 Madam President, on behalf of the Hawkeye State, I am  proud to congratulate the Iowa women's basketball team for a historic  run in the NCAA Division I basketball tournament. All season long, the  Hawkeyes played before sellout crowds at Carver-Hawkeye Arena in Iowa  City. Fans from across the State got swept up in the adrenaline rush of  remarkable athleticism and a fast-paced offense that delivered high- scoring games and thrilling victories throughout the regular season,  from the home court buzzer beater against second- ranked Indiana on  February 26, to bringing home the hardware on March 5 from the Big 10  Championship game at ``Carver North'' at the Target Center in  Minneapolis.   Leading the team to its fifth Big 10 Conference Tournament title,  Iowa's homegrown guard Caitlin Clark wowed the world all season long,  setting the bar higher and higher and delivering one of many historic  firsts yet to come in postseason play, namely the first 40-point  triple-double in NCAA tournament history. Only after, the West Des  Moines native and stellar student-athlete from Dowling Catholic High  School registered the third triple-double in Big 10 tournament history,  the first time ever in the championship game. Clark's phenomenal  ability to connect with teammates in transition, net 3 pointers from  half court, and score lay-ups and jumpers while being double-teamed  captured the attention of the entire country. From one game to the  next, Clark's trademark ability to swish a basket from the logo  mesmerizes spectators, bewilders the defense, and opens up  opportunities for her teammates to shine. A sensational athlete, Clark  earned player of the year from multiple outlets this season.   Throughout the thrilling contests during Iowa's deep run in the NCAA  tournament, Hawkeye fans from around the world and across the State of  Iowa were thrilled with pride to be along for the ride. The journey  began at home on St. Patrick's Day with a resounding win over  Southeastern Louisiana 95-48. In the second round, the Hawkeyes beat  Georgia 74-66 before a sellout crowd in Iowa City before advancing to  the Sweet 16 against Colorado and on to face Louisville in the Elite  Eight at Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle, WA. The spellbinding teamwork  the Iowa Hawkeyes brought to the court broke attendance records for  Women's NCAA tournament regional play as they locked in 87-77 and 97-83  victories, respectively, to punch their ticket to the Final Four at the  American Airlines Center in Dallas. Next up, a contest against the  defending champion South Carolina, who was on a 42-game winning streak.  In a spectacular upset on Friday, March 31, the Iowa Hawkeyes secured a  spot in the national championship game with a 77-73 victory over the  Gamecocks.   The electrifying victories and hard-fought contests during the 2022/ 23 season made household names of Hawkeye starters Caitlin Clark,  Monica Czinano, Gabbie Marshall, McKenna Warnock, and Kate Martin, led  by an outstanding coaching team captained by head coach Lisa Bluder and  associate head coach Jan Jensen, both homegrown products of Iowa  women's basketball. I am proud to share an alma mater with Coach  Bluder, where she earned her way into the Panther record books at the  University of Northern Iowa. Widely respected as workhorses through  their high school and collegiate careers, this dynamic coaching team  has built a program for the ages that will inspire and attract future  basketball players for years to come.   With nearly 10 million viewers for the championship game against the  LSU Tigers, this historic match-up offered both teams their first  opportunity in program history to bring home the national title. It was  the most-watched women's basketball game in history. If what is past is  prologue, the sellout crowds and record-breaking TV ratings will  continue.   This magical season started at home on November 7, continuing with an  exhilarating run through March Madness all the way to April 2, taking  the Iowa Hawkeyes to the second Final Four in program history and its  first appearance in the NCAA title game. The electrifying ride unified  our State, even coalescing fans with die-hard rivalries in their  bloodstreams. To be sure, I watched every minute and couldn't take my  eyes off the game when the Hawkeyes were playing. Iowans cloaked  themselves in Black and Gold to cheer for the Hawkeyes and women's  basketball on the national stage.   Although the final score in the championship game didn't deliver the  victory the coaches and players worked their tails off to bring home,  the State of Iowa, the University of Iowa, and future generations of  players received a priceless victory from this extraordinary season.  The Iowa Hawkeyes women's basketball team made Iowa proud. This team  has earned a place in our hearts, and we can't wait to watch and cheer  for you next season and for generations to come. On behalf of the  Hawkeye State, I congratulate you for an outstanding season that made  history, put all eyes on Iowa, and catapulted women's basketball to  soaring new heights on the horizon and beyond. Go Hawks.                            ____________________
