 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and  giving me an opportunity to say a few words about our extraordinary  colleague, the late John Lewis.   John Lewis is someone who had such an enormous impact on this  country, someone who risked his life and endured violence and  intimidation to help create a more beloved community and a better  country. John was a gentle man who continued his fight for equality and  justice and dignity for every single person in this country.   Many of us had the privilege of crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge  with John Lewis, but for me what was particularly helpful and memorable  was that John Lewis was a champion in the fight for LGBTQ and the  Equality Act. At a very critical moment, he became part of that effort,  and I thought to myself: Here is a man who has already done more than  anyone could imagine one person could do for human dignity, for  equality, and for justice, and he was still in the fight for the LGBTQ  community.   One of the most extraordinary honors of my life is having served in  Congress and, certainly, having the friendship of the extraordinary  John Lewis, someone who was beloved by everyone here.   I will end with this. When I first met Mr. Lewis, he called me  brother. That went on for about 6 months. I thought to myself, well, he  doesn't remember my name. You know, that is just the way it is. But I  soon learned that he called everyone brother and sister because, in  John's heart, we were all part of a common family.   So this post office--and I thank Congresswoman Nikema Williams for  her sponsorship--will be a permanent memorial to the extraordinary  contributions of the life of John Lewis to our country.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 566,  legislation to rename the United States Postal Service facility in  Slatersville, Rhode Island, the Specialist Matthew R. Turcotte Post  Office.   A fallen soldier from North Smithfield who gave his life in service  of his country, Specialist Matthew Turcotte was tragically killed  during a training accident in 2017 when he was only 20 years old. An  exceptional young man who exemplified the utmost commitment to serving  his community and his country, Matthew's service continues to make all  Rhode Island proud.   Matthew, a lifelong North Smithfield resident eager to serve his  country, enlisted in the U.S. Army while attending North Smithfield  High School, where he was cocaptain of the football team and a member  of the track and field team.   After his graduation in 2015, Matthew enlisted as a specialist and  began his military career at Fort Benning. During his 2 short, enlisted  years, he earned numerous awards for his service, including the Army  Achievement Medal, National Defense Service Medal, the Armed Forces  Expeditionary Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the  Army Service Ribbon, the Overseas Ribbon, and the NATO Medal.   Matthew's superiors in the military described him as a tremendous  soldier who exemplified selfless service to our military and our  Nation. He was deployed to Kosovo in 2016, and following his return,  married his high school sweetheart and beloved wife, Megan.   In August of 2017, Matthew was killed during a live-ammunition  training exercise at Fort Carson in Colorado while serving with the 2nd  Infantry Brigade Combat Team of the 4th Infantry Division.   As we prepare to dedicate this post office in Matthew's memory, I am  thinking about his father, Raymond; his mother, Liza; his wife, Megan;  his sisters, Kayla and Paige; and all his extended family and loved  ones.   Mr. Speaker, let us never forget the enormous debt of gratitude that  we owe to not just Matthew and his family, but to all military families  across the country who support the brave men and women who defend our  Nation and often shoulder the pain of unimaginable grief and loss.                                time  1445    The decision to live one's life in service of others is never an easy  one, and Matthew's commitment to a vocation of service represented the  very best of our Nation and Rhode Island. For his patriotism, for his  love of family and community, and for his dedication to the principles  we as Americans hold dear, we salute Matthew and dedicate this post  office in his honor.   I know that Matthew's legacy will continue to inspire our community  in North Smithfield and all Rhode Islanders.   The dedication of this post office is an enduring expression of our  gratitude for his service and a permanent reminder of his sacrifice. We  know that Matthew's legacy and the impact he had on those who knew and  loved him will far outlast anything we do or say, Mr. Speaker, but it  is the least we can do for one of the great heroes of our Nation,  Matthew R. Turcotte.
