 Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Committee  on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, it is my privilege to recognize  a small business that has benefited from hard work, ingenuity, and  international trade. As we celebrate World Trade Month, it is important  to recognize the limitless potential that exporting offers small  businesses across the country. It is my distinct honor to name GT  AirInject Inc., located in Jacksonville, FL, as the Senate Small  Business of the Week.   Founded by Glen Black, GT AirInject is a family-owned manufacturer of  air injection machines, which provide an efficient way to improve soil  and lawn maintenance for golf courses and athletic fields. GT  AirInject's flagship product, the AIR2G2, solves the issues of soil  compaction by injecting pressurized air into the soil, up to 12 inches  deep, which fractures the natural forming compact layers. Unlike  traditional aeration methods that simply perforate the soil, the AIR2G2  injects air without damaging the turf surface. This revolutionary  feature allows the course or field to be used immediately, making the  AIR2G2 an ideal product for sport facilities and golf courses. In fact,  GT AirInject's products are utilized internationally, at world-renowned  facilities such as St. Andrews Links in Scotland, the Boston Red Sox's  Fenway Park, the Green Bay Packer's Lambeau Field, and Real Madrid's  Santiago Bernabeu Stadium.   In addition to the AIR2G2, GT AirInject has developed the AIR2HP.  Perfect for both commercial and household use, the AIR2HP offers  customers a more portable and dynamic product, while still providing  the soil benefits of increased porosity, better water drainage, and  improved root growth. The benefits of the AIR2G2 and the AIR2HP,  however, are not limited to improved soil quality. The efficient and  effective designs of GT AirInject products allow recreational  facilities to remain open after turf maintenance, simultaneously  decreasing the facilities maintenance budget while increasing revenue.   GT AirInject's commitment to manufacturing superior products, while  maintaining an affordable price, has allowed them to become a world  leader in air injection machines. Exporting across the globe, GT  AirInject products can be found throughout Europe, Asia, and Africa.  Despite increased international demand, GT AirInject continues to  manufacture its machines in Jacksonville.   GT AirInject's commitment to quality and innovation has not gone  unnoticed. The AIR2G2 won the prestigious 2016 HSBC Golf Business Forum  Innovation Award and the 2015 Sports Turf Managers Association's  Innovation Award. Additionally, the AIR2HP was named as one of Lawn and  Landscape magazine's Twenty for 2017 New Product Award Program winners.   American made products are essential to the United States' continued  competitiveness in the global marketplace. GT AirInject is a tremendous  example of a small business creating an innovative product that has  generated global demand. They have grown internationally while  continuing to create American jobs. It is with great pleasure that I  name GT AirInject as the Senate Small Business of the Week. I wish Glen  and the entire team nothing but success in their future  endeavors.                            ____________________
