 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 1:30 p.m. on Monday next, and  further, when the House adjourns on that day, it adjourn to meet at  noon on Tuesday, February 4, 2020 for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m.  for legislative business.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Keith Lamont  Stith for becoming the first African American Chief of Detectives of  the Criminal Investigation Division of the Hudson County Prosecutor's  Office.   Mr. Stith brings more than 2 decades of accomplishments and  experience in  [[Page H740]]  law enforcement to the position. For the last 3 years, he was the  deputy chief for the prosecutor's office; and in that role, he managed  the daily investigation operations of the Criminal Investigation  Division.   In the past, he has worked as a narcotics detective and for the U.S.  Customs Service in their Financial Crimes Task Force.   He has done groundbreaking work to reduce gang and gun violence, as  well as rehabilitate convicted criminals in Hudson County.   Also, he is a graduate of the prestigious FBI National Academy.   With these extraordinary credentials, I think Mr. Stith will be an  exceptional chief of detectives in Hudson County.                            ____________________
