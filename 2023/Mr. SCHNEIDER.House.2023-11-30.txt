 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Debbie Wasserman  Schultz, for organizing this hour. I thank the Speaker for his  indulgence and attention as we have gone through a long list typical of  conversations talking about the hostages. I thank my friend from  Michigan, General Bergman, for the time.   We should not have to be here tonight. We should not be forced to  talk  [[Page H6043]]  about some of the 250 people brutally kidnapped and taken hostage on  October 7.   It should not be necessary to call for the immediate, unconditional  release of these hostages. We should not be here because Hamas should  not be holding hostages.   I am grateful that more than 100 hostages have been released and  returned to Israel, but 143 hostages remain in captivity, held by  Hamas, by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and by others in Gaza.   The families don't know the status of their loved ones. They don't  know where their loved ones are. They don't know when they will be  coming home.   I will talk tonight about one hostage, Hersh Goldberg-Polin. Hersh's  parents, Rachel and Jon, are from Chicago. I have been friends with his  aunt, Abby, for more than 30 years. I know his grandmother Leah.  Hersh's family is now my family.   Hersh was born in northern California. His family moved to Virginia  when Hersh was 4 and to Israel when he was 7. That was in 2008. Hersh  grew up in Jerusalem, reached adulthood, and was known widely as a  kind, gentle mensch.   On Friday, October 6, of this year, Hersh was with his family in  Jerusalem. It was the evening of the Sabbath, Shabbat, and the holiday  of Simchat Torah.   The family went to synagogue and then went to dinner at a friend's  house with two other families. After dinner, Hersh grabbed his backpack  and left to meet his friend Aner. They later learned that Hersh and his  friend were going to a concert in the south, a music festival.   That was on Saturday, October 7. I will read at length some of the  words of Hersh's father, Jonathan Polin, published in Time magazine.   He says, describing his circumstance on Sunday, having learned that  Hersh was taken hostage on Saturday, at some time--I think it was  Sunday morning--a picture started to circulate online that was from an  outdoor bomb shelter. They are not uncommon in the south of Israel.   Our son was in the picture, as was Aner. Through social media, we  started to search for other families of people who were in the shelter  and to try to piece together a story.   What we have subsequently pieced together, based on conversations  with the three witnesses who were in the shelter with him, is the  following: Sometime around 7:30 Saturday morning, those in the bomb  shelter came under heavy gunfire. Grenades were being tossed into the  shelter.   Hersh's friend Aner, who was by the entrance of the bomb shelter, is  responsible for the lives of anybody who is still alive--he was picking  up grenades and tossing them back out and taking control of the  situation. But it was total chaos. At least 11 grenades were thrown  into the shelter. Aner picked up eight and threw them back out. Three  exploded inside.                                time  1930    People were critically wounded. What we next know from witnesses is  that at roughly 9 a.m., gunmen came into the shelter calmly, not  shooting, and they said anybody who can get on their feet and walk out,  walk out of here. And our son was one of the small number to walk out.   That was 55 days ago: Seven Shabbat dinners with an empty seat in the  Hersh Goldberg family; seven weeks of uncertainty not knowing where  Hersh is; seven weeks of not knowing how Hersh is doing; seven weeks of  not knowing when Hersh is coming home.   Tonight, we have heard about so many of these hostages, 143 of the  250-plus hostages taken still are in captivity. The IRC must be able to  see Hersh in every one of the other hostages.   Hersh and all the other hostages must come home. Not someday, not  soon, but now. We owe it to these hostages to bring them home. We owe  it to our families, and we must make sure that Hamas can never take  hostages, can never attack Israel ever again.
