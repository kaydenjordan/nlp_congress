 Mr. President, as we observe National Women's  History Month throughout March, it gives me great pleasure to recognize  one of North Dakota's own history makers. Margaret Huettl from Minot  has become my State's first female Eagle Scout and is a member of the  inaugural class of young women to receive this high honor across the  United States.   Margaret is a member of Scout Troop 5401 of the Northern Lights  Council. A recent graduate of Minot High School, Margaret is currently  studying biology education at Minot State University. Despite the  coronavirus pandemic, which limited many Scouting group activities over  the past year, she continued pressing on toward her goal of completing  the merit badges necessary to earn the award. For her Eagle Scout  project, she spent 238 hours building a pit for gaga ball, which is a  variation of dodgeball, for outdoor activities at her home church, Zion  Lutheran.   She said earning the 21 merit badges, along with completing her  project and the other requirements for the Eagle Scout Award, helped  her further develop leadership, time management, and communication  skills. She intends to continue her involvement with Troop 5401,  transitioning to an adult leader this year.   I congratulate Margaret on achieving this award through hard work and  persistence and a being a trailblazer for other young women who have an  interest in the Scouting program. With only 6 percent of all scouts  attaining the rank of Eagle Scout, she now will be recognized alongside  the 2.5 million  [[Page S1612]]  others who have earned this prestigious award since it was created in  1911. She will learn, as have other Eagle Scouts, that throughout her  life, this accomplishment will bring her recognition as being a person  of the highest caliber and character. I fully expect to hear much more  from Margaret in the future as she excels in academic, professional,  and personal endeavors.                            ____________________
