 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on the topic of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, it is my privilege to lead this Special  Order tonight as we consider the national debt as a security threat to  the United States of America.   I thank Senator David Perdue for his leadership. He introduced a  concomitant resolution in the Senate. I also thank the more than 50  Members of this body who are original cosponsors to this resolution.   I also thank the more than one dozen conservative groups that  endorsed this resolution and have come to understand that a structural  deficit that nears a trillion dollars every year, a national debt that  exceeds $22 trillion, is indeed a threat to our national security.   Madam Speaker, I yield to my friend, the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Roy).    Madam Speaker, when the gentleman from Texas talks about  the crowd-out effect, that is what we see as one of the threats to our  national security.   When you look at the spending that is being bloated and plussed-up  and increased, the ramifications of borrowing more and more money for  an insatiable appetite to spend the Federal revenues and beyond to the  tune of almost a trillion dollars a year--and it will continue to rise,  make no mistake about that, unless we do something--it will ultimately  crowd out spending for things like the military, spending for things  like transportation and infrastructure, spending for any discretionary  item.   We are on that fast track today, so I appreciate my friend from Texas  talking and discussing the crowd-out and the impacts on our future and  our future generations.   Madam Speaker, it is my privilege to yield to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Williams).    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend, Congressman Williams  from Texas, for his willingness to take a strong stand on this. I am  particularly impressed by his reference to President Trump's National  Security Strategy, which specifically mentions a portion of it is to  bring down our national debt, to try to become a better fiscally  situated nation.   That will help our national security, now and in the future. This is  exactly what President Trump is talking about. That is what we are  talking about. That is one of the issues that we have before us today.   I am grateful to my friend, the gentleman from Texas, who brought  that forward and is supporting this important resolution.   Madam Speaker, it is my privilege to yield to my friend from Maryland  (Mr. Harris), the great congressman.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland, and I  appreciate his focusing on the interest, because he is right. In just a  few short years, we will be spending more of our budget on interest  than we do on defense; and then a couple of years after that, more on  our interest than we spend on Medicare.   Think about that. Think about where we are headed because of our  profligate ways.   In the first chart he showed, I was struck, as I remembered growing  up in the Cold War era.   Madam Speaker, I think those of us who grew up in the Cold War era  remember that contest between us and the former Soviet Union and the  amount of money spent by both sides. It is dwarfed by the spending that  we are embarking on today as a percent of our GDP. That is where we  are. That is where we have come. So it continues to be a problem in so  many ways and on so many levels.   Madam Speaker, it is my privilege now to yield to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Buck).    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Colorado, Mr. Buck,  and I appreciate him raising that important issue, that it is an  oddity, isn't it, in Congress, that somehow we segregate money. We  segregate money and say, oh, well, this money doesn't matter so much.  But it becomes fungible when you are looking at the accumulation of  debt that we are heaping upon our future generations.   I appreciate the gentleman bringing that to our attention and  reminding us, and I would just say, I appreciate his voting record,  because I have watched it closely, and he is a man of his word when he  says he has been fighting to balance the budget and reduce our deficit  since he got here, because his voting record is actually true to that,  and I appreciate that very much.   Madam Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Cline).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Cline), for his comments and his efforts and his willingness to stand  on this important issue and recognizing--and promising to people and  responding to that promise; because I can tell you, when I first  considered even running for Congress, one of the things that motivated  me was this horrific debt, which I have watched explode even more since  I got here; not because I am here, but in spite of my efforts.   So, today, we are preparing to introduce our resolution, which will  be later this week, Senator Perdue, his cosponsors, my 50 original  cosponsors--more than 50 original cosponsors. And we recognize that, as  of today, the national debt is more than $22 trillion. You have heard  that. Can you hear it enough without taking action?   The resulting total interest expense for the fiscal year 2019 is $192  billion. $192 billion. Interest does not sleep. It doesn't take a  holiday; it doesn't take a vacation. Interest accumulates without  ceasing until you pay your debt.   Our national debt as a percentage of GDP is 104 percent. The last  time a Federal budget was balanced and was signed was 1997.   Our total Federal tax receipts for fiscal year 2018 were $3.329  trillion. But somehow--and we all know how--our Federal outlays totaled  $4.1 trillion, with a deficit of $780 billion. And we know how. We know  how that happened. We look to each other in this body.   Since the last time Congress balanced the Federal budget in 1997,  Congress has failed to maintain a fiscally-responsible budget and has  relied on raising the debt ceiling. How many times have we raised the  debt ceiling? It is almost more than you can count.   Congress failed to pass a balanced budget for fiscal year 2019 and  failed to restore regular order to the legislative process by not  allowing Representatives to offer and debate amendments. When we have  regular order, it permits the House to separately debate and adopt all  appropriation bills in a timely fashion and facilitates congressional  oversight on Federal spending.   Estimates are Medicare will run out of money in 2026, Social Security  in 2034.   As my friend from Virginia, Mr. Cline, said: Congress'  ineffectiveness has caused the U.S. credit rating from Standard &  Poor's to drop from AAA to AA+. Without a targeted effort to balance  the Federal budget, our credit will surely continue to fall.   President Trump's National Security Strategy highlights the need to  reduce the national debt through fiscal responsibility.   Former Secretary of Defense James Mattis warned that: ``Any nation  that can't keep its fiscal house in order eventually cannot maintain  its military power.''   Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats warned that: ``Our  continued plunge into debt is unsustainable and represents a dire  future threat to our economy and to our national security.''   Former Secretaries of Defense Leon Panetta, Ash Carter, and Chuck  Hagel warned: ``Increase in the debt will, in the absence of a  comprehensive budget that addresses both entitlements and revenues,  force even deeper reductions in our national security capabilities.''   And former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Michael Mullen  warned: ``I believe the single biggest threat to our national security  is debt.''   And so what must the House do?   First, we have to recognize that the national debt is, indeed, a  threat to our national security. We must realize that deficits are  unsustainable, irresponsible, and dangerous.                                time  1930    We must restore regular order in the appropriations process, and we  must commit to addressing the fiscal crisis faced by the United States.   I mentioned it before, but when you are spending a pot of money and  you have limited resources, regardless of how great those resources  are--I mean, we have had record tax revenue for the last 14 months,  record revenue, more than any time in the history of the United States  of America, and we still outspend that revenue.  [[Page H2225]]    As we do so, we have to borrow money, because we have created a  structural deficit. So, foundationally, we put ourselves in a position  where we have to borrow money; and when you have to borrow money, you  have to pay interest. As you have to borrow more money, which we do,  you are going to start crowding out what you can spend those limited  resources on.   Who holds our debt? One of the biggest holders of our debt is also  one of our greatest potential adversaries, and that is China. China has  been, for the last 25 years, expanding their military, building a blue- water navy, expanding their capacity for rockets and missiles, and also  taking in our debt.   This places us at risk if we are ever in a conflict, which I pray we  never are. I hope we never are. But if we are in a conflict with an  adversary who holds significant amounts of our national debt, we are at  risk. And you have to acknowledge that.   What has helped us out so far is the fact that the U.S. dollar is the  international medium of exchange in international transactions,  economic transactions. If we were to lose that, the ability to borrow  funds to sustain our unsustainable spending would go away. And I bring  that back to China.   China has ambitions to make its own currency a regional currency of  exchange. They would like to replace the United States dollar as the  international medium of exchange as well.   What else is an actual physical problem when you have the kind of  debt and deficit spending that we have is that you cannot pay to  replace and maintain your internal infrastructure, and we see that  today. Bridges, roads, airports, all of these need maintenance. They  need upkeep. They need expansion. We need new roads. We need new  highways, but we can't pay for it, because we are going to be in a  position of being overextended. That places us at risk, because you do  need internal infrastructure.   Madam Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield to my good friend, the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho).    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Florida for taking  time to come down and give us his insight on this monumental problem.   One of the things that he talked about, Madam Speaker, is that we  have got to take care of our processes, our procedures. He is right. It  doesn't matter whether it is Republican or Democrat; our processes have  been broken.   I can't even begin to tell you. I have been here a little over 2  years. I bet you we have done a dozen and a half short-term spending  bills, continuing resolutions. I bet it is that many. It seems to me  like that many. I think we did three government shutdowns last year. I  don't know when the next one is going to be. It wouldn't surprise me if  it was 2 weeks from now, whenever it is. But the reason we do those  things is because our budget process fails.   I remember sitting in a meeting and I heard someone say: We have got  a 10-year budget plan to balance our budget. And I heard somebody else  stand up and say: Well, I have been here 10 years. Ten years ago, I was  told we had a 10-year budget plan, so we ought to be up to snuff. We  ought to be balanced by now, because it is 10 years since that 10-year  budget plan.   I think it was Mr. Yoho who said that.   Madam Speaker, I yield back to Mr. Yoho.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.   Madam Speaker, reclaiming my time from the gentleman from Florida,  when we look at that and the promises constantly, this is getting to my  point: The process needs to get back to regular order. It needs to get  back to 12 individual bills--this is what we talked about--12  individual bills that go through a process where there is debate; there  are amendments; there is discussion; and there is accountability.   Nothing provides more accountability than bills that have single  subjects; nothing provides more transparency than bills that have  single subjects; and nothing allows the American people to see what we  are doing in Congress like single subjects.   So when you take 12 subjects, which are your budget bills, and you  combine 3 or 4 of them into a minibus and 6 or 7 into an omnibus, and  you say vote on these things--usually we are given just a short period  of time to read those things and analyze them anyway; usually they come  in under some closed rule or some highly structured rule--well, you are  preventing a couple of things:   Number one, we are not going to get to a balanced budget because,  ultimately, what you are also preventing is accountability, because  when the American people can see how you voted in a single area on a  single issue, they know whether they agree with you or not. They know  whether you should be doing that, and they will let you know. They give  you the feedback. That is the accountability that we need if we are  going to balance this budget over time and correct our course.   Now, there is an economic theory called path dependence. Sometimes it  is called increasing returns. Kenneth Arrow wrote a lot about this, and  what it boils down to is this: It is an analysis, really, of why  decisionmakers make suboptimum decisions and then persist on the course  even after they know it is a suboptimum decision.   Well, what typically happens is regimes and institutions are built  up. There is feedback, and people will persist on that because they are  building up regimes and institutions; and, ultimately, they have  propelled themselves so far down, they are what we call locked in. To  exit that path, the cost is so high that they don't want to exit that  suboptimal path and move to a more optimal path.   But I am here to tell you tonight that as long as we stay on this  suboptimal path where we don't have these 12 budget bills, we don't get  back to regular order in budgeting, as long as we do CRs and then claim  that we have done a normal budgeting path when we have created  cromnibus bills or omnibus bills or minibus bills, we are not going to  be able to exit the path that we are on.   If we are going to sustain this Nation, we are going to need to exit  the path that we are on and move to a more optimal path.                                time  1945    That is really what this resolution is about. It is encouraging  people from both sides of the aisle. I am not blaming one side or the  other. I am just saying that if we are going to get this done,  everybody in this House has to look internally. Everybody in this House  needs to say: What are we doing with our process? Everybody needs to  recognize that if we continue on this path, at some point there is no  more path to run down.   We just heard from a series of speakers that the numbers go up and,  at some point, you reach a tipping point, and that tipping point says  you cannot go forward. I would rather we move over to a suboptimal path  now and pay that price, which is typically a short-term, corrective  price. In the scheme of things, it may take longer than just a short- term, but we have to move over because, if we don't, our choices are  taken away from us.   I will tell you that if we would have gotten on the path 2 years ago,  we would have had more choices and more options. Every day we go  further down this path, the fewer options we have until the end. Mr.  Yoho is correct, and all of my friends who have spoken tonight were  correct, and the more than 50 cosponsors here, they are all correct: If  we don't do something, it will be imposed upon us.   If it is imposed upon us, we won't have control. We will not be able  to handle this in a way where we hurt the fewest people, where we can  feather the landing as much as possible, where we can maintain our  economic status, where people can still find jobs, and where people can  achieve the American Dream that they perceive that they want to  achieve. Those things get taken away from us because, ultimately, this  country is built on individual freedom and individual accountability.   If we have to take that horrible measure of receiving something like  our debts being called in, or we can't find lenders, or the cost of our  loans--imagine if the cost of our debt today would just move up a  couple of points--imagine what that would look like. If we can't do  this of our own volition, we will be subject to someone else's will and  the very essence of the American Dream--individual freedom and  individual accountability--will go away. And why? Because that  accountability will be foisted upon us by coercive forces.   Madam Speaker, I conclude tonight with gratitude to the 50-some-odd  men and women who have signed on to this resolution. I implore all in  this body to join myself, to join me, to join Senator Perdue and those  who have signed on and sponsored a companion resolution in the Senate,  and let's make the hard choices today so that we might preserve the  freedoms for our children and grandchildren.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for leading this  Special Order.   Madam Speaker, I want to speak to two specific aspects of this.   First of all, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1, the sweeping  unconstitutional attack on the electoral system that it represents. It  would federalize our electoral system and usurp the authority of States  and their citizens to manage their own elections by imposing  unnecessary and unconstitutional restrictions that interfere with their  fundamental democratic rights.   H.R. 1 would restrict freedom of speech and undermine Americans'  constitutional rights under the First Amendment by increasing the power  of the Federal Government to regulate and control political speech.   It would criminalize a vast range of legal activities, increase  government censorship, and impose an enormous administrative compliance  burden on candidates that would make it harder for everyday Americans  to participate in our political system and even run for office.   It would also weaken important safeguards to ensure the integrity of  our electoral system and guarantee that every American vote is counted  and protected. This could expose future elections to greater risk of  cyber manipulation and mass voter fraud.   It could limit the ability of election officials to ensure that only  eligible voter votes are counted and cripple the effectiveness of State  voter ID laws.   Now, I have to speak to an issue that particularly impacts those of  us who live in States that have independent redistricting commissions.  I live in Arizona. Many years ago, our voters said: We don't want the  legislature designing the congressional districts and the State  legislative districts anymore; we want an independent redistricting  commission, so they voted for it. So we have a five-member commission:  two Republicans, two Democrats, and an Independent. They design the  congressional districts.   This bill would take that away from them. It would bring it back to  Washington, D.C., after creating an unelected board that would then  design these districts for States. Now, I ask you, why would that be  better than the independent redistricting commission in Arizona that  was approved by the Arizona voters? It doesn't make sense to me, and it  doesn't make sense to my constituents, I can tell you that.   We struggle enough. We struggle enough with the independent  redistricting commission with Arizona appointees. Imagine if we have no  connection to the appointees.   I am also always amazed at people who don't get to Arizona and don't  realize the vastness of that State. It is a unique State: 7 million  people--5 million of them in one county, one metropolitan area; 1  million in another county; and then another 1 million sprinkled  throughout this vast State. That takes local knowledge and it takes  local experience to create those districts, there is no doubt about it.  The Arizona Constitution is filled with the criterion on how to  redistrict in Arizona. This would usurp the Arizona Constitution.   H.R. 1 is fraught with many, many problems. I have just gone through  a couple of them for you tonight.   Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Florida for his leadership on  this, his fight, and I appreciate him sharing time with me tonight.
