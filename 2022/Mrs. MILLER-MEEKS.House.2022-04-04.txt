 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the memory  and legacy of a glass-shattering athlete from Iowa's Second  Congressional District.   Frederick ``Duke'' Slater's passion for football began when his  family moved to Clinton, Iowa, where Duke started playing football at  Clinton High.   Duke went on to receive his education at the University of Iowa,  where he won a national championship in 1921 and was named an All- American. An incredible athlete, Duke also competed for the Hawkeyes'  track and field team, placing third in the hammer throw and fourth in  the discus while helping Iowa win the 1921 national title.   When Duke joined the NFL's Rock Island Independents, he became the  first Black lineman in NFL history. He went on to become a five-time  first-team All-Pro selection, retiring after 10 great years.   Following his retirement, Duke was inducted into the College Football  Hall of Fame in 1951 and was posthumously selected to the Pro Football  Hall of Fame in 2020. Last year, the University of Iowa announced that  the field at Kinnick Stadium would now be known as Slater Field in  honor of Duke.   I am pleased to hear that the local community is planning to erect a  statue of Duke at Clinton High School. Duke is the embodiment of hard  work and overcoming obstacles, and I cannot wait to see that statue in  person.                            ____________________
