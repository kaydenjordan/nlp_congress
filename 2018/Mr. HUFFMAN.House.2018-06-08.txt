 Mr. Speaker, on the day of June 8th, 2018, I was  unavoidably detained and as a result, I was absent for rollcall votes  254-257.   Had I been present for the rollcall vote 254, on Agreeing to the  Amendment, I would have voted ``no.''   Had I been present for the rollcall vote 255, on Agreeing to the  Amendment, I would have voted ``aye.''   Had I been present for the rollcall vote 256, on motion to recommit  with Instructions, I would have voted ``aye.''   Had I been present for the rollcall vote 257, on passage of H.R.  5895, I would have voted ``no.''                            ____________________
