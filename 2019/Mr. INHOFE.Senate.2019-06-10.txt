 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and congratulate  RADM James T. Loeblein of the U.S. Navy on his outstanding service to  our Nation as the Navy's Chief of Legislative Affairs from January 2017  to July 2019. During these 2 years, a period best described as one of  constant change, he deftly led his team to execute with a lasting  legacy of ``precision and style.''   Jim Loeblein was the Navy's lead advocate on Capitol Hill and had the  challenging job of communicating with all 535 Members of Congress. He  expertly handled our constituent inquiries and represented the Navy  while balancing military, political, and budgetary priorities. His  naval service is a lasting reminder that the United States remains the  strongest maritime nation.   Rear Admiral Loeblein selflessly devoted the last 2 and a half years  of his naval service ensuring our Nation's sailors were taken care of  and represented faithfully in Congress. Specifically, Jim brilliantly  led the response to the salient issues of this period: aircraft carrier  purchases and overhauls, submarine procurement timelines, the rise of  cyber warfare, the quality of on-base military housing--and the list  goes on. Jim excelled in this role with his hallmark ``precision and  style.''   Because of Jim's professionalism and friendly personality, he  established warm and lasting relationships with our colleagues,  garnering respect and admiration in both Chambers of Congress and on  both sides of the aisle. He worked with us to broaden the Navy's  outreach beyond those members of defense committees. Jim's efforts,  along with those of the Chief of Naval Operations, introduced the Navy  to Senators who would not otherwise have had exposure to the great work  our sailors are doing around the globe.   On behalf of my colleagues and the entire U.S. Senate, I want to  personally thank RADM Jim Loeblein for his more than three decades of  dedicated service to the Navy and our nation. He will be certainly  missed. I also want to thank his wife Carol for her sacrifice during  her own time in the Navy and for her continued, tremendous support to  her husband. I wish them fair winds and following seas in his post- naval career, and I sincerely look forward to seeing him again in the  future.                            ____________________
