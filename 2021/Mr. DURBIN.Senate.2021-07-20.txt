 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I heard the Republican leader on the floor  just moments ago talking about the dismissal of some individuals by the  Biden administration and their replacement, and his complaint that this  violated the norms and the precedents of the U.S. Senate.   There are certainly two words I would offer in response to that  assertion: Merrick Garland.   I would offer those words to the Republican leader as a reminder of  what he did when there was a vacancy on the highest Court in the land,  the U.S. Supreme Court. Antonin Scalia passed away, and a vacancy  occurred. It was the last year of the Obama administration.   Tradition suggested that that President of the United States, duly  elected and in office, had the responsibility and the opportunity to  fill the vacancy, and so he offered as his nominee Merrick Garland from  the DC Circuit court.   What happened to Merrick Garland's nomination? What was the norm and  precedent? Well, there would be a hearing and a consideration of that  nomination and a vote in the U.S. Senate.   That process was stopped in its tracks by one leader, the Republican  leader of the U.S. Senate from Kentucky.   So when he talks about norms and precedents and creating and filling  vacancies, he has forgotten that he made history in a very unusual way:  by violating the most basic norm and precedent that the U.S. Senate had  the responsibility to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. And the  President of the United States, duly elected, was not a lameduck in the  last year of his administration.   The second issue which was raised by the Republican leader this  morning dealt with the phrase ``defunding the police.'' I have rejected  that phrase from the first time I heard it. I couldn't imagine anyone  thinking that this was a sensible policy to follow when it came to the  security of our homes and our communities.   I can't speak for anybody else in the Senate, but in the awful  circumstance when one is called on to dial 911, you certainly hope that  the police will answer and that they will be there if they are needed.  Defunding them lessens that possibility, and I am not a person who  supports that.   I want the very best police and law enforcement. I want them well  trained, and I want them to follow norms and conduct that are  respectful of American values. But defunding the police is not  something I have ever embraced or ever will.   But it is interesting to hear that argument from the Senator from  Kentucky. He said that, in a way, you would be insulting and attacking  the police by taking that position. One could argue that, but I would  suggest to him that, in his position, stopping the creation of a  commission to investigate what happened in this Chamber on January 6  and what happened to 140 members of law enforcement in the Halls of the  U.S. Capitol on the same day is not respectful of the police itself.   We have had a plea--a direct plea from the men and women in uniform  who guard us in this building to have an investigative commission  determine what was behind that insurrectionist mob of January 6 and  what we need to do to avoid it in the future. That commission and its  prospects were stopped cold by the Republican leader from Kentucky.  That is a fact.   In terms of being respectful of law enforcement, allowing that  commission to be created--a bipartisan commission--to get to the bottom  of that horrible incident, that embarrassing incident in the history of  the United States, is the least we can do to respond to what the police  who guard us have asked for.   I might add one other element while we are on the discussion of law  enforcement and protecting America. We have a special security  supplemental appropriation that was created by Senator Patrick Leahy of  Vermont, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, which  appropriates the funds to pay the National Guard units who left their  families and came here to protect us, and to pay the Capitol Police for  the expenses they incurred on January 6 to fortify this Capitol against  any future insurrectionist mob. That supplemental appropriations bill,  which should have been passed routinely weeks ago, is still languishing  for lack of agreement on the Republican side.   If you want to be respectful of law enforcement, whether they are men  and women in uniform, in police units, or the National Guard, wouldn't  you pay them for the services they have rendered to protect this  Capitol and to protect the United States of America?   I call on the Republican leader: Instead of making a speech on the  floor, call the Republican ranking member on the Senate Committee on  Appropriations and ask him to waste no time in showing respect for law  enforcement and to pass that security supplemental.                   Nomination of Kenneth Allen Polite, Jr.    Mr. President, on another topic, this week, the Senate will vote on  the nomination of Kenneth Polite. President Biden has nominated him to  serve as Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department's  Criminal Division.   As an experienced prosecutor who has served his community throughout  his career, Mr. Polite is certainly qualified for this important  position. From 2013 to 2017, Mr. Polite served as the U.S. attorney for  the Eastern District of Louisiana. While in this role, Mr. Polite's  office prosecuted several large, violent, criminal organizations. He  held local corrupt politicians accountable and stopped more human  traffickers than during any prior U.S. attorney's term in office.   Prior to serving the people of Louisiana, Mr. Polite served as an  assistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York, which is  a very busy and important office. There, he took on organized crime,  fought corruption, healthcare fraud, and identity theft.   In addition to his extensive experience as a public servant, Mr.  Polite also has a remarkable personal story. Born to teenage parents,  he spent his youth in public housing projects in New Orleans before  moving to the Lower Ninth Ward as a child. He graduated high school as  the valedictorian of his class, and he went on to earn his  undergraduate degree from Harvard and his law degree from the well- respected Georgetown University. After law school, Mr. Polite initially  went into private practice, but he was inspired to become a prosecutor  after his half brother was tragically killed by gun violence.   Throughout his career, Mr. Polite has always given back to the  community that raised him. He has served on the boards of numerous  community organizations and schools in New Orleans, and Mr. Polite's  track record as an even-handed public servant has earned him support  from across the aisle.   In 2011, he was appointed by a Republican Governor of Louisiana,  Bobby Jindal, to serve on the Louisiana Civil Service Commission.   Then, last month, the Republican Attorney General of Louisiana, Jeff  Landry, publicly voiced his support for Mr. Polite's nomination to this  position in the Department of Justice. In a letter to the Senate  Judiciary Committee, Mr. Landry wrote that, while serving as U.S.  attorney, ``Mr. Polite was not only an effective crime fighter, but he  was also an invaluable member of the community.''   Mr. Polite is an outstanding nominee for this critical role at the  Justice Department. You should have been in the Judiciary Committee,  which the Presiding Officer serves on, when his nomination came up. The  praise that he won from the two Republican Senators of Louisiana is an  indication of this man's popularity and of his value to Louisiana and  to our country. I hope that he will receive the same broad bipartisan  support in the full Senate, and I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting Mr. Polite's nomination    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume legislative session and the Senate begin consideration of H.R.  1652, under the previous order.    I ask unanimous consent that the Toomey amendment be  called up, as modified with the changes at the desk, and that it be  reported by number.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5:15 today  the Senate vote on the Toomey amendment and on the passage of the bill,  as amended, if amended, as provided for under the previous order.    Mr. President, when the pandemic began last year,  Americans across the country were faced with more than one public  health crisis. While we all feared contracting COVID-19 outside of our  homes, the most vulnerable members of our community feared a danger  lurking within the home or, certainly, in the neighborhood--violent  crime.   During the first several weeks of the pandemic, police departments  across America reported a significant increase in arrests or calls  related to domestic violence. And reports of hate incidents and crimes  increased, as well, particularly those targeting Asian American and  Pacific Islander, or what is known as the AAPI community.   Nearly 4,000 of these hate incidents were reported during the first  year of the COVID-19 pandemic. AAPI women comprised the majority of the  victims.   In my home State of Illinois, some of these victims of violent crimes  have an indispensable resource they can turn to. It is known as KAN- WIN, a nonprofit that supports survivors of violence, particularly  women and members of the immigrant community. KAN-WIN offers a 24-hour  hotline, legal advocacy, transitional housing, sexual assault services,  and many more resources to survivors of violent crimes. They also offer  programming to support children who have grown up in a traumatic  environment.   During the pandemic, organizations like KAN-WIN have been a beacon of  hope for some of the most vulnerable members of our community. But  these beacons of hope are at the risk of growing dark, unless we in  this Senate today take immediate action by passing the VOCA Fix to  Sustain the Crime Victims Fund Act. This legislation, which I am proud  to have introduced with Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, will  replenish the Crime Victims Fund, which Congress established in 1984  with the passage of the Victims of Crime Act, known as VOCA.   The Crime Victims Fund helps abused children, survivors of domestic  violence, and other victims of violent crime access the professional  services they desperately need. It also assists victims with expenses  like medical bills, counseling, funeral costs, loss of wages. And,  importantly, the Crime Victims Fund supplies grants to thousands,  literally thousands of victim service providers across the Nation, like  KAN-WIN.   In KAN-WIN's case, the Crime Victims Fund pays for the salary of  their Children's Advocate. That advocate reached out to my office and  wrote the following: ``The entire Children's Program at KAN-WIN will  have to be eliminated'' if the VOCA Fix to sustain the Crime Victims  Fund does not pass the Senate. Without this legislation,  ``linguistically and culturally sensitive services and counseling,  education assistance, economic assistance, medical assistance, art  activities that help regulate children's emotions, parent-child  relationship assistance, and other case management services'' will be  cut.   The kids who receive help from KAN-WIN are far from the only people  who would be hurt if the Crime Victims Fund runs dry. Children's  Advocacy Centers in Illinois report that a significant cut in VOCA  funding would result in more than 1,500 children being deprived of  services they need to overcome trauma.  [[Page S4964]]    The Chicago Children's Advocacy Center writes: ``One of the most  important uses of VOCA funds is for mental health therapy for sexually  abused children.'' Without that funding, they will have to ``cut the  number of children we provide therapy to and more children would go  without life-changing treatment to heal from their abuse. Even a small  cut in VOCA would mean up to 100 children would go without healing  services.''   We have a serious problem across America--and I have seen in  Illinois, particularly in the city of Chicago--of gun violence. There  are so many guns. The city is awash in guns. Too many young people get  their hands on them every day.   The Fourth of July weekend, 104 people were shot in the city of  Chicago. 104; 19 died. Last weekend, 50. The numbers are staggering. We  have a mass shooting in the city of Chicago every weekend. It has  become, sadly, expected. It breaks your heart.   I went to the juvenile facility of Cook County several years ago and  talked to the counselors who are meeting with the adolescents who have  been charged in these gun crimes. Some of these adolescents spend a  year or two in that facility waiting for trial. I asked these  counselors: Who are these kids? What has happened to them to the point  where they can take a gun and just shoot wantonly into a crowd, killing  infants and children and grandmothers and innocent people?   The counselor said to me: There are many things. There are hardly any  serious mental illnesses that you can think of that we don't find in  these kids. But the one thing we find, Senator, consistently is they  are the victims of trauma.   Now, by classic definition, trauma is some physical injury, but  trauma today is viewed in a much larger context. It goes back to a  template that was established by Kaiser Permanente and the CDC called  adverse childhood experiences--ACEs for short. Most psychologists and  child counselors know exactly what I am talking about.   ACEs, these adverse childhood experiences, can be as simple as  witnessing a violent crime or returning to a home where the parent is  not a positive force--perhaps the only parent is drug-addicted or an  alcoholic or not home at all--or having a situation in which you are  never sure where home is. So many kids in school talk about moving back  and forth from one relative to another. All of these things take their  toll on little kids. It is part of the traumatic experience.   These counselors of these gun-toting adolescents at the Cook County  facility say that over 90 percent of them are victims of trauma. Stop  and think: Is it possible that that simple thing that happened in a  child's life could have that kind of impact? Well, I am afraid it is.  For many of us, just to think back on your childhood, of the most  memorable moment in your childhood--I hope it is a good memory, one  that you smile with, but it could be a terrible memory, too, the loss  of someone you love or some other tragic event. Well, that is what has  happened to these kids. This trauma in their lives runs the risk of  changing them and even making them potentially dangerous to the  innocent people they live around.   That is why, when we talk about the Victims of Crime Act and giving  these kids counseling, a child who witnesses a domestic violence  incident in the home, where their mother is being beaten or worse, how  in the world do you erase that from your memory? You only hope that you  can find someone--some mentor, some counselor--who can talk you through  it. That is what the VOCA does. The victims of crime have an  opportunity to access those professional services before they do the  damage that they do.   So how did we get to this point where we are even debating whether to  fund this? Why is the Crime Victims Fund so dangerously close to  running out of money when we know we need it so much?   It comes down to how the fund is funded. See, the money for the  victims of crime doesn't come from taxpayer dollars. Traditionally, it  comes from criminal fines, penalties, forfeited bail bonds, and special  assessments collected by the Federal Government. Historically, these  criminal fines have accounted for the largest portion of the funding,  but in recent years, deposits in the Crime Victims Fund have dropped  significantly as the Justice Department has increasingly used deferred  prosecution and nonprosecution agreements. Monetary penalties from  these deferred prosecutions and nonprosecution agreements are currently  deposited into the General Treasury, not into the Crime Victims Fund.  As a result, the shift in sentencing has resulted in a devastating  impact on the fund.   That is why the bipartisan, bicameral coalition of lawmakers has  worked with advocacy organizations to write a fix to the VOCA law to  sustain the Crime Victims Fund. Our bill would stabilize the Crime  Victims Fund by redirecting monetary penalties from deferred  prosecutions and nonprosecution agreements to the victims and service  providers that desperately need the financial support.   If you think that is an easy and obvious fix, you don't understand  Congress. To have all of the different committees of jurisdiction take  a look at it and all of the Members take a look at it and to come up  with a solution, it doesn't happen every day. One of the reasons it  happened here in the Senate is that one of my colleagues, whom I want  to put in the Record as a major positive force, Senator Tammy Baldwin  of the State of Wisconsin. She took a real personal interest in this,  and I thank her for it. She brought us together and came up with a  solution and worked out the details--and there were many--until we  could all agree. I thank her personally and specifically during the  course of this opening remark.   The reduced deposits into the fund have had a devastating impact. She  knew it. I knew it. Everyone does. As of this year, victim assistance  grants have been reduced by more than $600 million nationwide, and even  more catastrophic cuts are looming if we don't fix it today. So far in  2021, this Crime Victims Fund has already missed out on nearly $550  million in deposits. We are not even halfway through the year. Imagine  how much more money this fund is going to lose if we don't pass this  bill.   There is no time to waste. Every day that goes by, we miss an  opportunity to help replenish this fund. More importantly, we miss an  opportunity to help a crime victim. It may be a medical bill. It could  be a funeral cost. It could be counseling for that child whom I  described earlier. Missing that opportunity may mean that the life of  that child will never quite be the same.   The Senate must immediately pass this bill. The House already did it  in March--in March. It is time for us to get around to it. So, with  broad bipartisan support in the House, we should be inspired in the  Senate by our bipartisan coalition backing the bill. Sixty-three  Senators--forty-two Dems, twenty-one Republicans--not bad. We have all  come together for the VOCA fix.   Over the past few months, an objection has prevented us from moving  forward on this legislation. We have been literally waiting for weeks  to pass this bill. Today, we have a chance to do it and to send it to  the President's desk. That is why, this afternoon, we are going to take  two votes. The first is on an amendment from Senator Toomey. It doesn't  address the substance of the programs that I mentioned; it addresses  the budget process. There is mention, of course, in this bill, but his  change would reach far beyond any single piece of legislation. We will  consider it. I will be opposing it, and others will get their chance to  vote. Then we will face final passage on the House-passed bill.   A broad coalition of victims' rights advocates, service providers,  and law enforcement organizations are urging the vote I just described  against the Toomey amendment and for the final bill. They recently  wrote to us, saying: ``The VOCA Fix Act is a narrowly tailored,  carefully negotiated, technical fix bill to address the immediate needs  of survivors, and the Senate must act now to pass this critical  legislation without any amendments. . . . Every delay allows potential  funds that should be deposited into the Crime Victims Fund to serve  victims to instead be deposited into the General Treasury. The House  passed the VOCA Fix Act more than four months ago with overwhelming  bipartisan support; we urge the Senate to similarly pass the House- passed VOCA Fix Act, as is, immediately.''  [[Page S4965]]    More than 1,700 national, regional, State, Tribal, and local  organizations are begging us to do this and do it today so we can send  it to the President and ensure that the victims are able to maintain  access to the services they desperately need. We owe it to the victims  to get this done.   I see my colleague on the floor who is the cosponsor of this bill  with me. He was the Senate Judiciary Committee's chairman in the  previous Congress, and I have that honor in this Congress. I am glad  that we could get together, a Democrat and a Republican, again. We have  cosponsored things before, and we will continue to. I want to thank  Senator Graham for his leadership and in joining on this effort. I  think it is a good one, and we need more of them   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, is there a scheduled vote?  [[Page S4973]]     The first vote is on the Toomey amendment followed by a  vote on passage of the bill, amended or unamended?    I would just say in conclusion--and I thank the Senator  from New Hampshire and the Senator from Vermont for their comments on  this measure.   If you listen carefully to the Senator from Pennsylvania, there is  one thing he did not say. He did not say that any surplus in this fund  was spent for another purpose.   He seems to worry about the allocation of the balance each year of  the fund. I would think a fiscal conservative would want to make  certain that the money spent is spent properly, not overspending in  some years and underspending in others.   That is exactly what the appropriators are asking for here, the  ability to moderate and to regulate the amount of money as it is spent,  as it is needed. That seems like a pretty fiscally conservative point  of view and a responsible one.   I urge my colleagues to follow the advice of the Senators from  Vermont and New Hampshire and to oppose the Toomey amendment and  support the passage of the bill.    Mr. President, I am not going to read the lengthy  statement from the coalition of victims' rights advocates and law  enforcement organizations opposing the Toomey amendment and the many  organizations that have asked us to vote no on the amendment and yes on  the Victims of Crime Act.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the entire  statement   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                     July 13, 2021.      Hon. Member,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.         Dear Senator: The organizations below, comprising the       national VOCA stakeholder workgroup, are writing today to       urge you to support a floor vote on the House-passed H.R.       1652, the VOCA Fix to Sustain the Crime Victims Fund Act of       2021 (``VOCA Fix Act'') by allowing a vote on the bill. We       further urge you to vote in favor of the VOCA Fix Act and to       oppose controversial amendments.        The bipartisan and bicameral VOCA Fix Act, introduced in       the Senate as S. 611 by Senators Durbin, Graham, Baldwin,       Grassley, Feinstein, Cornyn, Klobuchar, and Murkowski, is a       narrowly-focused, carefully negotiated technical fix to       address an immediate crises--massive cuts to Victim of Crime       Act (``VOCA'') victim service grants and insufficient funding       for victim compensation.        VOCA grants are funded by monetary penalties associated       with Federal criminal convictions--they are not funded with       taxpayer money. In recent years, deposits into the VOCA's       Crime Victims Fund (``CVF'' or ``the Fund'') have dropped       dramatically, due to the Department of Justice's increasing       reliance on deferred prosecution and non-prosecution       agreements (DPAs/NPAs). Unlike criminal convictions, monetary       penalties associated with DPAs/NPAs are deposited into the       General Fund of the Treasury--they do not go into the Crime       Victims Fund, despite being outcomes based on the same       crimes.        The VOCA Fix Act fixes this discrepancy by making a       technical fix to deposit monetary penalties associated with       DPAs/NPAs into the CVF instead of the General Fund, in       alignment with the original intent of the statute. It also       increases funding for state victim compensation programs and       includes other provisions outlined in this letter of support,       signed by more than 1,710 national, regional, state, Tribal,       and local organizations and government agencies.        The VOCA Fix Act passed the House with overwhelming       bipartisan support, but it has stalled in the Senate due to       attempts to use the non-controversial VOCA Fix Act to force a       vote on the controversial use of Changes in Mandatory       Programs (``CHIMPs'') in the Appropriations process.       Recognizing the critical need to pass the VOCA Fix Act       without further delay, Senators are pursuing a consent       agreement to vote on both the VOCA Fix Act and an amendment       by Senator Toomey relating to the use of the VOCA CHIMP. We       urge you to support a floor vote on the VOCA Fix Act by       letting the unanimous consent agreement to go through. Upon       the acceptance of the consent agreement, we urge you to vote       in favor of the VOCA Fix Act.        We also urge you to vote against Senator Toomey's amendment       to limit the use of the VOCA offset by requiring       Appropriators to release the average of the past three years'       deposits from the CVF annually. We recognize Senator Toomey's       desire to help survivors, but his amendment is not the best       way to do so. While on the surface, this proposal may seem       reasonable, it actually has the potential to be harmful. The       average of the past three years' deposits was less than $500       million. If there was no balance in the Fund to offset the       low deposits, victim service grants would have been $200       million--a cut of 95% compared to four years ago. The cuts to       grants over the last few years have been catastrophic, but a       cut of 95% would completely decimate the entire victim       service infrastructure. The $2 billion balance allowed by       Senator Toomey's amendment is less than yearly disbursement       over the past five years and is insufficient to meet the       needs of survivors.        It is also important to note that funding is not being       diverted from victims to pay for other programs, as stated by       those seeking to amend the VOCA Fix Act. When the CVF is used       as a paper offset, funds are not transferred to pay for other       programs--they remain in the Fund. Moreover, despite claims       to the contrary, Appropriators are not hoarding money in the       Fund to use as an offset. Over the past several years, they       have reduced the balance in the Fund from $13 billion in       Fiscal Year 2017 to an anticipated $2.5 billion at the end of       this fiscal year by increasing grants to victim service       providers. While $2.5 billion may seem like a large balance,       in actuality, it would only cover one year's VOCA grants at       Fiscal Year 2020 levels, which were already at a five-year       low. The amendment has the potential to bring down future       funding bills and cause a government shutdown, and a bill       with this language would not pass the House of       Representatives. We ask that you join us in opposing this       amendment.        Victims, survivors, and victim service organizations are       telling us that they are cutting services, laying off staff,       and even closing. They are asking for the VOCA Fix Act--they       are not asking for CHIMP reform. While we wait for passage,       survivors and advocates have watched criminal settlements       totaling more than $545 million directed towards the General       Fund rather than into the Crime Victims Fund this calendar       year, because this technical fix has not passed. Ultimately,       there may be merit in holding a conversation about the       structure of Congressional spending bills, but the VOCA Fix       Act is not the appropriate forum. The use of CHIMPs is       controversial; the VOCA Fix Act is not.        The VOCA Fix Act is a narrowly tailored, carefully       negotiated technical fix bill to address the immediate needs       of survivors, and the Senate must act now to pass this       critical legislation without any amendments. On behalf of a       broad and committed group of national, regional, state,       Tribal, and local stakeholders, we urge you to support a vote       on the VOCA Fix Act, to vote in favor of the VOCA Fix Act,       and to vote against the Toomey amendment. Every delay allows       potential funds that should be deposited into the Crime       Victims Fund to serve victims to instead be deposited into       the General Treasury. The House passed the VOCA Fix Act more       than four months ago with overwhelming bipartisan support; we       urge the Senate to similarly pass the House-passed VOCA Fix       Act, as is, immediately.

I yield the floor.                          Vote on Amendment No. 2121     Madam President, the U.S. Postal Service always provides  outstanding service during every election, but 2020 was something  unseen in more than a century. Last year, USPS had to manage processing  nearly 66 million ballots, countless safety concerns, and a hostile  administration. And as expected, it met these challenges with  incredible efforts and determination. A big part of that strength came  from the National Association of Postal Supervisors, or NAPS. What  started as 50 postal supervisors dedicating themselves to helping their  fellow supervisors more than a century ago has become a critical force  during our election. They have kept our Nation connected through the  mail, and in 2020, they helped keep us connected to our democracy.   With a membership of 27,000, NAPS local ballot ambassadors helped  postal leadership process millions of ballots during this pivotal  election. Leading the effort was NAPS national president Brian Wagner.  I am grateful for his leadership and service. He has served in NAPS for  more than 25 years, and in August, he will be retiring from his  position. I would like to share his amazing story with you.   Brian was a paperboy while growing up in Peoria, IL. Right out of  high school, he joined the U.S. Postal Service as a letter carrier. It  was a perfect fit; Brian just enjoys people. He loves connecting with  his neighbors and naturally made friends all along his route. A  lifelong lover of ice cream, Brian was happy to have The Spotted Cow  ice cream shop on his route as well. Brian even met his wife Carol when  he was a letter carrier. Carol ran the mailroom of a business on  Brian's route.   While working as a letter carrier, Brian worked hard on his formal  education. He earned an associate's degree in business from Illinois  Central Junior College, a bachelor's degree in finance from Illinois  State University, and an MBA from Illinois State, all while still  completing his route every day. Brian and Carol married after he  graduated.   In 1990, Brian joined NAPS. He joined NAPS because be knew that being  a postal worker was a wonderful job with benefits that were worth  fighting to keep. Others deserved to have the same opportunities he  had. He began representing NAPS members in 1994 when members elected  him president of the Heart of IL Branch 255. Throughout the years, he  has served as NAPS secretary/treasurer, central region vice president,  and NAPS Illinois State area vice president.   In August 2016, Brian was elected NAPS national president and has  been a consistent fighter for postal supervisors. His dedication to  NAPS is incredible. Brian even celebrated his 30th wedding anniversary  at a NAPS convention. He has been in their corner through these  especially tough times in the last several years.   This summer, Brian will retire from his role. He will have more time  to travel, practice for his marathons, and watch his beloved St. Louis  Cardinals play baseball. In addition, he will be able to spend time  with his sons Justin and Ryan and dote on his new grandchild. I have  heard Idaho and Hawaii are on the docket for travel plans. I hope he  will also find time to enjoy his favorite mint chocolate chip ice cream  at The Spotted Cow.   Wishing our best to one of our best.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have 11 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
