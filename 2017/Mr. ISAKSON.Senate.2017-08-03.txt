 Mr. President, I rise for a moment to reflect on what  was a great night for the U.S. Senate, the U.S. Government, for the  population of our country but most importantly for those who served as  veterans in the military.   Last night, the Senate agreed to significant legislation on three  fronts to make the VA better and more responsive to our veterans.   Ranking Member Tester and I have spent the entire year working toward  making sure we dealt with the needs the VA has so all these stories we  see on the front page of papers, stories about there being unsafe  conditions, stories about people being mistreated, stories of people  having to wait so long for their appointments--we want to put an end to  all this, and we have given the Secretary the tools to do exactly that.   I was telling the ranking member this is called ``no excuses day.''  Secretary Shulkin will have no excuses for any mistakes to be made.  Every tool he needs in his toolbox to see that the Veterans'  Administration is responsible to the veterans of the United States of  America passed in this Senate, passed in the House. There were six  major bills the first 7 months of this year, a remarkable achievement,  a testimony to teamwork, to staff, and to the leadership of the  Republican and the Democratic Parties. The majority and minority  leaders of this Senate made it possible for that to happen last night.  I am eternally grateful to both of them for their support and help.   I am not going to read all the names of the staff now because we are  in limited time.   I ask unanimous consent that the names of every staff member who  worked with the VA Committee to make it the best year ever be printed  in the Record.   Credit is given to captains, Presidents, and people with titles.  Senator Tester and I have the titles, when it comes to the VA  Committee, but the reason the VA Committee was successful in  accomplishing every single goal, was because of every ranking file  member, Republican or Democratic. We took our labels off, we put our  armor on, and we plowed ahead. We didn't say no to problems that looked  like they were too hard. We said yes to solutions that looked like they  made sense.   Veterans of the United States of America have better healthcare,  better educational benefits, and a modern VA to deal with in the years  ahead. I am proud to have been a part of it. I want to commend Senator  Tester for his contribution.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Staff on the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs:        Tom Bowman, staff director, soon-to-be Deputy Secretary of       VA; Amanda Meredith, deputy staff director, soon-to-be judge       on the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims; Leslie       Campbell; Gretchan Blum; Maureen O'Neill; Adam Reece; David       Shearman; Jillian Workman; Kristen Hines; Thomas Coleman;       John Ashley; Mitchell Sylvest; Joan Kirchner; Trey       Kilpatrick; Jay Sulzmann; Ryan Evans; Salvador Ortega; and       Amanda Maddox.     I yield to Senator Tester.    Mr. President, as my colleague Senator Menendez  indicated, the intent of the language in the FDA Reauthorization Act is  this: so long as the submission process for a given product is begun by  the sponsor on or before September 30, 2017, the product would qualify  for a priority review voucher under the neglected tropical disease  priority review voucher program.
