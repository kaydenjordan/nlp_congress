Jones, a Representative-elect from the       Third District of the State of North Carolina, has been       unable from illness to appear in person to be sworn as a       Member of the House, and there being no contest or question       as to his election; Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the Speaker, or deputy named by her, is       hereby authorized to administer the oath of office to the       Honorable Walter B.
