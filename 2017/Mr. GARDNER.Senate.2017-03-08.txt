 Mr. President, looking at today's headlines and  listening to the news, it may seem as if colleagues from across the  country--Democrat, Republican--don't always agree on some things, let  alone anything. I think we are starting to see a consensus emerge--a  very good, genuine agreement emerge between liberals and conservatives,  Democrats and Republicans on at least one matter in Washington, DC, in  the Senate: Neil Gorsuch. That agreement is on Neil Gorsuch.   Neil Gorsuch is an exceptional nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court. In  fact, Judge Gorsuch is, by many extents and by many commentators,  arguably one of the most talented jurists we have nominated to the  Court in a very long time, at least in modern history.   As the Denver Post in Colorado said: ``Gorsuch is a brilliant legal  mind'' who has a reputation for ``[applying] the law fairly and  consistently.''   You can't ask for much more than that--somebody who will apply the  law fairly and consistently. However, this shouldn't surprise anyone  who knows Judge Gorsuch. Judge Gorsuch has always enjoyed overwhelming  bipartisan support. All we need to do to see that is to look back to  2006 when we could see that most clearly in the U.S. Senate.   In 2006, when Judge Gorsuch was unanimously confirmed to the Tenth  Circuit Court, 12 current Democratic Senators, including the minority  leader and Senators Leahy, Feinstein, and Durbin, all were in office.  It was a nomination in 2006 that was unanimous, a nomination that went  by voice vote.   He was so universally appealing to the Tenth Circuit Court that he  had an introduction at the Judiciary Committee by both a Democratic  Senator  [[Page S1662]]  from Colorado and a Republican Senator from Colorado, joined by every  single person on the floor to vote yes unanimously.   They approved his nomination. And to give you even greater context  about this vote, the people who made this vote, the approval of Judge  Gorsuch in 2006 to the Tenth Circuit Court came in addition to the 12  people I just mentioned who are here today and who were here then. It  also came with the support of then-Senator Obama, Senator Biden,  Senator Clinton, and Senator Kerry.   Approximately 11 years later, now that Judge Gorsuch has proved  himself to be a mainstream jurist, a consensus builder, a profound  legal mind with an even temperament and affable nature, we have a  chance again to put this incredibly brilliant mind on the Nation's  highest Court.   Judge Gorsuch is a faithful adherent to the Constitution and the  organizing principles of this great democracy. I have no doubt that  Judge Gorsuch will--and should--enjoy similar levels of approval among  my distinguished colleagues across the aisle.   I also wish for people to learn more about Judge Gorsuch personally  and to tell some stories about growing up in Colorado. It is a story  about how a young man from Denver, CO, through his own hard work and  academic excellence, rose to the highest echelons of the legal  profession and to the nearly universal acclaim of Democrats and  Republicans.   A fourth-generation Coloradan, Neil Gorsuch learned the value of hard  work at a young age from his grandfathers. His maternal grandfather,  Dr. Joseph McGill, began his adult life by working in Union Station,  the main railway terminal in Denver. From there, Dr. McGill put himself  through medical school and became a prominent surgeon. With his wife,  Dorothy Jean, Dr. McGill raised seven children, all of whom he gave a  better life to and put through college.   Neil's paternal grandfather, John Gorsuch, was his legal inspiration.  After serving in World War I, John Gorsuch put himself through  undergraduate and law school at the University of Denver by driving a  trolley car. Upon graduation, John built a law practice focusing on  real estate law. He also made time to help Denver's welfare department  and participate in the Kiwanis Club and numerous other civic  organizations. Later, John started what was at one time one of the  largest law firms in Denver, Gorsuch Kirgis, where he practiced well  into his eighties.   It was this family work ethic that drove Neil to get his hands dirty  and pursue blue collar jobs at a young age. In Colorado, he moved  furniture, he shoveled snow, he mowed lawns, and he even shoveled some  more snow in the great State of Colorado. It was this work ethic--and a  lot of shoveling of snow--combined with his family's appreciation of  higher education that helped Neil consistently realize academic  excellence.   By now, I think this Chamber is well familiar with Judge Gorsuch's  sterling academic credentials, receiving his undergraduate degree at  Columbia, law school at Harvard, Ph.D. at Oxford. I don't think any of  us can forget, nor should we, the fact that he spent a summer at the  University of Colorado.   Intellect alone doesn't get you through the halls of these storied  academic institutions. It requires hard work, independence--two values  of the West; two values in addition to many other western values that  Judge Gorsuch holds.   It is these values, these western perspectives that the Supreme Court  desperately needs to grow. Judge Gorsuch is a lifelong outdoorsman. He  enjoys fly fishing and skiing. In fact, I have been told that he is a  double black diamond skier. His wife, Louise, cares for animals in a  small barn on his land.   In addition to his love of the outdoors and his appreciation of  nature's beauty, Judge Gorsuch understands the complex legal issues  facing westerners and our Western States.   Since 2006, Judge Gorsuch served on the Federal court that covers the  Tenth Circuit Court based out of Denver that covers six other Western  States--Colorado, Oklahoma, Kansas, New Mexico, Wyoming, and Utah.  Those States represent nearly 20 percent of the land of the continental  United States.   His service on this court has provided him with a unique  understanding of public lands, water, and Tribal issues that many of  the other Western States in the region face. Some of the most complex  legal challenges in water law and others come before his court as a  result. That experience would serve all of our Western States well when  utilized from the U.S. Supreme Court.   Over the coming days, I plan, along with many of my other colleagues,  to elaborate on why Gorsuch's western values and perspective make him  an outstanding choice for the U.S. Supreme Court. I look forward to  working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make sure he gets  a timely up-or-down vote. From the highest echelons of the legal field  to the Tenth Circuit Court, to the U.S. Supreme Court, Judge Gorsuch  would make us proud, and he would serve this country well.
