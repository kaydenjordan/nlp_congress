 This is a constitutional amendment that we are       debating, not an impeachment resolution. The Republicans are       crossing out the impeachment standard of high crimes and       misdemeanors, and they are inserting the words ``any crime or       misdemeanor.'' We are permitting a constitutional coup d'etat       which will haunt this body and our country forever.
