 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to applaud the passage of  Restoring Hope for Mental Health and Well-Being Act of 2022, a  comprehensive package of over 30 bills, 6 of which I proudly led.   Today, over 50 million Americans struggle with mental illness, and  over 20 million Americans struggle with substance use disorder. We have  lost nearly 1 million lives to suicide and over 1 million Americans to  drug overdoses in the last 20 years.   Today, we are on course to lose another 1.2 million Americans in the  next decade to drug overdoses. We cannot afford to wait until tomorrow,  so today, we took action. This effort served as a first step of a  continued journey to end these crises that have taken far too long and  taken too many.   We proudly cast our vote to help save the lives of our fellow  Americans. I thank Chairman Frank Pallone, Ranking Member McMorris  Rodgers, Leader Hoyer, and their teams for making this vision a  reality.                            ____________________
