 If a President does something which he       believes will help him get elected--in the public interest--      that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in       impeachment. The fact that he has announced his candidacy is       a very good reason for upping the interest in this son. If he       wasn't running for President, he's a has-been. He is the       former Vice President of the United States. OK, big deal. But       if he is running for President, that is an enormous big deal.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. So it is certainly true that when public  officials take actions, they may have in mind, when they make a policy  judgment, what is the impact on my political career going to be, or,  what is the impact going to be on my reelection prospects, but that is  a very different question than whether they can engage in a corrupt act  to help their election--in this case, to get foreign help to cheat in  an election.   I think we can distinguish between the fact that political actors  have political interests and what the President's defense would argue,  and that is, if he believes it is in his reelection interest, then no  quid pro quo is too corrupt. If we go down that road, there is no limit  to what this or any other President can do. There is no limit to what  foreign powers will feel they can offer a corrupt President to help  their reelection if that is the precedent we intend to establish.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from New Jersey.
