 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to complete my  remarks before the vote starts.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that there be  3 minutes of debate, equally divided, between the votes today.    Madam President, I come to the floor, hopefully today  will be the day we wrap up debate on the America Competes-Endless  Frontier legislation now known as the USICA, United States Innovation  and Competition Act of 2021. We come to talk about this now, primarily  because we know that the research dollars invested today are going to  decide the jobs of the future. And we know that we all believe a  significant increase in the investment in research and development  dollars will help us spur innovation, continue to help us compete, and  continue to be competitive in key sectors of our economy that are so  important to us.   We know that we have been having this debate literally now for more  than a decade, starting with President Bush's 2006 report saying  America needed to invest more in the National Science Foundation. And  at the time, I am pretty sure we thought we were in a track meet where  our competitor was maybe half a lap behind us   I am pretty sure now, as the decade has moved on, we are looking over  our shoulder and realizing that the competition is gaining. So we need  to make this investment in research and development to stay  competitive, to grow jobs for tomorrow, and solve some of our most  pressing problems, whether that is climate change, national security on  cyber issues, or the advent and usage of artificial intelligence and  what that will mean both for our opportunities and for our challenges.   So we are making a renewed commitment to the National Science  Foundation. I thank my colleagues again, Senator Schumer and Senator  Young, for  [[Page S3975]]  their innovative legislation. They are telling us a couple of things.  They are saying, one, invest more money in research and development, so  this bill not only increases the NSF budget, it increases DOE's budget  and increases the Defense Advanced Research Program Agency's funding as  well by $17.5 billion.   So it is saying, yes, basic research is still very important. But it  is also saying, for the first time, we need to get more out of the  research that we do, and we need to have more translational science,  that is, taking the basic research and applied research and actually  using the applications of that in a more robust way so that we can  translate more of that into actual science and manufacturing.   Why is this so important? Because we know that our competitiveness as  a nation is suffering from the fact that people are looking at our own  research and development. They are looking at our teachings and our  publishing at universities and actually going and implementing this. So  we need to do better on tech transfer.   This underlying legislation not only helps us do that by helping to  help universities who are our No. 1 research partner with Federal  dollars, it allows those universities to help us with more tech  transfer in innovative ways, that universities not just do the  research, but help commercialize it. It also makes investments and  helping them protect the patenting of that critical information, so no  longer having that patentable information used in other places around  the globe, but actually capitalizing on the jobs here in the United  States.   It also makes a huge investment in STEM, the science, technology,  engineering, and math jobs that we need for the future. And clearly,  you can't make a major investment in research and development if you  don't have the workforce to carry it out. And we need a workforce to  carry it out. So this underlying legislation helps us not only  diversify our workforce by a major investment in STEM, going from an  annual budget of about $1 billion in the year 2020 to about $4 billion  a year by 2026. So we are going to get a more diversified STEM  workforce with women and minorities participating.   And we are also trying to distribute more of our engineering and  science capacity around the United States. Our colleagues, Senators  Schumer and Young, were adamant that we also look at innovation  infrastructure happening in more regional places in the United States,  where they may not currently have the R&D capability of some of our  major institutions.   So this legislation promises 20 percent of the research and  investment dollars go to those EPSCoR states, Established Program to  Stimulate Competitive Research, an already identified landmark in how  we distribute research dollars, that tries to grow the regional  research infrastructure in more places in the United States. Again, I  thank my colleagues Senator Wicker for leading the charge on that and  helping us make that investment. And it also triples the Manufacturing  Extension Partnership Program, so that we get more out of manufacturing  workforce training and resiliency of our supply chain for the future.   As I mentioned before we left, it also includes an authorization for  NASA and the Artemis mission and making sure that we are staying  competitive. As Senator Nelson said in a House hearing on our mission  and challenges, as China has made it clear, they are going to Mars, we  are going back to the Moon to ready ourselves to go to Mars, and we  think that it, too, deserves the funding and support to make us  competitive.   I think the bottom line here is that we know that American innovation  drives the economy of the future. In a lot of ways, in passing this  legislation today--and just so our colleagues know, we will have a  couple of votes here before we get to a final passage--we really are  doing our part.   People hopefully will support this legislation enthusiastically, well  past the majority of Members, because you believe in the history of the  United States research and development that we have achieved innovation  goals--whether that was what we did with the internet, whether that was  what we have done on biosciences, even on some of our issues as it  relates to energy. We have achieved big breakthroughs.   So today's vote is about investing in that innovation economy of the  future. I am pretty confident because I have met some of these  innovators across the United States. I don't know if everything that we  have done so far will be absorbed by universities, our researchers, and  our labs, but literally, we are trying to dust off R&D skills and make  them more competitive for today.   I guarantee you, though, these dollars that reach American  entrepreneurs, who reach American innovators, they are ready and  willing to take up this challenge. Give them those collaborative  research resources through innovation at universities, through tech  hubs, through more collaboration on workforce training, through  investments in semiconductors, and I guarantee you these entrepreneurs  in America will innovate our economy and create the economies of the  future.   And what is at stake? If my colleagues have a better idea, I am  willing to hear it. But I know this: Americans want us to lead on their  regional economies, on the U.S. economies, and on global economies.  They do not want to get left behind. They look at this time and era as  a challenge to the leadership we have provided in the past.   So settling for Federal investment being near their lowest point as a  percentage of GDP in 60 years won't cut it. What cuts it is making an  investment in R&D and empowering those entrepreneurs so they will  create those future economies.   I yield the floor.    Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act  of 1974, the waiver provisions of applicable budget resolutions, and  section 4(g)3 of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, I move to  waive all applicable sections of those acts and applicable budget  resolutions for the purposes of the pending measure, and I ask for the  yeas and nays.    If I could explain to my colleagues about this vote  because it goes far beyond the simplicity of just the debate regarding  the semiconductor chips and emergency appropriations.   The way this point of order is drafted, basically, it would gut the  bill. Basically, it not only guts the provisions related to the chips  emergency appropriations, but it strikes the Foreign Relations  Committee's work, it strikes the Homeland Security Committee's work, it  strikes the Banking Committee's work, it effectively strikes the HELP  Committee's work and the Judiciary's, and most importantly, the Finance  Committee's work, which it was the entire Finance Committee's  insistence that the GSP, the System of Preferences, be included in the  bill.   So all of those things that everybody wishes would be in the bill  would no longer be in the bill, including the Department of Energy  funding, the increase in STEM funding, and many other provisions.   I ask my colleagues to waive the budget point of order. Vote yes, and  let us move this legislation forward.    Mr. President, we have been working for almost a month  to review and vet hundreds of amendments filed by my colleagues on both  sides. You maybe followed the floor debate here, where we agreed to  numerous amendments and had discussions on many more--I think 20, to be  exact.   We had been working on a managers' package that was previously  objected to before we left for the recess. Since then, we have been  working diligently with our colleague Senator Wicker, on the Commerce  Committee, to put forth a bipartisan package of amendments to improve  the legislation. Many of these provisions have been great bipartisan  efforts: Senators Ernst and Hassan's bipartisan amendment to improve  transparency of the National Science Foundation grant funding; Senator  Collins' amendment to require an update on implementation of the Energy  Implementation Act; Senator Blackburn had a technical fix on studying  the possible threats to our communications network and fiber optic  transmission; Senator Warnock's amendment to clarify the definition of  minority-serving institutions on STEM grants; Senator Cortez Masto  worked on several bipartisan pieces of legislation to resolve issues on  amendments dealing with critical minerals and recycling, something very  important to us as a nation.   So, in total, we have 42 amendments--23 led by Republicans, 19 led by  Democrats--many of which, as I said, are bipartisan. These amendments  would seek to improve the bill and accomplish Member priorities. And  this is what happens when you negotiate on the Senate floor in regular  order. You vote on amendments; you have some voice vote amendments; and  you have a managers' package.   So I hope our colleagues will consider giving our colleagues a chance  to have their amendments that have been agreed to accepted into this  package.   So I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be agreed to  en bloc: Collins 1583; Fischer 1637; Johnson 1701; Shaheen 1758; Rubio  1777; Thune 1851; Wicker 1943; Hagerty 1958; Cotton 1964; Blunt 1988;  Scott 2000; Ernst-Hassan 2017; Romney-Menendez 2025; Johnson 2048;  Lujan 2082; Rosen 1768; Merkley 1823; Warnock 1980; Murray 1981; Hassan  2001; Warren-Rubio 2104; Collins 1622; Wicker 1801; Leahy-Tillis 2093;  Van Hollen-Tillis 2049; Blackburn 2085; Cortez Masto 2083, which  includes language from Senator Durbin; Lankford 1945; Baldwin-Braun  2026; Hyde-Smith 1933; Hyde-Smith 1841; Merkley-Rubio-Romney 2103;  Ossoff 2105; Kennedy 2113; Barrasso 2094; Rubio 2106; Kaine 2090;  Barrasso-Cardin 2101; Peters 2112; Cantwell 1905; Baldwin 2081; and  Cardin-Wicker, as modified, 1782.    Mr. President, I do believe our colleagues have worked  hard to have their legislation considered. I want them to know I am  going to continue to promulgate these ideas about competitiveness.   You know, I had a chance to fly home, and for me it is a long way. It  is 5\1/2\ hours so you get a lot of reading done. And I read Chris  Wallace's new book about 1945 and the number of days that our Nation  had to respond to the threat of war, what it took them to go out and  develop the Manhattan Project, to get them to go and not only in my  State, develop the Hanford site--Los Alamos developed that--and not  only that, developed what happened at Oak Ridge and a scientific  response to make our Nation more secure. All we are asking for here is  a little R&D dollars. So I can tell you that I wish we would find a  Leslie Groves of today because those are the people who responded to  our Nation when we needed to respond in a competitive fashion.   I am so sorry that our colleagues' amendments are not going to be  considered, but if my colleague's underlying premise is that you don't  want to respond to the competitive threats to our Nation, you have a  right to vote no. But holding up our colleagues' good work, I think, is  a mistake.   I will commit to our colleagues that these important things on  critical minerals, on transparency, and on moving forward on science,  we will continue to work with you.   I thank the Presiding Officer, and I think now we have a vote on the  substitute amendment.                    Vote on Amendment No. 1502, as Amended     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that myself,  Senator Cantwell, Senator Wicker, Senator Young, and Senator Schumer be  allowed to speak before the vote.    Mr. President, I just wanted to take a moment to thank,  obviously, my colleagues, Senator Schumer and Senator Young, for their  hard work on this legislation and thank my counterpart, Senator Wicker,  for his tremendous effort in moving this bill.   We have now been on this bill, and we reported it out May 12. I think  it came on the calendar May 13, and, literally, we have been working on  it since. So this is a very hard effort to produce something very  important to today's economy. So I want to thank Senator Schumer's  staff, Mike Lynch, Meghan Taira, Gerry Petrella; and John Keast,  Crystal Tully, Steven Wall, James Mazol, Cheri Pascoe of Senator  Wicker's office.   On my team, David Strickland, Melissa Porter, and Mary Guenther. But,  specifically, I want to thank Richard-Duane Chambers, who came to the  Senate from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, I think,  maybe like a week before we started working on this bill. So,  literally, since he joined the Senate Commerce Committee, he has been  just knee-deep in the conversation of dusting off our R&D for the  Nation, making a new investment, making more translational science. So  I really appreciate Richard-Duane's effort.   I also want to thank Gigi Slais, Shawn Bone, John Branscome, Ronce  Almond, Alex Simpson, Jared Bomberg, Shannon Smith, John Beezer, Noam  Kantor, Tiffany George, Jordan Blue, Kara Fischer, Nikky Teutschel,  Matthew Bobbink, Caitlin Warner, Alex Kiles, George Greenwell, Elle  Wibisono, Alexis Gutierrez, Eric Vryheid, Brian McDermott, Lucy Koch,  Hunter Blackburn, and Alex Hall. So all of these people.   I think my colleagues know that these bills don't come about easily.  They come through a lot of hard work. And we thank everybody for  participating in a regular order process out here on the Senate floor  to produce a bipartisan result for something so important to our  Nation's competitiveness.
