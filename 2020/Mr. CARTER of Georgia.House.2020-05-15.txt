 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the  HEROES Act.   This legislation ignores the fundamental issues affecting our  country. It is a harmful misallocation of congressional efforts and  ignores the plight of the American people.   For instance, this package references cannabis more times than it  does jobs. It includes hundreds of billions to bail out States, which  may be needed, but it is not even ensuring that there are guardrails to  prevent reckless behavior and waste.   It extends increased unemployment benefits well past the targeted  reopening of the country, forcing businesses to compete with a  government program for employees.   This package would allow illegal immigrants access to direct  payments, and it would move to federalize elections. These are just a  handful of examples of the misguided and dangerous  [[Page H2234]]  policies included in this legislation. We have allocated trillions of  dollars in aid, and significant amounts of that still hasn't gone out  the door.   Now is the time to discuss solutions for the problems facing the  American people, not a partisan wish list.    Mr. Speaker, now is the time for us to discuss  solutions for the problems facing the American people, not to put out  partisan wish lists. I urge my colleagues to oppose this.                                time  1645
