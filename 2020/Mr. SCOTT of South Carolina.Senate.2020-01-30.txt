 Mr. Chief Justice.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S729, January 30, 2020, third column, the following  appears: Thank you.  Mr. Chief  Justice.      The online Record has been corrected to read: Thank you,  Counsel.  Mr. Chief Justice.    ========================= END NOTE =========================      The CHIEF JUSTICE. We have another half of the presentation.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. If we could--Senator, if we could pull up slide  37, this is what the district court had to say in the McGahn  litigation, now on appeal:         Executive branch officials are not absolutely immune from       compulsory congressional process no matter how many times the       executive branch has asserted as much over the years.    That is consistent with the decision in the Miers case, where the  court said:         Clear precedent and persuasive policy reasons confirm that       the Executive cannot be the judge of its own privilege and       hence Ms. Miers is not entitled to absolute immunity.    Let's look at what the court said on slide 38, where Judge Jackson  said:         Stated simply, the primary takeaway from the past 250 years       of recorded American history is that Presidents are not kings       . . . compulsory appearance by dint of a subpoena is a legal       constrict not a political one, and per the Constitution no       one is above the law.    This is the district court saying: Thou shalt appear and this claim  of absolute immunity is absolute nonsense.   In the court, now, this is what the Justice Department is arguing in  that case, if we can see slide 39.         The committee lacks article III standing to sue to enforce       a congressional subpoena demanding testimony from an       individual on matters related to his duties as an executive       branch official.    And so here we are. We are now in a court of appeals, the Justice  Department is saying that you cannot force congressional subpoenas, and  they are saying: Well, let's continue to litigate the matter. Let this  play out further.   To what end? To what end? Yes, I suppose we could wait for a court of  appeals decision, but, of course, they would say they are not satisfied  with that court throwing out this idea either.   Well, look, we have got a perfectly good Justice right here that can  make these decisions. Let's let him make the call. Let's let him make  the call. Let's trust that he would be fair and impartial.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from South Carolina    Thank you, sir.   I send a question to the desk on behalf of myself, Senators Hawley,  Sasse, and Barrasso.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senators Scott of South Carolina, Hawley, Sasse,  and Barrasso is to the counsel for the President:         During their presentation, the House Managers referenced       Chairman Gowdy and the  [[Page S730]]       House Benghazi Investigation. The final report on Benghazi       flatly says ``The administration did not cooperate with the       investigation.'' That committee fought for two years to       access information, and often had information requests       ignored or denied. Yet this House investigation, after just 3       months, already supposedly justifies impeachment. Does       President Trump owe more compliance than other Presidents       did?    Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   Part of what we are seeing, I believe, is kind of a two-fold attack  or approach. We just saw a citation to two district court opinions, as  if the final arbiter of an issue of this magnitude is going to be the  district court--or, for that matter, the court of appeals.   You are right. It is going to be the Supreme Court of the United  States, if it goes in that direction.   Now, with regard to the question about the statement in the Benghazi  report that the administration did not cooperate, the same was also  true with Fast and Furious and the investigation there. And in that  particular investigation, it reached such a significant point that  Members of the House determined that the then-Attorney General of the  United States should be held in contempt.   Now, President Obama exercised executive privilege over documents and  testimony related to Fast and Furious. The constitutional process was  followed.   Now, I am not the one that makes the decision whether that was  privileged or not privileged. If there was going to be a challenge, it  would have been adjudicated. But the fact of the matter is, at least 10  times tonight Manager Schiff has said: We have complete confidence in  the Chief Justice, ignoring the fact that it is not his call. And I  mean that with all sincerity, since you are making fun of people who  are saying ``with due respect.'' It is not--that is not the way it is  set up.   Now, you could agree to anything. Sure, you can negotiate. You can  negotiate that all the witnesses that will be called will be the  witnesses they requested, or you could negotiate that since they had 17  and we had none, we get 17 and they get 4. All kinds of things can be  negotiated under their view.   But this is brought to you by the managers who have an overwhelming  case that they proved over and over again. That is what they say. They  have proved it. It is overwhelming. It is incredible. We were able to  put it together in a record amount of time. And now we want you, the  U.S. Senate, to start calling witnesses for our overwhelmingly proved  case.   I would just lay this down: If we are negotiating, why don't we just  go to closing arguments, and see what this body decides?   But I respect the process. The process is we have 2 days of  questioning. Tomorrow there will be an argument on the motion. There  will be a decision on the motion, and we have to--that is the system  that is in place. That is the system we should follow.   But this idea that two district court judges have decided an issue of  this magnitude and that is now the determination--they wouldn't accept  it if they were in our position. They would say: Well, the district  court decided; so that is going to be it.   So I think we need to look at what is really at stake. These are  really significant issues. These are serious. I mean, the idea that  executive privilege should just be waived or doesn't exist, that, in  your view, absolute immunity can't possibly exist--it has only been  utilized for administrations for 50 years or more.   Professor Dershowitz gave you the list of Presidents that have put  forward executive privilege, and in a lot of his writings, he talks  about it.   But to say tonight that we are just going to--you know, we will just  cut a deal. We will do it in a week. We will get some depositions, and  that will make everyone happy.   It doesn't make the Constitution happy.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Ohio.
