 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to lead my  colleagues in a Special Order hour.   On October 7, Hamas launched a horrific attack against Israeli  civilians, murdering over 1,400 people and taking hostage more than 244  women, children, families, and the elderly. Hamas spared no one.   The hostage crisis has left hundreds of families desperate and  searching for answers on the health and safety of their loved ones.  This past month has been gut-wrenching. I have never felt this  magnitude of pain, shock, and anger burning in the hearts of the Jewish  people.   The intentional, genocidal violence inflicted on Israeli civilians  and the unconscionable apathy of many nations is a sobering reminder of  the fact that Israel remains surrounded by hostility and danger.   For me, and for so many of us, this goes beyond our belief in the  survival of the Jewish State. It rises far above politics as usual. It  is a moment in history that begs for humanity, unity, and solidarity  with Israel.   I am wrecked by how quickly people in this country have forgotten the  hostages still being held in Gaza by Hamas. I find myself having to  reiterate over and over again that Israel was attacked by a terrorist  organization whose mission is the eradication of Israel and the Jewish  people.   We must all remember not only the horrifying statistic of 240  captured, but who they are as people. These are real human beings. That  is why we are here tonight.   We will continue to come to this floor to call attention to all of  the human beings who are brutally being held captive by Hamas in Gaza,  until every last one of them is released.   Each of my colleagues who are joining me will speak about a hostage  or family of hostages, show their beautiful faces, and remind all of us  not to forget these victims who are suffering under terrorist  brutality.   Thankfully, Israel has welcomed home many children and some women  this week. I am extremely grateful for President Biden's efforts to  help make that possible. We cannot and we will not stop until all  hostages are reunited with their families.   Tonight, I will be sharing the story of the Bibas family, parents  Shiri and Yarden, 4-year-old Ariel, and 10-month-old Kfir from Kibbutz  Nir Oz. Look at this beautiful family.   Kfir, the youngest hostage, was just 9 months old on October 7. He  had just learned to crawl when he was abducted. His family is worried  Kfir doesn't have access to formula. Look at Kfir's beautiful face. How  could anyone justify kidnapping and taking hostage a 9-month-old.   As a Jewish mother, I remember when my babies were that age. I  remember nursing them. I remember holding them in my arms and being  joyful about their first crawling, their first steps, and looking  forward to the beauty of their lives unfolding.   Looking at Kfir and Ariel's faces is heartbreaking and is deeply  personal. Many of us have had the opportunity to meet with the families  of these hostages. Yesterday, Hamas claimed that Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir  were killed in Gaza. I pray with all my heart that that is false. The  barbarism and cruelty of Hamas knows no bounds.   The Bibas family would never have been in harm's way in Gaza if Hamas  did not launch its murderous attack on Israel and take children as  leverage on October 7.                                time  1830    On that fateful day, Shiri, Yarden, and their boys were hiding in a  safe room when militants fired semiautomatic weapons outside the  family's window as Yarden texted relatives: ``I love you all.'' One- half hour later, he texted, ``They are coming in,'' just before  communication ceased.   Since then, the world has seen a distressing video of Shiri holding  her two young boys wrapped in a blanket close to her chest while  surrounded by Hamas militants. Another video depicts Yarden with a head  injury forcibly being taken away on a motorcycle.   On Monday, the IDF announced the Bibas family was transferred by  Hamas to another Palestinian terror group in Gaza as if they were a  commodity to  [[Page H6038]]  give leverage to another terrorist organization.   While we know the facts about October 7 and have seen the family's  pictures and videos, it is important to remember the light and love of  this family. Shiri is described by loved ones as a woman who touches  everyone's heart, gentle and full of tenderness, which you can clearly  see when she was trying to shield her children and the terror on her  face. She was reborn with her two little sons. They were the light that  filled her life. Under her loving wing, they were growing up happily.   Ariel loves anything with wheels and a motor. He dreams of  superheroes and dresses up as Batman.   Yarden is a sensitive and loving father and husband. Ofri says that  while her brother looks big and strong, inside he is the most sensitive  and gentle person she knows.   Shiri's cousin Yifat said in an interview about her family: ``I can  only hope they are together. I hope they didn't separate her from her  children. I try not to think about the worst. This is the only thing  that keeps me going. But every day that goes by, we can't go the same  path anymore. Things need to be changed. Israel is going to be changed  after this. We are all traumatized, okay? This touched every family  that is involved in Israel.''   My heart goes out to Ofri, Yifat, and their whole family. Make no  mistake, Hamas will be held responsible.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  poignant words.   Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, my friend  from Michigan, General Bergman, for his indulgence and his generosity.   Mr. Speaker, I close by reminding the American public the names and  faces you saw tonight are only a fraction of those who remain held  hostage in Gaza by cowardly terrorists, by Hamas.   I hope every American understands that Israel is fighting to protect  her citizens from this diabolic terrorist organization and to rescue  her hostages.   There is only one culprit to blame for this war, and that is Hamas.  Their singular goal is to destroy Israel and kill Jews.   Mr. Speaker, this Chamber has always and will always continue to  stand strong with Israel and work to release these victims from  terrorist tyranny and support, preventing an attack like this from  being perpetrated against Israel by Hamas ever again.   ``Am Yisrael Chai,'' ``The people of Israel live.''
