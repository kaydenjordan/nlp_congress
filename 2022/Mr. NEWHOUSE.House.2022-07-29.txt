 Madam Chair, I thank my friend from Arkansas for  allowing me to speak on this important issue.   Madam Chair, rural communities across the country are plagued by  persistent drought and catastrophic wildfires, especially communities  in the Western United States. As the Representative for Washington's  Fourth Congressional District and as chairman of the Congressional  Western Caucus, I have been consistently calling for these issues to be  taken up in committees and here on the House floor.   In one sense, I am very glad that our colleagues from across the  aisle are finally realizing just how crucial these issues are, but I am  disappointed by the fact that today's rushed package of provisions  fails to address the root challenges that we face in the West and  ignores a myriad of solutions that were offered by my Republican  colleagues.   Rather than fixing our broken, duplicative requirements under the  National Environmental Policy Act, this package adds more regulation  and bureaucratic red tape. Rather than enhancing opportunities for  long-term water storage infrastructure and offering any type of lasting  solutions for forests and species management, it focuses on adding  environmental studies and prioritizing environmental justice.   Madam Chair, my colleagues and I submitted numerous amendments that  would actually solve these problems--to encourage additional water  storage, active land forest management, commonsense reforms to the  Endangered Species Act, and critically needed domestic energy and  timber development. Unfortunately, Madam Chair, Democrats refused to  even let these amendments be considered for debate.   This bill fails to address the actual problems facing rural  communities and  [[Page H7425]]  will likely exacerbate the very issues Democrats claim the bill  addresses.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this legislation.
