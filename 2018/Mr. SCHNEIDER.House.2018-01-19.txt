 Madam Speaker, we are 111 days into the current budget  year and yet no closer to a budget than we were 4 months ago. We face a  long to-do list, including funding our military, funding the Children's  Health Insurance Program and community health centers, protecting  DREAMers, repealing the medical device tax, supporting disaster relief,  and the list goes on.   We simply can't continue kicking the can down the road with  irresponsible temporary fixes like the ones this House passed last  night. They hamper rather than help our military and other government  agencies by forcing them to function in uncertainty, unable to make key  strategic decisions and investments. This is no way to run our  government.   Three times in the past year I crossed the aisle to vote for these  short-term extensions, but I have seen no willingness to work with  Democrats, no evidence of progress, and no reason to believe we won't  be in the exact same position 1 month from now after yet another CR.   Enough is enough. That is why last night I voted ``no.'' It is not  too late. I urge my Republican colleagues to reach across the aisle and  work with Democrats to find a long-term funding solution that addresses  our country's needs.   Madam Speaker, I am committed and ready to work with my colleagues as  long as it takes to achieve that responsible resolution.                            ____________________
