 Mr. President, it is my great privilege to say a very few  words in introduction of my friend and fellow Senator, Eric Schmitt, as  he prepares to give his maiden speech on this floor.   We haven't worked together very long in the Senate, but we have known  each other for some time, and I just want to say that if you look at  Senator Schmitt's record, the people of Missouri are tremendously  fortunate to have him, and he is already doing tremendous work for  them.   As attorney general, Eric led the way in taking on the Biden  administration and holding them accountable for their abuses of power.  He led the way in taking on Big Tech and holding them accountable for  what they tried to do to our children, what they tried to do to our  elections, and what they tried to do to our speech. And already now in  the U.S. Senate, he is holding the deep state--the administrative  state--accountable, standing up for ordinary, normal, everyday working  Missourians who deserve to have a voice in this Chamber, who deserve to  have a voice in their government. And he has been standing here  fighting for them. I can't wait to continue to have the privilege to  serve with him, and I can't wait to hear his remarks today.   So with that, Mr. President, I yield the floor to the Senator from  Missouri, Eric Schmitt.
