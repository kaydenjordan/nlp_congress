 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for  yielding me the time. It is true, the wasteful spending, the tax hikes,  and the excessive regulations of the Biden administration are crushing  working families and small businesses across this country.   In particular, I rise tonight in support of the House Joint  Resolution to denounce Biden's overly ambitious rule proposed for  changing the definition of the waters of the United States, also known  as WOTUS.   You know, agriculture is the number one industry in Virginia, and the  Sixth District is proud to be home to more than 8,000 farms.   Narrowly defined water regulation is key to ensure that Virginia's  agriculture industry can succeed and local industries can thrive.  Unfortunately, the disastrous EPA is working to regulate every pond and  every puddle, every stream and small creek with their new WOTUS  regulation.   This new rule is going to negatively impact the vital goods and  services that farmers, ranchers, and small businesses provide to the  Commonwealth and across the Nation.   I have heard from farmers and property owners up and down my  district. One thing is clear: They do not want to be told how to use  and regulate their land by Joe Biden's radical EPA.   Imposing this overly broad and burdensome regulation will grant  Biden's bureaucrats more arbitrary control over our rural communities,  saddling folks with costly red tape.   It is far past time that we rescind the administration's new WOTUS  ruling and protect America's farmers from this gross overreach of  government power.   I thank the gentleman again for organizing this evening's Special  Order.
