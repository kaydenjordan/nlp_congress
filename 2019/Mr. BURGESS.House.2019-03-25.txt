 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to speak today in support of H.R. 1839, the  Medicaid Services Investment and Accountability Act of 2019.   This is a bipartisan Medicaid extenders package that moves forward  House priorities with responsible offsets. In fact, this package  actually saves the Federal Government $1 million.   H.R. 1839 includes a new program to improve access to healthcare from  medically complex children and reauthorizes important and effective  programs that benefit Americans each and every day.                                time  1730    Money Follows the Person is an important program for the State of  Texas. This Medicaid demonstration, which was established in 2005, has  enabled eligible individuals in States across our Nation to receive  long-term care services in their homes or other community settings,  rather than an institution such as a nursing home.   While I am disappointed that H.R. 1839 includes only $20 million to  extend this critical program through September instead of through the  end of calendar year 2019, I am pleased that the funding for Money  Follows the Person was ultimately included in this package.   This bill also includes an extension through September of the  protection for Medicaid recipients of home and community-based services  against spousal impoverishment program. This program specifically  protects married individuals requiring Medicaid-covered and long-term  services and supports to ensure that they do not have to deplete their  financial resources or bankrupt themselves in order to become or remain  Medicaid-eligible to receive such services. Our seniors are among our  most vulnerable citizens, and it is programs such as this that will  help protect them from financial ruin.   According to the National Institute of Mental Health, nearly one in  five United States adults lives with a mental illness. Programs  established to help individuals who are struggling with mental health  issues, including the Excellence in Mental Health program, enable  States to implement community behavioral health centers to address the  needs of their populations. H.R. 1839 extends the Excellence in Mental  Health program funding for Oregon and Oklahoma so that they will be on  the same financial cycle as other States that are participating in the  program.   The ACE Kids Act, which will improve care for children with complex  medical needs, is also included in this package. The goal of this  legislation is to improve comprehensive care for medically complex  children through a State option to create a Medicaid health home  specific to children. Health homes have proven effective in improving  care coordination in the adult Medicaid population and hold promise for  complex pediatric patients.   However, I want to clarify that this legislation is not intended to  limit families or their physicians from selecting the provider of  choice for medical services. There is nothing in this legislation that  restricts the child's family or their physician from deciding who is  best qualified as a Medicare provider. The Centers for Medicare and  Medicaid Services has provided assurances that current freedom of  choice rules will apply to new care coordination activity.   As a physician, I know that many children with chronic illnesses have  a strong relationship with their physician and with other providers. I  want to make certain that this new law will help families coordinate  their care without affecting the relationship that families have with  their current doctor or other medical care provider or other providers  in their communities from whom they may wish to receive care.   This package contains must-pass provisions that will improve access  for Medicaid beneficiaries, which is a laudable and important goal. Not  only are these provisions imperative, but they are responsibly offset.  In fact, this package saves money.   I would particularly like to thank the Energy and Commerce Committee  staff, in particular J.P. Paluskiewicz and Caleb Graff, who have spent  a significant amount of their lives negotiating this package to get it  to the floor.   I support this legislation, and I urge other Members to continue to  support this and get the other body to take it up and pass it as well.  [[Page H2778]]    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden), who is the Republican leader of the  Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Upton), who is the former chairman of the Energy and  Commerce Committee and the author of the Cures for the 21st Century  bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie), a valuable member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee and the Republican leader of the Oversight and Investigations  Subcommittee.  [[Page H2780]]         Mr. Speaker, this is an important bill, and I urge all  Members to support it.   Once again, I want to single out and thank J.P. Paluskiewicz and  Caleb Graff for really moving heaven and earth to get this to the floor  so that these valuable programs do not lapse.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the Congressional Motorcycle  [[Page H2786]]  Caucus, I am committed to advocating for riders both on and off the  road.   This week, Congressman Tim Walberg and I will reintroduce a  resolution highlighting motorcycle profiling. This resolution  recognizes motorcyclists' importance to their communities and promotes  collaboration between motorcyclists and law enforcement.   We introduced this resolution in a previous Congress, and its Senate  companion was passed in December of last year.   Mr. Speaker, more than 27 million Americans are estimated to operate  a motorcycle, annually, representing 9 percent of the population, yet  motorcyclists account for a significant portion of road accidents and  road injuries. That is why I co-chair the Congressional Motorcycle  Caucus: to support riders through education and awareness.   Together, we can make travel safer for all motorists in general and  motorcyclists in particular. This first week of spring, I look forward  to continued engagement on motorcycle safety and awareness.   Remember: Share the road.                            ____________________
