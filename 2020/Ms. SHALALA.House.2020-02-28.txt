 Madam Speaker, I would like to submit for the Record a  letter from the leading voice of African American physicians, Dr. Louis  Sullivan, in support of the legislation.   Dr. Sullivan was my predecessor at HHS. He served as Secretary from  1989 to 1993 under President Bush and is the president emeritus of  Morehouse School of Medicine.                                          Louis W. Sullivan, MD,                                     Atlanta, GA, February 26, 2020.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Pallone: I write to you today to express my       strong support for H.R. 2339, Reversing the Youth Tobacco       Epidemic, and I urge its passage by the House of       Representatives.        There is an urgent need for action to protect the health of       Americans--including the health of our young minority       citizens--from the adverse health consequences of tobacco,       including menthol-flavored cigarettes. For too many years,       the tobacco industry has used menthol cigarettes--and now       flavored cigars--to prey on minority youth and addict them to       deadly tobacco products.        In 2011, the Food and Drug Administration's Tobacco       Products Scientific Advisory Committee found that removing       menthol cigarettes from the marketplace ``would benefit       public health in the United States.'' It concluded that       menthol cigarettes have been disproportionately targeted at       African Americans and have been disproportionately smoked by       African Americans. Yet, the Food and Drug Administration       failed to act to remove these products from the marketplace.        A number of localities prohibit the sale of all flavored       products, including menthol cigarettes. Local action is       important but local policies will not protect millions of       African Americans: Congress must remove all flavored products       from store shelves in order to protect minority populations.       A nationwide policy will also help end inconsistent       enforcement.        Removing all flavored tobacco products, including menthol       cigarettes will save lives--especially the lives of our       minority citizens. I urge you and the House to move forward       with removing all flavored tobacco products, including       menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars.            Sincerely yours,      Louis W. Sullivan, MD,        President Emeritus, Morehouse School of Medicine, U.S.       Secretary of Health and Human Services, 1989-1993.                                time  1100    Madam Speaker, as our Nation anticipates the probability of a  pandemic, here today in this House, the people's House, we have the  opportunity to save millions of young lives that would be cut short by  nicotine if we fail to act.   I am not exaggerating. The CDC predicted that, if the children of our  country continue to use tobacco products at the current rate, 5.6  million will have premature deaths.   This is a test of our courage. Let's look at the facts.   In 1997, 24.6 percent of all 12th graders reported daily use of  cigarettes. Thanks to smart, tough policies and a national commitment  to reducing cigarette use, those numbers dropped to 3.6 percent by  2018.   Nearly 90 percent of adult smokers began smoking before the age of  18. If you don't start smoking as a child, it is very unlikely you will  smoke as an adult. This isn't a secret. Public health officials know  this, and tobacco companies know this, too. They also know nicotine is  a highly addictive substance.   This dramatic reduction in cigarette use by children put tobacco  companies in a bind. If children and teenagers have stopped using  cigarettes and 90 percent of all adult smokers began smoking as  children, how can they maintain a pipeline of customers?   Their answer arrived in the form of a new technology: e-cigarettes  and vaping products. Companies knew that the pipeline of lifetime  smokers was dwindling, so they started to market new vaping products to  young people.    They started marketing new vaping products to young  people through Instagram ads and influencers and other social media  platforms. They handed out free vaping products. They clearly targeted  our children, and the strategy worked.   It is time to ensure that our children do not face a lifetime of  nicotine addiction. It is time to finally pass a bill that protects  their health, and that is what this bill does. I strongly support it.
