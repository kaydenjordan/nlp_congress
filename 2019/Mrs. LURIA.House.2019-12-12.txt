 Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment to H.R. 3, the Elijah E.  Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act of 2019. My amendment would ensure  that Federal employees benefit from the same contracting practices as  stated in the fair price negotiation program established by the  underlying bill.   Close to 30,000 of our constituents in Virginia's Second  Congressional District are Federal employees, and they should all be  able to benefit from this monumental legislation to lower prescription  drug costs.   Making healthcare more affordable is among my top priorities in  Congress. As the costs of prescription drugs seem to skyrocket, I know  I must do everything I can to ease that burden on coastal Virginians.  Nobody should need to choose between lifesaving medications or  bankruptcy.   A vote in favor of this amendment is one to support broader access to  affordable prescription drugs. I urge all of my colleagues to support  my amendment and the underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I stand here today in strong support of H.R. 3, in opposition to my  colleague.   If, in fact, we are going to offer lower prescription drug costs to  those covered by Medicare and private insurance, it is the least that  we can do to include our Federal employees in these cost-saving  benefits.   Federal employees live in nearly every district in this country, and  we must ensure that they, too, can benefit  [[Page H10216]]  from lower drug prices secured by this landmark legislation.   I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, as well as the  underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
