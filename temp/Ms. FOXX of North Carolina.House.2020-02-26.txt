 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize National  Future Farmers of America Week. Without question, the hardworking men  and women in the field of agriculture serve as the backbone of our  Nation.   Since its founding in 1917, the Future Farmers of America has  prepared the next generation of chemists, veterinarians, entrepreneurs,  and premier agriculture professionals. These individuals will go on to  solve the world's challenge of providing resources to growing  populations.   In North Carolina, the Future Farmers of America continues to grow.  Last year, it had over 20,000 members, and its 321 chapters contributed  more than 1 million service hours across the State. When you see these  young people in their dark blue jackets with the gold trim, you are  seeing leaders and patriots.   By learning to do, doing to learn, earning to live, and living to  serve, the Future Farmers of America ensure that our Nation's  agricultural future remains bright.   Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I did not address imprudent  comments about our Nation's farmers that were recently brought to  light. At an Oxford University event in 2016, Michael Bloomberg offered  commentary that was truly unsettling. He said: ``I could teach anybody,  even people in this room, to be a farmer. It's a process. You dig a  hole; you put a seed in; you put dirt on top, add water, and up comes  the corn.''   When you write off America's farmers, you write off the lifeblood of  our country. To show you the impact of our farmers, we will look at the  facts in just a moment.   Contrary to the idea, as Michael Bloomberg said, that farming is so  simple, the truth is that farmers must be among the most intelligent,  innovative, and creative people in the world. They face challenges  every day that threaten their survival.   Now, let's look at the facts:   Annually, one U.S. farm will feed 166 people in the U.S. and abroad;   In 2018, $139 billion of American agricultural products were exported  around the world;   Ninety-eight percent of U.S. farms are operated by hardworking  families; and   About 11 percent of U.S. farmers are serving or have served in the  military, compared to only 2 percent of the general public, showing  that American farmers are very patriotic.   These facts speak for themselves. The work of American farmers goes  far beyond Michael Bloomberg's claim of simply digging holes, planting  seeds, and adding water.   I am proud to represent over 7,000 farms and over 11,000 agricultural  producers in the Fifth District of North Carolina. Collectively, they  generate over $1 billion every year and represent almost 10 percent of  North Carolina's agriculture sales.   Recently, Alleghany County honored some of its farmers, young and  old, and to hear of their efforts and dedication would inspire anyone.  I commend and thank our farmers and our future agricultural leaders for  their unwavering commitment to our families, communities, and to our  country.                            ____________________
