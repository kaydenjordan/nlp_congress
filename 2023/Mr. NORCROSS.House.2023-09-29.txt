 Mr. Speaker, it is my honor today to welcome guest  chaplain, Head Granthi Giani Jaswinder Singh, who made history today as  the first Sikh to serve as guest chaplain in the United States House of  Representatives.   Giani Singh proudly serves the people of South Jersey at the Gurdwara  in Pine Hill in my district. His spiritual leadership has helped foster  a vibrant Sikh community.   The history made today by Giani Singh is a reminder that the United  States welcomes and values all and will remain committed to free  expression of religion.   Giani Singh has made South Jersey proud today, and it is an honor to  be a part of this moment with him. I thank him for leading the prayer  and for the work he does in our community each and every day.                            ____________________
