 Mr. President, it is safe to say the national  spectacle the professional left has created around Judge Brett  Kavanaugh's confirmation process has now reached some kind of fever  pitch in the 17 days since Dr. Ford's confidential correspondence was  leaked to the press--17 days of a feeding frenzy on Judge Kavanaugh and  his family, unlike anything we have seen in recent memory.   Since then, a literal mudslide of wild, uncorroborated accusations  has literally poured out--each more outlandish than the last. This  mudslide has been actively embraced, urged on, and capitalized upon by  the Democrats inside this Chamber and by the organized far-left special  interests outside. It hasn't been about getting to the truth or giving  anyone a fair hearing; it has only been about one thing--the far left's  hunger to bring down Judge Kavanaugh's nomination by any means  necessary.   If facts and evidence couldn't get the job done, then intimidation  tactics and bullying would have to do. Sometimes this intimidation  campaign has been aimed at the nominee. Colleagues, including my friend  the Democratic leader, have tried to get Judge Kavanaugh to withdraw  from this process because of these uncorroborated and sometimes  absolutely ridiculous allegations.   When that didn't work, then the far left tried to bully and  intimidate Members of this body--Republican U.S. Senators. They tried  to bully and intimidate us. One of our colleagues and his family were  effectively run out of a restaurant by these people in recent days.  Another reported having protesters physically block his car door, and  some have seen organized far-left protesters camp out at their homes.   I am not suggesting we are the victims here, but I want to make it  clear to these people who are chasing my Members around the hall here  or harassing them at the airports or going to their homes: We will not  be intimidated by these people. There is no chance in the world they  are going to scare us out of doing our duty. I do not care how many  Members they chase or how many people they harass here in the halls. I  want to make one thing perfectly clear: We will not be intimidated by  these people. This is all part of the organized effort to delay,  obstruct, and intimidate those of us who will be voting this week.   A few days ago, I did something I rarely do: I offered a prediction.  I predicted that here in the last few days before the Senate is to vote  on Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation, the Democratic conference would  continue to make good on its leader's promise and fight this nomination  with everything it has got. I predicted that, on a dime,  [[Page S6456]]  the very supplemental background investigation for which my Democratic  friends had clamored would suddenly become insufficient and that no  matter what accommodations would be made, no matter what agreements  would be reached, the Senate Democrats would find more excuses to  continue moving the goalposts one more time.   Granted, this was not exactly a radical prediction. This body and  this Nation have spent months watching their friends across the aisle  grasp at every imaginable excuse to delay this process and damage this  nominee. So I felt pretty safe in saying the last goalposts would soon  be on the move yet again, but even I was not sure it would happen this  quickly.   Let's start with the Democratic leader and the ranking member of the  Judiciary Committee. In a letter released on September 23, they  suggested that the FBI had ample time to conduct a supplemental  investigation before the hearing that was scheduled just 4 days later.  They insisted an inquiry would ``not take a `tremendous amount of  time.' '' The Democratic leader brushed aside the notion that this--the  seventh background investigation of Judge Kavanaugh--would delay the  process, saying, ``It will only take a few days.'' Well, that was, of  course, before we agreed last Friday to delay the proceedings by no  more than 1 week to accommodate just such an inquiry.   Naturally, we are now hearing a different tune. Yesterday, the  ranking member stated her view that voting this Friday on Judge  Kavanaugh's nomination as planned would be ``too soon.'' There go those  goalposts again, moving right on down. In that same letter, the  Democratic leader and the senior Senator from California called for the  supplemental investigation because ``conducting background  investigations on nominees has long been the FBI's standard practice.''  Here is what ``standard practice'' means: The FBI conducts interviews,  prepares a careful report, and makes it available for Senators to  review. ``Standard practice'' does not mean what the Democratic leader  decided to demand for the first time yesterday now that the FBI is  concluding its review. You get the picture.   As it concludes the review, it is not enough. We are to have yet  another delay so FBI agents are made to appear--listen to this--for in- person briefings and so that Democrats can cross-examine the agents to  see if they are satisfied with how they did their jobs. Is anybody  surprised about this? There go those goalposts again.   Well, guess what. Our Democratic colleagues have made it abundantly  clear they will never ever be satisfied, not ever. Does anyone really  think the same people who said any nominee of this President would  result ``in the destruction of the Constitution'' will be satisfied?  Does anyone really think the same people who called Judge Kavanaugh  ``evil'' long before they heard one word of testimony from anyone will  be satisfied? Does anyone really think the same people who said their  goal was to delay this nomination past the election will be satisfied?  To ask the question is to answer it. If my friends across the aisle  were to have their way, the goalposts on Judge Kavanaugh's nomination  would be in another time zone by now.   Our Democratic colleagues are quickly running out of material. One of  their last efforts seems to be the new argument--notwithstanding  whether these allegations can be corroborated in any way--that the real  crime here is that Judge Kavanaugh stood up for his family and took  umbrage at this disgraceful spectacle. He is now expected to witness  this disgraceful spectacle and not get upset about it.   I would ask any of my colleagues: How would you feel if your entire  reputation had been destroyed in this mudslide? Would you be calm about  it?   For weeks now, a national media feeding frenzy has literally dragged  Judge Kavanaugh and his family through the mud. He has been subjected  to the most vile and disgusting accusations. His wife has been  threatened and his young daughters traumatized.   In many instances, my Democratic colleagues have ushered on these  absurdly disgusting accusations and tried to give them a veneer of  credibility, specifically citing them now as a reason why Judge  Kavanaugh should not be confirmed. Our Democratic colleagues are  enabling this mudslide and encouraging it. Now the same Democratic  Senators have the temerity to say Judge Kavanaugh disqualified himself  for the Supreme Court because he got a little testy at the hearing  after they drug him through the mud--because he told them how much  damage these accusations had caused him and his family.   Let's get one thing straight right now: I don't want to meet the man  or woman who wouldn't be frustrated and angry by a coordinated strategy  to destroy his or her good name on the altar of partisan politics.   The Senate has received an incredible volume of testimony about Judge  Kavanaugh's exemplary judicial temperament. We have heard from faculty  of his alma mater, who called him ``a fair-minded jurist who believes  in the rule of law'' and ``commands wide and deep respect'' among his  legal peers, and from his former law clerks who say: ``He listens  carefully to the views of his colleagues and clerks, even--indeed,  especially--when they differ from his own.'' Yet some still prioritize  partisan point-scoring ahead of Judge Kavanaugh's actual record.    We have heard overwhelming testimony that Judge Kavanaugh's time on  the Federal bench has been defined by equanimity, even-handedness, and  fair treatment of all parties.   It is time to put this embarrassing spectacle behind us. The American  people are sick of the display that has been put on here in the U.S.  Senate in the guise of a confirmation process.   The FBI is finishing up a supplemental background investigation. It  will soon add this information to Judge Kavanaugh's file for Senators'  consideration. This is the standard practice. Then, pursuant to last  week's agreement of a delay no longer than 1 week, the Senate will vote  on this nomination this week. The Senate will vote on this nomination  this week.   When we do, we will be voting on one of the most impressive and most  stunningly qualified Supreme Court nominees in our Nation's history. We  will be voting to confirm a new Supreme Court Justice who possesses  sterling academic credentials, widely acknowledged legal brilliance, an  exemplary legal temperament, and a proven commitment to complete  fairness on the bench. That is what the Senate will do this week.                            ____________________     Now, on a completely different matter, Mr. President,  the Senate is also attending to other matters of critical, nationwide  importance this week.   Today, we will pass a fulsome reauthorization for the critical  functions of the Federal Aviation Administration. We will also take up  and pass landmark opioids legislation. It is set to deliver major  relief to American communities that have been decimated by the scourge  of substance abuse and addiction.   Every one of our colleagues represents families who have grappled  with the loss of livelihoods and loved ones at the hands of this  crisis, and nearly every one of them has contributed provisions to make  this a truly comprehensive response.   The legislation before us is the collaborative product of  contributions from 70-plus Members of this body. Five different  committees had a say. The result is a landmark package that will  deliver critical resources to establish opioid-specific recovery  centers and equip local medical practitioners. It will help law  enforcement to stop the flow of opioids across borders and increase  safeguards against overprescription.   I hope each of my colleagues will join me in voting to pass this  landmark legislation. I hope they will join me in getting more  assistance, more tools, and more training in the hands of first  responders.   There will be more access to housing and work opportunities for those  in recovery, thanks to my CAREER Act--which, I am proud to say, is  included in this legislation--and more resources for State, local, and  community leaders as they stand up treatment and recovery programs.   With today's vote, the Senate will say this to every American  affected by  [[Page S6457]]  the opioid epidemic: America is fighting back against this crisis. More  help is on the way.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following  disposition of the House message to accompany H.R. 302, the majority  leader or his designee be recognized to make a motion to concur in the  House message to accompany H.R. 6, and that notwithstanding the  previous order in relation to H.R. 6, the Senate vote on the motion to  concur without further intervening action or debate at 3:15 p.m. today,  all as in legislative session.    Mr. President, this evening, the Senate will receive  the results of the FBI supplemental background investigation of Judge  Brett Kavanaugh.   This is now the seventh time the FBI has looked into Judge  Kavanaugh's background, and this information comes on top of what has  already been one of the most thorough and exhaustive Senate reviews of  any Supreme Court nominee in the entire history of our country: Five  days of public hearings, 65 private meetings with Senators, more than  1,200 responses to written questions from Members, more than 500,000  pages of documents were reviewed--the most produced for any Supreme  Court nomination in our history--and the 300-plus opinions Judge  Kavanaugh has issued during his 12 years on the DC Circuit.   And now, Senators will have the evidence collected by this additional  background investigation for their consideration as well.   Members will have the opportunity to review investigators' records,  and as is the standard procedure, designated Judiciary Committee staff  members with the required clearances will be authorized to brief  Members.   There will be plenty of time for Members to review and be briefed on  the supplemental material before a Friday cloture vote. So I am filing  cloture on Judge Kavanaugh's nomination this evening so the process can  move forward, as I indicated earlier this week.    Mr. President, what is the pending business?    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk for  the Kavanaugh nomination.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 11 a.m.,  Thursday, October 4; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; finally, that following  leader remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session to resume  consideration of the Kavanaugh nomination.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 9:55 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, October 4, 2018, at 11 a.m.
