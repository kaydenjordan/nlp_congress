 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 4302, the Homeless Assistance Act.   Madam Speaker, homelessness is a very real problem across this  country. In fact, more than half a million individuals are homeless on  any given night in America.   From cities like my own of Little Rock, Arkansas, to big metropolitan  areas like Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco, State and local  governments have been unable to address this devastating human crisis  fully.   Last year, the committee held several hearings on homelessness.  Throughout our hearings, the committee explored some of the root causes  of homelessness, including restrictive local zoning policies, the harsh  and punitive treatment of individuals who have no other place to turn,  and the counterproductive Federal mandates on shelter providers that  will close, not open, doors to people who are truly in need.   The bill we have before us today, H.R. 4302, is designed to help  prevent high-risk, vulnerable populations from ever becoming homeless.   The bill allows local public housing agencies to share data and  coordinate with other State and local government agencies and their  local partnering service providers.   Madam Speaker, I enjoyed working with the majority on this, and I  thank my friends for helping protect that private data. The personally  identifiable information was of concern to the minority, and I am  grateful for the majority helping improve this bill to protect that  private data of these Americans struggling with homelessness.   But by sharing this data, these entities can help target and deliver  supportive services to these vulnerable populations before they are  displaced from their current housing situation. Sharing this data will,  we hope, help localities better coordinate to prevent problems before  they occur and keep more individuals in stable housing environments and  off our streets.   Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from California, Mr. Sherman, the  sponsor of this legislation, for his work in this area. I thank the  chairwoman of the full committee, who has prioritized fighting  homelessness since she was elected to Congress. I thank my friend from  Guam for managing the time on this important bill.   Madam Speaker, I recommend that my colleagues support H.R. 4302, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 4335, the 8-K Trading Gap Act of 2019.   Madam Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentlewoman from New York,  Congresswoman Maloney, and her staff for her efforts on this bill and  for working with Republicans to make this a bipartisan bill.   Madam Speaker, we all agree that fraud and abuse, such as illegal  insider trading, have no place in our financial system. Bad actors  damage the integrity, efficiency, and effectiveness of our markets,  which in turn hurts everyday investors.                                time  1700    When significant corporation events occur, such as the appointment of  a new chief financial officer, public companies must disclose these  events to shareholders and to the public on form 8-K. This form must be  filed within 4 business days of that significant event.   It is reasonable to believe that company insiders may have knowledge  of the event or material, nonpublic information days before that same  information is disclosed to the general public and shareholders.   Most companies and their executives strive to operate within the law.  Trading within that period is clearly illegal. However, there is no SEC  rule that explicitly prohibits insiders from buying or selling company  stock during  [[Page H189]]  this 4-business-day gap, which starts at the time the event occurred  and ends with the filing of form 8-K in which information about the  event is then disclosed to the public.   Simply put, that is what this measure does. The bill before us today  prohibits executive insiders from profitably trading in their company's  stock while in possession of material, nonpublic information stemming  from a yet-to-be-disclosed event.   At the same time, the bill also provides appropriately tailored  exemptions for companies not intended to be covered by the bill, such  as registered funds or business development corporations.   In addition, the bill provides flexibility to companies by allowing  for announcements via press releases while not requiring the immediate  filing of form 8-K.   Again, I thank our chair of the Oversight and Reform Committee, a  former loyal and longstanding member of the House Committee on  Financial Services, and her staff for her diligent efforts in working  across the aisle to draft and design this bipartisan bill that strikes  the right balance of strengthening our securities laws while tailoring  the bill to minimize unintended and unnecessary application.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting  this well-balanced piece of legislation, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close. I urge  my colleagues to support Mrs. Maloney's good work. I thank my friend  from Guam for his leadership, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, first of all, happy new year to our chairwoman of the  full committee. I am glad to see the gentlewoman on the floor today on  this good set of bills that she has worked hard to produce, a  bipartisan solution to so many important topics.   I rise in support of H.R. 4841 today, and I thank the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Phillips) and the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Loudermilk) for offering this legislation.   If there is one key point that the Republicans and Democrats can  agree on in the post-2008 crisis, it is that increased dialogue and  transparency on safety and soundness of institutions, and monitoring  emerging risks and potential threats to financial stability, can better  promote understanding of the most concerning issues facing our American  financial system, the broader economy, and how to make sure that  America can keep its leadership in the world in competitive financial  services. Certainly, an active Financial Stability Oversight Council is  an example of that, and this measure, H.R. 4841, is a key tool as well.   It will require Federal financial regulators to appear at least  annually before the House Financial Services Committee and the Senate  Banking Committee to provide testimony on their oversight of financial  institutions, including regulatory, supervisory, and enforcement  activities.   Under this bill, the regulators will also be required to produce  semiannual reports to Congress on these efforts.   Although the Federal Reserve Chairman, the Federal Reserve Vice  Chairman for Supervision, and the Director of the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau are required to testify before Congress semiannually,  similar requirements do not exist for the Comptroller of the Currency,  the Chair of  [[Page H191]]  the FDIC, or the Chair of the National Credit Union Administration.   Last year, the principals from the prudential regulatory agencies,  the OCC, the FDIC, and National Credit Union Administration, willingly  and happily testified alongside the Federal Reserve Vice Chair for  Supervision during his statutorily required appearance.   Committee Republicans recognize that it is good practice to have open  and regular conversations with our prudential regulators on topics  concerning the integrity of the U.S. and global financial systems. This  practice is important, regardless of which party is in power.   Merger and acquisition trends, BSA/AML exams, fintech, Bank Secrecy  Act, anti-money-laundering exams and trends, the use of financial  technology, cyber threats and planning for cyber protection and  compliance issues, generally, all of these are important topics.   I thank the gentleman from Minnesota for working in a bipartisan way  to address some modest concerns the Republicans had with the initial  draft. We were able to make simple changes that clarify the parameters  for the release of information by Federal banking regulators.    This result is a bill focused on good government and increased  transparency. I thank the gentleman from Minnesota and his colleague,  Mr. Loudermilk from Georgia. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4841,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Gonzalez), my good friend who supports this  legislation.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   I want to urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4841. It is an excellent  piece of bipartisan work that certainly speaks to the heart of Article  I power, which is oversight over the executive. I congratulate Mr.  Phillips and Mr. Loudermilk for their work.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise in support in H.R. 5315, the Expanding Opportunity for  Minority Depository Institutions Act.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty) for  offering this bill and for working to keep important institutions  having access to the capital they need to support the communities that  rely on them.   H.R. 5315 would codify the U.S. Treasury Department's Financial Agent  Mentor-Protege Program into law.   Minority-owned depository institutions play a vital role in our  communities across America. The significant decline in the number of  banks and credit unions since the financial crisis is concerning.   MDIs have a substantial impact on consumers and communities, in  particular, those small businesses and families that reside in low- and  moderate-income census tracts that depend on services, often from MDIs  in order to prosper.   MDIs are essential to promoting and expanding greater access to  financial services in low- and moderate-income communities. As the  number of minority depository institutions continues to decline,  Congress should act to preserve these vital institutions.   In a hearing earlier this year, the Financial Services Committee  heard directly from a number of MDIs that post-crisis regulations have  taken a serious financial toll on their ability to compete and provide  low-cost services, thus, making it harder for them to survive.   In this instance, MDIs have that in common with many, many community  bank organizations across the country. Compliance costs have risen  since the crisis; and the smaller the institution, the higher the  burden of those costs.   So what better way to try to overcome that than to try to create a  mentorship program to provide the talent and extra resources necessary  to cope with raising capital, having expertise, developing human  resources, and developing alternative compliance procedures that will  allow MDIs to thrive?   The Financial Agent Mentor-Protege Program has a proven track record  of success in doing just this. Codifying the Financial Agent Mentor- Protege Program into law signals Congress' intent to promote the  program and increase mentor participation, potentially expanding the  number of MDIs participating in the program.   Committee Republicans support free-market solutions. The Financial  Agent Mentor-Protege Program can encourage stronger partnerships  between larger institutions and the financial sector with their  minority depository institution partners, thereby benefiting more  households and more consumers across our country.   Madam Speaker, I would once again like to thank the gentlewoman from  Ohio for her work on this bill and urge all my colleagues to support  H.R. 5315.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume to close.   Madam Speaker, again, I want to thank my friend from Ohio for her  work on this bill, for calling attention to it and for suggesting that  it is a great sense of partnership to have technical compliance and  technical assistance that is available in so many of our larger  institutions, those certainly $50 billion and up, and how they can help  mentor a minority depository institution and try to create a better  working environment for them to serve their communities and serve their  households that are important in each of their towns and communities  across this country.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5315, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2398. I want to thank my  friend, Mr. Peters from California, for his work on this legislation  and my colleague on the House Financial Services Committee, Mr. Stivers  of Ohio. We love working together to benefit our veterans in the  Veterans' Affairs Committee and the House Financial Services Committee.   As our chairwoman simply said, Congress should not rest until every  homeless veteran has a roof over his or her head. Despite all of our  efforts and all the leadership we have contributed for 3 decades, it is  still shocking to hear Ms. Waters say that 37,000 veterans are reported  homeless on any given night in our country.   The idea of partnership between the Department of Housing and Urban  Development and the Department of Veterans Affairs dates back to the  1990s. It was a pleasure to serve then for President George H. W. Bush  and to work with Secretary Jack Kemp at HUD when the partnership was  envisioned. Jack Kemp of New York and of Vice Presidential candidate  fame was a strong Member of this House and someone who worked hard for  communities all over this country, particularly for communities that  are struggling to make sure they have access to a better future. Jack  Kemp demonstrated a lot of leadership in outlining this partnership  between the VA and HUD for housing vouchers dedicated to homeless  veterans.   We combined that with the VA case management services to provide  healthcare, mental health treatment, substance abuse counseling, job  placement, and more. We know this works. This is why so many of us  speak out so passionately about shared services and comprehensive case  management for our homeless. We know that all of that is important for  them to have a better future.   I work with the Veterans' Affairs homeless coordinator in Little  Rock, Arkansas, on a regular basis, Estella Morris, and I have seen her  work so successfully within this program to benefit constituents in my  hometown of Little Rock.   This partnership on a national basis has proven to be very successful  in all the States of our land, awarding almost 100,000 vouchers over  the past 10 years to those who have honorably served their country.  H.R. 2398 would build on that success by requiring annual reporting  from the VA to disclose demographic information and how  [[Page H195]]  these vouchers are distributed. With several communities around the  country having made great strides to effectively end veteran  homelessness, it is crucial that we use this information to better  target the HUD-VASH voucher program in those communities that need them  the most.   The bill would also expand the eligibility for the program, as  Chairwoman Waters described, to veterans who were discharged other than  honorably, helping that vulnerable population have access to this  crucial resource.   Since 2010, the number of homeless veterans has been cut in half.  This Congress has made it a priority and the Obama administration and  the Trump administration have made this a priority. These are positive  signs, but there is more to do and this bill will help achieve the goal  of ending veterans' homelessness.   I, again, would like to thank Mr. Stivers, the ranking member of the  Housing, Community Development and Insurance Subcommittee in the House  and a cosponsor of the bill for his leadership on the issue and in  working with Mr. Peters.    Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, this is a good bill. This is a  bill that will help move more people to shelter, particularly our  veterans, who are so in need.   When I think about Jack Kemp and his inspiration for this so many  years ago, he frequently quoted Theodore Roosevelt's great quote, which  was: ``Nobody cares how much you know, until they know how much you  care.''   Certainly, that is apropos here because Mr. Peters and the Committee  on Veterans' Affairs and the members, both Republicans and Democrats,  on the House Financial Services Committee care about solving this  crisis. We care about working with our local partners to make our  communities a better place.   Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Stivers for his work and my friend Mr.  Peters. I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend, the ranking  member of the House Financial Services Committee, for yielding to me.   I, too, rise and thank John Cornyn, the Senator from Texas, and my  good friend, small business man, auto dealer from Dallas, Texas, Roger  Williams, for his leadership on this commemoration.   What a treat to be here on the House floor and honor George and  Barbara Bush right where he served as a member of the House Ways and  Means Committee some 50-plus years ago.   He loved the House. He loved an Arkansan named John Paul  Hammerschmidt, a longtime member of the House Transportation Committee.  They were best friends. They were freshmen together.   He always spoke fondly of this House, and it served him well when he  was Vice President, served him well when he was President of the United  States.   My wife, Martha, and I think about one thing when we think about  George and Barbara Bush, whom we had the pleasure to know for over 40  years and work for for 4 years.   When you are at school with your kids or filling out a form, there is  a line that says, ``in case of emergency,'' and there is a blank, and  you are supposed to put a friend's name, a neighbor's name, a  colleague's name. Madam Speaker, when we think of George and Barbara  Bush, we think of that form.                                time  1815    In case of an emergency, call George Bush, call Barbara Bush. Because  that  [[Page H200]]  is what they were. They were neighbors. In their soul, as the ranking  member from North Carolina said, service was at the heart, whether it  is pushing the cart across the Randalls' parking lot in Houston,  serving cookies sitting on the floor of the vice president's mansion  here in Washington, D.C., welcoming foreign leaders at the diplomatic  entrance of the White House, service was at the heart. Being a neighbor  was at the heart. That was George and Barbara Bush.   You think about our kids and their striving for who to look up to,  who to have as a hero on the sports field, on the hospital board of  directors, on the city council, in this House, serving the people of  America. Who do you think of? George and Barbara Bush.   America, buy these $1 coins, hand them out to young people and say,  if you are looking for a hero, you are looking for George Bush. Look no  further than Barbara Bush. What the Bushes did pre-Presidency, in the  Presidency, in the limelight for this country was lead and demonstrate  service from the heart.   I can tell you a million stories about what a decent person George  Bush was and what a wonderful woman, biting, bossy, fabulous mom,  grandmother, and First Lady Barbara Bush was. Don't ever be caught  chewing gum around her because you will swallow it. She was tough. She  set high standards. Her children were held to those high standards. And  she has lifted our whole country up to high standards by being an  outstanding First Lady.   Tonight on this House floor it is an honor to be here and honor the  memory of George and Barbara Bush by unanimously in this House  supporting John Cornyn and Roger Williams' good bill to have the United  States Treasury mint a coin to someone we look up to, we remember with  reverence, we are grateful for, grateful for their service to this  country.   From being fished out of the Pacific Ocean onto the fish back all the  way to the White House, what a story.   As Chairwoman Waters said, even better was the story after the  Presidency. George Bush shaving his head in symbolism, support and  solidarity with the kids at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.  George Bush wearing that goofy smile with his goofy socks to bring out  heart and reverence for the good work of MD Anderson. Barbara Bush, for  something that plagues every community in this country, every age in  this country, the lack of literacy. How can you be a successful  American and not be literate? And Barbara Bush from day one said, this  is a fight I am in. And she fought for literacy for adults and for kids  all over this country and had fun doing it. Her daughter-in-law, Laura  Bush, our First Lady also, has carried that mantle forward.   Thank you, Madam Speaker, for this opportunity to be on the floor to  pay tribute again to Mr. and Mrs. Bush for their leadership in this  country. I thank the Members of this House that come together on both  sides of the aisle and recognize a leader when they see one. I  appreciate the ranking member from North Carolina for the time. I am  going to vote ``yes.''
