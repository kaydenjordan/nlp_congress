 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the  perseverance, strength, and compassion of my constituent, Hannah  Howard.   Hannah is a Gordonsville resident, Orange County High School senior,  and Blue Ridge Virtual Governor's School student.   On May 8, 2019, Hannah lost her older brother, Devon, to a heroin  overdose. In the 9 months since Devon's death, Hannah has shown  tremendous courage by studying addiction and educating her peers.   As part of her senior project, Hannah interned at a rehabilitation  facility where she learned about the recovery process and engaged with  patients to understand substance use disorders.   Following her internship, Hannah not only became certified to  administer Narcan herself, but she led her first Narcan certification  course to members of the Orange County Youth Council and plans to hold  additional trainings in the future.   I admire Hannah's empathy and determination. Through unimaginable  loss, she has created a framework within the Orange community to  prevent tragedies like the one she and her family have faced.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in thanking Hannah for her selflessness  and her service to Virginia's Seventh Congressional District.                            ____________________
