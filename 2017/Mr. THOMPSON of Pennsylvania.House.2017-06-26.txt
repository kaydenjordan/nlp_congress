 Mr. Speaker, June is National  Homeownership Month, and it is a time when we celebrate and recognize  the many benefits of owning a home.   For generations of Americans, owning a home has been an essential  element in achieving the American Dream. But since the Great Recession,  we have seen homeownership rates drop to historic lows.   Young families often find themselves unable to save for a downpayment  or to gain access to adequate credit. This is especially true for those  in rural areas.   The United States Department of Agriculture places emphasis on  helping rural Americans buy homes. USDA provides mortgage loan  guarantees through partnerships with private sector lenders to help  low- to moderate-income rural home buyers.   In 2016 alone, USDA worked with nearly 1,500 lenders to help 116,000  rural individuals and families buy homes. USDA has helped more than 4.1  million rural residents buy a home since the National Housing Act was  passed 68 years ago.   Mr. Speaker, the benefits of homeownership have widespread benefits.  Homeownership fortifies communities, creates jobs, and strengthens the  local businesses that support our towns.   Thank you to USDA for your commitment to providing affordable housing  for rural Americans. Happy National Homeownership Month.                            ____________________
