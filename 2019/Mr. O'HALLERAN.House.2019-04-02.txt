 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong  support for the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.   Since it was first enacted in 1994, the Violence Against Women Act  has saved countless lives and supported millions of domestic violence  and assault victims and survivors by funding critical programs.   In February 2019, the Violence Against Women Act expired. This is  unacceptable. It is imperative that we fully reauthorize the Violence  Against Women Act. A stopgap Violence Against Women Act does not  address critical issues within the legislation and would seriously  impact the lifesaving programs needed across Indian Country.   Domestic violence affects every community in America. Tribal  communities, though, face it at an alarmingly high rate. According to  Federal data, at least 55 percent of American Indian and Alaska Native  women have experienced physical violence at an intimate partner's  hands.   We are here to make visible the unacceptable and glaring disparities  that women and families across Indian Country face when it comes to  violence, assault, and abuse. We are here to demand action because  there are things we can and should do to help survivors.  [[Page H2945]]    In 2013, the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act  created special domestic violence criminal jurisdiction. This was  critical to holding perpetrators accountable on Indian Country, but it  didn't go far enough. The special jurisdiction limits Tribes to  prosecuting only crimes committed against intimate partners, not kids  or police officers.   As a former law enforcement officer and homicide detective, I can  tell you that responding to these types of calls was extremely and is  extremely dangerous for police officers. Within the past 3 years alone,  the Navajo Nation has lost three officers responding to domestic  violence calls. We must honor their sacrifice with action.   Further, these gaps in jurisdiction put children who are victims or  witnesses to violence in harm's way. It affects families dramatically.  It affects our communities. It affects our country.   This reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act includes my  legislation, the Native Youth and Tribal Officer Protection Act. This  lifesaving provision would fix these jurisdictional gaps and expand  current law regarding special jurisdiction. It would allow Tribes to  prosecute and convict non-Indian offenders who harm children and law  enforcement officers responding to domestic violence cases, as any town  outside Indian Country can already do.   Few things have shaped my life more than the 13 years I served as a  police officer. My first call as an officer involved domestic violence.  I still remember it and other domestic violence and sexual assault  cases. There are too many to remember. Our society has to change if we  are to make life and our families successful.   We must protect children and other survivors of domestic violence and  sexual assault. I join my colleagues in demanding a full  reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. I am a proud  cosponsor of this legislation and urge all my colleagues to support its  passage. It is long overdue.                            ____________________
