 Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to honor an American hero.  Jeremy ``Scott'' McGuire was a special agent assigned to the National  Security Investigations Division at the Department of Homeland Security  in New Orleans.   Scott began his career in law enforcement while pursuing a bachelor's  degree in criminal justice at the University of Southern Mississippi,  where he received the Most Outstanding Undergraduate Pursuing a Career  in Law Enforcement Award. After graduating with honors from USM, Scott  was hired by the former U.S. Customs Service, where he was an import  specialist.   After the September 11 terrorist attacks, Scott was selected to be a  special agent with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement team at the  Department of Homeland Security. There, he received numerous awards and  citations while he investigated successes that included preventing the  export of radioactive material in Iraq and halting an attempt to  smuggle military aircraft parts to Pakistan, just to name a few  examples.   On January 25 of 2016, Scott was killed in the line of duty while  conducting investigations to dismantle transnational criminal and  terrorist organizations that threaten the United States.   Scott will forever be in our hearts and minds. I want to thank his  family for being here with us in the balcony.                            ____________________
