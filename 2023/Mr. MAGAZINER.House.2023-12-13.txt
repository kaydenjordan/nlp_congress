 Mr. Speaker, the Rhode Islanders who I talk to are so  disappointed in this Congress. They sent us here to fight to make their  lives better, not to play political games, like the sham impeachment  push that House Republicans are making against the President, despite  no evidence of wrongdoing.   The people expect us to fight to lower costs, to go after the  companies that are price gouging working Americans. They expect us to  fight for Social Security and Medicare and abortion rights, and to fix  roads and bridges.   Instead, the extreme House Republicans are pushing for impeachment of  the President, despite having no evidence of wrongdoing after a year of  investigations. We need to remember who  [[Page H6876]]  sent us here and what they sent us here to fight for.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to fight for working people in this  country. Stop the political games. Stop the nonsense.                            ____________________
