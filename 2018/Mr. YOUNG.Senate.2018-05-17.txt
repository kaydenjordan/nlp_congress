 Mr. President, I wish to rise today to formally  recognize the 90th anniversary of the Embassy Theatre in Fort Wayne,  IN. Since its founding on May 14 1928, the Embassy has remained  Indiana's leading self-sustaining historic theatre, welcoming more than  130,000 patrons each year. Originally built as a movie palace and  vaudeville house, the theatre featured regal entertainment with a  complete Page theatre pipe organ. At the height of its popularity, the  Embassy frequently hosted decorated artists, including musician Tony  Bennett and comedian Victor Borge. It wasn't until the evolution of  television that the theater's popularity began to fade.   In 1972, the Embassy was threatened to be demolished, but several  Hoosiers in the Fort Wayne community formed the Embassy Theatre  Foundation to preserve its historical significance. Now in its 90th  year, the Embassy Theatre continues to feature national  [[Page S2772]]  Broadway productions and hold various concerts of all genres.   I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the Embassy Theatre for  its famed entertainment and commitment to preserving one of Indiana's  most historical sites.                            ____________________
