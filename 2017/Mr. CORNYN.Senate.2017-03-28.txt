 Mr. President, I came to the floor to talk about the  nomination of Judge Gorsuch to serve as the next Supreme Court Justice,  and I happened to walk in while the Democratic leader was speaking. In  the brief time I heard him comment this morning, I concluded that  basically the Democrats are against everything. They are against  everything. He knows as well as anybody that when the President sends  over a budget, it is a proposal by the President that Congress  routinely changes, arriving at its own budget priorities, working with  the White House.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Georgia (Mr. Isakson).
