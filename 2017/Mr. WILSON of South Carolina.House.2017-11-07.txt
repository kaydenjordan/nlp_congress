 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, congratulations to  Ambassador Nikki Haley, the former Governor of South Carolina, for  leadership opposing a misguided U.N. resolution calling for the U.S. to  lift the Cuban embargo. This was a resolution the Obama administration  has shamefully abstained from voting on.   Rather than bow down to the Cuban Communist dictatorship, Ambassador  Haley stood up to them and stood up for the oppressed people of Cuba.   Ambassador Haley correctly reviewed: ``The United States opposes this  resolution today in continued solidarity with the Cuban people and in  the hope that they will one day be free to choose their own destiny.''   The economic catastrophe of Cuba is due to the Communist,  totalitarian dictatorship, not the American embargo. As cited by the  late Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher: socialism will work until you  run out of spending other people's money.   Ambassador Haley's service has ushered in a new era of moral clarity.  The United States is again a leader for expanded freedom. President  Donald Trump's commitment to peace through strength is going to make  the world safer for American families, along with Vice President Mike  Pence, who is here in the Capitol Building today.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
