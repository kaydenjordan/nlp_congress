 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of my  ADD SOY Act. This bill makes soy milk available to children who need  alternatives to cow's milk. This is especially important for the large  number  [[Page H1219]]  of minority children who are lactose intolerant and experience adverse  health effects simply because, in practice, dairy is the only type of  milk offered in schools.   The rates of lactose intolerance in these communities is surprisingly  high with 65 percent of Latino students, 75 percent of Black students,  and 90 percent of Asian students unable to digest dairy milk without  detrimental effects.   Many children don't make the connection between consumption of this  product and their feelings of discomfort and even illness. Right now,  children who suffer adverse reactions from cow's milk must get a  doctor's note if they choose not to accept traditional milk in their  lunch. This is partly due to Congress' ``milk note'' requirement which  places an unfair burden squarely on minority children.   Lactose intolerance causes a range of health effects, from stomach  pains and digestive problems to exacerbated asthma symptoms. This makes  learning more difficult for children.   America needs to embrace a diverse lunch counter solution.                            ____________________
