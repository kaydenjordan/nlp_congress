 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from the  First District of Georgia for yielding to me and for hosting this  Special Order to honor my friend and mentor, Zell Miller.   Mr. Speaker, Zell Miller was a titan in Georgia, the man that I was  humbled and honored to call a friend and a mentor. He was an  extraordinary statesman, a true public servant.   He served as a sergeant in the Marines, the mayor of Young Harris, a  Georgia State senator, Lieutenant Governor, Governor, and U.S. Senator  for the State of Georgia.   Now, as a newly elected State representative of the 94th district of  Georgia in 1977, I had very little to do at the State capitol after the  session ended and my committee meetings were over.   Somehow, I found myself hanging out in the office of the Lieutenant  Governor, where his press secretary was from my hometown of Columbus,  who was on loan from the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer to serve Lieutenant  Governor.   I got to know Zell. I got to learn from his example. And from him, I  even developed an appreciation for country music. I witnessed in Zell  Miller a public servant with extraordinary integrity, courage, and  character.                                time  1830    Fourteen years later, he became Governor, and I became a member of  the Georgia State Senate. In that term as a State senator, I was  appointed to be the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee,  Subcommittee on Education, K-12 Subcommittee, and I got to work very  closely with Zell Miller because, after all, he was the education  Governor.   That year, Georgia was the beneficiary of a windfall as a result of a  lawsuit with some utilities, and there were several million dollars  that were unexpectedly put into the State coffers. Zell Miller had to  make a determination of how the State would spend that money. And being  the farsighted visionary that he was, he decided that we needed to  bring our State into the computer age, and so he used it to create a  computer network, statewide, to enhance the educational opportunities  for our colleges and universities and our State's public libraries.   He established the Galileo computer network, which provided the  groundwork for distance learning and for telemedicine. I was very proud  as the chair of the Education Subcommittee of the Georgia State Senate  to work with him in making that happen. Not only that, but we worked to  establish pilot programs that year for teaching foreign languages in  elementary schools.   Zell Miller will perhaps be best remembered for the HOPE Scholarship,  as you have heard, which helped to establish scholarship money and to  direct money raised from the State lottery to the college tuition for  Georgia students. To date, the program has provided over $10 billion in  scholarship funds to 1.8 million eligible Georgia students. These  investments in education are continuing to pay dividends for the State  of Georgia.   Zell Miller was a true servant, and he was an advocate for Georgia.  He was an advocate for humankind.   My wife, Vivian, and I offer his wife, Shirley, and their family,  friends, and loved ones our most sincere condolences for their loss,  but we are all so grateful that he touched our lives.   In closing, I just want to quote the words of a poem that I think is  so fitting as we remember the life of Zell Miller:       The tree that never had to fight      For Sun and sky and air and light,      But stood out in the open plain      And always got its share of rain,      Never became a forest king      But lived and died a scrubby thing.      The man who never had to toil      To gain and farm his patch of soil,      Who never had to win his share      Of Sun and sky and light and air,      Never became a manly man      But lived and died as he began.      Good timber does not grow with ease:      The stronger wind, the stronger trees;      The further sky, the greater length;      The more the storm, the more the strength.      By Sun and cold, by rain and snow,      In trees and men good timbers grow.    Zell Miller was good timber. He left his mark on Young Harris; he  left his mark on Georgia; he left his mark on our Nation; and he left  his mark on the world.   Lives of great men all remind us: ``We can make our life sublime,  and, departing, leave behind us footprints on the sands of time.'' Zell  Miller has left some big footprints, and we and the world are better  because he passed this way.
