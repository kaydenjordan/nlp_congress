 Mr. Speaker, I rise for the purpose of speaking with  great sadness and emotion about the loss of our great Senator, our  senior Senator from California, Senator Dianne Feinstein.   I do so, as I say, personally, as a friend, neighbor, and fellow San  Franciscan. All of us do so with great pride as the great Senator she  has been to our State, and the longest serving woman Senator from  California.   She came here with Barbara Boxer, she stayed on, and she left on her  own terms. She was the first woman mayor of San Francisco, coming into  office under sad circumstances but leading us with great dignity, with  great effectiveness, and with great leadership.   Much more will be said about it. We will have so much time to talk  and brag about Dianne Feinstein. Her legacy will be a long one that we  will all be inspired by. However, today, at this time, just hours since  her passing, rather than talk about her, let us just pray that she  rests in peace.   In that regard, Mr. Speaker, I ask that all present in the Chamber,  as well as Members and staff throughout the Capitol, please rise for a  moment of silence and in remembrance of the late Honorable Senator  Dianne Feinstein.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, with deep condolences and sympathy to  Senator Feinstein's daughter Katherine and her granddaughter Eileen,  and the entire Feinstein family, I offer a privileged bereavement  resolution and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 742         Resolved, That the House has heard with profound sorrow of       the death of the Honorable Dianne Goldman Berman Feinstein, a       Senator from the State of California.        Resolved, That the Clerk communicate these resolutions to       the Senate and transmit a copy thereof to the family of the       deceased.        Resolved, That when the House adjourns today, it adjourn as       a further mark of respect to the memory of the deceased       Senator.    The resolution was agreed to.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
