 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  community of North Platte, Nebraska, for its many decades of service to  our men and women in uniform.   Earlier this week, the North Platte Canteen came together once again  to host more than 700 Army National  [[Page H5577]]  Guard soldiers based in Arkansas who were returning from a training  mission in Wyoming, not having eaten a hot meal in days.   The North Platte Canteen traces its history to World War II, when the  community came together to feed more than 6 million servicemen and - women as they traveled by train across the country.   The North Platte Canteen was organized this time to feed more than  700 soldiers, like I said. They were transported on 21 buses over 2  days, and these experiences included homemade birthday cakes for those  celebrating, which is that time-honored tradition at the Canteen.   I would like to thank Lisa Burke, Muriel Clark, Amanda Connick,  Courtney Fegter, and Michelle Thomas at the North Platte/Lincoln County  Visitors Bureau, who coordinated what became a whole-community effort  with just a few days' notice.   This is really what Nebraska's support for our troops is all about.                            ____________________
