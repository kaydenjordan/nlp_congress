 Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Ohio  not just on his speech and his remarks but on his leadership on the  opioid epidemic in our country and its progression into other areas. He  speaks passionately about it publicly and privately to his colleagues,  just as he did today at our lunch as we discussed healthcare. He was a  leader last year when we passed the 21st Century Cures Act to try to  move these medical miracles that we know are coming through the  regulatory and investment process more rapidly and into medicine  cabinets and doctors' offices.   Senator Portman and Senator Whitehouse and others, in a bipartisan  way, worked to add at least $1 billion more funding for States to deal  with opioids after they had passed the Comprehensive Addiction and  Recovery Act earlier that year. So the opioid epidemic and the families  who suffer from it have no more effective spokesman and advocate than  the Senator from Ohio, and I am glad I had an opportunity to hear his  remarks today.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time until 4:30 be  equally divided in the usual form; further, that all postcloture time  on the Gottlieb nomination expire at 4:30 p.m. today; and that, if  confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid on the  table, and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, while the Senator from Ohio is here,  one more word on opioids.   Dr. Francis Collins, the head of the National Institutes of Health,  has testified before the Senate that in the next decade we could have-- we should have a discovery of a nonaddictive pain medicine.   I cannot think of anything that over the long run could deal more  with opioid addiction than to find a substitute for opioids that wasn't  addictive. So we have discussed that with the President, with the new  head of the FDA--after today, Dr. Gottlieb, I hope--with Dr. Price,  Senator Portman, and with others, and, hopefully, in a bipartisan way,  we can lean forward into accelerating the discovery of a nonaddictive  pain medicine, and we can make that contribution in this effort.   Mr. President, the Senate will vote shortly at 4:30 p.m. on the  President's nomination of Scott Gottlieb to serve as Commissioner of  the Food and Drug Administration. He is the right person to lead the  FDA in this vital mission and move the agency forward so America's  patients can benefit from the remarkable discoveries--one of which I  was just discussing--that our Nation's researchers are working on.   Dr. Gottlieb has impressive qualifications from every perspective. He  was a practicing physician and hospitalist for many years, received his  medical degree at Mount Sinai School of Medicine and completed his  residency there. He held three positions in the Department of Health  and Human Services, including two at the FDA as Deputy Commissioner,  from 2005 to 2007, and before that, in 2003 to 2004, as a senior  adviser to Commissioner Mark McClellan, and as the FDA's Director of  Medical Policy Development.   Dr. Gottlieb has studied health policy as a resident fellow at the  American Enterprise Institute. He is a prolific writer and speaker on  medical innovations. He has testified in front of Congress 18 times on  a variety of issues, including the drug approval process, drug costs,  drug shortages, importation, and healthcare reform.   Dr. Gottlieb is also a cancer survivor. He knows firsthand how  medical treatments affect patients and their families.   Dr. Gottlieb, like others who were nominated by Presidents, has been  through an exhaustive vetting process. The President announced the  Gottlieb nomination on March 10. We received the nomination March 27.  On April 5, Dr. Gottlieb testified for 2\1/2\ hours in our Senate HELP  Committee. I offered Senators an opportunity to ask any questions they  wished. Following his hearing, he answered 189 follow-up questions. If  you count all the subquestions, it was 372 questions.   On April 27, our committee approved his nomination by a vote of 14 to  9, readying that nomination for consideration by the full Senate today.   On March 28, more than a month ago, the independent Office of  Government Ethics concluded that Dr. Gottlieb ``is in compliance with  applicable laws and regulations governing conflicts of interest.''   Let me read from the Office of Government Ethics' website about what  that agency does. It says: ``OGE provides an independent review of the  financial disclosure reports of candidates for Senate-confirmed  nominees. OGE makes sure that these individuals have complied with the  extensive requirements for financial disclosure under the Ethics in  Government Act. OGE ensures compliance with financial disclosure  requirements and assists in the resolution of potential conflicts of  interest. It carefully evaluates nominees' financial disclosure reports  and works with agency ethics officials to prepare individualized ethics  agreements.''   The website continues: ``After confirming with the agency that there  are no unresolved conflicts of interest, OGE then transmits the  financial disclosure report, the ethics agreement, and a cover letter  directly to the Senate.''   That all arrived at our committee on March 28. So that should answer  any questions about whether Dr. Gottlieb has a conflict of interest  because the independent agency Congress set up to resolve that question  says he has none--or if he has any, he will resolve them according to  an agreement with that office.   I believe Dr. Gottlieb will help to move the FDA forward so patients  can benefit from the remarkable medical discoveries that researchers  are working on. The FDA affects nearly every  [[Page S2838]]  single American and regulates about a quarter of all consumer spending  in our country, over $4 trillion annually.   It is responsible for areas as diverse as prescription drugs for  humans and animals, medical devices, biologics, dietary supplements,  cosmetics, over-the-counter medications, food, and tobacco products. In  addition to drugs and medical devices, the FDA is responsible for  protecting our Nation's food supply and working to reduce the number of  people who get sick from foodborne illnesses.   Some of my Democratic colleagues have expressed concern about Dr.  Gottlieb's prior work with companies that are regulated by the Food and  Drug Administration, but the fact is, it is not so unusual to have an  FDA Commissioner who has consulted with the food and drug industry. Dr.  Califf, the distinguished former FDA Commissioner under President  Obama, consulted for many companies prior to his confirmation from the  Senate. That didn't disqualify Dr. Califf. I supported him. So did 89  other Senators. He was confirmed 89 to 4.   I think we should recognize the obvious fact that it is a good idea  to have people serving in government with some experience in the types  of industries they are in charge of. The other day we confirmed a  Secretary of Agriculture. I think it helps that he is a farmer and a  veterinarian. We confirmed the Secretary of Commerce. I think it helps  that he has some background in business. Some of the same people who  are criticizing Dr. Gottlieb for having a background in working with  companies that manufacture drugs criticized President Trump's Secretary  of Education because she had never been on the payroll of the people  she was about to be in charge of. So you can't have it both ways.   I believe Dr. Gottlieb's background in understanding how drugs are  manufactured, how they can be manufactured safely, how they can be  moved through the regulatory and investment process more rapidly is  vitally important to the opportunity we have in America--more than we  have ever had before--of finding these new medical miracles and putting  them in our medicine cabinets and our doctors' offices.   Dr. Gottlieb has broad support from an array of patient, industry,  and research organizations. The supporters include three former FDA  Commissioners and President Obama's Administrator of the Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services.   On Friday, I received a letter of support for Dr. Gottlieb from 10  State attorneys general who particularly praised the nominee as ``a  leader in the fight against opioid abuse,'' the subject Senator Portman  spoke on a moment ago.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  a list of 93 groups that support Dr. Gottlieb's nomination at the  conclusion of my remarks.   Mr. President, here are a few examples of what some of these groups  had to say.   Dr. Jeff Allen, the President and CEO of Friends of Cancer Research,  said: ``Through his knowledge and experience, we have no doubt that Dr.  Gottlieb will be the right person to ensure FDA keeps pace with science  and innovation without sacrificing the safety and efficacy gold  standard established by FDA.''   The Healthcare Leadership Council said: ``Dr. Gottlieb's  qualifications to lead the FDA are extensive and indisputable. . . .  Dr. Gottlieb has consistently demonstrated his vision for accelerated  medical innovation in this country and greater patient access to the  drugs and devices that improve lives.''   Dr. Mark McClellan, FDA Commissioner from 2002 to 2004, said: ``He's  a very good nomination,'' adding ``he is very dedicated to finding  better ways to protect and improve the health of the public, all of  which are great prerequisites for FDA Commissioner.''   Andy Slavitt, who just stepped down as the Administrator of the  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services under President Obama, said  that Dr. Gottlieb is ``a very good choice.''   The FDA has always been important, but there never has been a more  important time for this agency. It is responsible for making sure  patients benefit from the promising research driven by significant  funding Congress has given to medical research in last year's 21st  Century Cures Act, which the majority leader called ``the most  important legislation of the year.''   I don't want it to go unnoticed that last year Congress increased  funding for the National Institutes of Health by $2 billion. Last week,  Congress increased funding for the National Institutes of Health by  another $2 billion. The 21st Century Cures Act, which Congress also  passed last year, authorized a $4.8 billion increase in funding for the  National Institutes of Health for President Obama's Precision Medicine  Initiative and for the Cancer Moonshot the Vice President worked on.  Speaker Ryan and Majority Leader McConnell, President Obama, Vice  President Biden, all of us want to see these medical miracles move  forward, and having competent leadership in the FDA is absolutely  essential to that effort.   I am very excited about the prospect of having Dr. Gottlieb and Dr.  Francis Collins, who is the head of the National Institutes of Health,  at the head of these two lifesaving agencies, which are important to  every single American family.   The reason 21st Century Cures is such an important bill is that it  will drive forward this extraordinary research, and Dr. Collins talked  about some of the discoveries that will be possible in the next decade.  I mentioned the possibility of nonaddictive pain medicine. Dr. Collins  said that we will also have hearts that will be rebuilt from our own  stem cells. We will have a universal flu vaccine. Did you know that the  flu kills between 12,000 and 56,000 Americans a year? There will be a  universal flu vaccine. There will be an HIV/AIDS vaccine and an  artificial pancreas for patients with diabetes who have spent decades  injecting themselves with insulin. These are the discoveries that are  just over the horizon, not to mention medicine that will identify  Alzheimer's before there are symptoms and then slow the progression of  the disease. Think of the grief it would save families and the billions  it would save the country. We have invested in that.   We have competent leadership to be approved by the Senate today, in  working with Dr. Collins and Dr. Price, who can make sure those dreams  become a reality perhaps even more rapidly.   The FDA plays a key role in this. At the committee hearing, I asked  Dr. Gottlieb about the subject Senator Portman and I just talked about.  I asked him how the FDA can be forward-leaning in accelerating the  finding of new nonaddictive pain medicines--the ultimate cure for the  opioid epidemic. It is a heartbreaking issue that almost every Senator  knows about. Dr. Gottlieb said that the opioid epidemic is ``having  staggering human consequences.''   He also said:         I think it's the biggest crisis facing the agency. It's       going to require dramatic action by whoever steps into the       agency. I think it's going to require an all-of-the-above       approach that does include reevaluating the framework for how       we can develop alternatives to opioid drugs. I think it also       includes looking at device alternatives to opioid drugs and       looking at devices in the context of drugs.    Dr. Gottlieb's first order of business will be to work with us on the  reauthorization of the FDA user fee agreements, which experts at the  FDA told members of our HELP Committee at one of the two bipartisan  hearings on the agreements, are integral to helping patients and  continuing the implementation of the 21st Century Cures Act.   Before September 30, four different agreements need to be  reauthorized. They fund $8 billion to $9 billion over the next 5 years,  which is about a quarter of the Food and Drug Administration's budget.  If we do not move quickly to pass these agreements in late July, the  FDA will be forced, by law, to send layoff notices to more than 5,000  FDA employees and notify them that they may lose their jobs in 60 days.   A delay in reauthorizing these agreements would delay the reviews of  drugs and devices that were submitted after April 1--1 month ago. For  example, if we do not pass these user fee reauthorizations on time, an  FDA reviewer who gets started in reviewing, say, a cancer drug that was  submitted to the agency in April would be laid off on October 1, which  would be before the reviewer is able to finish his or her work.   In addition to harming patients and families who rely on medical  innovation, a delay in reauthorization would  [[Page S2839]]  threaten America's global leadership in biomedical innovation.   After reviewing the recommendations from industry and the FDA, I  believe these are good agreements for patients. The sooner we pass the  legislation, the better so as to give patients, doctors, FDA reviewers,  and companies' certainty.   At this moment, Washington, DC, is not a very bipartisan town on many  issues, but on this issue--the issue of user fees to support the Food  and Drug Administration--it has been.   I compliment Senator Patty Murray and her staff. Senator Murray is  the ranking Democrat on the HELP Committee. Our staffs have been  working together for 15 months in a bipartisan way and working with the  House of Representatives to try to make sure we can present to the full  Senate our FDA user fee agreements. We have had two bipartisan  hearings. Tomorrow, we have a markup at which we hope those agreements  will be reported to the Senate floor.   The FDA has a vital and important mission, and I am confident Dr.  Gottlieb is the right person to be leading the agency. We are fortunate  that he is willing to serve. I look forward to the Senate's approving  Dr. Gottlieb's confirmation this afternoon.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Dr. Gottlieb's nomination has received support from 93       groups--including a broad array of patient, industry, and       research organizations.
