 Mr. Speaker, tomorrow former President Donald Trump will  be arraigned in Federal court in Miami. He has been indicted on 37  different felony charges, including false statements and  representations, scheme to conceal, concealing a document in a Federal  investigation, corruptly concealing a document or record, withholding a  document or record, conspiracy to obstruct justice, and 31 counts of  willful retention of national defense information.   Mr. Speaker, I read the incredibly detailed and evidence-based  indictment, and it is deeply troubling and disturbing, to say the  least. These charges show a complete and total disregard for the  national security of the United States. The former President's actions  compromised the lives and safety of U.S. military personnel around the  world.   No one is above the law, and anyone who undermines U.S. national  security must be held to answer for their actions. Mr. Speaker, he had  our nuclear secrets stashed away in boxes in his bathroom.   Listen, I am here on the floor today because prodemocracy Republicans  in North Carolina's 13th District rejected extremism and sent me to  Washington because I ran to protect our democracy and our rule of law.  This is about our rule of law.   Mr. Speaker, as the American people try to make sense of these  indictments, I think we should listen to the comments from Republicans  who served in the Trump administration and other leading Republicans.   John Bolton, who served as National Security Advisor in the Trump  administration said: ``The indictment is devastating. Those who  defended Trump before the charges were made public or those who have  not yet spoken, should very carefully weigh how history will consider  their statements.''   Mick Mulroy, a senior Pentagon official in the Trump administration,  said: ``The classified documents described in the indictment are some  of the most sensitive information we possess. . . . This type of  information should never be removed from a secured facility and once  discovered should have been immediately returned.''   Bill Barr, who served as Attorney General in the Trump administration  said: ``If even half of it is true, then he is toast. It's a very  detailed indictment, and it's very, very damning. And this idea of  presenting Trump as a victim here, a victim of a witch hunt, is  ridiculous.  [[Page H2794]]    ``He is not a victim here. He was totally wrong that he had the right  to have those documents. Those documents are among the most sensitive  secrets the country has.''   Asa Hutchinson, former Bush administration official, former Governor  of Arkansas, said: ``Donald Trump's actions--from his willful disregard  for the Constitution to his disrespect for the rule of law--should not  define our Nation or the Republican Party.''   Mitt Romney, the junior Senator from the State of Utah said: ``Mr.  Trump brought these charges upon himself by not only taking classified  documents, but by refusing to simply return them when given numerous  opportunities to do so.   ``These allegations are serious and if proven, would be consistent  with his other actions offensive to the national interest, such as  withholding defensive weapons from Ukraine for political reasons and  failing to defend the Capitol from violent attack and insurrection.''   Mr. Speaker, we are a nation of laws. No one is above the law in the  United States of America. No one is entitled to keep top secret  national security documents. The documents in this case are among the  most secret we have in this country--nuclear secrets. We need to know  just how much the careless and cavalier storage of these documents has  compromised our Nation's national security.   I came to Congress to get things done for the people in my district,  and I have been glad to build relationships with my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle. We should work in a bipartisan way whenever we can,  but if we are going to truly heal as a country, we need to hold people  accountable.   As a lawyer, I know allowing this process to play out in a court of  law and ensuring a fair and impartial trial is critically important.  However, this is already a sad and somber moment in our Nation's  history. Democracy should never be taken for granted. We must be  vigilant and proactive to protect it.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, history will remember those who defend this  lawless behavior, and it will not be kind.                            ____________________
