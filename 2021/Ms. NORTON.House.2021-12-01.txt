 Madam Speaker, I thank both of my friends for their kind  remarks on my bill, the Women Who Worked on the Home Front World War II  Memorial Act. As my friend has just said, this is really an unusual  bill because it came to me from a fifth grader. I am particularly  pleased and proud to speak in favor of her bill, the Women Who Worked  on the Home Front World War II Memorial Act. This is all her idea,  including getting the funds for the memorial.   This bill would authorize the establishment of a memorial on Federal  land in the District of Columbia commemorating the efforts of the 18  million American women who kept the home front running during World War  II.   Madam Speaker, I thank Senators Tammy Duckworth, Marsha Blackburn,  and Mike Braun for introducing the companion bill in the Senate. Last  Congress, the House passed this non-controversial bill by a voice vote,  and I am hoping for that result again in this House and in the Senate.   As a teenager, Raya Kenney, the founder--and I emphasize ``founder''  for this very young woman--of the non-profit Women Who Worked on the  Home Front Foundation--her own foundation--and my constituent, as she  is, came up with the idea of a memorial to honor the women on the home  front who supported World War II in its effort.   She rightfully questioned why the women on the home front, whose  efforts were so instrumental in maintaining the stability of our  country during World War II, have not received as much recognition for  their contributions as the men who fought bravely in World War II.   This bill would authorize the Women Who Worked on the Home Front  Foundation to establish a memorial to honor these women. The memorial  is designed to be interactive and to educate visitors on the important  role women played during World War II.   Between 1940 and 1945, the percentage of women in the workforce  increased from 27 percent to nearly 37 percent. By 1945, one in four  married women worked outside the home. The work done by women on the  home front opened the doors for women in the workplace widely and has  had a profound and lasting effect on the job market ever since.   As a result of their efforts, millions of American women on the home  front redefined so-called women's work and paved the way for future  generations.   Many women also played critical roles in support of the war effort.  More than 10,000 women served behind the scenes of World War II as  codebreakers. Due to the classified nature of their work, they did not  receive recognition for their tireless efforts until recently.    Women were also trained to fly military aircraft so male pilots could  leave for combat duty overseas. More than 1,100 female civilian  volunteers flew nearly every type of military aircraft as part of the  Women Airforce Service Pilots, the WASP program.   The WASPs flew planes from factories to bases, transported cargo, and  participated in simulated strafing and target missions. These women  were not given full military status until 1977, and it was not until  2010 that they were recognized with the Congressional Gold Medal.   Women have been historically underrepresented in our memorials,  particularly the memorials on Federal land in our Nation's capital. It  is fitting to authorize a memorial that would allow millions of  visitors to the Nation's capital to understand and honor the heroic  efforts of these women and their lasting impact on the fabric of our  society.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.    Madam Speaker, Democrats in the House have much to be  proud of as we approach the end of the year.   In the midst of an unprecedented pandemic, we have passed two of the  most significant bills in the history of the House of Representatives-- the Transportation and Infrastructure bill and President Biden's Build  Back Better bill.   I chaired the Highways and Transit Subcommittee and I was pleased to  attend President Biden's signing of the bill at the White House. The  bill directs $39 billion to public transportation--like D.C.'s Metro-- expands broadband, and funds replacing lead service pipes.   Our Build Back Better bill is an omnibus bill that catches up with  years of needs Congress has failed to meet, from affordable childcare  that will free women and men to work, to combating climate change, a  clear and present danger to the planet.   It would be difficult to find more significant bills passed by the  House of Representatives in a single session.                            ____________________
