 Mr. Speaker, I rise as a freshman who came here to  get things done on the 26th day of the longest government shutdown in  American history.   For 26 days, we have had to explain to 800,000 dedicated, patriotic  Americans why we will not pay them for their service to our country,  even as they must keep paying for their rent, their medicine and their  kids' educations.   For 26 days, we have had to explain why small business owners can't  get loans; why food safety inspections are suspended; why lines are  growing and terminals are being shut down at our airports; why we are  willing to jeopardize the safety of air travelers; why we can't protect  our National Parks from desecration; and why, if securing our country  is so important, we aren't paying the Coast Guard, and Customs and  Border Protection officers whose job it is to secure it.   In the last few days, I have been hearing from college students in my  district who have until February 1 to apply for financial aid, but they  can't access their tax transcripts from the IRS.    Mr. Speaker, I ask: Why are we doing this to ourselves? The President  says it is because of border security. But if we are honest, we know  that that is not what this is about. If getting $5.7 billion for a  border wall is important enough to inflict this much suffering on  Americans, why didn't the President pick this fight in the 2 years when  his party controlled both Houses of the Congress?   Why is he doing this now? I think we know the answer. I fear that for  the President the chaos is sometimes not a means to an end, but an end  in itself. He doesn't want a wall, he wants a fight over the wall; not  a compromise to open the government, but a conflict that dismantles the  government. And that raises the stakes for all of us.   For this is not about how we secure the border, as important as that  is to all of us. It is about how we govern our country. We have a  chance now to say, once and for all, Presidents are entitled to try to  persuade us to support their priorities, but if they fail to persuade  us, they are not entitled to shut the government down to get their way.   None of us, not Democrats or Republicans, are entitled to hold  hostage the basic functions of our government to force our will on  others. And if we give into this tactic now, it will be used again, and  again, and again. We will have chaos in our government for as far as  the eye can see.   So how do we solve this problem? We will not solve it by abdicating  our responsibility in the Congress and waiting for the President to  agree on something. If we wait for that, we will be waiting forever.   We will not solve it by encouraging him to use emergency powers or to  use our military to defy the Congress. That would tear another hole in  our constitutional fabric.   We will solve it when the House and the Senate Democrats and  Republicans come together to say: This is not how we do business in a  democracy.   Mr. Speaker, instead of enabling this abdication of responsibility by  the White House, let us rise to our responsibility in the Congress. Let  us work together to reopen the government by passing the same bills we  were all willing to vote for across party lines last year, and then  let's sit down together as adults to talk about immigration and the  border as part of the debate about funding the Department of Homeland  Security when both sides can put their ideas on the table and find  common ground.   If we do that, we will not only address border security, we will  break this pernicious practice of taking the American people hostage  when we don't get our way.   We can make this the shutdown to end all shutdowns.                            ____________________
