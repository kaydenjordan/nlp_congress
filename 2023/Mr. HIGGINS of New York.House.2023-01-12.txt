 Madam Speaker, Buffalo and western New York  have had our fair share of challenges over the last year:   A racist mass shooter murdered innocent people at a local grocery  store.   A blinding blizzard took the lives of dozens of our neighbors 2 weeks  ago.   And what should have been an exciting Monday night football game  turned into a nightmare for Buffalo Bills player Damar Hamlin and his  family.   Our community is grateful Damar is recovering at home with his family  now.   Today, I rise to celebrate the people and the spirit of Buffalo. We  are more than neighbors, we are family. We are a family that sticks  together, works together, and rallies around our teams and one another  in good times and in bad.   Madam Speaker, I am proud of the way Buffalo works through our  struggles, and prouder still to call this place with a big heart home.  Our best days are immediately in front of us.   Go Bills.                            ____________________
