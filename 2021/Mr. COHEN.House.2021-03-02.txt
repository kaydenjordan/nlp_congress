 Madam Speaker, this is an important and good bill. It is a  comprehensive bill that takes in a lot of issues that are important to  giving people the opportunity to vote and the opportunity to elect  their leaders in fair manners. The most important, I think, as Leader  Hoyer addressed all the points, is redistricting, to have nonpartisan  redistricting commissions decide how the State legislatures and the  congressional seats will be designed so that they are geographic,  understandable, and done without the intent of electing a particular  party to that position.   Madam Speaker, right now, most of the districts are determined in the  primary; that is why we don't have competitive districts and people  coming closer to the center to try to work together.   This bill also has the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act. John Lewis  was the conscience of the Congress. He almost gave his life in Selma,  Alabama, to try to get the right to vote for people. Nobody should have  to do that.
