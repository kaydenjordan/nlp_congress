 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the outstanding work  of Kelly Britton and Kathy Caruso, two residents of New York's 22nd  Congressional District.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        March 9, 2021, on page H1133, the following appeared:  Mr.  Speaker, today I rise to honor the outstanding work of Kelly  Britton and Kathy Caruso, two residents of New York's 22nd  Congressional District.    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Kelly and Kathy founded and run Better Together, an advocacy group  for children with special needs. As mothers with children with  disabilities, Kelly and Kathy mobilized a grassroots group of parents  and family members to advocate for children with differing abilities.  Today, Better Together is bringing awareness to the many unmet needs  that children with differing abilities experience.   I recently joined Better Together for their first advocacy event, an  autism awareness and first responder forum. This wonderful  collaborative event provided training and guidance to first responders  on how to work effectively and compassionately to help patients with  autism and other disabilities. It was a pleasure to join Kelly, Kathy,  and the Better Together family to discuss their advocacy efforts and  priorities.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Kelly and Kathy for giving back to our community  in such a meaningful way. They truly are making the world a better  place.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to call up H.R.  682, the Reopen Schools Act, to get our kids out from behind screens  and back in the classroom.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to oppose the previous  question and to offer an amendment to help our schools safely reopen  their doors for in-person learning.   Madam Speaker, millions of children around the Nation have been out  of the classroom for the better part of a year. This has taken a  serious toll not only on their learning and social development but also  on their working parents, who have been forced to juggle home-schooling  their children and working full-time jobs.   The data is in, and it makes abundantly clear that at-home learning  is not a sufficient substitute for in-person education. One recent  study found that children began to fall significantly behind in math.  The study concluded that it would take students in grades 5 and 6 at  least 12 weeks, on average, to catch up to where they were expected to  be.    Madam Speaker, the science is in, and it, too, makes abundantly clear  that schools can reopen safely if the right precautions are taken.  Commonsense social-distancing measures significantly reduce the spread  of COVID-19 in schools and make the classroom a safe place for our  students and our teachers. The CDC Director said last month that the  science shows our schools can reopen safely even before every teacher  is vaccinated.   Madam Speaker, this is what the science tells us. Yet, despite these  facts, too many children in my district and around the country are  still not in the classroom. Students are losing out on a true, sound,  basic education guaranteed them by the New York State Constitution, and  parents are being forced to choose between going to work to earn a  paycheck or staying home to teach their children. It is an impossible  decision that no parent should be forced to make.   In my home State of New York, Governor Cuomo has said one thing and  done another. The result has been confusion across the State and a  patchwork of incoherent and conflicting policies. Governor Cuomo claims  to support the science. Yet, it is March 2021, and New York still does  not have a statewide plan to reopen our schools. It is clear that he is  putting special interests before our students' education.   Sadly, we New Yorkers aren't surprised. Governor Cuomo has already  lost credibility due to his unconscionable coverup of nursing home  deaths. He failed to put our seniors first, and now he is failing to  put our students first. We can and we must do better.   Madam Speaker, under the American Rescue Plan that the House will  consider again later this week, nearly $130 billion is set aside for  schools. But if you read the fine print, 95 percent of that money won't  be spent until after 2021 is over. If you keep reading, you realize  that there is no requirement that the funding be used to reopen schools  safely, something our Nation is desperately crying out for.   The rescue plan fails to prioritize our students and does not do  enough to return safely to in-person learning, which our students  desperately need.                                time  1600    If we defeat the previous question, we will move to immediately  consider the Reopen Schools Act, which states that schools, which  accept a portion of the COVID-19 funding, must reopen. In order to  receive full funding, schools are required to allow at least 50 percent  of their students in the classroom, in person, at least 50 percent of  the time.   This is what New York families are requesting, and it is exactly what  families across the country are demanding from their leaders in  Washington.  [[Page H1171]]         Madam Speaker, the money is coming from the American  Rescue Act that the gentleman voted for, but what we are doing here is  prioritizing the spending.    Madam Speaker, I would just like to address the question  that the gentleman from Massachusetts posed.   What is allocated for this bill?   $54.3 billion is going to be appropriated immediately.   Madam Speaker, at this point, the bill that he is talking about has  no money--only 5 percent until after 2021.   We have students and parents and everyone coming to us, and they want  to open their schools because the children are falling far behind. This  is particularly difficult in New York, where we have no plan in place  and the Governor has failed to give us a plan, and our students are  failing and we need to have our students back on track.   That is all that we are asking for, is that this money be allocated  now and not wait for only 5 percent to be allocated until after 2021.
