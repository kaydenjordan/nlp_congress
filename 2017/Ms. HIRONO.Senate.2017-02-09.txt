 Mr. President, I rise to address the deep anxiety in  Hawaii and across the country about President Trump's choice to lead  the Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, Congressman Tom  Price.   I am particularly concerned about this nominee because of the mixed  messages President Trump has been sending about health care. During the  campaign, President Trump promised to protect Medicare and Medicaid.  Yet he has nominated Congressman Price to head HHS. Congressman Price  has led the effort to privatize Medicare and dismantle Medicaid in the  U.S. House. This is hardly someone who would protect Medicare and  Medicaid.   Shortly before taking the oath of office, President Trump said he  supported the concept of universal coverage. He said:         We are going to have insurance for everybody. They can       expect to have great health care.   Yet he nominated Congressman Price, who has spent the past 6 years  trying to end universal health care coverage by repealing the  Affordable Care Act.   President Trump says a lot of things. He tweets his thoughts daily,  but at this point, instead of listening to what President Trump says,  we should pay attention to what he does. By nominating Congressman  Price, the President demonstrated he does not intend to protect access  to quality, affordable health care for all Americans--not by protecting  Medicare and Medicaid, not by protecting health insurance fraud.  President Trump's health care agenda would have far-reaching, negative,  painful consequences for tens of thousands of people in Hawaii and  millions all across the country. Maybe President Trump should tweet  less and listen more.   Over the past few months, I have heard from thousands of Hawaii  residents concerned that they will no longer be able to afford health  care if President Trump succeeds in repealing the Affordable Care Act  and privatizing Medicare. I would like to read a few of the messages I  have received.   Catherine from Honolulu wrote:         I am writing to you to express serious concern over the       repealing of ACA and other health insurance changes. As a       working (teacher) and single parent of two young children I       am very afraid for our future. I am afraid my insurance will       not cover my psoriatic arthritis if I change jobs, they       change companies, or for some reason I should lose my job or       coverage. My medicine without insurance would cost more than       my mortgage payment, and would thus be cost prohibitive.        If I don't have my medication I would be in so much pain. I       would be unable to work and would therefore lose my insurance       which would mean I would never be able to get coverage       because of a preexisting condition. I am certain there are       many other people out there with similar stories.        Please do everything you can to make sure this scenario       doesn't happen to us. If there is anything I can do, please       don't hesitate to let me know. I just don't know who else to       turn to.    Next, I would like to share a note I received from Julie from  Papaaloa on the Big Island.         My husband and I are on Medicare, together with a       supplemental plan. We are totally dependent on Social       Security for our income and Medicare for our health plan.       Many millions of seniors are in the same situation as we are.       Please continue to fight for us as this abominable horror of       an administration goes forward. I shudder to think what would       happen if these programs are repealed or privatized.    Finally, I would like to share a heartbreaking story from Desi from  Mililani on Oahu. Desi is an extremely hard-working, self-employed  teacher and the single mother of two daughters. Her youngest daughter  has Down syndrome, autism, and is hearing impaired. Desi is self- employed because she needs the flexibility to work and care for her  daughter. This year, as a sole proprietor over the age of 55, Desi's  premiums for her HMO plan rose to over $680 per month for 2016.   In a letter she wrote to me, Desi said:         Paying this high monthly premium was no longer possible and       was jeopardizing our family's ability to pay our mortgage,       food, and other essentials alone.    Desi successfully found a cheaper plan in the ACA marketplace for  2017. In her letter she went on to say:         If the ACA is successfully repealed, we will no longer be       able to afford medical coverage! Families like ours are the       reasons why it is so important to defend the Affordable Care       Act.    These letters and stories demonstrate what is at stake for our  200,000 seniors on Medicare in Hawaii and millions more across the  country. That is why I will continue to fight tooth and nail to prevent  any cuts that would jeopardize our crucial social safety net progress.   The fight has already begun. Last month, Republicans in Congress  pushed through a partisan budget resolution that would give them the  tools they need to repeal the Affordable Care Act. This assault on the  Affordable Care Act is also an assault on Medicare and Medicaid because  the ACA strengthened Medicare and Medicaid through, for example,  closing the prescription doughnut hole and providing free preventive  checkups for seniors. This is why I joined with my colleague from  Indiana, Senator Donnelly, to introduce an amendment that would block  congressional Republicans from privatizing Medicare or increasing  eligibility standards for Medicare. It would also prevent changes that  reduce funding for Medicaid.   During the debate on our amendment, one of our Republican colleagues,  in his opposition to the amendment, basically made our point for us. He  said something to the effect of, a vote in favor of our amendment to  protect Medicare and Medicaid is a vote against repealing the  Affordable Care Act. Exactly. In the end, it was a close vote on our  amendment. While the amendment lost, I was encouraged that two of our  Republican colleagues, Senator Heller of Nevada and Senator Collins of  Maine, voted in favor of the amendment.   In the coming weeks and months, there will be other battles to  protect Medicare and Medicaid. It is going to be a daunting fight, but  I am not going to shy away from it. I am going to do whatever I can,  whenever I can to protect the Affordable Care Act, Medicare, and  Medicaid. In this fight, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote no on  Tom Price's nomination to serve as Secretary of Health and Human  Services. Tom Price is not the champion that millions of people in our  country are counting on to protect their health and welfare.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
