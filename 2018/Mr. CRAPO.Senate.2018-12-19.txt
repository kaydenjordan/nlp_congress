 Mr. President, with my colleagues Senator James E. Risch  and Representative Mike Simpson, I congratulate Dr. David Petti on his  retirement from the Idaho National Laboratory, INL. Dave has had a  long, distinguished career as an innovative nuclear engineer and leader  at INL, where he has made a significant impact in his field.   Presently, Dave is a Laboratory Fellow and Division Director for  Nuclear Fuels and Materials. He is also a Fellow of the American  Nuclear Society and the Senior Editor for the Journal of Nuclear  Materials and an Editorial Member for Nuclear Engineering and Design.   During his tenure, Dave led a number of projects at INL, including  overseeing all research and development for the Very High Temperature  Reactor Technology Development Project, known previously as the Next  Generation Nuclear Plant. Dave is an internationally recognized expert  in the development of advanced reactor fuels and is the recipient of 19  awards, including the Lifetime Achievement Award for an INL Publisher,  2016, the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory Management Excellence  Award, 2014, and the American Nuclear Society Materials Science and  Technology Special Achievement Award for leadership in development of  nuclear fuels for high temperature gas-cooled reactors, 2009.   A highly published and well-respected expert in his field, Dave has  authored or coauthored more than 100 peer reviewed journal articles,  contributed more than 50 papers to conferences, and authored 2 book  chapters. He holds a patent for method for the production of 99mTc  compositions from 99Mo containing materials, 1998. Most recently, Dave  coauthored the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT, report ``The  Future of Nuclear Energy in a Carbon-Constrained World''. This  influential study has had great impact on the international nuclear  community, and he has presented the findings of the report in  Washington, DC, London, Paris, Tokyo, and other places around the  world. Dave holds a Ph.D., an M.S., and a B.S. in nuclear engineering  from Massachusetts Institute of Technology.   Dave has left a mark in his field and in Idaho during his 32 years at  INL. We congratulate him on his many accomplishments and wish Dave and  his wife, Becky, all the best as they enjoy retirement.                            ____________________
