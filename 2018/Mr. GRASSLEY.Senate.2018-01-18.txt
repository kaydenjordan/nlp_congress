 I thank the Presiding Officer.   Should the Children's Health Insurance Program be reauthorized? Of  course it should be reauthorized. It has a long history of strong  bipartisan support. This is a major issue in reaching the point of  whether we need to get something passed--and we do need to get  something passed so the government doesn't shut down. In regard to the  Children's Health Insurance Program being a part of that, this started  very early last fall, when the Senate Finance Committee overwhelmingly  passed a 5-year extension from that committee, once again stating the  strong bipartisan support that the Children's Health Insurance Program  has.   Thankfully, it is moving along in the House of Representatives. That  body has included a 6-year extension of the Children's Health Insurance  Program in the continuing resolution that we have to get through the  U.S. Senate. That 6-year extension would be the longest extension of  the program since it was created over 20 years ago.   I am sure this is going to be surprising to our constituents, for  sure, and maybe even surprising to Members of this body, but this  reauthorization of 6 years actually saves $1 billion.   I cannot believe that we are in a situation where people who have  said that they support the Children's Health Insurance Program would  vote against its reauthorization when the House resolution comes over  here, but that is what the leadership of this body is dealing with. The  reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program has been  elevated in this debate, so people know that those who have been crying  for a long period of time about finally having CHIP reauthorized could  be in a situation of voting against what they have been pleading for  over a long period of time.   My colleague from the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Feinstein,  said: ``Healthcare coverage for kids should be a no-brainer.'' I agree.  This Children's Health Insurance Program reauthorization is a no- brainer, both in the value it has for the kids and in saving us money  at this point.   Senators Warner and Kaine from Virginia wrote: ``We ask that you  include bipartisan legislation reauthorizing the Children's Health  Insurance Program in any upcoming funding legislation.'' Well, it is  here for all of those Senators who want the Children's Health Insurance  Program reauthorized. This is the opportunity to reauthorize it.   Will you vote against what you have been advocating for a long time-- the reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program? In my  State of Iowa, 68,792 children--the latest enrollment--are in CHIP and  are depending upon Congress to do the right thing. The right thing to  do is to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program as soon as  possible--which could be today or tomorrow--for 6 years so that we  don't have to deal with it for a long period of time.   My fellow Senators, this is a time for statesmanship, not  gamesmanship. It is time to vote for a prompt reauthorization of the  Children's Health Insurance Program.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to speak about a tax issue.  It was nearly 3 weeks ago that the President signed into law the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act. It is the most sweeping reform of our Tax Code in  more than three decades. This tax reform provides both tax  simplification and tax cuts for the vast majority of taxpayers.   Importantly, the tax reform bill made good on its commitment to  provide real relief to small business owners, and that also includes  family farmers and ranchers. As one of only three Republican Senators  on both the Finance Committee and the Agriculture Committee, it was a  priority of mine to represent agriculture and the family farm  institution throughout the tax reform debate.   Fair treatment for farmers under tax reform was especially important  to me, given the large role agriculture plays in the economy of the  State of Iowa. Ag accounts for one out of every five jobs in the State  and makes up 33 percent of Iowa's economy. The tax reform bill provided  a once-in-a-generation opportunity to make real and long-lasting  reforms for farmers, ranchers, and every American working in our  agricultural industry.   Broadly speaking, across the board, rate reductions will let  Americans keep more of their own money. This will afford farmers the  opportunity to reinvest in their operations instead of sending that  financial capital to politicians in Washington.   Tax reform legislation expands section 179 of the Tax Code, which  helps farmers finance overhead costs. It enables farmers to deduct more  expenses in the year they occurred and also expands the availability of  cash accounting to more farmers in Iowa and throughout the country.  These provisions will allow farmers to invest in the equipment  necessary to do the job of feeding the Nation and the world.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act lowers taxes on capital investment and  includes a business income deduction, which will help level the playing  field between farms that file as corporations and those that file as  individuals. More than 94 percent of farms are taxed under the IRS  provisions affecting individual taxpayers. The bulk of agriculture  producers who operate outside the corporate tax code deserve basic  fairness. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act makes sure that those taxed under  the individual and corporate tax codes are treated with more equity.   One of the most frequently discussed issues in tax reform discussion  is the estate tax, which can force family farms to break up operations  to pay the IRS following the death of family members. That doesn't  happen at the death of a lot of farmers, but in a few cases it does,  and it seems to me to be very unfair to break up a farming operation to  pay as a result of the consequence of death. I support a full repeal of  this unfair tax, but was pleased that in this tax reform legislation we  were able to make significant progress in alleviating its burden on  family farmers by doubling the estate tax exemption. This substantial  change would let more family farmers pass their hard-earned life's work  on to their children, paving the way for the next generation of family  farmers.   According to the Iowa Farm Bureau, given the price of farmland, about  30 percent of crop farms in Iowa exceeded the $5 million estate tax  exemption in 2016, based on land values. The doubling of the exemption  amount will go a long way toward alleviating the nightmare that is the  death tax for many Iowa farmers.   I have long advocated for commonsense tax relief measures because  they will help Iowa and the Midwest and will make life easier for  middle-class Americans.   Farmers' hard work provides the healthy and affordable food that we  so often take for granted. We should do everything in our power to  support that segment of our economy and create an environment where  these small  [[Page S282]]  businesses and hard-working families can thrive and prosper. That is  what tax reform will do for farmers, for Iowans, and for all Americans.  Whether they are middle-class farmers or middle-class nonfarmers, all  will benefit from other provisions of the tax bill, such as doubling  the standard deduction, doubling the child tax credit, reducing the 15- percent bracket to 12, reducing the 25-percent bracket to 22, and there  are a lot of other features in this bill to benefit not only farmers  but also other middle-class families.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.                            ____________________     Mr. President, before I speak--because Senator Perdue  wants to speak right after me--I ask unanimous consent that Senator  Perdue, assuming he shows up before I am done, be the next one in line  to follow me.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I come to the floor today to offer  remarks about an issue of utmost important to this body and to the  American people--the ongoing negotiations over the future of the  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.   I should explain the justification for these young people. The  children were brought here by their parents. Their parents crossed the  border without papers, violating the law, but the children cannot be  held guilty for the sins of their parents. That is why we feel it is  very legitimate to do this humanitarian thing of legalizing DACA  children--not in and of itself, but, as you heard from my colleague  from North Carolina and you will hear from other people, the necessity  of making sure that we have border security, that we do away with chain  migration, and that we also do away with diversity visas--this is the  scope of negotiations that ought to be going on to get a compromise for  the humanitarian reason of giving certainty to these young DACA people.   Those things were narrowed at the White House a week ago Tuesday, not  the famous Thursday meeting that you heard so much about last weekend  but the meeting of 23 Republican and Democrat Members of both the House  and Senate. When you get a bicameral, bipartisan group of people  together with the President--and you want to do that because you want  to make sure that when you reach an agreement, the President will sign  it--it seems to me that is a significant way to move forward. But  things tend to take different routes around here, and I am here because  of some routes that I think are very puzzling at this point--pretty  much along the lines of what the Senator from North Carolina just  stated.   Last week, speaking to my colleagues, I told this body that we still  weren't any closer to a legitimate and fair deal that promotes and  protects the interests of the American people in a lawful immigration  system, and, at the same time, what is very important is providing a  fair and equitable solution on DACA. But we also want to take care of  the interests of the American people, particularly the safety of the  American people when it comes to criminal aliens.   Since I made that speech a week ago, we made some progress in a  meeting that went on at the White House, which I just told you about.  In spite of the many events of these past 2 weeks, the pronouncement I  just made that we don't have a legitimate, fair deal on one hand to  protect the American people and, on the other hand, to deliver the  humanitarian ends that we need for the DACA kids--that pronouncement  still holds true.   Unfortunately, immigration has become the ``Groundhog Day'' of the  U.S. Senate. Democrats, and even some Republicans, keep repeating the  same mistakes that we have been making for the past 30 years, and they  don't seem to be learning from them. I should probably tell my  colleagues what I have learned in those 30 years.   Thirty years ago, when I voted for an immigration bill--the last  great big reform of immigration--we had 3 million undocumented people  here. In good faith, we thought we had secured the border because  throughout the history of the country, from the beginning, it had never  been illegal to hire an illegal alien, and for the first time, we made  it illegal for our employers to hire someone who is undocumented,  taking away the magnet to come to this country. We thought it would  secure the border if they couldn't be legally hired, and we legalized 3  million people. We didn't take into consideration the whole industry of  false documents in which, if I go to an employer and show him a false  document and they believe it is a true document, then they are not  guilty of hiring me, even though I am technically an undocumented  worker, because I am using a fraudulent document.   What happens when you reward illegality? You get more of it. So  instead of the 3 million people we had legalized, we now have an 11- million person issue. That is what I have been told.  [[Page S287]]    We don't want to repeat those mistakes, and that is why, besides  legalizing DACA kids, border security and doing away with chain  migration are so important. One of the bombers in New York was here  because of chain migration--the terrorist who was just about ready to-- well, he didn't kill anyone, but he injured a lot of people. Then we  have another person who was here on a diversity visa and killed 8  people and injured 12 while driving down the streets of New York. So we  have a major problem we have to take care of.   The President is very interested in taking care of this problem, as  he enunciated in that Tuesday meeting, which was bicameral and  bipartisan and narrowed the issues so that it would be easier for us to  reach an agreement here. Instead of dealing with 100 things, 4 are  taken care of--DACA, border security, doing away with diversity visas,  and doing away with chain migration.   We don't want ``Groundhog Day'' to happen again in the U.S. Senate  because it has been happening quite frequently. In the last 30 years,  we thought we could solve this problem once and for all by taking away  the magnet for people to come here for jobs, and we would secure the  border. Well, 30 years later, you can understand why the President  wants a wall and more border security.   In recent days, several of my colleagues formed what can best be  described as a poor man's version of the Gang of 8. The Gang of 8 is  affiliated with a very bad bill called comprehensive immigration. It  passed in 2013 and went nowhere in the House of Representatives because  it was unrealistic. These six Senators have decided that they--and they  alone--will come up with a solution to the DACA crisis. Now they are  demanding that their solution--and no other solution--receive a vote or  they will shut the government down at midnight tomorrow night. That is  right. These Senators, along with many Democrats, are threatening to  shut the government down unless this plan gets a vote.   Surely, if these Senators are willing to prevent basic services from  being provided to law-abiding, tax-paying American citizens and legal  immigrants, their plan must be something that could garner wide  bipartisan support, pass the House, and be signed into law by the  President. It is far short of those four things that were agreed to at  the bipartisan, bicameral meeting at the White House.   What is actually in this grand plan these Senators have come up with?  Well, as of today, neither I nor my staff have actually seen text of  the bill they are promoting. Why are they threatening a shutdown of the  Federal Government over a bill that almost no one has been given a  chance to read, and why are they threatening to shut down the  government when there is still plenty of time? The deadline is March 5  to come to a meaningful solution that can earn bipartisan support.   Well, here is what we do know about their proposal, from one-page  summaries. The bill would provide a massive amnesty to millions of  people who are in this country unlawfully--before border security,  making the same mistake we did in 1986. Their proposal doesn't just  provide status to the young men and women enrolled in the DACA Program,  which everyone in this Chamber agrees should be done; it dramatically  expands the scope, granting legal status to potentially millions of  others, including those who knowingly violate the law. It is  unthinkable to me that we should reward that unlawful conduct, and it  is ridiculous that Democrats and some Republicans are turning the  tables and making this last-minute demand when there was such a  successful meeting at the White House a week ago Tuesday. It was  bipartisan, bicameral, with the President leading the discussion and  everyone agreeing that we would narrow the 100 issues down to 4: DACA,  border security, diversity visas, and ending chain migration.   Surely then, in exchange for this massive amnesty, their proposal  would provide significant border security, enforcement, and chain  migration reforms. If you were hoping for that answer to be yes, don't  hold your breath. Their proposal has a paltry amount of funding for  existing border security infrastructure improvement. That is right--no  new infrastructure.   Their proposal also doesn't add new legal authorities to make it  easier for law enforcement to apprehend, detain, and deport dangerous  criminal aliens. Now, I think they are somewhat embarrassed that they  don't have some proposals in there that dangerous criminal aliens ought  to be deported easier than they are today.   So I have to ask, is there a reason why these Senators don't want to  make it easier to remove these dangerous criminals? Do they want to  protect sex offenders? Do they want to protect child molesters? Do they  want drunk drivers, gang members, like MS-13, human traffickers, and  drug smugglers roaming throughout this great United States of America?   I can't imagine the answer to any of these questions is yes. If I am  right, then they need to tell the American people why they refused to  give our government the new authorities needed to remove these  individuals who have endangered our communities. They either support  removing dangerous criminals or they don't. There is no going in  between.   Their plan also fails to truly end chain migration. In fact, in that  one-page document I have seen, these Senators acknowledge their chain  migration fix would only affect 26,266 visas per year. That is right,  just a little above 26,000. So in exchange for a potential amnesty for  8 million people, they have agreed to eliminate 26,000 visas a year. I  am no mathematician, but that doesn't seem to be a very balanced  agreement to me. They seem to be making the same mistakes I made in  1986.   Finally, their proposal doesn't even end the Diversity Visa Program.  Remember, this is one of four agreements in a bicameral, bipartisan  meeting with the President of the United States that everybody left the  White House with an agreement that we were going to break within those  four.   This Diversity Visa Program, we all know, is subject to fraud and  abuse, and colleagues on both sides of the aisle have long called for  its elimination--and I mean elimination, not reallocation. The proposal  they are floating around doesn't do that.   To sum it up, this proposal is heavy on amnesty, learning nothing  from the 1986 mistake I learned a lot from. Too bad there is only a  handful of us around the U.S. Senate from that time because there would  be a lot more missionaries saying that what happened in 1986 shouldn't  be repeated.   Also, more importantly, it is nonexistent on security measures. This  approach has been tried time and again, and that approach has failed.  The American people simply don't want to provide a massive amnesty  first and secure the border later. For those Members who think we can  do amnesty first and security second, I think I made it quite clear: I  think that is the wrong approach. I know because I have been here a  long time, and I have been here at the time those mistakes have been  made. We know they failed the goals we sought. I remember why it  failed. Maybe--just maybe--if we actually provide safety first and then  consider more comprehensive reforms later, we can break this repetitive  cycle and end this immigration ``Groundhog Day.''   Maybe I ought to add to those four points that were agreed to at the  White House. The President was promoting another step or two called  comprehensive immigration reform, but get this done first. Secure the  border first. If we actually provide security first, doing so would  instill trust with the American people that we are dedicated to fixing  this immigration issue, not simply delaying the same debate.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.                            ____________________
