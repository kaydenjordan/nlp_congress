 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  life of Lou Galliker, the longtime president of Galliker Dairy Company,  who passed away in December surrounded by his family. He was 87 years  old.   The Galliker Dairy Company is a third-generation, family-owned,  regional dairy company headquartered in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, since  1914. Lou was chairman and president for more than half a century. He  turned his family's dairy business into one of the largest enterprises  in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the mid-Atlantic region.   Galliker Dairy distributes ice cream, milk, iced tea, and other  beverages throughout several States.   Mr. Speaker, Lou was a giant of the dairy world who served as a board  [[Page H75]]  member of the International Association of Ice Cream Manufacturers and  as a president of the Quality Chekd independent dairy processors  cooperative.   He was equally devoted to the Johnstown community, which he served in  various capacities over the years. As president of the Chamber of  Commerce and the greater Johnstown Jaycees and a board member of  several other organizations, Lou was always committed to the region's  success.    Lou Galliker was an incredible force for good in the Johnstown  region, and he leaves a legacy that will be remembered for years to  come. My prayers are with his family.                            ____________________
