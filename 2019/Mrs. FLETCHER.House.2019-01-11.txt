 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues here  and in the Senate to vote to end this shutdown.   Across Texas, there are nearly 30,000 Federal workers who will not  receive their paychecks today, many of them still dutifully performing  their jobs.   This Congress has a constitutional duty to fund the government so  that the agencies can do their important work, the work of and for the  American people, and there is much of it.   In my own district in Houston, for example, this shutdown is delaying  our recovery from one of the most devastating natural disasters in our  country's history. As Members of this body will recall, Hurricane  Harvey hit Houston and the Gulf Coast in August of 2017, causing nearly  $115 billion in damage.   This body appropriated funds to aid the recovery from Harvey, but  nearly 18 months later, the City of Houston, and Harris County, still  awaits these funds. And the funds can be distributed only after the  publication of rules from the Department of Housing and Urban  Development, funds that are desperately needed.   The shutdown has delayed publications of these rules, and I urge my  colleagues to vote to end the shutdown.   I understand that we have differences over issues--including the best  way to secure the border--but shutting down the government is neither a  responsible nor reasonable approach to our differences.   I urge Senator McConnell to take up the multiple spending bills the  House has passed this week, which Senators approved with a large  bipartisan majority just weeks ago, so that we can open the government  and get back to work for the people.                            ____________________
