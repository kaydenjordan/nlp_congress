 Madam Speaker, the bottom line is this rule  would advance unconstitutional legislation that undermines the Second  Amendment for law-abiding citizens. It is amazing that lawful gun  ownership has been so politicized by the left that it is now common to  ask someone their position on the Second Amendment, as if our  constitutional rights are subject to opinion.    The question before us is not: Do we believe in gun rights? It is  rather: Do we believe in the Constitution?   Currently, any firearm purchase from a federally licensed dealer is  subject to a background check. But this legislation would expand this  system--along with the fees and bureaucracy that comes with it--to  private transfers.   For what other constitutional rights will we now assign a fee or a  tax?   Our First Amendment rights?   Our Fifth Amendment rights?   This bill creates a de facto gun registry by involving the Federal  Government in every gun transfer, including private transfers and  gifts.   How else would we enforce these requirements?   For my Democrat friends who suggest that Conservatives and gun owners  are paranoid about a national registry, Madam Speaker, you bet we are.  We know our history, and we know what has happened in other countries.   Madam Speaker, I oppose this rule and all three of these bills.
