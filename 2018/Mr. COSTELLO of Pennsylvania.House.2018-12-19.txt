 Mr. Speaker, I thank Carlos for his  service to this country, to his constituents. He has been an exemplar  of what it means to be a gentleman, somebody who comes in to work here  every day in the Halls of Congress, serving the people, doing his best,  giving it 110 percent.   What I would like to do, if I could, is just thank those residents in  my congressional district residing in Chester  [[Page H10326]]  County, Pennsylvania; Montgomery County, Pennsylvania; Berks County,  Pennsylvania; and Lebanon County, Pennsylvania, for the opportunity to  serve you here in Congress for 2 terms.   This was always, admittedly, a dream of mine, and it is something  that I took great pride in doing. It has been a very humbling  experience. In some respects, it has been a very rewarding experience.  In other respects, it has been challenging and frustrating at times.  But when you are someone who puts your name on a sign and gets elected  to this institution, you carry with yourself a certain humbleness and a  certain sense of purpose that every single one of the 434 Members that  I have served with--probably more since there has been resignations and  reelections--but everyone who I have served with in this institution  takes their job very, very seriously, and I just hope the American  people realize that even as we have differences here, we have a lot  more that binds us together as Americans, and everyone is here trying  to do their very best.                                time  2045    I would also like to, real briefly, just thank my parents, Sherry and  Tony, for their support through the years; my wife, Christine; my  children, Ryan and Caroline; and the many great members of my staff who  have just done an absolutely wonderful job. I think one thing that  every single Member of Congress can universally agree to is that the  staff is underappreciated, undercompensated; but without them, this  institution would not run, and we would not be able to be as effective  as we are day in and day out.   I would particularly like to recognize Lauryn Schothorst and Dante  Cutrona, my chiefs of staff through the years; Kori Walter, my district  director; Jason Carver, my constituent services director; and if I  start naming all the other staff persons, I would probably forget one.  But I just want each and every one of them to know how personally  grateful I am for their service to Pennsylvania's Sixth Congressional  District, this country, and myself.   And for all those whom I have served with, from the bottom of my  heart, thank you for being a friend and being an advocate for this  country and for your constituents all across this country.   This is a very special institution. It has been a real privilege to  serve in it. God bless each and every one of you, and God bless  America.
