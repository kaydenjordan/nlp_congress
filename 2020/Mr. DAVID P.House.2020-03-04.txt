 ROE of Tennessee led the Pledge of Allegiance as  follows:         I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of       America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation       under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.                            ____________________     ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize Ethan Magness, who delivered today's opening prayer.   Ethan is the senior pastor at First Christian Church in my hometown  of  [[Page H1475]]  Johnson City, Tennessee, where my wife, Clarinda, has attended for many  years.   We are pleased to welcome Pastor Magness here today.   Ethan is originally from Elizabethton, Tennessee, and graduated from  Swarthmore College. He received his master of divinity from Emmanuel  Christian Seminary and served for 10 years at the Mountain Christian  Church in Joppa, Maryland.   Ethan founded and still directs the Semester in Ministry program at  Milligan College. He has served as an adjunct professor there for 10  years.   I am proud to welcome Ethan; his wife, Betsy; and his son, Evan, to  our Nation's Capitol today. I am also pleased he could share the Word  of God with us today.                            ____________________
