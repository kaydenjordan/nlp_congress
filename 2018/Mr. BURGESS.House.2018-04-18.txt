 Mr. Speaker, the opioid epidemic has swept across the  country impacting millions of Americans who lost loved ones to this  preventable crisis. No community is immune.   Just as the President of the United States has said, this is, in  fact, the crisis next door.   This is even more true in neighborhoods in north Texas where we are  all too familiar with this fatal epidemic.   Overdose deaths from opioids have increased more than five times in  the last 30 years, and it is estimated that more than 115 Americans die  each and every day from opiate-related overdoses. There is no question  that we must act to stop this crisis.   To that end, I am very grateful to the members of my committee, the  Committee on Energy and Commerce. I am grateful to the chairman of the  committee for participating in this hour.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden), who  is the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee.     Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the full committee  for his participation in this hour tonight.   The chairman is correct; our committee has a history of working in a  bipartisan fashion. This, obviously, is an illness that can strike  regardless of political party or political persuasion; and in the  interest of that theme, I am happy to yield to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Gene Green), my counterpart, the ranking member on the Democratic  side of the dais in the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Health  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his participation  this evening.   Again, the problem is not likely to be solved by one political party  or the other. It is going to require a collaborative approach. Opioid  abuse can happen by access to dangerous drugs in a family member's  medicine cabinet or by obtaining them illegally. The fight against this  crisis is indeed a team effort, and we must evaluate it from all  angles.   We must consider how opiate medications are produced and distributed,  and we must look at how agencies track and respond to distribution  discrepancies. We are required to take a hard look at how the  medications are prescribed and dispensed, while addressing the disposal  of unused medication. We need to look at the treatment for those who  suffer from addictions and the future of pain medications.   It is also imperative that we address the access and enforcement of  illicit drugs. We must work to stop the unfettered distribution of  harmful drugs that flow into this country from outside our borders.   Earlier this year, I joined the Commissioner of the Food and Drug  Administration, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, in visiting the international mail  facility at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York. This facility is one  of nine in our country and acts as a barrier for these illicit and  dangerous drugs being sent to America through the international mail.  The Food and Drug Administration and the United States Customs and  Border Patrol, together, work to identify and destroy dangerous  substances hidden in pieces of mail, but more authority is needed to  provide these agencies with tools to swiftly act and act more  efficiently.   There are millions of suspicious packages full of illicit drugs and  other contraband crossing our borders. Sometimes the FDA is powerless  in its ability to destroy these harmful and illicit substances,  sometimes they are required to send them back to the sender, and  sometimes they will see a package recycled and brought back into this  country for yet another try. That, Mr. Speaker, must end.   Now, as chairman of the Subcommittee on Health, I have already held  three hearings and considered a total of 67 related opiate bills. Last  October, we opened the doors of the subcommittee to any Member, not  just of the subcommittee, not just of the full committee, but any  Member of Congress who wanted to come and talk to us about problems  they have seen in their district related to opiates, solutions that  they may be considering or people in their communities might have asked  them to consider.   We heard from well over 50 Members of Congress that day, and as a  consequence of that Member involvement, we have distilled these 67  pieces of legislation. We have had three legislative hearings. We have  heard from key members of the administration. We have heard from  stakeholders who are at the forefront of our efforts to stem this  epidemic.   We have evaluated this crisis from all fronts, from public health and  prevention and intervention, law enforcement, education and recovery,  and then finally, lastly, looking at the Medicaid and Medicare programs  and the role that they may play. It is evident that this is a  multifaceted problem and will require an all-hands-on-deck approach.   As a physician, I also understand and respect the importance of  successfully treating and managing patients with chronic pain. One of  the reasons that most of us went into the practice of medicine was to  be of service. One of the highest callings is to ask to be worthy to  serve the suffering. Opiates are an essential tool. We must respect the  fatal and addictive properties that opiates possess, while also  understanding the vital role that these medications play in the lives  of individuals who are suffering from serious or chronic illness, such  as cancer.   As we evaluate this complex issue, we must strike the right balance  between necessary enforcement and patient safety. Unfortunately, there  is no easy answer and there is no single party to blame.   We also know that Congress cannot fight this battle alone. We must  all work to strengthen our commitment to overcome this scourge. With an  average of more than 100 Americans dying  [[Page H3434]]  every day from opiate overdoses, we must be willing to ask hard  questions and consider solutions.   At this time, I am pleased to yield to the gentleman from Mississippi  (Mr. Harper), who is a member of the Health Subcommittee and also the  chairman of the Energy Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations and  has led a number of our efforts in trying to control the opiate crisis.   Mr. Harper, thank you for joining us tonight.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Mississippi for  participating in our Special Order tonight. I thank him for his  leadership in the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations and the  work that he has done to help control this crisis.   I now yield to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie), vice  chairman of the Health Subcommittee, for his observations.                                time  1845     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for his  participation this evening.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr.  McKinley), the vice chairman of the Environment Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from West Virginia  for his comments.   Mr. Speaker, now I am pleased to yield to the gentleman from Michigan  (Mr. Walberg).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his participation  this evening. He brings some valuable insights, and I am always  grateful to hear his perspective from the State of Michigan.   I now go way out West to California. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the  gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Mimi Walters) for her thoughts on the  crisis.     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her  participation in this evening's Special Order hour.   Mr. Speaker, it is now my great privilege to yield to the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Griffith), the vice chairman of the Subcommittee on  Oversight and Investigations in the Energy and Commerce Committee,  certainly one of the most thoughtful Members of this body.  [[Page H3436]]                                     time  1900     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  participation.   As the gentleman was talking about, the fact that in his State and  the surrounding States it is possible that, if there is not  collaboration between State prescription monitoring programs, a doctor  or a pharmacist would never know what other prescriptions might have  been written for a patient.   Our committee actually has a history of working on this. Charlie  Norwood, a Member of Congress from Georgia, 15 years ago came up with  the National All Schedules Prescription Electronic Reporting Act, or  NASPER. We have authorized NASPER several times. I am happy to say  that, this year, in the omnibus bill, there actually was funding, for  the first time, provided for the NASPER program. It is just a  beginning.   Clearly, the need for this national reporting program is so critical.  In a State like Texas, we are huge, where we don't even think about  other States in Texas. But the crossing of State lines with this  information can be extremely powerful and, in fact, it can be  lifesaving.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for bringing that up, and I thank  him for the work that he is doing on the Oversight and Investigations  Subcommittee, and I thank him for the work he is doing on the  prevention of pill dumping.   Mr. Speaker, the fact that the opioid crisis is devastating our  country and undermining our social structures and eroding our economic  productivity is, every day, more and more tragic. But the good news,  Mr. Speaker, is the current trends can be reversed. We are building on  years of previous bipartisan efforts. We all know that our action is  important to the families, to the communities, to our constituents, and  to the patients impacted by the opioid epidemic.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
