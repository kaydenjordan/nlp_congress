 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize William  Glanville of Milford, PA. Mr. Glanville is a U.S. Navy veteran who  served in World War II. I am pleased that he will soon be honored by  his fellow veterans from Pike County and the surrounding region for his  lifetime of service, dedication to his nation, and commitment to his  fellow veterans as a longtime member of the American Legion.   Born and raised in Carbondale, PA, Mr. Glanville enlisted in the U.S.  Navy in 1943 and eventually volunteered to join the then newly formed  Underwater Demolition Teams, UDTs--the forerunners of the U.S. Navy  SEALs. Known as frogmen, UDTs were an elite force established during  World War II to fulfill a specialized mission, including to conduct  beach reconnaissance, submarine operations, and lay and clear  underwater mines. UDTs would participate in numerous conflicts in the  decades following World War II.   Mr. Glanville was first assigned to a UDT deployed to the European  Theater, where he worked with his fellow frogmen to clear the beaches  of Normandy prior to D-Day, undoubtedly one of the most important  assaults conducted by the Allied Forces during the war. After this  operation, Mr. Glanville was assigned to the Pacific Theater where he  participated in missions at Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima, Saipan, and Borneo.  After the Japanese surrender on August 15, 1945, Mr. Glanville's UDT  unit completed the underwater survey of the USS Missouri in preparation  for the surrender ceremonies that took place on September 2, 1945.  Through their heroic action during World War II, men like Mr. Glanville  played a critical role in the Allied victory and laid the foundation  for today's modern naval special warfare units.   Following his retirement from the Navy in 1955, Mr. Glanville  returned home to Carbondale but worked in New Jersey as a construction  equipment operating engineer until his retirement. He then moved to  Pike County, PA and became actively involved with the Marsh Kellogg  American Legion Post 139 in Milford. As a member of Post 139, Mr.  Glanville held numerous leadership roles, including executive board  member, judge advocate, adjutant, second vice commander, first vice  commander, and twice as commander. In 2016, he was named commander  emeritus for his enduring service to the post and his community.   William Glanville's life is distinguished by his dedication to  service and his possession of exemplary character traits such as  fidelity, honor, and humility. He is a man who, in his youth, chose a  path that took him to among the most dangerous parts of the globe in  the defense of freedom. He participated in some of our Nation's most  important military operations and did so knowing that he might, like so  many of his brothers and sisters did over the course of the war, pay  the ultimate sacrifice for his country. I am pleased to honor his  accomplishments as his fellow veterans recognize him for a lifetime of  dedicated service to his nation and his community.                            ____________________
