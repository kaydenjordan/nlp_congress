 Madam Speaker, I am going to vote for this bill because  it provides desperately needed money for small businesses and  hospitals. But we have got to do better by our State and local  governments. We must support the work of our cops, firefighters, EMTs,  and teachers.   New Jersey is critical in the fight against this virus. We have more  scientists and engineers per square mile than anywhere in the world and  the best education system in the country,  [[Page H1945]]  so supporting our State and local governments in New Jersey is key to  beating this virus and taking care of Americans.
