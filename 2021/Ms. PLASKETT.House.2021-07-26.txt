 Mr. Speaker, the Biden administration's proposed $2.65  trillion American Jobs Plan contains a commitment of resources and  investments to overcome structural economic inequity, driven by decades  of racial and gender discrimination and exclusion.   In addition to being undercapitalized by the PPP in the midst of the  COVID-19 pandemic, Black business owners experienced an acute decline  of 41 percent in their numbers; Latinx businesses fell by 32 percent;  Asian businesses, 26 percent. Compounding these inequities, Black,  Indigenous, and people of color, particularly, women of color, have  been hardest hit by unemployment and job losses.   These groups have been left behind and held back for far too long,  resulting in multigenerational poverty, wage, and wealth gaps. To meet  the moment, House Democrats are proposing systemic solutions rooted in  equity to ensure prosperity for all Americans. These solutions are  driven by targeted, long-term investments to improve our infrastructure  by igniting our economy for equity, baking in accountability to  equitable practices and outcomes and fostering an ecosystem where the  safety, health, and well-being of the people are a priority.                            ____________________
