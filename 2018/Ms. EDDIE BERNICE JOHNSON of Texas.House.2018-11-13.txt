 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of  House Resolution 1052 which affirms cooperation on space research,  exploration, and utilization between the United States and its great  ally, Australia.   On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the landing of Apollo 11 on the  Moon, it is fitting that we acknowledge the contribution of NASA's  tracking station located at Honeysuckle Creek in Australia and  Australia's Parkes radio telescope to the success of the Apollo 11  mission.   Indeed, Neil Armstrong's famous words announcing humankind's first  step on the Moon were first received by those facilities located in  Australia before being relayed to the rest of the world.   Australia has been a crucial partner to the U.S. space program ever  since.   For example, scientists and engineers from the Australian Space  Agency worked with NASA at the Canberra Deep Space Communication  Complex to support communications for the landing of rovers on Mars,  the arrival of New Horizons to Pluto, and the entry of Juno into orbit  around Jupiter.   And NASA will build on its experience conducting sounding rocket  launch operations at Australia's Woomera Test Range by using the  Equatorial Launch Australia launch range for several Astrophysics  missions that are scheduled for 2019.   As Ranking Member of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,  I have been engaged in ensuring that NASA establish the requisite  building blocks to ensure the success of the Nation's space exploration  program.   One of those building blocks will be international cooperation and  partnerships.   The National Academies' Committee on Human Spaceflight recommended in  its 2014 ``Pathways to Exploration'' report that NASA, among other  recommendations, ``vigorously pursue opportunities for international  and commercial collaboration in order to leverage financial resources  and capabilities of other nations and commercial entities''.   Peaceful international cooperation has been a hallmark of NASA's  approach since its inception. House Resolution 1052 resolution affirms  the need for such cooperation and partnership with Australia.   I urge my fellow Members to pass this Resolution.                                time  1745
