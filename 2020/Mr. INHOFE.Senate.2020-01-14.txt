 Madam President, I am pleased to recognize Mrs.  Norma Kaehler on the occasion of her retirement. Norma has been a hero  of the aviation community for more than two decades. Most recently, she  served as the managing director for government and corporate affairs at  American Airlines Group.   Not many may remember this, but Norma got her start on Capitol Hill  working for Senator Mack Mattingly of Georgia, and she never forgot  that taking care of constituents is our No. 1 priority around here. She  has always worked on behalf of the employees of American Airlines on  Capitol Hill, tens of thousands of airline pilots, mechanics and  maintenance personnel, flight attendants, gate agents, and everyone in  the back office--all responsible for ensuring planes depart and land on  time--have benefited from her advocacy on their behalf. I can  personally attest to this during her tireless advocacy of legislation I  sponsored that protected the retirement benefits of American Airline  employees after the 2013 merger.   In the course of her career, Norma Kaehler has worked for multiple  airlines: Trans World Airlines, American Airlines, and American  Airlines Group; and she played a major role in every FAA  reauthorization bill enacted by Congress. Through it all, Norma  remained an unflappable, passionate advocate for aviation. I know I  join her family and American Airlines in thanking Norma for her years  of service and contributions to the aviation community.   Congratulations on your retirement. We will miss you around  here.                            ____________________
