 Mr. President, I rise to voice my strong support for  the passage of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or the USMCA.   When I travel the State of Nebraska, I always hear directly from our  farmers and our ag producers. Nebraska's farmers have endured some of  the most challenging setbacks in recent memory. The severe flooding  from last spring devastated thousands of acres of our farm and our  ranch land, brought hundreds of livestock deaths, and destroyed barns,  countless grain bins, hay, and critical farm equipment. This list of  daunting obstacles continues to grow.   Last July, the Gering-Fort Laramie-Goshen irrigation tunnel collapsed  and cut off a crucial source of surface irrigation water to the western  region of our State for several weeks.   Only a few days earlier, a devastating fire broke out in a Tyson beef  processing plant in Holcomb, KS. The plant processed about 6,000 head  of cattle every single day. That is roughly 6 percent of the total fed  cattle processing capacity in the United States.   The effects of the plant's closure rippled throughout the entire  cattle industry and the beef processing chain. This is all in addition  to 5 years of low commodity prices, the unfair small refinery  exemptions for oil refiners, and the cloud of uncertainty over trade.   While all of these factors have caused anxiety and unpredictability,  there is one solution that Nebraska's farmers, ranchers, ag producers,  manufacturers, and hard-working men and women have made clear, and that  is the passage of the USMCA.   Nebraska's farmers and ranchers have a different lifestyle than most  people. Their patience is steadfast. They plan for the long term. They  can envision how they want their land to look, not only next year but  100 years into the future. It is in their DNA, and families are fed  around the world because of it.   They are optimists, but they are realists. As Secretary Perdue  recently said, ``they know you can't plant in August and harvest in  September.''   That is exactly right. Our producers have remained patient during  these tough and turbulent times because they know that there is an  opportunity for a better, long-term trade solution on the horizon.   The USMCA would replace the 25-year-old North American Free Trade  Agreement, or NAFTA, and bring the deal into the 21st century, while  fortifying our strong trading relationships with Canada and Mexico and  growing critical market access for Nebraska.   The heart of Nebraska beats in the same rhythm as agriculture. It is  who we are, and as the world knows that it is what we do better than  anyone. So it is not hard to understand why our State needs this deal.   America's neighbors to the north and south are the destination of 44  percent of Nebraska's total exports. In 2017, Nebraska shipped $447  million of agricultural products to Canada and a staggering $898  million to Mexico. These exports include hundreds of millions of  dollars' worth of Nebraska's high-quality corn, soybeans, ethanol, and  beef.   Specifically, the USMCA maintains and strengthens those markets for  corn and soybeans. It also allows U.S. beef producers to continue to  grow their exports to Mexico, which have risen 800 percent since NAFTA  was first ratified.   In 2018 alone, Nebraska exported over $250 million dollars of beef to  both countries.   It is important to note that the benefits of the USMCA extend far  beyond our farmland. Agricultural trade between Canada and Mexico  supports nearly 54,000 jobs in the State of Nebraska. According to the  Nebraska Department of Agriculture, Nebraska's $6.4 billion in  agricultural exports in 2017 translated into $8.19 billion in  additional economic activity. For the good of our State and our Nation,  these markets need to be protected.   The USMCA goes even further than NAFTA. It adopts labor and  environmental standards that Democrats have long advocated for. It  requires that 40 to 45 percent of auto content be made by workers who  earn at least $16 an hour by 2023. This will undoubtedly help close the  gap in labor standards between our Nation and Mexico.   According to the U.S. Trade Representative, the deal includes new  provisions to prohibit the importation of goods produced by forced  labor.   The USMCA addresses violence against workers exercising their labor  rights, and it ensures that migrant workers are protected under labor  laws.   The deal brings labor obligations into the core of the agreement, and  most importantly, it makes them fully enforceable.   On top of that, the USMCA deploys the most advanced, comprehensive  set of environmental protections of any trade agreement in our Nation's  history. The list of environmental protections includes first-ever  articles to improve air quality, support forest management, and ensure  procedures for studies on its environmental impact.   New provisions protect a variety of marine species, such as whales  and sea turtles, and there are prohibitions on shark finning.   Unlike NAFTA, the USMCA provides enforcement mechanisms that will  ensure that all countries not only meet but strengthen their  environmental responsibilities.   Lastly, I want to point out to my Democrat colleagues the support the  USMCA is receiving on both sides of the aisle.   I recently heard Tom Vilsack say this:         I think under any evaluation, from the U.S. agriculture       perspective it clearly is a better deal. So, with that our       hope is that it gets done, and gets done soon.    These are not the words of some Trump administration official. These  are the words of President Obama's former Secretary of Agriculture.   Here is another quote from Dan Glickman:         We have a good agreement. We cannot let the perfect be the       enemy of the good. This is a good deal for America and       particularly a good deal for farmers at this vulnerable time.    Again, this isn't support from some Republican Member of Congress.  This is support that is voiced by President Clinton's former Secretary  of Agriculture.   What is more, all former Agriculture Secretaries since the Reagan  administration have voiced their full support for the USMCA.   We have seen the headlines of endorsements, and one especially caught  my attention. The title of a recent op-ed read: ``Democrats Should Give  Trump a Win on His Trade Deal with Mexico and Canada.'' Well, this  piece wasn't composed by a conservative publication. It was penned by  the editorial board of the Washington Post.   Finally, a group of 14 House Democrats sent a letter to Speaker  Pelosi last July urging her to take up the USMCA for a vote.   The letter reads: ``Canada and Mexico are by far our most important  trading partners, and we need to restore certainty in these critical  relationships that support millions of American jobs.''   Both sides of the aisle agree that the USMCA is a significant win for  farmers, ranchers, ag producers, and America's economy as a whole.   Nebraska's farmers and ranchers have maintained patience in these  tough times. They deserve to know without a doubt that they will  continue to have access to their two largest markets and closest  trading partners.   As I said earlier, farmers aren't just thinking about themselves.  They are planning for the future generations that will proudly carry on  their life's work and continue feeding our world.   Right now, we have an opportunity to come together around a  commonsense, bipartisan agreement that will benefit the American people  both now and for years to come. Now it is up to Congress to deliver.   I urge Speaker Pelosi to stop needlessly delaying this vote, and I  encourage all of my Democrat colleagues not  [[Page S5823]]  to allow politics to stand in the way of sound policy. It is time to  push the USMCA over the finish line.   I yield the floor.
