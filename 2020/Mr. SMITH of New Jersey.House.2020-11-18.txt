 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I will begin by thanking our distinguished chairman, Eliot Engel, for  his extraordinary leadership as chairman of the House Foreign Affairs  Committee for all these years. He is a good friend. We have worked on  so many issues together. I thank him again for his leadership. It has  been extraordinary. Your bipartisanship has been an example to us all,  so I thank you for that, Eliot, and I really mean that deeply.   I also thank my good friend and colleague from Texas, the ranking  member,   Michael McCaul, for his support of this legislation and other  important initiatives.   Also, Eliot, thank you again.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7276, the Desert Locust  Control Act, which I introduced along with my good friend and  colleague, Karen Bass. She is chairwoman, as you know, of the Africa,  Global Health, Global Human Rights and International Organizations  Subcommittee. I am the ranking member. In previous times I was the  chairman, and she was my ranking member, and we have worked very  closely together on all issues dealing with the health and well-being  of people around the world through the global health portion of our  portfolio, but also, with a very particular emphasis on Africa.   This bipartisan bill would create an interagency task force that  would address the crisis of increasingly biblical proportions caused by  swarms of desert locusts, which have been compounded by the COVID  crisis, which our country and so many other nations are dealing with.   Indeed, as serious as COVID has been, and it has been serious, as we  all know, the unfortunate fact is that there are many other threats to  the welfare and  [[Page H5897]]  well-being of so many people in the developing world, including Sub- Saharan Africa, where the likelihood of food insecurity looms larger  thanks to the pandemic.   Just how bad is it?   Swarms of hundreds of millions of locusts darken the sky, descend  upon an area, stripping it entirely of its vegetation. Crops are just  decimated in a matter of minutes and hours.   Unfortunately, due in part to this bad timing with a pandemic, we are  witnessing the real possibility of famine in many countries of east  Africa, where over 27 million people are now estimated to be suffering  from acute food insecurity, which is defined as the sudden lack of food  or the ability to produce or access minimum requirements of food.   I should note that in the case of one of the nations most impacted,  Ethiopia, the political situation has simultaneously deteriorated, so  that the country is now on the brink of civil war with the added crisis  of refugees fleeing conflicted areas added to the mix of cascading  calamities and compounding crises.   Indeed, the Food and Agriculture Organization, the FAO, estimates  that this infestation of locusts will persist until at least March 2021  in both Ethiopia and Somalia.   Our bill would create an interagency working group comprised of  representatives of the USAID, State, the NSC, the Department of  Defense, and the Department of Agriculture to formulate a strategic  plan to address this and future locust outbreaks, as well as other  similarly destructive pests, such as fall armyworm, which wreaks  tremendous havoc on crops annually.   The working group would also include a representative from our  mission to the United Nations food agencies based in Rome, where our  current ambassador, Kip Tom, is doing a stellar job interacting with  both the World Food Programme and the Food and Agriculture  Organization, as well as locust-impacted countries.   Ambassador Kip Tom has briefed me and others repeatedly. We have  talked about best practices on the phone in Skype phone calls, and  again, I want to single him out for the tremendous job that he has done  in trying to mitigate this crisis.   The World Food Programme has also been a tremendous help, as it has  been in so many other places around the world, under the extraordinary  leadership of David Beasley.                                time  1345    Indeed, the international community has recognized the yeoman's work  by awarding the World Food Program the Nobel Peace Prize.   Ambassador Tom has been pushing the FAO in particular to proactively  address the problem and adopt the better use of technology. For  example, use of apps on smartphones in Kenya advocated by the  Ambassador has led to roughly 80 percent of the data collected on the  location of desert locusts, thereby allowing for the targeted  mobilization of aerial assets for locust eradication and control.   It is innovation such as this, and the adoption of best practices,  which our interagency group will focus on identifying and implementing.  Indeed, we also think that the working group will help ensure that our  taxpayer dollars are spent in the most effective way possible. The  United States Government has committed over $24 million to the USAID,  and that has made a difference as well.   While the focus of our bill is on East Africa, other countries like  Yemen, India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan are threatened by these  spreading swarms as well. Indeed, Yemen has become a breeding ground  for locusts crossing over into the Horn of Africa, compounding the  problem caused by indigenous swarms in the countries of the Horn.   Again, Mr. Speaker, I urge strong support for the bill. And again, I  thank our distinguished chairman for his leadership on this bill and so  many others.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5586, the Haiti  Development, Accountability, and Institutional Transparency Initiative  Act, authored by Mr. Jeffries and Ann Wagner.   Haiti remains the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere and  continues to struggle under fragile public institutions. As we speak,  Haiti is facing a constitutional crisis without a sitting parliament  after failing to organize legislative elections in 2019. We continue to  encourage the Government of Haiti to hold these elections as soon as  possible.   Haiti continues to struggle with disaster recovery from the  earthquake in 2010 and Hurricane Matthew in 2016, as well as civil  unrest, increasing gang violence, and accusations of government  corruption and human rights abuses.   Haiti remains the second largest recipient of U.S. assistance in the  region, including over $128 million in foreign assistance appropriated  by Congress in 2019 for economic development, democracy and rule of  law, and critical support for the Haitian National Police.   This legislation prioritizes anticorruption efforts, press freedoms,  and human rights, and it requires the Department of State to develop a  strategy with benchmarks and indicators to measure the progress toward  stated objectives for U.S. assistance.   This bill also requires an assessment of U.S. support for disaster  resilience to ensure that our assistance is effectuating Haiti's  recovery efforts and strengthening infrastructure against future  disasters.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support it, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7703, the Caribbean Basin  Security Initiative Authorization Act, authored by Mr. Espaillat and  Mr. Rooney, and I want to thank them for their leadership on this.   The countries of the Caribbean continue to face serious security  challenges from criminal organizations, drug trafficking, corruption,  and threats to the rule of law that seriously jeopardize the people of  these nations as well as U.S. security interests in the region.   Since 2010, the U.S. Congress has provided nearly $677 million to  support the region's efforts to address these threats under the  Caribbean Basin Security Initiative, or CBSI. Funding under CBSI has  supported training for law enforcement, counternarcotics efforts,  border and port security, and strengthening of the rule of law. The  assistance has strengthened U.S. security cooperation with our  Caribbean partners and remains critical as transnational criminal and  terrorist organizations continue to threaten their security.   The legislation before us today authorizes $74.8 million for the CBSI  for each year until 2025 and continues to prioritize capacity building  for local law enforcement, disruption of criminal organizations, drug  and firearm interdiction, rule of law, and anticorruption efforts.   The bill also supports disaster resilience and requires the State  Department to establish benchmarks and indicators to track progress  towards CBSI's stated objectives.   I would also point out this legislation also includes important  requirements for monitoring and countering the malign influence of the  Chinese Communist Party in the region.   I congratulate the gentleman on his very fine bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 672. I want to thank Marcy  Kaptur for offering it. It is a very important bill to express support  for the Three Seas Initiative.   Launched by 12 of our close friends in central and Eastern Europe,  the Three Seas Initiative seeks to expand cross-border energy,  transportation, and digital infrastructure, as well as to boost  economic development in the region.   Though it is a regional initiative, it has global implications that  serve not only European but also U.S. security and economic interests.   For far too long, Mr. Speaker, Vladimir Putin has had an energy  chokehold on much of Europe. In response, I have worked with my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to strongly oppose Putin's  efforts to weaponize Russia's energy resources, including by working to  ensure that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is never completed.   Moreover, we in Congress have expressed growing concern that the CCP  is exporting corruption, debt traps, poor labor and environmental  standards to Europe and across the world through its 17+1 and Belt and  Road Initiatives.   We have also raised the alarm for our EU and NATO allies about the  threats that Huawei and the Chinese Communist Party pose as partners.   The Three Seas Initiative seeks to address these concerns. It aims to  decrease European dependence on Russian energy by financing new routes  for non-Russian energy suppliers and to provide positive alternatives  to PRC investments in the region.   We must support our allies in Central and Eastern Europe as they  seek, through the Three Seas Initiative, to reduce their dependence on  Moscow's and Beijing's economic overtures.   Only together can we face the threats posed by the authoritarian  regimes in China and Russia. Therefore, I ask my colleagues to support  this important legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1415     Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to begin by thanking my good  friend, Chairman McGovern, for sponsoring this important resolution. I  am very proud to be one of its cosponsors.   Both Mr. McGovern and I co-chair the Lantos Human Rights Commission,  and I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, we have been trying for years to hold  Russia to account for these kinds of despicable displays where, as was  pointed out by my good friend from New York, very visible opposition  leaders and others have been targeted by the Russian regime for  poisoning and other kinds of deadly deeds. So I want to thank him for,  again, bringing our attention and the House's attention to this  additional terrible misdeed by Vladimir Putin.   Each of us in this House, I believe, were appalled to learn that Mr.  Navalny had been poisoned with a Soviet-era chemical nerve agent. Of  course, we are relieved that he seems to be doing well, but that  doesn't in any way mitigate the terrible act that was committed to try  to kill him. We are not surprised though. Just 2 years ago, the same  chemical nerve agent was used in an attack on United Kingdom soil  against former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal. The attack  severely injured him, his daughter, and a police officer, and also cost  the life of an innocent British citizen.   Moreover, since Putin came to power, as was pointed out a moment ago,  numerous Russian journalists, human rights activists, opposition  leaders, whistleblowers, and others who opposed his regime have been  murdered or died in mysterious circumstances.   As noted in the resolution, Ranking Member McCaul and Chairman Engel  wrote a letter to the President after the attack to request an  investigation into whether Russia had, once again, used a lethal  chemical weapon in violation of international law.   Pursuant to the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare  Elimination Act, this request started the clock on a 60-day evaluation  period to make such a determination. Unfortunately, the deadline has  passed, so we respectfully--all of us--ask the administration to  release the findings of its investigation and to do so without any  delay.   If it is determined, as we suspect, that the Putin regime is behind  the attack, then additional U.S. sanctions must be imposed. His regime  must be held accountable for resorting to such cruel and barbaric  methods to silence his critics.   I was glad to see the E.U. support a Franco-German plan to impose  sanctions on Russians suspected to be behind Mr. Navalny's poisoning. I  also continue to hope that our German friends will heed the growing  calls around Europe and within Germany since the attack to reconsider  their support for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this resolution. Again, I  want to thank Chairman McGovern for authoring it, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for  time, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 8259, which prohibits Russian  participation in the G7. I thank my friend and colleague, Mr. Meeks,  for authoring this bill.   As I have said time and time again, Vladimir Putin is not a friend of  the United States nor of our allies.   In the past few years, we have witnessed his regime invade and occupy  [[Page H5908]]  parts of Ukraine and certainly Georgia in South Ossetia and Abkhazia;  unleash devastating cyberattacks against our allies; prop up corrupt  regimes in Syria and Venezuela; use a banned nerve agent to try to kill  a former Russian spy, as we just saw with the resolution that preceded  this, opposition activist Alexey Navalny; meddle in our elections; and  much more.   The Russian President's actions speak for themselves. At almost every  opportunity, Putin pursues policies that undermine American and allied  interests around the world.   The Group of Seven is a forum that brings together like-minded  democracies to tackle important global issues. A dangerous and corrupt  dictator that assassinates his own people cannot be trusted to be a  reasonable partner on the world stage. We must not turn a blind eye to  this reality.   This bill would prohibit Russia from being readmitted to the Group of  Seven until Putin fully restores the territorial integrity of Ukraine,  parts of Georgia, and Moldova, and stops interfering in the democratic  processes of the United States and our allies.   The bill also demonstrates that Congress takes very seriously the  safety of American troops serving overseas--it is our utmost priority-- and that we remain concerned about the challenges Russia poses to U.S.  and NATO efforts to bring peace and stability to Afghanistan.   Maintaining the integrity of the Group of Seven is vital to its  success. Russia cannot be invited back in while Vladimir Putin  continues to undermine the efforts of democratic states to build a  freer and more prosperous world.   Mr. Speaker, I have no more requests for time, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution marking the  50th anniversary of entry into force of the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.   I want to thank our distinguished colleagues, Mr. Sherman and Mr.  Banks, and some of the other cosponsors. Mr. Sherman took the lead on  it, and I thank him for that, in marking this important anniversary.   For the last 50 years, the NPT Treaty, Non-Proliferation Treaty, has  been the bedrock upon which nonproliferation policy has been built.  More than 185 countries around the world have ratified the treaty,  adding their support to the responsible use of nuclear technology,  while reducing the likelihood of nuclear conflict.   Every country has the right to use nuclear energy for peaceful  purposes; however, we must ensure that the number of states armed with  nuclear weapons does not grow. The proliferation of these weapons in  unstable, dangerous regimes like North Korea and Iran only makes the  world more dangerous and the use of those weapons of mass destruction  more likely.   Under the treaty, nuclear weapons states agree not to transfer  nuclear weapons or technology to nonnuclear weapons states. States  without nuclear weapons are bound to accept IAEA safeguards in order to  verify any and all nuclear activities are peaceful.   The treaty also requires all countries to pursue good faith  negotiations related to nuclear disarmament. There may be disagreement  on how to achieve such disarmament, but in the meantime, the U.S.  remains committed to continuing to reduce risk and enhance global  stability through maintaining a modern, safe, and secure nuclear  deterrent and reaffirming our defense commitment to our allies. We seek  to engage countries like China, which is growing its nuclear arsenal,  and Russia, which is developing new nuclear armed weapons systems, on  enhanced arms control regimes.   Finally, the United States continues to seek to prevent the spread of  nuclear weapons to rogue states.   Again, I want to thank my friend, the gentleman from California (Mr.  Sherman), for sponsoring this bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for  yielding. I thank Mr. Wilson for his great work, and I want to thank my  distinguished colleagues on both sides of the aisle, Eliot Engel and    Michael McCaul. Thank you for your support in helping to get this  legislation to the floor. I thank Chairman Keating, as well.   Mr. Speaker, I urge swift enactment into law of this bipartisan bill  called the Belarus Democracy Human Rights and Sovereignty Act of 2020,  which I have introduced.   And here is why this legislation is absolutely needed right now; not  next year, not when we come back, hopefully the Senate will take it up  if it passes today, and I think it will, but we need this right now.   Many of my colleagues know, and perhaps they know it well, that  Belarus was perhaps the nation most mired in the Soviet past, with an  inefficient economy and a strongman autocrat, really a dictator, in  charge for over two and a half decades, Alexander Lukashenko. Yet the  indomitable spirit of freedom stirred among the people of Belarus, and  when a patently false election--another one--was announced on August 9  declaring Lukashenko the winner, the people took to the streets. And  they are still on the streets today.   The OSCE Moscow Mechanism reported November 5 that there is  ``'overwhelming' evidence that Belarus' August 9 presidential election  results were falsified and as `systematic' human rights violations have  been committed by the country's security forces in response to the  peaceful demonstrations that the vote sparked.''   Now, reports out of Belarus indicate that police are using  increasingly violent tactics against these peaceful protesters.   The BBC summed it up yesterday in an article titled, ``Belarus  protesters battered, bruised, but defiant after 100 days,'' which said  in part, ``opposition protesters remain defiant in Belarus despite  police brutality, 100 days after they first took to the streets to  denounce the reelection of President Alexander Lukashenko. Police in  helmets and body armour throw women holding flowers and balloons into  police vans.''   And, of course, then it only gets worse. ``Officers tear-gas elderly  people on a pensioners' march. . . .   ``Yet every Sunday thousands still pour into the streets of the  capital Minsk, condemning what they see as Mr. Lukashenko's fraudulent  9 August victory. . . . `'   There is a report that points out, again a BBC report, ``Alesya, a  31-year-old worker in the IT industry, regularly attends the Sunday  rallies. On 15 November, however, things turned nasty very quickly.   ``When she arrived at the square,'' she said, ``where the march was  supposed to start, it was already packed with security forces. As more  people gathered, officers fired stun grenades and started hitting  people with batons to disperse the crowd.   ``They attacked us again and again. It was awful. They ferociously  beat people, twisted their arms and took them away.   ``She ran away into one of the courtyards following other protesters,  but police in their minivans quickly caught up with them even there.  She was saved,'' she goes on, ``by a stranger who hid her and several  others in his house.''                                time  1530    She goes on to say, ``It was like World War II, when people tried to  hide Jews from the Nazis. It was terrifying, we were shocked.''   That particular march was called in memory of Roman Bondarenko, an  activist who was so severely beaten while in detention, that he died in  the hospital just last week.   Mr. Speaker, the Congress can and we must do our part in this crisis.  The people of Belarus, especially the pro-democracy leaders,  desperately need our help, and they need it right now.   As my colleagues know, the leading opposition presidential candidate,  Svetlana Tsikhanouskaya, almost certainly won the election in August.  She went on to form the Coordination Council.   The democratic opposition is united, it is smart, it is principled,  tenacious, and it is extraordinarily brave.   Ms. Tsikhanouskaya ran a courageous campaign, but today is in exile  in Lithuania, in Vilnius, where she continues to rally the Belarusian  people and the world and demand that democracy and human rights for all  people be given to her nation.   A couple weeks ago I read portions of a transcript of a hearing I  chaired in 2011 after another fraudulent Belarusian election put  Lukashenko back in power. Then as now, and on so many other occasions,  Lukashenko's bullies beat, jailed, assaulted, tortured, raped, and  killed peaceful protesters, but now it is going on right as we meet  here today as never before.   The big mistake of the past, fatigue or lack of commitment and  perseverance by the international community, can't be repeated this  time. We can't be outraged at first and then turn the page and say,  ``Now what?''   We need to have a determined effort to help these people who are  struggling for democracy and human rights in their nation.   On two separate occasions, I would note parenthetically, I met with  Lukashenko in Minsk and came away resolved to accelerate the struggle  for democracy and freedom.   I was with a group of 11 Members, including some of our members on  the committee, and he pointed to me, because I am the author of the  Belarus Democracy Act of 2004, and said, ``There is public enemy number  one.''   That is how he thinks. Anybody who aspires for freedom and democracy,  particularly against his brutal regime, is construed to be a public  enemy. And for the people of Belarus, they go to jail, where they are  beaten senselessly.   Our bipartisan bill, H.R. 8438, again, cosponsored by Mr. Engel, Mr.  McCaul, Mr. Keating, Mr. Kinzinger, and so many other Members of this  House, updates, strengthens, and expands the Belarus Democracy Acts of  2004, 2006, and 2011, laws that I also authored, and renews the  personal, economic, and visa sanctions on an expanded list of actors in  the Belarusian Government, and now for the first time on Russian  individuals complicit in this crackdown.   I would note parenthetically, the Magnitsky Act, the idea of  personally sanctioning with visa denial as well as economic sanctions  on individuals that led to the Global Magnitsky Act came out of the  Belarus Democracy Act of 2004.   So it is an idea, it is a method of holding those who commit these  abuses personally accountable.   When you sanction an entire nation, that has an impact, but innocent  people do get hurt. This sanctions the individuals who are perpetrators  of these heinous crimes.   Yesterday, Svetlana again called for the sanctions, just yesterday  for the sanctions that are embedded in our bill. So the time to act is  now.   The bill also has other provisions. It does call for new elections.   It recognizes the Coordination Council as a legitimate institution to  participate in a dialogue on a peaceful transition of power. They are  the ones we need to be talking to.   It calls for the release of all political prisoners, and that number  rises by the day.   It supports the aspirations of the people to exercise their religious  freedom. There has been a crackdown there as well.   It authorizes assistance to promote democracy in civil society in  Belarus. On occasions in Minsk, I have met with those individuals. They  are brave beyond words, because they always know somebody is lurking-- the secret police--just waiting to haul them off to prison.   It unequivocally states that it is the policy of the U.S. ``not to  recognize any incorporation of Belarus into a `Union State' with  Russia.'' Russia is using this crisis as a pretext to further manifest  their monopoly of power. They would love--like they did in parts of  Ukraine, South Ossetia, Abkhazia--to just take the whole of Belarus  into their national boundary.   The bill requires the U.S. strategy to promote broadcasting, internet  freedom, and access to information.  [[Page H5920]]    In addition, it gives much needed support to the Belarusian media and  to the IT sector.   By passing this bill today followed by, hopefully, swift approval in  the Senate and signature into law by the President, we not only  reiterate, but significantly expand our support and solidarity with the  great people of Belarus. We need to pass this bill and I respectfully  call on our Senate colleagues to pass it as well.
