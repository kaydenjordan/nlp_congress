 Mr. President, I rise today to  recognize Mr. Jon Jensen as he nears the end of his term as the 115th  chairman of the nation's largest insurance association, the Independent  Insurance Agents & Brokers of America, also known as the Big ``I.'' He  has served an unprecedented 2-year term as chairman of the Big ``I''  due to the coronavirus pandemic's impact on association operations  throughout most of 2020. Over the past 2 years, he has piloted the  association through tumultuous times as a strong leader for independent  insurance agents and small businesses across the country.   Jensen has made many contributions to the business community in South  Carolina and the broader United States. A graduate from the Appalachian  State University's insurance executive program, Jensen is currently the  president and CEO of Correll Insurance Group, which has 28 offices in  South Carolina, North Carolina, and Tennessee. Jensen has also chaired  the Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of South Carolina-- IIABSC--and received their Young Agent and Agent of the Year awards.  Throughout his 12 insurance agencies, he employs approximately 300  South Carolinians across the State.   At the national association level, Jensen has served as chairman of  the InsurPac committee and the government affairs committee. He has  received two Big ``I'' Chairman's Awards and the Sidney O. Smith Award,  the highest governmental affairs award given by the Big ``I.'' Jensen  has also testified before Congress numerous times on topics such as  flood insurance, agent licensing, and terrorism insurance.  Additionally, he is a member of the TrustedChoice.com board and  represents the Big ``I'' on the World Federation of Insurance  Intermediaries, WFII. Jensen was sworn in as WFII's chairman in 2019 in  Rome, the first time a Big ``I'' representative has chaired the  organization.   As an active leader and philanthropist in his community, Jensen  serves on the board of the Spartanburg Regional Foundation's--SRF-- cancer division, as well as SRF's grants and allocations committee, and  he is a founding member of SRF's Legacy Society.   The State of South Carolina is proud of Jon Jensen and wishes him,  his wife Julie, and his two children well following his successful term  as chairman of the Big ``I.''                            ____________________
