 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of  Orlando Police Officer Kevin Valencia.   As a former chief in Orlando, I join my brothers and sisters at OPD  and Kevin's wife, Meghan, and their two sons in expressing gratitude  for his service and in mourning his passing.   In 2018, Officer Valencia responded to a domestic violence call  involving a convicted felon armed with a firearm who was holding four  children hostage. Upon trying to gain entry and save the children,  Kevin was shot and critically wounded. The subject later took the lives  of those children.   Kevin fought hard to survive but succumbed to his injuries on March  15 of this year.   We use the word ``hero'' often, and sometimes I think we forget the  many heroic actions our men and women in blue perform every day. But  Officer Kevin Valencia was a hero in every sense of the word.   On March 15, a part of America died. We are grateful for a life well  lived. Courage, pride, and commitment.                            ____________________
