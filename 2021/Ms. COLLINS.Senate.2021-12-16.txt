 Mr. President I rise today with my colleague, Senator  Ben Ray Lujan, to introduce the Neuroscience Center of Excellence Act  of 2021, legislation that would establish a Neuroscience Center of  Excellence at the Food and Drug Administration, FDA. This program would  be modeled after FDA's Oncology Center or Excellence, which was  authorized through the 2lst Century Cures Act. Building off that  successful and bipartisan model, I hope we can make critical advances  for those living with neurological diseases.   In July, FDA's Director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and  Research testified that neuroscience is an area of medicine where there  is tremendous unmet need, and neurodegenerative diseases are  particularly challenging from both a research and a drug development  perspective. I have seen this firsthand as founder and cochairman of  the Senate Alzheimer's Disease Caucus. I have vigorously advocated for  record funding increases to support additional NIH research over the  past 25 years. Over the past year, many have noted the success of  Operation Warp Speed and wondered why we can't achieve the same rapid  progress in other health conditions.   The Neuroscience Center of Excellence would encompass more than 20  neurological diseases, including conditions that are very rare. For  example, Huntington's disease is an inherited  [[Page S9264]]  disease characterized by the progressive loss of brain and muscle  function. It has sometimes been described as having ALS, Parkinson's,  and Alzheimer's simultaneously. It is an autosomal dominant condition,  so families with a history of Huntington's disease can see it appear in  every generation. In Maine, Nancy Patterson has seen Huntington's  disease in four generations of family. In addition, I lost a friend and  coworker in former Senator Bill Cohen's office to this devastating  disease. Sadly, there is no cure.   Through our bill, this new Neuroscience Center of Excellence would  establish several programs aimed at supporting innovation. The first is  to identify some of the current and emerging regulatory science and  public policy challenges associated with developing medical products  for neuroscience diseases and disorders through a series of public  meetings and guidances. The Center of Excellence would also establish a  program to facilitate both the collection and the systematic use of  patient experience data in the development of medical products for  neuroscience diseases and disorders.   Another component of the Center's work would be around using digital  technologies, an area of much promise. In 2018, the National Academies  of Medicine Forum on Neuroscience and Nervous System Disorders hosted a  workshop on using mobile technology to advance research and treatment  of central nervous system disorders. As Dr. William Marks, head of  clinical neurology at Verily Life Sciences, observed, the current state  of assessing brain disorders is ``exquisitely crude'' and there is a  large unmet need for better measures of disease burden that are  objective, quantitative, more frequently measured, and in the context  of normal life.   Finally, the center would help promote inclusion of traditionally  underrepresented populations in the research and development of medical  products for neuroscience diseases and disorders through public  meetings and industry guidance. Senator Lujan and I have worked  together on this issue before as part of our Equity in Neuroscience and  Alzheimer's Clinical Trials Act of 2021. Whether the barrier to  participation is a distrust of the medical community or logistics  concerns like time and travel, we need to overcome those hurdles in  order to ensure the best possible science.   Researchers from the University of South Florida looked at the nine  most prevalent and costly diagnosed neurological disorders and found  the annual cost totaled nearly $800 billion. We desperately need to  change this trajectory and renew our focus on these critical unmet  needs. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.                            ____________________     Mr. President I rise today with my colleague, Senator  Ben Ray Lujan, to introduce the Neuroscience Center of Excellence Act  of 2021, legislation that would establish a Neuroscience Center of  Excellence at the Food and Drug Administration, FDA.
