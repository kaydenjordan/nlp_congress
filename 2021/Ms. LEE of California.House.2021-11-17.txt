 Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Speier  for her leadership as well as Chairman Deutch and the Speaker for  bringing this with urgency.   Representative Gosar used taxpayer-funded resources to publicize a  cartoon of him killing one of our House colleagues, Congresswoman  Ocasio-Cortez, and threatening to kill the President.   When Republicans don't condemn death threats against their colleagues  and the President, it sends a message to the public that these threats  are condoned. Their silence and misrepresentation in light of these  threats speak volumes.   Now, it might be easy for Mr. Gosar to shrug this off as a joke, but  it is not only Members of Congress but women and people of color  throughout the country who deal daily with the threat of physical  violence. This is no laughing matter.   As someone who for decades has had to live with death threats, this  is a moment when we need to say enough is enough. Hate speech leads to  hate violence. Death threats can lead to death. Threats to murder  people can lead to criminal charges.   This is the minimum we need to do. It reinforces that this behavior  will not be tolerated.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.
