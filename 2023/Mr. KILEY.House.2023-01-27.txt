 Mr. Speaker, this week, we celebrate School Choice Week,  and it certainly is something to be celebrated.   Across the country, school choice has been an abundant source of  opportunity and force for good, lifting the life prospects of millions  of students.   It is important to recognize at the outset that for a particular  group of people across this country, school choice exists to the  fullest extent. Those are the families who are fortunate enough to have  the financial means to create choices for themselves by moving into a  community that has good public schools or by sending their kids to  private schools. This form of school choice exists in all 50 States.   When it comes to everyone else, there is a stark difference among the  50 States. You see, there are some States that have decided that school  choice should be available not just for some but for everyone.   For example, you have States like Florida that have offered a variety  of different school choice options. In fact, Florida is ranked number  one in the country when it comes to educational freedom and, not  coincidentally, also ranks near the top when it comes to the  performance of their kids ranked among the States across the country.                                time  1445    But then there are other States that have opted to have a two-tier  education system, where they say we will have school choice for those  that can afford it, but everyone else, they say, we are going to tell  you where you will send your child to school. You will have one option,  and they will go to that school whether your child is learning or not;  whether they are learning how to do math or not; whether they are  learning how to read or not; whether they are being prepared for  success in life or not.   This is the two-tiered education system that prevails in far too many  States in this country, and perhaps nowhere more so than in my home  State of California, where it has become a business model--a perverse  business model of keeping kids trapped in failing schools, which each  year is further entrenched by politicians and the special interests  that support them.   No individual personifies this two-tiered education system more than  the Governor of California, Gavin Newsom. Soon after taking office,  Governor Newsom enacted an aggressive, anti-school choice, anti-parent,  anti-student agenda that went after charter schools, and was condemned  by civil rights groups like the NAACP and the Urban League.   After the COVID-19 shutdown began, Newsom and the California  legislature went even further trying to reduce the number of options  that parents had from one to zero.   At the beginning of the shutdown, with schools not operating at all,  many lacked even a distance learning option. Parents started enrolling  their students in charter schools that already had well-developed,  personalized learning models.   Newsom and the California legislature passed a bill to stop this: to  defund these charters, to deny them funding for any new students so  that kids would remain trapped in schools that weren't even offering  Zoom school at the time.   In the months ahead, Newsom, and his allies in California realized  that the  [[Page H483]]  COVID shutdown presented an opportunity to further entrench their  business model of keeping kids trapped in failing schools without even  having to run schools at all, all the while taking in billions and  billions of extra dollars in funding.   California would have the longest school shutdown of any State in the  country. Newsom as Governor assured California was 50 out of the 50  States in resuming in-person instruction.   He claimed again and again that it was necessary to keep schools  closed for the safety of students, but he knew that wasn't true. The  reason we know that he knew it wasn't true is that at the same time he  was sending his own kids to in-person private school.   This, by the way, is a pattern across the country, where some of the  most strident, anti-school choice politicians embrace school choice for  themselves: President Biden, Vice President Harris, former Speaker  Nancy Pelosi, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, North Carolina Governor  Roy Cooper, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, Illinois Governor J. B.  Pritzker, as well as, of course, Newsom. They all fight against  education options for families while enrolling their own students in  private schools.   The consequences of California's school shutdown, as well as other  States that kept their kids out of school for far too long, are  starting to come into focus. The National Assessment of Education  Progress, a test administered by the Department of Education, released  scores in the fall of 2022, showing that students in California had a  five-point drop in reading and a seven-point drop in math.   California already had among the worst education outcomes in the  country. Before COVID, we ranked 49 out of 50 when it came to education  outcomes for kids in low-income communities. Now, thanks to the longest  school shutdowns in the country, those achievement gaps have been  widened significantly.   This doesn't even account for all of the other dimensions of harm  that were done to kids in terms of their mental health and in terms of  their social development and so much more.   We have so much work to do now to try, as much as we can, to help  students recover from learning loss and get them back on the road they  need to pursue their goals and to have success in life.   The good news, though, is that the experience of the last few years  has catalyzed a movement of parents across the country that is starting  to develop into a Renaissance in school choice, as we are seeing more  and more pro-school choice, pro-kid, pro-parent legislation pass in  States all across the country.   California has been an exception. If anything, there has been a  retrenchment, as those who are currently in power see the threat that  this movement of parents proposes or presents to their business model.   As we pause for a moment this week to celebrate and commemorate  School Choice Week, I would want to offer a few ideas for the forms of  school choice that this movement of parents can be channeled into.   The first is choice within the traditional public education system,  which isn't discussed as much in the context of school choice, but  which is very important and very powerful.   So this means, number one, allowing schools within a district to have  the freedom to present different types of offerings, different types of  schools, such as vocational schools, or emergent schools, in order to  serve different types of students and to cater to the learning  modalities of different types of students.   Allowing enrollment freedom within the district so parents can choose  a school within the school district which is right for them, as well as  offering the option of transferring to another school district if there  is a school in that district that serves their child better.   Even in California, where we have among the worst school choice  offerings in the country, one of the few options that does exist is  called the District of Choice program, which enables families to  transfer into a neighboring school district.   A study by the State's nonpartisan legislation analysts showed that  for students who participated in the District of Choice program and  transferred to a neighboring school district, their education outcomes  improved. But not only that, the districts that they were transferring  out of realized they needed to take action to prevent students from  leaving. They started offering new courses. They started offering AP  courses, and the level of achievement in their schools improved as  well.    That is the beauty of school choice, it lifts all boats. As we  develop more programs for choice within the traditional public  education system, it should be coupled with ease of enrollment,  transparency to parents as far as what options are available, and easy  websites where you can see the schools that exist within a district and  can see your enrollment options. There are many districts across the  country that develop these platforms that serve students and families  very well.   The second form of choice that is continuing to expand across this  country are charter schools, which are about 30 years old now in the  United States.   What charters do is they essentially flip the typical education  paradigm on its head. They enable a great degree of freedom to school  leaders to run the school however they see fit, and free the charter  school from the constraints of the State's education code. They are far  less regulated and have far fewer mandates.   In turn, charters are not assigned students like your typical  neighborhood school is, they have to attract students to proactively  enroll, and then not only that, but they also get reviewed every few  years and assessed on the bases of their learning outcomes, and that  determines whether the school will continue to operate.   Now, this combination of innovation and accountability has a  tremendous track record after just a few decades in existence. For  example, one study by Stanford's Center for Research on Education  Outcomes showed that after 4 years in a charter, urban students learn  about 50 percent more than demographically similar students in  traditional public schools.   New Orleans, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, became a 100 percent  charter district. You saw test scores, graduation dropout rates,  college-going rates, independent studies, all showing that the city  schools have doubled or tripled their effectiveness over the course of  a decade.   Charter schools are another key tool in the school choice toolkit,  and should continue to be encouraged as an option for parents and  families outside of the traditional public education system. Although,  it is important to note that charters are public schools, they are  free. They have to have a blind admission system that is non- preferential, where if they are oversubscribed then they are subject to  a lottery.   A third form of choice then is opting out of the public education  system altogether. It should be noted again that this right does exist  in every State across the country, but the means to do so only exist  for a certain segment of society.   Again, it is the Gavin Newsom's of the world that have the ability to  withdraw their kids if they so choose from the public education system.  But a lot of families just don't have the financial resources to do  that, even if they believe that that is the option that is right for  their kids.   So what you are seeing to solve this problem and to tear down this  two-tiered education system and have one where school choice is open to  all is many States are passing legislation to create education savings  accounts or other mechanisms where funding follows the child.   You take the amount of State-funding that is given per pupil--and in  some California districts this is over $24,000 per pupil--and at least  give a portion of that to the parent to send their child to a private  school or to hire a tutor or to find the option that is right for them.   It should also be noted, by the way, that protecting homeschooling is  now more important than ever. We have a wonderful homeschool community  in the district that I represent. Given the experience of public  education in California and across this country in recent years you  have seen, by some estimates, homeschooling doubled just over the last  few years.  [[Page H484]]    This is an option that needs to be available to every family in this  country as a matter of right and as a matter of giving parents the  ability to control the education of their child.   Those are just a few of the exciting things that we see going on  across this country in at least some States when it comes to expanding  school choice, to having not a two-tiered education system, but one  where opportunities are available for all.   I actually worked as a high school teacher in inner city Los Angeles  where I worked on a direct level on a small scale to try to close the  achievement gap for my students. I am now honored to have been  appointed to the Education and Workforce Committee here in the House of  Representatives, where I am going to be working to do that on a larger  scale to expand school choice as much as we can, and to pursue the goal  of assuring that every child in this country has the opportunity for  the education they deserve.
