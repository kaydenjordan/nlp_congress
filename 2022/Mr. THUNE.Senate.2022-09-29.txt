 Madam President, yesterday I came down to the floor to  talk about where we are after nearly 2 years of Democrat control of  Congress and the White House.   We are, as I noted, in the midst of an inflation crisis with no end  in sight. Our economy is weakening. Our energy security is diminished.  Violent crime has increased, and we are dealing with record waves of  illegal immigration and a serious security situation at our southern  border. That is where we are.   The question is, How did we get here? The answer lies with Democrats'  priorities.   The Democratic Party has moved sharply leftward over the past few  years. Democrats, of course, have always been on the left side of the  political spectrum. But over the past few years, what was once far-left  ideology has become the Democrat mainstream. And Democrats swept into  office determined to enact a far-left, Big Government agenda. It didn't  matter to them that their majorities in the House and Senate were  extremely narrow or that President Biden had been elected largely  because he was considered to be a moderate.   Democrats had a grip on power, however tenuous, and they were  determined to use it to enact their most cherished, far-left fantasies.   They started off with their $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act,  filled with unnecessary spending and payoffs to Democrat interest  groups. They were warned their legislation ran the risk of overheating  the economy and setting off inflation. But they ignored the warnings  and dumped a lot of unnecessary government money into the economy, and  the economy overheated as a result. Inflation quickly began climbing  and then climbing some more.   Now, at this point, it might have seemed prudent to pull back on all  those spending plans. After all, if one massive spending bill had  kicked off inflation, how much worse would another, even more massive  spending bill make the situation?   But Democrats were just getting started. The ink was barely dry on  the so-called American Rescue Plan before Democrats were outlining  plans for a new spending spree, one that would dwarf their initial  spending spree and install some of the Democrats' most cherished Big  Government priorities.   And even as inflation climbed and climbed again, Democrats kept  pushing ahead. Even as Democrat economists warned that the American  Rescue Plan had kick-started inflation, they kept pushing forward with  plans for a $5 trillion spending spree, their so-called Build Back  Better plan--$5 trillion.   To put that number in perspective, the entire Federal budget in 2019  was $4.4 trillion, the entire Federal budget. Yet Democrats were  pushing forward with a $5 trillion spending plan on top of a $1.9  trillion spending bill earlier in the year.   Fortunately, for the American people, the Democrats' $5 trillion  spending plan was foiled last December, but that didn't stop them for  long.   Even as inflation reached 40-year highs, Democrats kept pushing for  more spending, and they managed to jam through another partisan tax- and-spending spree in August.   We have now had 6 straight months--6 straight months--with inflation  above 8 percent. The last time inflation was this bad, I wasn't even  married yet. Now I have grandkids. But Democrats just don't seem to  care. They are committed to their tax-and-spending agenda, regardless  of the consequences for the American economy.   Their August tax-and-spending spree will hurt both wages and economic  growth at a time when economic growth is weakening and Americans are  experiencing a de facto pay cut due to inflation.   And just days after signing this tax-and-spending legislation into  law, President Biden announced--if you can believe this--a massive  student loan giveaway, which would cost more than $1 trillion and will,  to quote the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, ``meaningfully  boost inflation''--meaningfully boost inflation.   Yet again, Democrats' Big Government, big-spending agenda trumps the  economic reality facing the American people.   No matter how bad the economy gets, Democrats are determined to enact  their Big Government vision. And I suspect the reason the Democrats and  the President have spent nearly 2 years ignoring the raging crisis at  our southern border is similar. After all, if Democrats and the  President acknowledge that there is a crisis, people might think that  they should actually start solving the crisis.   They might, in fact, think that a raging security crisis deserves to  be a priority--more of a priority than, say, Democrats' plans for  electric postal vehicles or monitoring gaps in tree canopy coverage. In  addition, of course,  [[Page S5514]]  acknowledging that there is a border crisis might offend some Democrat  interest groups, and that might imperil Democrats' fierce determination  to stay in power and enact their Big Government agenda.   Madam President, I mentioned Democrats' fierce determination to stay  in power, and it is fierce, so fierce that the Democrats manufactured a  voting crisis and almost succeeded in gutting the Senate's rules in an  attempt to force through Federal legislation that would give their  party an advantage in future elections. And it clearly doesn't matter  to them that their claims of voter suppression were pretty clearly  refuted by excellent election turnout mere months later. Democrats are  still talking about forcing through a Federal takeover of elections to  address a nonexistent crisis and give their party a leg up in future  elections.   Madam President, I guess it is not necessarily surprising that  Democrats' growing commitment to the biggest kind of Big Government has  been matched by a growing determination to secure their party's grip on  power with government action, if necessary. As government power grows,  I suppose the governing party starts to think its power should grow  with it. It would explain Democrats' commitment to abolishing  protections for the rights of the minority party in the Senate and the  Americans that it represents and the commitment expressed by a number  of Democrats to packing the Supreme Court, expanding it--expanding the  Supreme Court with Democrat Justices until they can be sure they will  get the outcomes that they want.   Leading Democrats have been openly crowing about their plans to  abolish the filibuster if they manage to gain a sufficient majority in  the Senate and then force through a variety of far-left, Big Government  legislation--from a government takeover of childcare to that voting  bill that they think will give them a leg up in elections to some of  the most extreme abortion legislation, literally, in the world.   Clearly, a raging border crisis, an inflation crisis, a weakening  economy, and growing energy insecurity mean little to Democrats. Their  focus, if they keep their majority, is not on solving these very real  problems facing Americans; it is on growing and expanding government  and implementing their far-left, Big Government, big-spending visions.   (Mr. SCHATZ assumed the Chair.)   Mr. President, Democrats' Big Government vision is clearly not a  vision I share, and despite Democrats' clear belief that their narrow  majority gave them a mandate for a far-left remake of our government, I  suspect the American people are not looking for that. Democrats may  think months and months and months of high inflation are a small price  to pay for implementing their Big Government visions, but I suspect the  American people disagree.   I also think the American people would like to see the party in power  focused on solving problems like violent crime and the crisis at our  southern border, not spending their time considering how to consolidate  their hold on power or force through extreme or partisan policies. And  despite Democrats' clear belief that Washington should be making  decisions about most aspects of Americans' lives, I suspect most  Americans are not interested in having Washington dictate their  choices, whether that is the choices they make about their childcare or  about their children's education.   Democrats' devotion to their Big Government, big-spending agenda has  left the American people worse off economically, and it has left our  country in a more dangerous position, from violent crime in our  communities to the security crisis that we see on a daily basis  unfolding at our southern border.   I think the American people know with painful certainty that we can't  afford another 2 years like the last 2, and for the sake of our  country, I hope we won't have to see what 2 more years of Democrat  power would bring.

Little Bear was returned home to McLaughlin, SD.   In 1951, Private First Class Little Bear, a native of Standing Rock,  was a member of A Battery, 15th Field Artillery Battalion, 2nd Infantry  Division. On February 13, 1951, he was reported missing in action after  his unit was attacked by Chinese communist forces, at which point his  unit conducted a 2-day fighting withdrawal from Changbong-ni, South  Korea, to Wonju. He was captured and held as a prisoner of war at POW  Camp Number 1 in North Korea, where POW reports show he died in  captivity later that summer.   In 1954, Private First Class Little Bear's unidentified remains were  returned to U.N. command under Operation GLORY. However, because  investigators were unable to identify to whom they belonged, his  remains were buried at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in  Honolulu, HI, in 1956.   Through the dedication and preservation of the Defense POW/MIA  Accounting Agency, the remains of Private First Class Little Bear were  finally identified on July 13, 2022, through DNA matching. Seventy-one  years after being captured and killed, his remains have finally been  returned to his family in McLaughlin, SD, where he will be laid to rest  in eternal peace at All Nations Veteran's Cemetery on September 30,  2022.   I consider it an honor to pay tribute to Private First Class Melvin  J. Little Bear. May his family and his Oyate find comfort in knowing  that his remains will soon be laid to rest and the legacy of his  service and sacrifice to our Nation will live on.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
