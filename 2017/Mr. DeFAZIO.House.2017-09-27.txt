 Mr. Speaker, this would be the fourth FAA extension in 2  years. It didn't have to be this way. We had a bill come out of the  committee in the last Congress and this Congress that was bipartisan  except for one provision; that is the privatization of the Air Traffic  Organization.   Now, there is a citizen group out there called Citizens for On Time  Flights--actually, Airlines for America funds this--who are saying that  we have to fly these old zigzag routes with 1950s' radar, and if only  we, the airlines--the same airlines, by the way, that have had their  dispatch and reservation systems go down 39 times in the last 2 years.  The national air traffic system hasn't gone down in the last 2 years.   But, anyway, they could do better, they say--or Citizens for On Time  Flights say. But, unfortunately, it is based on lies.   We have deployed a system where we could fly planes closer together.  It is operational, actually, but the airlines haven't purchased the  equipment to use it, and they are not going to purchase that equipment  until 2020 or after.   So they are saying the FAA is dragging its feet; the FAA is over  budget; the FAA is this, the FAA is that. No. Actually, it is the  airlines that haven't purchased the equipment to use that system.   Now, the other most egregious part of this privatization proposal is  the Ways and Means Committee, Chairman Brady, has decided to give  taxing authority to the private corporation. Now, they are not going to  call it taxes. It is fees. Okay.   But right now we finance our Air Traffic Organization with a 7\1/2\  percent tax, a progressive tax; the more expensive your ticket, the  more you pay. That is how we finance, predominantly, our Air Traffic  Organization.    Well, this bill repeals that ticket tax. First thing that happens is  the airlines raise their tickets by 7\1/2\ percent. They already did  that once 5 years ago when there was a temporary lapse. Only two  airlines didn't, Spirit and Alaska. Everybody else grabbed the money  and ran, $400 billion.   So Congress repeals the ticket tax. They raise prices 7\1/2\ percent,  and then they would get three seats on the board. Three seats will go  to direct airlines interests to decide what passengers and how people  will pay to use the national airspace. So they, in all probability,  will come up with a head tax.   So, in addition to paying $7 billion a year for baggage fees, now we  are going to start charging people to use the national airspace with a  flat tax. So, hey, that is a big, great win for the people with first  class tickets. The people, of course, who have got a $100 coach seat  are now going to be paying more like 20 percent or 25 percent. And the  person with a $2,000 ticket is going to pay, basically, 3-point- something percent.   So this is all really unfortunate because we could have passed  already out of this House a bipartisan bill, sent it to the Senate.  Instead of trying to jam them with this bill that is loaded down with  riders, we would be jamming them with good, long-term policy for the  FAA and the traveling public and the aviation industry in America.    Mr Speaker, we have already heard from the gentleman  from Louisiana (Mr. Graves), who is a member of the committee, who is  going to oppose the bill because of provisions regarding private flood  insurance. He thinks it will cause Federal flood insurance to collapse.  And the two Senators from Louisiana who they are attempting to jam with  this bill are saying they are going to oppose the bill and block it in  the Senate. So we may end up with no continuing authorization for the  FAA because they wanted to put these flood insurance provisions and  other riders on this bill instead of passing them as separate  legislation.                                time  1800
