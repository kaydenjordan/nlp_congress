 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give my final speech in the  United States House of Representatives to express my gratitude for the  opportunity to serve the people of Arizona's Second Congressional  District.   It has been a tremendous honor to deploy here to the people's House  over the past 4 years as an advocate and champion for Tucson, Sierra  Vista, Douglas, Bisbee, and all the other amazing communities in  southeastern Arizona.   I am grateful to my dedicated staff in Arizona, who were omnipresent  in our community and fought for constituents who needed help with  Federal bureaucracies. They were able to solve nearly 6,000 cases,  returning nearly $2.5 million to seniors, veterans, and others--money  that was rightfully theirs in the first place. This is one of the most  meaningful and impactful parts of our job.   My D.C. staff tirelessly helped push our legislative initiatives  forward. Because of them, we saved the A-10 Warthog, put the Douglas  port of entry project on the map, kept the Cherrybell postal processing  facility open, fast-tracked our veterans for jobs at the border, opened  Arlington again to our World War II female pilot heroes, improved  mental health access, stopped a harmful tax increase on seniors and the  middle class, led bipartisan efforts to break the gridlock on  healthcare, border security, immigration, and so much more.   A heartfelt thanks to all my staff, but especially those who were  with me all 4 years: my chief, Justin Roth; district director, C.J.  Karamargin; LD, Pace McMullan, and deputy district director, Rosa Ruiz.   As I reflect on my two terms in the House, I will cherish many  memories from this time of service. I was honored to have a front row  seat to history here in our Nation's Capitol.   I will never forget sitting next to an American hero, Sam Johnson, on  the day I was sworn in, or being on this floor as two Presidents  delivered their State of the Union speeches and when Israeli Prime  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Pope Francis addressed a joint session  of Congress.   I was blessed to pay final respects to American icons like Senator  John McCain, Reverend Billy Graham, and President George H.W. Bush in  the sacred grounds in the Capitol rotunda.   To my fellow Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, those  who have been here awhile and those who will be sworn in soon, I humbly  ask that you never forget the privilege it is to serve here and why you  are here. Membership in this body is a precious opportunity. Don't take  it lightly, and don't squander it.   It is not about us. As soon as we leave here, this institution will  move on and, candidly, few will remember us. Use the time wisely. We  have been entrusted to solve our Nation's problems and chart its course  for a better future. Do the right thing. Do it for the right reasons.  And get things done. This is why we are here.   The people of our great country--the people each of us represent-- often have very different views on how to solve our challenges, the  proper role of our government, and the priorities for our limited  resources. Reconciling these differences requires rigorous and robust  debate, both in this Chamber and outside of it. Disagreements are  inevitable, but we can and should set the example to disagree without  being disagreeable.   Our challenge is, then, to find the sometimes very tiny sliver of  common ground where we can agree and govern. I am particularly proud of  the fact that every one of the five bills I introduced that were signed  into law had bipartisan support.   Lastly, and most importantly, to my constituents: In my time as your  Representative, I deeply valued meeting with you all over our  incredible district--at schools, senior centers, small businesses,  nonprofits, military bases, medical facilities, farms, ranches, and  other places--to hear about the challenges that you have along with the  opportunities to make an impact with your lives that only come in  America. You inspired me and fueled my purpose here.  [[Page H10108]]    I represent a diverse and amazing district. These are Americans with  real issues, real problems, and real dreams who are not concerned with  what party we belong to or what ads we run every 2 years. They care  that we care and that we are here to serve not only ourselves, but our  country and them.   Our democracy requires that our time here be spent in humility,  dedication, and pride: pride to fight for those who can't, pride to  work for those who are unable, pride to push back against the  bureaucracy that frequently stands in the way and hampers their ability  to conduct their business and live their lives.   I stand here today proud of the work we did in these 4 short years,  but more proud of the people who sent me here: the citizens of  Arizona's Second Congressional District. Thank you for the opportunity  and the honor to serve you.   To my successor, Ann Kirkpatrick, I wish you all the best as you are  sworn in to serve our amazing and inspiring community.   God bless you all and God bless America                            ____________________
