 Mr. President, in California, several counties and  cities are suing the big oil companies to hold them liable for the  damages that climate change is causing to the infrastructure out there.  As judges consider these cases, one thing they will be asked to keep in  mind is Big Oil's history of deception and lies.   A group of scientific experts filed this friend-of-the-court brief  out in the Ninth Circuit, carefully charting that history, that pattern  of deception and lies. The group of scholars and scientists chronicled  how the fossil fuel companies had actual knowledge of the risks of  their products and had taken ``proactive steps to conceal their  knowledge and discredit climate science'' while at the same time taking  steps based on that science to protect their own assets from the  impacts of climate change.   It is a 51-page document, so let me cut to the chase. Big Oil knew  for a very long time that the production and burning of fossil fuels  would be disastrous for the planet. Yet they did everything in their  power to confuse the public, undermine the scientific evidence of the  dangers, and prevent action to stave off this worldwide problem. The  brief makes a fascinating read. Here are some highlights.   Way back in 1959, when I was a kid and Dwight Eisenhower was  President, Columbia University held a symposium attended by oil  industry executives to mark the 100th anniversary of the petroleum  industry. At that event, the legendary Dr. Edward Teller, a physicist,  warned the industry about global warming. He said:         [A] temperature rise corresponding to a 10 percent increase       in carbon dioxide will be sufficient to melt the icecap and       submerge New York. . . . [T]his chemical contamination is       more serious than most people tend to believe.    In 1959. A few years later, in 1965, at the American Petroleum  Institute's annual meeting, API president Frank Ikard briefed the Big  Oil trade group on a report from President Johnson's Science Advisory  Committee that predicted significant global warming by the end of the  century, caused by fossil fuels, and warned that ``there is still time  to save the world's peoples from the catastrophic consequence of  pollution, but time is running out.'' The American Petroleum Institute,  1965.   API then commissioned a Stanford Research Institute report on the  climate problem which was made available to its membership in 1968. The  report said:         [R]ising levels of CO2 would likely result in       rising global temperatures. . . . [T]he result could be       melting ice caps, rising sea levels, warming oceans, and       serious environmental damage on a global scale.    Then, in 1969, Stanford produced a supplemental report for the  American Petroleum Institute. As the authors of this brief tell the  Ninth Circuit, ``The report projected that . . . atmospheric  CO2 concentrations would reach 370 [parts per million] by  2000--exactly what it turned out to be.'' That was 1968 and 1969, very  clear warnings that have come to pass.   Big Oil did not just rely on the American Petroleum Institute to do  its research on climate change. Ed Garvey was an Exxon scientist at the  time. Mr. Garvey said:         By the late 1970s, global warming was no longer       speculative.    Did you get that? ``By the late 1970s, global warming was no longer  speculative,'' said the Exxon scientist.   The issue was not were we going to have a problem, the issue was  simply how soon and how fast and how bad was it going to be. Not if.   Indeed, Exxon did a lot of climate research, and they understood the  science well. A 1979 internal Exxon study found that:         [The] increase [in CO2 concentration] is due to       fossil fuel combustion . . . and the present trend of fossil       fuel consumption will cause dramatic environmental effects       before the year 2050.    Meanwhile--back to the American Petroleum Institute--they had put  together a task force on what they called the CO2 problem.  In 1980, Dr. John Laurman told this API task force that ``foreseeable  temperature increases could have major economic consequences [and]  globally catastrophic effects.'' The American Petroleum Institute,  1980.   Back at Exxon, Roger Cohen, the director of Exxon's Theoretical and  Mathematical Sciences Laboratory, warned in 1981--the next year--about  the magnitude of this problem.         [I]t is distinctly possible that [Exxon's planning]       scenario will later produce effects which will indeed be       catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the       earth's population).    In 1982, Roger Cohen reiterated his warning:         Over the past several years a clear scientific consensus       has emerged regarding--    This is 1982--       the expected climatic effects of increased atmospheric       CO2.    He continues:         [There is] unanimous agreement in the scientific community       that a temperature increase of this magnitude would bring       about significant changes in the earth's climate.    Unanimous agreement in the scientific community.   In 1982, Exxon's own scientist said this, but almost four decades  later, the Trump administration pretends that we just don't know. Well,  we do know.   Back to the brief. In 1982, an internal Exxon corporate primer said  that, in order to mitigate the effects of global warming, ``[there is a  need for] major reductions in fossil fuel combustion. . . . [T]here are  some potentially catastrophic events that must be considered. . . .  [O]nce the effects are measurable, they might not be reversible.''   So on into the late seventies and the early eighties, they knew.   This is from a 1998 report by Shell Oil's Greenhouse Effect Working  Group:         Man-made carbon dioxide, released into and accumulated in       the atmosphere, is believed to warm the earth through the so-      called greenhouse effect. . . . [B]y the time the global       warming becomes detectible it could be too late to take       effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even to       stabilise the situation.    So, long story short, Big Oil knew, API knew, Exxon knew, Shell knew.  They knew, but Big Oil also realized that understanding climate change  meant limiting carbon emissions, and that meant less oil sales. So they  [[Page S1654]]  began to tell something very different than what they knew to the  public.   A 1998 Exxon internal memo acknowledged that the ``greenhouse effect  may be one of the most significant environmental issues for the  1990s,'' but Exxon's position would be to try to ``[e]mphasize the  uncertainty in scientific conclusions regarding the potential enhanced  Greenhouse effect,'' and that became the drumbeat of the industry:  minimize the danger--the one they knew--that the greenhouse effect may  be one of the most significant environmental issues for the 1990s but,  instead, undermine the science.   So the industry set up front groups with innocuous-sounding names  like the Global Climate Coalition or the Information Council on the  Environment to do this PR work for it. The scientific brief notes this  bit of industry propaganda from 1996 from the so-called Global Climate  Coalition: ``If there is an anthropogenic component to this observed  warming, the GCC believes that it must be very small.''   Well, here is what an earlier draft of the same document said:  ``[The] scientific basis for the Greenhouse Effect and the potential  impacts of human emissions of greenhouse gases such as CO2  on climate is well established and cannot be denied.''   They just weren't telling the truth. They knew, and they said things  they knew were not true.   Money poured from the oil industry into these denialist groups. In  1991, the so-called Information Council on the Environment launched a  nationwide campaign with one goal, to ``reposition global warming as  theory (not fact).'' This thing they said was well established and  cannot be denied, they decided to reposition as theory, not fact.   The polluters kept this up all the way through the 1990s. A 1998  American Petroleum Institute strategy memo tells what they wanted  people to believe, even though they knew it wasn't true. They said:  ``[It is] not known for sure whether (a) climate change is actually  occurring, or (b) if it is, whether humans really have any influence on  it.''   Again, well established, cannot be denied on the one hand and not  sure whether it is occurring or whether humans have anything to do with  it on the other hand.   Here is Martin Hoffert, who was an Exxon scientist for 20 years. He  said:         Even though we--    ``We,'' meaning the Exxon scientists.         Even though we were writing all these papers . . . [saying]       that climate change from CO2 emissions was going       to change the climate of the earth . . . the front office--    The front office said otherwise.       . . . the front office which was concerned with promoting the       products of the company was also supporting people that we       call climate change deniers.    So even as they spun this massive fraud out to the public, Big Oil  internally took the evidence of climate change seriously. They took the  evidence of climate change seriously enough to factor it into their own  planet. So while they were telling the public ``This isn't for real,  and we don't have anything to do it with, and the science isn't  secure,'' they were doing their own planning based on that very  science.   For instance, in designing and building the Sable gas field project  off the shores of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Mobil, Shell, and Imperial Oil  explicitly told their own engineers about sea level rise. They said  that ``[a]n estimated rise . . . due to global warming, of 0.5 meters  may be assumed.''   Big Oil protected its own assets against predicted sea level rise  based on this science, while, at the same time, funding a massive  campaign of deception to fool the public and policymakers about this  science. They protected themselves, and they connived to prevent the  public from taking steps to protect itself.   There are some unsung heroes in this climate battle. Among them  number the dedicated and assiduous group of scholars and scientists who  track this climate denial apparatus that this industry built. Many of  them are the authors of this brief, such as Robert Brule, Justin  Farrell, Benjamin Franta, Stephan Lewandowsky, Naomi Oreskes, and  Geoffrey Supran. They are just a few. There are many, many others who  are watching, examining, reporting, and subject to a peer review  chronicling the climate denial apparatus set up by the oil industry to  fool the public. They patiently and thoroughly assembled in their brief  a record of industry malfeasance, and they are helping to make sure  that the long history of industry deception is part of the court's  official record.   I thank them for their work.   I yield the floor.
