 Mr. Speaker, in the midst of a statewide drought  emergency, California has experienced much-needed rain and snowfall  during these winter months.   While communities across my district are especially grateful for the  rainfall we have encountered, I remain concerned that the State of  California has already announced a zero percent allocation for water  deliveries for this year.   I also remain concerned that the Bureau of Reclamation could possibly  announce a similar water allocation for 2022 within the next month.   This is unacceptable.   We must work together to figure out a way to fully utilize the water  we have access to in a way that benefits our communities and  agriculture production. Farmers are desperate for water to grow their  crops. Rural towns continue to face water shortages.   We need this rain, but we also need to do a better job of managing  our resources. We have opportunities to move our water responsibly when  the snowpack melts.   As you can see here, more than 5 million acre-feet of water was sent  out to the ocean over this past year. This water could have gone a long  way for our communities and for farmers in the Central Valley.   I have asked time and time again for support from the House majority  to address this issue. The families of the Central Valley cannot  continue to wait. I ask my colleagues yet again to join my efforts to  improve water management in California.                            ____________________
