 Madam President, there are moments in history that shock  our national conscience, news so heartbreaking that we will always  remember exactly where we were when we heard the news. One of those  moments is the day the El Monte Thai garment workers were found  enslaved in California.   As recently as August 2, 1995, there was 72 Thai women and men who  were discovered held against their will in the city of El Monte, CA,  just outside the city of Los Angeles. There, in a series of apartments- turned-sweatshops, packed in between sewing machines, forced to work 16  hours a day, 7 days a week, and hidden behind barbed wire fences and  armed guards, some of them believed help would never come.   They were lured by recruiters with the promise of their own American  dream. Seventy-two Thai women and men arrived into the United States  only to find a nightmare.   When they were liberated by Federal agents on that day, that  nightmare wasn't over. Instead, they were placed into holding cells,  where they feared they would actually be deported after the horrific  experience. It wasn't until a 26-year-old staff attorney for the Asian  Pacific American Legal Center by the name of Julie Su, among others,  took on their case for backpay and for dignity in this country that  they had once only dreamt about.   When the 72 Thai nationals were finally, truly freed, they actually  owed nothing to this country. Yet they stood up and they fought to  protect others from going through the hell they had endured. Their  advocacy led to meaningful protections in America, including the  landmark Federal Victims of Trafficking and Violence Prevention Act,  which created a new class of visas for victims of crimes like forced  labor and trafficking and strengthened the penalties for trafficking  crimes.   Just last week, now-Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su--yes, the same  Julie Su--had the opportunity to induct the El Monte Thai garment  workers into the Department of Labor's Hall of Honor, honoring the  courage they have shown and the progress they have made to protect  other workers.   I also had the privilege of getting to meet them in Washington last  week, and I was proud to join Senators Duckworth and Feinstein in  introducing a resolution to honor them by the U.S. Senate.   But, as each and every one of them has shown us, the best way to  respond to the atrocities they went through, the best way to honor them  is through our action--by keeping up the fight to end human  trafficking, by working to end wage theft that exploits far too many  workers in the garment industry and passing the FABRIC Act, and by, in  my opinion, finally confirming a champion for workers and worker  [[Page S4699]]  rights like Julie Su to be Secretary of Labor.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I also rise today just a week after the  Senate confirmed Judge Rita Lin to serve on the U.S. District Court for  the Northern District of California.   Today, I would like to take a moment to celebrate her confirmation  and share with the people of California a bit more about the  outstanding public servant and jurist they have gained on the Federal  bench.   Now Judge Lin earned her undergraduate degree from Harvard College  and her law degree from Harvard Law School. After clerking on the First  Circuit Court of Appeals for Judge Sandra Lynch, she started out her  legal career as an associate and later became partner at the firm of  Morrison Foerster in San Francisco.   But in 2014, she left private practice to pursue a career in public  service, joining the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District  of California.   Four years later, Governor Brown appointed Judge Lin to the San  Francisco County Superior Court, where she presided over both felony  and misdemeanor trials.   At every step, Judge Lin's career has been guided by her dedication  to public service, whether by maintaining an extensive pro bono  practice in the early years of her career or by leaving behind the  promise of a very lucrative career in private practice to serve in the  Northern District U.S. Attorney's Office. Judge Lin has proven she has  the heart and mind worthy of a Federal district judge.   And as someone who has lived her entire life with a hearing  disability, she also brings a unique perspective from a community not  often represented in our Nation's Federal judiciary.   The State of California is now lucky to have a Federal district court  judge not only with the judicial qualifications of Judge Lin but with  the voice, the personal experience, and the passion for public service  she brings each and every day.   So I want to thank my colleagues for confirming her nomination, and I  want to congratulate Judge Lin once again on her confirmation.                Unanimous Consent Requests--Executive Calendar    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to  executive session to consider the following nomination: Calendar No.  266, Tara K. McGrath, to be the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District  of California; that the Senate vote on the nomination without  intervening action or debate, that if confirmed, the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate resume  legislative session.    Madam President, it has been 2 months since I first came  to the floor to call for the confirmation of Tara McGrath, President  Biden's nominee to serve as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of  California.   On that day in July, my Republican colleague from Ohio chose, as he  does today, to put political gamesmanship over the safety of the  American people and to hold her nomination hostage to leverage  completely unrelated issues.   Two months later, clearly, nothing has changed. And as a result,  since early August, the Southern District of California has gone  without a confirmed U.S. attorney. That is despite the fact that a  highly qualified candidate was approved by the Senate Judiciary  Committee after a confirmation hearing, after the proper vetting and  review, and is awaiting a full vote on the Senate floor.   Yet, because my Republican colleague has chosen to politicize our  Justice Department and the confirmation process and hinder the work of  multiple law enforcement offices as they await confirmation of their  leadership, law enforcement is now forced to work harder than necessary  to keep our communities safe. That includes the Senator's own home  State of Ohio where the Northern District is currently without a  Senate-confirmed U.S. attorney for the longest stretch in that office's  history.   Now, in my own State, the Southern District of California has become  tangled in this political mess.   Make no mistake, these delays damage the effectiveness of U.S.  Attorney Offices across the country. Like the  [[Page S4700]]  confirmation of hundreds of our military leaders, these crucial law  enforcement nominations are being treated like pawns in their political  game.   If we truly care about public safety in our communities, if we truly  care about enforcing the law, and if we truly care about cracking down  on fentanyl and saving American lives--a claim I hear constantly from  my colleagues--then confirm Tara McGrath in the Southern District and  allow for the swift confirmation of a host of U.S. attorneys that are  still being held up. The people of California and the people of the  United States deserve better than this.   So I call on my colleague to stop weaponizing the Senate's  procedures, to confirm Ms. McGrath and all the qualified nominees  before us, and take seriously the job that Americans have sent us here  to do.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I recognize that my colleague from Ohio  cannot or will not speak on behalf of other Republican Members, but I  would respectfully ask if he would lift his hold on the nomination of  Tara McGrath to be U.S. attorney for the Southern District of  California.   I yield to the Senator from Ohio to respond to my question.    I respectfully ask if my colleague from Ohio will lift  his hold on the nomination of Tara McGrath to be U.S. attorney for the  Southern District of California; yes or no?
