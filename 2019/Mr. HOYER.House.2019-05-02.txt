 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 2:30 p.m. tomorrow, and further,  when the House adjourns on that day, it adjourn to meet at noon on  Tuesday next for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative  business.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   On Tuesday, Madam Speaker, the House will meet at 12 p.m. for  morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business, with votes  postponed until 6:30 p.m.   On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for  morning-hour debate and 12 p.m. for legislative business.   On Friday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business.   We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. The  complete list of suspension bills will be announced by the close of  business tomorrow.   The House will also consider H.R. 986, the Protecting Americans with  Preexisting Conditions Act of 2019.   On October 22, 2018, the Trump administration continued the  Republican assault on affordable, quality health coverage by issuing  new guidance to carry out section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act.   That new guidance, Madam Speaker, undermines patient protections and  threatens coverage for Americans with preexisting conditions. H.R. 986  blocks implementation of that guidance so as to preserve preexisting  condition protections and ensure that healthcare remains affordable and  comprehensive.   In addition, Madam Speaker, the House will consider H.R. 2157, the  Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2019.   The legislation would provide relief and recovery assistance for  Americans affected by recent natural disasters. It includes an  additional $3 billion above that which we passed and sent to the Senate  some weeks ago to address urgent needs following flooding in the  Midwest and tornadoes in the South that have occurred since the House  passed its first disaster relief bill in January, which, unfortunately,  has languished in the Senate.   Lastly, the bill includes an extension of the National Flood  Insurance Program until September 30, 2019.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's comments. I  won't respond to his initial comments. Obviously, we have a  disagreement on the impact that the administration has had on  preexisting conditions and on the section to which we are referring.  But we will have a full debate on that next week when we consider the  bill.   With respect to the gentleman's question as it relates to the  President's proposal for supplemental funding for border security,  which, by the way, was sent down yesterday and is now being reviewed,  the gentleman knows that we are strong supporters of border security,  and we want to make sure that the border is also humane.   The gentleman did not mention, but I want to point out, that in the  bill that we adopted to fund the government that was shut down for 35  days, in the bill that we passed, there was $755 million for  construction and technology at ports of entry where most drugs come  into the country illegally. We want to make sure those drugs stop.   We want to have border infrastructure that allows for not only  security but checking people who are coming into the country to make  sure they do not have illicit substances with them, either for their  own use or for sale.   In addition to that, we had $415 million for Border Patrol and  Customs agents and for humanitarian relief, which, obviously, was  anticipating the problem that currently confronts us and to make sure  that people who come across our border are treated humanely and with  respect.   In addition, there was $30.5 million for alternatives to detention  and family case management, which we think is important.   In addition to that, there was a half billion dollars, $563 million,  for immigration judges to reduce the backlog of cases.   Lastly, there was a half-billion dollars, $527 million, to assist  Central American countries, which has had a positive effect on reducing  crime and violence, one of the major reasons that people are fleeing  those countries, particularly the Northern Triangle countries, and  seeking asylum in the United States of America, pursuant to American  law.   But we are reviewing. We want to make sure, as I said at the  beginning, that our borders are secure and that we are treating people  consistent with American law, not separating children from their  families.   The President says he wants to perhaps renew that policy. We are  vigorously opposed to that policy. We think the President is wrong in  citing previous administrations that separated children. They did so in  very few instances, almost exclusively when they were concerned about  the safety of a child because of a parent's actions toward the child.   I will tell the gentleman that we are going to be reviewing the  President's request very carefully. Ms. Roybal-Allard, who chairs the  committee, and Mr. Thompson, who chairs the Homeland Security  Committee, both will be looking at it carefully. We will be making  recommendations in the near future as to the disposition of that  proposal.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   The point of reciting the dollars that were included just some weeks  ago to the administration is to point out that they had clearly  significant sums with which to operate now, and we will see what funds  they need in the future. But I wanted to point out that we have not  been negligent or sleeping, with respect to both border security and  the humanitarian treatment of those who come across our border seeking  asylum.   As I said, we will review it and see what determination needs to be  made on what further resources are necessary.    Madam Speaker, as the gentleman knows, and I thank him for  his observation, the bill to which he refers has essentially four  parts, including a provision with reference to the MOU for Israel's  assistance package, which we strongly support. We strongly support the  levels of that. That was not controversial.   Also, the Syria sanctions bill--of course, we have passed the Syria  sanctions bill, and we are working on other bills that relate to that.   Unfortunately, they are being held up in the Senate by some  Republican Senators. The Syria sanctions bill has not been moved in the  Senate. It also has the Jordan MOU, which is noncontroversial. It has  Syria, Jordan, and the MOU. Those are the three factors. One is  controversial.   It is controversial because of whether or not it comports with the  law. There have been a substantial number of State cases that have been  ruled on, State actions taken on this issue that have been held not to  be consistent with law and the Constitution.   We are concerned about that because I share the gentleman's view. I  am an opponent of the BDS movement. I think it harms one of our most  important allies, and it is inconsistent with, I think, the welfare of  the people in Israel and, frankly, the Palestinians in the West Bank.   Having said that, we are strong supporters of the resolution. That  resolution has bipartisan support, I think, and if it comes to the  floor, it will have bipartisan support. The gentleman indicated that.  [[Page H3432]]    We intend to come forward with that, but we are trying to work to  make sure that other suggestions are consistent with law, and we may  move with those as well.    We haven't made that determination yet.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.   Of course, what the gentleman didn't say is that the last Congress  had the most closed rules of any Congress in which I have served, the  most closed Congress that we have served in, according to outside  observers.   There were 30 amendments available to this bill. I am not sure how  many were asked on the Democratic side or the Republican side, frankly.  But having said that, there were Republican amendments made in order.  Mr. McGovern, the chairman of the Rules Committee, has said he intends  to have as many amendments made in order as they believe consistent  with getting our work done.                                time  1245    So I would say to the gentleman, unlike the last Congress, I think  you will see closed rules be very much the exception while, frankly,  they were very much the rule in the last Congress. But I take the  gentleman's point, and I will have discussions with Mr. McGovern. But  as you know and I know he is one of the fairest Members in this House,  and we will be trying to accommodate Members.   I will also say that the gentleman's statistics include the  appropriations process, where there were a lot of amendments on both  sides of the aisle. We have not gotten to the appropriations process.  As you know, it is my intention that we get to the appropriations  process and, frankly, try to conclude the appropriations process next  month, and I am sure there are going to be a lot of amendments coming  from both sides.    I thank the gentleman for his comments.   I think the viewers and the Members of Congress are probably glazed  over right now with these numbers, but I will tell the gentleman, there  was not a single open rule in the House that was presided over by Paul  Ryan, not one--not one. Check your record.   But as I say, Mr. McGovern has clearly said that we want to have  amendments made in order so that both sides can get a fair hearing, and  I think he has been doing that, and I think he will continue to do it.
