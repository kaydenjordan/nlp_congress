 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate  a great Mainer and a longtime public servant, Leslie Merrill. Leslie is  retiring this month after 22 years of dedicated constituent service to  the people of Maine's First District, having served under my  predecessor before joining my office.   I believe that the majority of us who work in this institution do so  because we want to improve the lives of those around us.   Leslie has committed her career to doing just that--whether guiding  asylum seekers and refugees through the immigration process, securing  passports for many anxious travelers, or assisting Maine youth with the  Academy nominations process so that they may pursue a career in the  military.   Beyond her considerable skills as a caseworker, she has been a mentor  to countless staff, sharing her Rolodex, her institutional knowledge,  and her relationships with those in agencies across the country, all of  which have been invaluable to constituents and colleagues throughout  the First District.   Importantly, she has been a treasured friend to so many of us in and  outside of the office. The lives of Mainers are infinitely better for  Leslie having served as their advocate, friend, and neighbor.   We will miss Leslie dearly. We wish her and Peter the very best in  their next adventure.                            ____________________
