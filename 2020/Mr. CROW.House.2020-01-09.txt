 Mr. Speaker, our Founders vested in Congress the solemn  responsibility of sending our sons and daughters to war.   I have often heard folks say that now is not the time to discuss the  use of force or the decision to send our men and women to fight. I  heard that in 2003 when I was carrying a rifle in Baghdad. I heard it  again in 2004 and 2005 when I was leading my unit through the mountains  of Afghanistan, and I am hearing it again today in the Halls of  Congress.   In the last 19 years, more than 7,000 Americans have given their  lives in these conflicts; 53,000 have been wounded; and we have spent  over $4 trillion of taxpayer money. Do not believe the fearmongering.   This resolution does nothing to prevent the President from protecting  the Nation against imminent threats. I have spent years fighting to  keep Americans safe and will continue to do so.   I may have laid down my rifle, but my oath to this country endures. I  will fight to ensure that we are having a discussion about when to send  our men and women, our sons and daughters, and our sisters and brothers  into harm's way. It is time to have this debate.
