 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding.   War is an incredible teacher, a brutal instructor. We have learned  lessons about triumph, sorrow, loss, and pain.   War teaches us to appreciate the simple things we take for granted,  like the ability to speak your mind, freely practice your religion,  even seeing your loved ones once a day.    It also teaches us that in war there are no unwounded soldiers.   There are those who came back with both visible scars and invisible  battle wounds, and there are those who did not come home at all.   Today, we pause to honor the 13 American servicemembers who lost  their lives during the evacuation efforts at the Kabul Airport in  Afghanistan on August 26, 2021.   These 13 fallen warriors, along with many others, made the ultimate  sacrifice. Each of them knew their duty, and they accepted the risks.  Not many answer the call, but they volunteered anyway.   Sent to evacuate Americans and Afghans that struggled to get past the  Taliban checkpoints in Kabul and through the airport gates, fearing  they would be left behind and left for dead. They knew the mission and  valiantly forged ahead; helping hundreds to safety, overcoming their  own fears, when a suicide bomb attack took their lives.   The terrorist act took the lives of at least 170 Afghans, 11 marines,  one Navy corpsman, and one Army special operations soldier, including  Lance Corporal David Lee Espinoza of Laredo, Texas; Sergeant Nicole Gee  of Roseville, California; Staff Sergeant Darin Taylor Hoover of Salt  Lake City, Utah; Staff Sergeant Ryan Knauss of Knoxville, Tennessee;  Corporal Hunter Lopez of Indio, California; Lance Corporal Rylee  McCollum of Bondurant, Wyoming; Corporal Dylan Merola of Rancho  Cucamonga, California; Lance Corporal Kareem Nikoui of Norco,  California; Corporal Daegan William-Tyeler Page of Omaha, Nebraska;  Sergeant Johanny Rosario Pichardo of Lawrence, Massachusetts; Corporal  Humberto Sanchez of Logansport, Indiana; Lance Corporal Jared Schmitz  of Wentzville, Missouri; Navy Corpsman Maxton Soviak of Berlin Heights,  Ohio.   I could not be more grateful for their service to our Nation. While  we as a Nation grieve for the servicemembers we have lost, we often  forget about the families who have lost even more.   To be a Gold Star Family is an honor no one wishes for. We owe our  sincerest gratitude to the families who eagerly awaited these 13  servicemembers' return. These families bear the greatest burden of  their loved one's sacrifice, and we can never thank them in a way that  will make up for their loss.    Awarding Congress' highest honor is a small token of  our appreciation.  [[Page H5852]]    Thank you to all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who  joined me in this effort.                                time  1745
