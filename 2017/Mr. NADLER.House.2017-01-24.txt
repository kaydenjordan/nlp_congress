 Madam Speaker, there is obviously a difference of opinion  in this country on the morality of abortion. I am appalled by the moral  arrogance of the Republicans who would use political power to impose  their views on the millions of women who disagree with them and want to  make their own decisions.    Though the Supreme Court has determined that neither Congress nor a  State may place an undue burden on a woman's right to terminate a  pregnancy, the Hyde amendment makes abortion access virtually  impossible for low-income women.   As unjust and despicable as the Hyde amendment is, this bill goes  beyond it. For the first time, Republicans are attempting to restrict  the right of women to use their own money to pay for abortions by  denying normal tax deductions for medical expenses if those medical  expenses include an abortion, by denying normal tax credits for health  insurance if that insurance covers abortion, and by denying use of tax- free money from an FSA or an HSA for an abortion.   The intent of this bill is obvious: to end insurance coverage for all  abortions, thereby making it nearly impossible for women to exercise  their constitutional rights.   Republicans should pay heed to the millions of women who marched to  protect their rights this weekend and are watching how we vote today.   Madam Speaker, there is obviously a difference of opinion in this  country on the morality of abortion. I am appalled at the moral  arrogance of the Republicans who would use political power to impose  their views on the millions of women who disagree with them and want to  make their own decisions.   If Saturday's protests are any indication, the women of America and  the world are watching us. They are not going to stand silently by  while Republicans in Congress and the White House take away their  rights, their health care, their families, and their livelihoods. They  sent this message loud and clear, but it seems my Republican colleagues  have not heard it. Yesterday morning, President Trump signed an  executive order reinstating the Global Gag Rule, which will deny  thousands of women around the world access to reproductive health care,  which will lead to a dramatic decline in maternal and infant health  around the world.   Today, Republicans are bringing up a bill that will deny women the  right to access comprehensive reproductive health care, a right  protected by the Constitution.   The right of a woman to decide whether to become pregnant, to decide  to continue her pregnancy, or to make the decision to terminate her  pregnancy is protected by the Constitution. The Supreme Court has  determined that neither Congress nor a state may place an ``undue  burden'' on that right. Denial of Medicaid or other government funding  that would be available for other medical procedures should be  considered an ``undue burden.'' For decades, Congress has imposed the  Hyde Amendment on every appropriations bill. This language  disproportionately impacts poor women and women of color, effectively  denying them their constitutional right to access abortion. Yet today,  Republicans want to make that language permanent.   As unjust and despicable as the Hyde Amendment is, this bill goes  beyond it. For the first time, Republicans are restricting the right of  women to use their own money to pay for abortions. This bill will deny  normal tax deductions for medical expenses if those expenses include  abortion, normal tax credits for health insurance if that insurance  includes abortion, and denying the ability to use tax-free money from  an FSA or HSA for an abortion.   The bill does include an exception in cases of rape, incest, or the  life of the mother. You may ask, how the IRS will know a woman's reason  for getting an abortion. Well, under this bill, women will have to  prove they are a victim of rape or incest or will have to provide  detailed medical records to determine just how at risk their life was.  Women will not only have to suffer the trauma of a sexual assault or  the loss of a pregnancy because of life-threatening complications, they  will now also have to face an IRS inquisition to get their own money  back. So much for Republicans' pledge to get ``big government'' out of  people's lives.   The intent of this bill is obvious: to end insurance coverage for all  abortions thereby making it nearly impossible for women to exercise  their constitutional rights. Republicans are clearly out of step with  the millions of women who marched to protect their rights this weekend.  Those women, and the millions more who stand with them, are watching  and ready to fight back. I am proud to vote against this bill and to  join their fight.
