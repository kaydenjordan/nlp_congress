 Mr. Speaker, this crazy push to make EVs the only  choice for U.S. car buyers without first building out our domestic  supply chains for critical minerals is a recipe for dependence on China  and, by extension, defaulting to China's filthy environmental  practices.   Aren't we already too beholden to China? It really stinks, but, yes,  we are.   Moreover, China's EV companies have announced significant investments  to manufacture EVs in Mexico, presumably to gain access to the North  American car market.   Why is the Biden White House hellbent on shoving their EV mandates  down Americans' throats?   China is not our friend, Mr. Speaker, and unlike China's treatment of  their very own citizens, we should not be dictating to Americans what  they can or cannot drive. In America, we let consumers choose the cars  they drive. It is that simple. Even one of our speakers over there said  that she chose to drive an EV.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill.
