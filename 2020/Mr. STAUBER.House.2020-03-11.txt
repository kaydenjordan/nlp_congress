 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Shawn Manke from  Cambridge, Minnesota, for his recent promotion to the rank of brigadier  general in the Minnesota National Guard.   Shawn grew up on the shores of Spectacle Lake in southwestern Isanti  County, and spent his summers working at his family's resort. He is a  proud graduate of Cambridge-Isanti High School.   Upon graduation from the ROTC program at the University of North  Dakota, Shawn was commissioned as an Army aviator in 1991. After being  released from Active Duty, Shawn knew he was not ready to give up his  life of service and enlisted as an officer in the Minnesota National  Guard.   During his time with the Minnesota National Guard, Shawn has held  many leadership positions, including director of Army aviation,  commander of the 34th Combat Aviation Brigade, and commander of the 2nd  Battalion 147th Assault Helicopter.   Shawn's exemplary leadership has earned him numerous military awards,  such as the Legion of Merit, Bronze Star Medal, and the Meritorious  Service Medal with four bronze oakleaf clusters.    Brigadier General Shawn Manke is an accomplished officer with the  knowledge and experience necessary for his new role.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Minnesota's Eighth Congressional District,  I thank him for his years of dedicated service, and congratulate him on  his well-deserved promotion.                   Standing with the Grand Rapids Community     Mr. Speaker, I rise today on the House floor to offer  words of consolation and support to the Grand Rapids community in  Minnesota's Eighth Congressional District as they mourn the loss of two  local businesses from a tragic fire.   Last Saturday, a fire broke out in the basement at Lakeview  Behavioral Health, and quickly spread to the VFW Post 1720 building  next door.   While we are fortunate that no one was harmed in the fire, both  businesses are a total loss.   I was deeply saddened by this news, as the VFW Post in Grand Rapids  served as a place where combat veterans could gather for support and  camaraderie since 1929. It also housed valuable historic memorabilia,  much of which is now gone.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the brave firefighters and first responders who  [[Page H1596]]  quickly responded to this emergency and prevented this fire from  spreading further. Your dedication to this community is greatly  appreciated.   Mr. Speaker, my heart goes out to the veterans who frequented this  VFW post, the patients who attended Lakeview Behavioral Health, and the  entire Grand Rapids community as they recover from this loss.   Please know that I stand by ready to help in whatever way I can  during this rebuilding process.                 Honoring the Life's Work of Howard Hedstrom     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the contributions of  Howard Hedstrom of Grand Marais, Minnesota, and the entire Hedstrom  family.   Last month, at the age of 71, Howard retired as president of Hedstrom  Lumber Company, a business that his family built from the ground up and  ran for over 100 years.   Howard's grandfather, Andrew Hedstrom, was a Swedish immigrant who  pieced together a used sawmill to build a company that would employ  three generations of Hedstroms.   While Hedstrom Lumber Company had humble origins, thanks to  determination, leadership, and the foresight of company employees, like  Howard, it evolved into one of the largest employers in Cook County,  Minnesota.   Mr. Speaker, for generations, Minnesotans have worked in our forests,  helping to support their families and boost rural economies. The  Hedstrom family is a fine example of this great tradition.   I am incredibly grateful to Howard and his entire family for their  dedication to the Grand Marais community and Minnesota as a whole.   Mr. Speaker, I wish Howard a relaxing retirement spent with his wife,  Bonnie, and the rest of his loved ones.                            ____________________
