 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of Federal workers  across the country.   Right now, in Dallas, Texas, the American Federation of Government  Employees local chapter, or AFGE, is organizing a rally to hold the  President accountable for this shutdown.   Today, the President is finally making his first official visit to  the Texas-Mexico border. He will be visiting McAllen, a town that I  have visited on numerous occasions and have many friends, and I adore  and love the town.   In 2018, McAllen saw their lowest crime rate in 30 years. And let's  be clear: Democrats care about border security. We care about stopping  crime. But we won't roll over because the President is getting  frustrated that the majority of Americans don't want his wall, plain  and simple.   The President and Senate Republicans are choosing political self- interest over our families. The members of the Dallas chapter of AFGE  are real people who are facing two real burdens as a direct result of  this shutdown. They are struggling to pay for rent and groceries.   The gut punch is that the President is far more concerned with his  base in 2020 than securing the well-being of over 800,000 families.                            ____________________
