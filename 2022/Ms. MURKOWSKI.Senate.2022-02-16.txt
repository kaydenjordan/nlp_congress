 Mr. President, I have come to the floor this evening  to speak in honor and recognition of a woman by the name of Elizabeth  Peratrovich.   Elizabeth Peratrovich is recognized in my State of Alaska as a  champion, a relentless champion, for civil rights for all Alaskans.   It is on this day, the 16th of February, that the State of Alaska  observes Elizabeth Peratrovich Day. In communities across the State, in  schools, cultural centers, you are going to be seeing activities to  honor this really remarkable Alaska Native leader.   PBS has an award-winning show for children called ``Molly of  Denali.'' It is a great TV show, and they recently had an episode  highlighting the story of Elizabeth Peratrovich.   It was just 2 years ago, now, that her image was placed on a dollar  coin issued by the U.S. Mint. So that recognition has gone beyond the  State of Alaska, clearly, to the national and the Federal level.   So as we are celebrating Elizabeth Peratrovich Day back home, I am  going to share a little bit of her story with the Senate because it is  a legacy of seeking and realizing a more inclusive society and  certainly a more representative democracy.   Elizabeth was a Tlingit, a member of the Raven/Sockeye or Lukaax-Adi  clan. She was actually born on Independence Day, born in Petersburg,  AK, in 1911.   And it was just a year after that, 1912, a group of Native people  from across the southeastern part of the State mobilized to form an  organization called the Alaska Native Brotherhood, ANB. Then, 2 years  later, they formed the Alaska Native Sisterhood. ANB, ANS these are  considered the oldest indigenous civil rights organizations in the  world, started right there in southeastern Alaska.   ANB and ANS sought to advance equal opportunities for education, for  employment, for housing, and they fought to secure Native civil rights.   Elizabeth married Roy Peratrovich, and the two of them became very  active in ANB and ANS activities in the 1940s.  [[Page S750]]    In 1941, they had moved to Juneau, and they encountered a level of  discrimination in that community against Alaska Native peoples that, as  we look at the accounts of the time, paralleled the Jim Crow practices  in the South, but it strengthened their resolve. It strengthened their  commitment to fight back against the discrimination that they saw.   Through their work with ANB and ANS, Elizabeth and Roy began  advocating for an antidiscrimination bill in the Territorial  legislature. If you will recall, we didn't become a State until 1959.  This is the early forties, and they are talking about an  antidiscrimination bill in our legislature. They pointed out to all who  would listen that Alaska Natives were paying taxes for a public school  system that excluded their children. They weren't part of that school  system. They pointed out that Alaska Native men were fighting in World  War II, but then on their return, they were denied rights that other  veterans enjoyed.    Those fundamental discriminations and many more were what drove their  pursuit for equal rights not just for Alaska Natives but for all people  in Alaska.   So they had gone to Juneau in 1941. That antidiscrimination bill  didn't pass immediately. It was reintroduced in 1945. And there is a  lot of discussion about the pivotal moment in time when eyes were  opened and, really, minds were also opened in awareness.   This was the time of debate where this antidiscrimination bill had  passed the house, had moved over to the senate, and there was a  Territorial senator who denounced these efforts to desegregate, and he  stood up on the senate floor, and he said:         Who are these people, barely out of savagery, who want to       associate with us whites, with 5,000 years of recorded       civilization behind us?    Pretty inflammatory if you are sitting there in those Senate chambers  listening to that, certainly--certainly--to an Alaska Native person.   At the end of the debate, the public was offered a chance to express  their views in front of the legislature. That is not something that you  have happen in most legislatures. We don't have it in our legislature  now, but in our Territorial legislature, the public was offered a  chance to weigh in here.   And Elizabeth Peratrovich stood in the back of this senate gallery,  and in her remarks, she said:         I would not have expected that I, who am ``barely out of       savagery,'' would have to remind the gentleman with 5,000       years of recorded civilization behind them of our Bill of       Rights.    And when asked if she thought that the bill would eliminate  discrimination, she replied:         Do your laws against larceny and even murder prevent those       crimes? No law will eliminate crimes, but at least you as       legislators can assert to the world that you recognize the       evil of the present situation and speak your intent to help       us overcome discrimination.    Imagine this scene. You are part of this legislative body, and from  the back of the gallery, a Native woman stands to speak to address this  elected body.   Following her comments, there was a long period of silence, and then  there was applause through the gallery and through the senate floor,  including from some who had previously opposed the bill.   Alaska's Governor at the time, Ernest Gruening, went on to sign the  antidiscrimination act, the Nation's first antidiscrimination act,  signed into law on February 16, 1945. This was almost two decades  before the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964.   So it is something that when we in Alaska think about the history of  discrimination that we have had, that certainly Alaska Native people  have endured--endured far too long--to have led the country in terms of  putting into law the first antidiscrimination act in this country a  couple decades before the Civil Rights Act advanced through this  Congress.   During an Indian Affairs Committee hearing on Native voting access  last October, the president of the Alaska Federation Natives, Julie  Kitka, reminded us that these events are not very old, and sometimes we  think of Elizabeth Peratrovich as part of our history, but she,  Elizabeth, and her husband Roy, and the impact that they had on Alaska  and the way that they strengthened our democracy is our current history  as well.   So we honor Elizabeth Peratrovich's legacy of standing up for what is  right. She is an inspiration because she set the example that when you  see something wrong, you speak out and you do something about it.   And she also provided a great example for why we need to listen--why  we need to listen to all perspectives and voices, especially those who  have been left out or left behind, oftentimes intentionally.   I think of Stella Martin of Kake, AK, a champion of equal rights  herself. She described Elizabeth Peratrovich as ``a fighter with velvet  gloves.'' And she was truly a fighter. Elizabeth Peratrovich Day is  also a timely reminder for those of us here in the U.S. Senate. We all  have an obligation to respond to the calls from our constituents who  are seeking protection, including through electoral reforms and  improvements for voter access.   We all know that we went through a very partisan exercise on voting  rights legislation here on the floor earlier this year. Some may say it  is hard to see how that advanced the debate on this issue; but it  didn't change the underlying fact that we do need to come together to  advance good solid policy in this area. I am working with a group of  Senators. There are around 16 of us, I think, total. But we are  continuing to focus on these issues of election reform. We want to try  to determine a bipartisan path forward so that we can actually move  important safeguards and clarifications into the law. And it may not be  easy to take on some of these complicated issues, particularly when you  get the pulls from both sides to not engage to try to come to the  middle. But like we did with the infrastructure bill, like we are doing  with the Violence Against Women Act, we need to follow a path that  allows us to get some things done as opposed to simply sending  messages.   As Alaska celebrates Elizabeth Peratrovich, I hope the Senate will  look to her legacy for inspiration as we seek unity and follow her  example of treating our fellow citizens with respect. We have got too  much at stake to operate in any other lesser manner.   I thank the Presiding Officer for his attention.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, Alaskans recognized February  11 to celebrate the Alaska 2-1-1 system, which connects community  resource specialists with Alaskans in need of help finding vital  services and resources. The Alaska 2-1-1 system has been instrumental  in providing Alaskans with information regarding key health and human  services within their community. Alaskans utilize 2-1-1 in emergency  situations when barriers to connecting to care are most challenging.  The 2-1-1 system has provided information regarding COVID-19 testing  sites, vaccine clinics, and other services including childcare,  emergency food and shelter services, senior services, and alcohol and  drug treatment programs. One of the biggest challenges Alaskans  continue to face is not knowing where to turn for help in their  communities during a crisis. Having a specialist available at no cost  is a critical element in accessing support and services. The Alaska 2- 1-1 system helps to bridge that gap for Alaskans. I thank all of those  working at Alaska 2-1-1 for their service to our neighbors and  State.                            ____________________
