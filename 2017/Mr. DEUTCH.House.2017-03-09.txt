 Mr. Speaker, today, March 9, marks 10 years since my  constituent Bob Levinson disappeared in Iran. I had hoped that I would  not have to come to the floor today to mark this day or to introduce  another resolution on Bob. I had hoped that Bob would be home in south  Florida with his wife, his seven children--one of whom is with us  today--and his six grandchildren. Bob should be home in time to see his  two new grandchildren born later this year.   Ten years is too long. This family deserves answers. Iran must stop  playing games, promising to assist finding Bob, agreeing last year to  open a new dedicated channel for Bob's case, only time and time again  refusing to follow through. Iran must provide meaningful information  that will bring Bob home. This new administration must press Iran at  every opportunity. I stand ready to work with them and with anyone who  is committed to bringing Bob back home to his family where he belongs.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, the right to choose one's own counsel is a  basic right in our democracy. This is a right that is a foundation of a  fair and impartial judicial system.   Having the right to choose one's own attorney ensures that a person  can hire an attorney who will best represent their interests and  protect their rights in the judicial process.   H.R. 985, the Fairness in Class Action Litigation Act, undermines  this basic right by requiring a court to deny any class action  certification based solely on a proposed class representative or named  plaintiff being represented by a family member. The bill provides no  discretion to the court and no exceptions.   The bill uses an expansive definition that includes not only  immediate family members, but extended parts of a family tree by blood  and marriage. Such a broad definition is an unfair restriction on the  right to an attorney of one's own choosing.   Previously, the manager's amendment modified this provision but did  not relieve these concerns. Such broad, blanket assumptions about  family relationships fail to recognize the importance of trust and  expertise into the attorney-client relationship.   In many instances, a family member will best represent their  interests in court or could have specialized training and experience  relevant to the case, yet the language in this bill does not provide  for any discretion or any exceptions.   The fact that a lawyer representing a potential class is a family  member of a named class member does not, in itself, create a conflict  of interest; and under current law, there is a process for courts to  address real conflicts of interest when they arise.   Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 23(g), courts have an  extensive list that must be satisfied when appointing counsel to  represent a class. There also already is a strong disincentive against  conflicts through fairness hearings after settlement is reached. Any  potential conflict of interest risks spoiling the agreement and wasting  the efforts of counsel and the class.   Removing the discretion of the courts is overly broad and will remove  access to appropriate counsel where no conflict exists. I urge strong  support for my amendment and the removal of this provision from this  bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to adopt this  important amendment to ensure that they have an opportunity to be heard  when they are injured by an attorney of their choice.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, the  right to vote, the right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment,  and other rights enumerated in the Constitution have an intrinsic value  that cannot be adequately expressed in dollars and cents. When a  person's constitutional rights are violated, they cannot be made whole  entirely with money, and yet the bill that we have before us today  would require our judicial system to hang a price tag on our most  cherished constitutional rights.   Under H.R. 985, the Fairness in Class Action Litigation Act, if a  ``judgment or proposed settlement in a class action provides for  equitable relief, the portion of any attorney's fee award to class  counsel that is attributed to the equitable relief shall be limited to  a reasonable percentage of the value of the equitable relief, including  any injunctive relief.''   Mr. Chairman, when a court grants such relief, it is not awarding  money to a plaintiff. In these cases, the courts are stepping in to say  this is a violation of constitutional rights and it must stop.   My amendment would strike the provision in this bill that would  devalue our fundamental rights by requiring a highly subjective and  wasteful, costly, and demeaning process of putting a price tag on these  rights. Worse, it would deter attorneys from bringing critical civil  lawsuits that reform systemic and widespread violations of individual  rights.   When we think of class actions, we usually imagine a group of people  seeking money to compensate them for an injury or a harm--a toxic  spill, a horrific accident, an Erin Brockovich-type story. But the  reality is that there are many class actions that do not seek monetary  damages but are fighting to right a systemic wrong in our society.   These class actions have made lasting changes to our legal system and  society that have moved our country closer to equality and justice,  landmark class actions such as: Brown v. Board of Education, ending  separate but equal as a basis for racial segregation in our schools;  Allen v. State Board of Elections, finding that section 5 of the Voting  Rights Act requires preclearance of any changes in voting practices;  and Alexander v. Holmes County School District, requiring immediate  integration of the schools. In these cases, plaintiffs asked the courts  to protect and preserve their constitutional rights for themselves and  others in similar situations in the future.   Under the system set forward by H.R. 985, a court would have to also  set a dollar value to the judgment. How do you place a price tag on  desegregating our Nation's public schools? How do you place a price tag  on protecting the right to vote? How do you put a price tag on  preserving the Constitution's Sixth Amendment right to counsel? How do  you put a price tag on the fundamental right of marriage? It is not  possible. These are fundamental, constitutional rights, and these  rights are priceless.   If this bill were to become law, courts and civil cases would become  bogged down in ancillary litigation aimed at establishing the value of  rights, rights that are protected through equitable and injunctive  relief. It would be a mess, and we don't have to make this unforced  error.   I oppose the underlying bill, but it is my sincere hope that, if the  House is going to pass it, the least that we can do is remove this  provision from the bill and end this insulting pretense that the courts  or anyone else can put a dollar value on our constitutional freedoms.   I urge support for my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, section 1983 that my friend, the chairman,  refers to as to providing attorney's fees, requires a determination of  attorney's fees by the number of hours reasonably expended on  litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly fee.                                time  1700    This bill is very different from that. Instead of referring to hours  and an hourly rate reasonably spent by an attorney, this bill requires  the court to establish the value of the actual, equitable, or  injunctive relief.   As I have suggested already, I cannot think of anyone who would  believe that we should leave it up to a court to put a value on our  constitutional rights that are, without question, priceless in our  democracy.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this good amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
