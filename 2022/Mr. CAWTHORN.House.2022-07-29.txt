 Mr. Speaker, a right is not truly a right if it  requires permission from the ruling class. Mr. Speaker, you and others  in this body seek to strip us of the most sacred tenet of natural law.  With H.R. 1808, this body is attempting to disarm Americans by  outlawing basic rifles and handguns.   It seems only logical to think that a government intent on disarming  its citizens is planning to do something that those same citizens would  utilize firearms to prevent.   In response to this radical gun control bill, I submitted H.R. 8399,  effectively known as the double tap to tyranny bill, to amend the  Internal Revenue Code and repeal the National Firearms Act, thus  removing infringements on our Second Amendment.   H.R. 1808 and the NFA both stem from the same class of  totalitarianism. Our Founders understood that the first steps to  tyranny begin by removing every safeguard that hinders its approach.   Mr. Speaker, let me ask you this: Why do you want my guns? You seem  perfectly content sitting behind a squadron of armed guards while your  constituents are slaughtered by gang violence in the streets. Perhaps  your reason for taking away my rights to defend myself are not as well- intentioned as you present them to be.                            ____________________
