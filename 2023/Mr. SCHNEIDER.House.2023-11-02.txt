 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill.   Eighty years ago, the Greatest Generation laid their lives on the  line fighting for our country and the free world in Europe, Africa, the  Middle East, and the Pacific.   Today, we are facing grave global challenges and threats not seen in  decades. The world is again looking to the United States to lead, and  we must not shrink from the burdens of our responsibilities.   We are here today talking about Israel and our ironclad commitment to  its security. Israel is fighting a war for its survival and must defeat  Hamas.   Hamas is a genocidal, nihilistic terrorist organization dedicated to  the destruction of the State of Israel and the murder of the Jewish  people. There will not be peace for Palestinians or Israelis until  Hamas can no longer rule over Gaza or threaten Israel from its borders.   It is also important to understand that Putin's war against Ukraine  cannot be separated from Hamas' war against Israel. Success in both  wars is imperative for the interests of the United States.   We must demonstrate to our allies and our enemies that we are not  just able but are committed to supporting Israel, Ukraine, and our  friends in the Indo-Pacific as they defend themselves.   Sadly, at this moment, the new Speaker of the House and the bill he  brought to the floor today are coming up woefully short.   Leaders from both sides of the aisle have long accepted three tenets  in their support for Israel:   Number one, support for Israel must never be a bargaining chip.   Second, support for Israel is and must remain broadly bipartisan.  [[Page H5306]]    Third, aid for Israel must never be conditioned.   This bill violates all three.   Right now, Israel urgently needs our strong support. Meanwhile,  Republicans who have too long tried to use Israel as a political,  partisan wedge are now conditioning aid to Israel on the partisan  demand we defund the IRS.   Reflecting the cynicism of this move, their condition for supporting  Israel will not even pay for itself but will dig a fiscal hole $27  billion deeper.   It will be far better and less costly in blood and treasure if we  ensure Russia, Iran, and Hamas are defeated in their current wars than  if our enemies achieve strategic victories against Ukraine and Israel,  and America has to strengthen our defenses in Europe and the Middle  East.   Speaker Johnson's plan is dangerous, reckless, and irresponsible. It  is dangerous because it endangers Israel's security. It is reckless  because it conditions aid to Israel for the first time. It is  irresponsible because it adds $27 billion to the national debt.   I am fully committed to ensuring that Israel gets the aid it needs as  quickly as possible. I will work with anyone, Democrat and Republican,  to get this done.   We all know the Senate will send us a robust bipartisan package. I  look forward to leading the charge to make sure that package passes  overwhelmingly in this House.   I cannot support the terribly flawed, weak, and dangerous bill  Speaker Johnson and the Republicans have on the floor today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to reject the cynical bill  before us.                                time  1630
