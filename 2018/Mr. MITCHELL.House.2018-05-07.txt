 Mr. Speaker, today, May 7, is my wife's birthday. It  may seem like a small thing to many, but it is hard to describe the  sacrifice and commitment that it takes to be the spouse of someone who  serves in government--the additional things she takes on when Dad is  not home, the fun and games when the school calls, or the text message  you get: Where did you leave whatever? I need to find it.   So, today, I want to briefly say to my spouse, to Sherry: Thank you  very much for understanding my need to serve and joining me in that  effort in serving in the House. Happy birthday, and I will see you at  the end of the week.                            ____________________
