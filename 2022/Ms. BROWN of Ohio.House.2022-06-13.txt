 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Alex  Johnson, who will soon be retiring after nearly a decade of service as  Cuyahoga Community College's president.   Dr. Johnson retires as a pillar of the Cleveland community. His deep  commitment to Tri-C's students and forward-thinking leadership helped  shape graduates, like myself, who were prepared for a lifetime of  success in northeast Ohio.   During Dr. Johnson's tenure, Tri-C produced a record number of  graduates and increased its graduation rates, all while remaining  committed to the school's core mission of delivering affordable higher  education, providing equitable job opportunities, and ensuring  successful degree completion. Meanwhile, throughout the tumult of the  COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Johnson served as a steady hand at the helm,  ensuring students' continued success.   As a Tri-C graduate and the Representative for Ohio's 11th  Congressional District, I deeply appreciate Dr. Johnson's extraordinary  leadership, unparalleled vision, and lasting accomplishments. His  legacy will only continue to grow through the countless students,  teachers, and administrators he impacted.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, thank you for the kind  introduction. I thank Chairwomen Beatty and all my Congressional Black  Caucus colleagues for highlighting the significance of Juneteenth  during today's Special Order hour.   Madam Speaker, the date was Monday, June 19, 1865; the location,  Galveston, Texas. It was 2\1/2\ years after President Lincoln issued  the Emancipation Proclamation and 2 months after the Civil War ended,  250,000 enslaved Black people in Texas still did not know they were  free.   That was until--on that Texas summer day--Federal troops rode into  town and a Union general read aloud an order announcing their freedom.   Emancipation didn't happen all at once, and slavery wasn't formally  abolished until the passage of the 13th Amendment later that year. That  19th day in June came to be known as Juneteenth, a day celebrating the  end of slavery in America.   The year following the 1865 declaration, freedman in Texas organized  the first of what became the annual June 19 celebration. Slowly but  surely, Juneteenth celebrations spread across the country.   Last year, thanks to the hard work of my friend, my colleague, the  dynamic incomparable Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, President Biden  signed a bill into law recognizing Juneteenth as a Federal holiday.   Juneteenth is a time to celebrate, and it is a time to take pride in  the many contributions of African Americans to our society and our  country across the generations.   It is also a time of remembrance and action. On Juneteenth, we  acknowledge a dark period in our history and its lasting legacy of  inequality and injustice--a legacy that continues to influence our  country today. We have made  [[Page H5476]]  much progress as a Nation, yet we still have a long way to go. Progress  is not possible without a full accounting of both our brightest days  and our darkest nights.   As we honor those enslaved Texans who finally learned of their  freedom 157 years ago, let us recommit to fulfilling the promise of  Juneteenth--and indeed of our Nation at large--by fighting for  equality, liberty, and justice for all.
