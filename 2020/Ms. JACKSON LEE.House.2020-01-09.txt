 Madam Speaker, I rise this morning to congratulate a  very significant and historic high school, Jack Yates High School. Jack  Yates High School was founded by the founding father, if you will, of  the African American community in Houston, Freedmen's Town.   He is the founder of Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church. He is respected  at Texas Southern University, and today they announced in a public  school that they will implement an international baccalaureate.   In the midst of the tumultuous times that we have, how important it  is that high school students will be engaged in discussions of peace,  diplomacy, understanding world engagement, understanding the value of  languages and being diverse, recognizing the wonderful experiment of  the United States founded by those who fled persecution and indicated  in the Constitution we have organized to create a more perfect union.   The more young people, more minorities that we can get in programs  like an international baccalaureate where they will come out with that  document and be ready to perch on the leadership role is outstanding.   To Jack Yates High School, I salute you. You are mighty. You are  important, and God bless you.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, the President cannot unilaterally go  to war with Iran, nor are we safer since January 2, 2020, after having  targeted and killed the second-in-command of Iran. The American people,  as well as our troops, are in more jeopardy.   In 2002, I was here, and I offer these words from my statement on the  floor regarding President Bush. ``Always a question of the greatest  importance, our decision today,'' in 2002, ``is further weighted by the  fact that we are being asked to sanction a new foreign policy doctrine  that gives a President the power to launch a unilateral and preemptive  first strike against Iraq before we have utilized our diplomatic  options.''   I further went on to say that ``our own intelligence agencies report  that there is currently little chance of chemical and biological attack  from Saddam Hussein on U.S. forces or territories.''   Proven right, endless war, continuous loss of life of our treasured  young men and women and many injured--this resolution and rule are  imperative to assert constitutional authority to ensure the protection  of the American people.    Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the House  Committees on the Judiciary and on Homeland Security, as a member  serving in this body on September 11, 2001 and throughout the fateful  and tragic war in Iraq, and as an original cosponsor, I rise in strong  support of the rule governing debate of H. Con. Res. 83, a concurrent  resolution directing the President to terminate the engagement of  United States Armed Forces in hostilities in or against Iran, as well  as the underlying legislation.   I thank the gentlelady from Michigan, Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin,  for introducing this resolution and Foreign Affairs Committee Chair  Eliot Engel for his work on this important resolution.   I also thank Speaker Pelosi for taking swift action to afford the  House the opportunity to honor its constitutional duty to keep the  American people safe by limiting the President from taking further  precipitous military actions regarding Iran.   We know from bitter and heart-breaking experience the truth that  while dangerous and bloody battles are fought by the military, it is  the nation that goes to war.   And that is why the Framers lodged the awesome power to declare and  take the nation to war not in the hands of a single individual, but  through Article I, Section, clause 11 in the collective judgment of  Congress, the representatives of the American people.   It is true of course that the United States has an inherent right to  self-defense against imminent armed attacks and that it maintains the  right to ensure the safety of diplomatic personnel serving abroad.   But in matters of imminent armed attacks, the executive branch must  inform Congress as to why military action was necessary within a  certain window of opportunity, the possible harm that missing the  window would cause, and why the action was likely to prevent future  disastrous attacks against the United States.   Only after being fully briefed and informed is the Congress in a  position to validate and ratify or disapprove and terminate the action.   Madam Speaker, Section 5(c) of the 1973 War Power Resolution, Pub. L.  93-148, provides that whenever ``United States Armed Forces are engaged  in hostilities outside the territory of the United States, its  possessions and territories without a declaration of war or specific  statutory authorization, such forces shall be removed by the President  if the Congress so directs by concurrent resolution.''   The military action ordered on Friday, January 3, 2020 by the  President to kill Major General Qasem Soleimani, the head of Iran's  Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, may have rid the world of a major  architect of terror but leaves unanswered the critically important  question of why the action was taken at that time.   Even at this late hour, members of Congress have not been briefed or  been shown compelling evidence by the Administration that the action  was necessary to repel a credible, certain, and imminent attack on the  United States, its allies, or American civilians or military personnel.   The Administration has yet to provide proof or assuage the concerns  of most member of Congress, and of the American people, that the  killing of Major General Soleimani was a necessary action that was the  product of a carefully crafted geopolitical strategy developed after  extensive discussion within the national security apparatus regarding  the short and long-term consequences for the security of the region and  our nation and its people.   Similarly, we do not know whether the decision to engage in the  hostile action against Iran was made by the President in consultation  and agreement with our regional and international allies and whether  there is now in place a strategy to ensure that the action taken does  not lead to a greater escalation of tensions between Iran and the  United States or in the worst case, another war in the Middle East  placing at risk the lives and safety of millions of persons.   Madam Speaker, Major General Soleimani was the long-time chief of the  Quds Force, the elite special forces battalion of the Islamic  Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), assisted Syrian strongman Bashar al  Assad slaughter hundreds of thousands of his own people in the Syrian  civil war, helped incite the Houthis in Yemen's civil war, and oversaw  the brutal killing of hundreds of Iraqi protesters recently  demonstrating against Iranian influence in their country.   Iran's Quds Force, under Soleimani's leadership, has long been  suspected by the U.S. Government of involvement in a 2011 plot to  assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the United States and  bore responsibility for the deaths of more than 600 Americans killed by  Iranian proxies since the 2003 inception of the war in Iraq.    Over the past eight months, in response to rising tensions with Iran,  the United States has introduced over 15,000 additional forces into the  Middle East.   But Major General Soleimani was more than a military leader, he was a  high-ranking political leader, second only in power and influence to  the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.   In fact, Soleimani was regarded by many as a future president of  Iran.   It was foreseeable therefore that the killing of Soleimani by  American forces was likely to invite retaliation by Iran putting at  risk American military and civilian personnel, as well as its allies in  the region and across the globe.   It must be remembered, Madam Speaker, the United States has national  interests in preserving its partnership with Iraq and other countries  in the region, including by combating terrorists, including the Islamic  State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS); preventing Iran from achieving a  nuclear weapons capability; and supporting the people of Iraq, Iran,  and other countries throughout the Middle East who demand an end to  government corruption and violations of basic human rights.   For these reasons it is essential that the Administration have in  place a sound, well-considered, and meticulously developed strategy for  managing disputes with Iran.   That does not appear to be the case.   There is no evidence that the Administration consulted with Congress  or the Gang of 8, no evidence that it enlisted or even consulted our  allies in NATO or the region, no evidence that the Administration has a  working and well-functioning national security council apparatus.   This is a critical Pottery Barn failure in dealing with the Middle  East for as former Secretary of State Colin Powell stated before the  Iraq War, ``If you break it, you bought it.''   Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has vowed that a ``harsh  retaliation is waiting'' for the United States as a consequence of the  action taken by the Administration.   It is imperative that the Administration have in place a strategy to  counter and deescalate any Iranian response and have in place measure  to protect the safety of Americans residing or travelling abroad and to  protect the security of the homeland.   The deliberate and targeted killing of Major General Soleimani has  the potential to be the most consequential assassination of a political  leader since World War I was started by the assassination of Archduke  Franz Ferdinand Carl Ludwig Joseph Maria of Austria, the heir  presumptive of the throne of Austria-Hungary in 1914.   One of the enduring lessons of the Great War too often forgotten but  so well documented in Barbara Tuchman's prize-winning history, ``The  Guns of August,'' is that misconceptions, miscalculations, and mistakes  result in the tragedy of horrific warfare; among them are  overestimating the value of one's economic power, harboring an ill- founded belief in quick victory, and a failure to consider political  backlash warfare.   Madam Speaker, the decision to send American men and women into  harm's way is the most consequential decision the Constitution vests in  the Congress and the President.   Members of Congress must be apprised of all facts material to the  decision and have access to relevant documentation, classified and  otherwise, and afforded the opportunity to meet in small groups and in  secure locations with senior members of the Administration's national  security team who can answer detailed and pointed questions and provide  requested information.   The Constitution wisely divides the responsibility of deciding when  to use military force to protect the nation and its interests between  the President and the Congress, the representatives of the American  people.   The United States' military involvement in Iraq begun in March 2003  and continuing to this day has taught this nation the importance of  having accurate and reliable information when deciding whether to use  military force and the painful costs in lives and treasure of acting  precipitously or unwisely.   We cannot and dare not repeat that mistake.   That is why I am proud to support and cosponsor H. Con. Res. 83, the  concurrent resolution before us, which directs the President to  terminate immediately the use of United States Armed Forces to engage  in hostilities in or against Iran or any part of its government or  military, unless Congress has declared war or enacted specific  statutory authorization for such use of the Armed Forces; or the use of  the Armed Forces is necessary and appropriate to defend against an  imminent armed attack upon the United States, its territories or  possessions, or its Armed Forces, consistent with the requirements of  the War Powers Resolution.   Our constituents, all Americans across the country, and the people of  the globe are looking to us to ensure that tensions between the United  States and Iran are deescalated, that smart power and diplomacy be  employed, and every effort be made to ensure the peace and  [[Page H91]]  safety in America and the region, and the lives of the innocent not be  placed at risk.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Burgess is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 781         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       resolution (H. Res. 783) honoring the members of the military       and intelligence community who carried out the mission that       killed Qasem Soleimani, and for other purposes. The       resolution shall be considered as read. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the resolution and preamble       to adoption without intervening motion or demand for division       of the question except one hour of debate equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Armed Services. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall       not apply to the consideration of House Resolution 783.    Madam Speaker, America is not safe or safer because  of the acts that occurred local time on January 3, 2020.   America is in more jeopardy, as are our brave men and women in the  United States military, whom we hold in the highest esteem and say to  their families: We are obligated and committed to honoring and thanking  you, but to also recognizing, when we send you into battle, there would  and should be the consultation, the engagement, the understanding of  the intelligence and the work between Article I, the United States  Congress, and Article II, the President of the United States.   I will not allow any Member of Congress to malign my Gold Star  families or to suggest that any Member here does not respect the  ultimate sacrifice that their family members took. Family members who  are Gold Star should not be used in a political debate. They should  only be honored.   And I will not accept anyone describing Democrats as mourning  terrorists.    Madam Speaker, what I will say is that nothing in  this resolution speaks to any named person. It says that this body,  this Congress, must adhere to its duty to be able to ensure that the  President of the United States does not unilaterally take us into war  with Iran. We will not stand for it.   It does, as well, say that my resolution in 2002 indicated that we  should not have gone to war in Iraq.   Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the House Committees on the  Judiciary and on Homeland Security, as a member serving in this body on  September 11, 2001 and throughout the fateful and tragic war in Iraq,  and as an original cosponsor, I rise in strong support of H. Con.

Madam Speaker, today our Nation is debating the very profound  question of war and peace and the structure and nature of international  relations in the 21st century. Before us today is the serious and  fundamental question of life and death: whether or not this Congress  will give the President authority to commit this Nation to war.   Always a question of the greatest importance, our decision today is  further weighted by the fact that we are being asked to sanction a new  foreign policy doctrine that gives the President the power to launch a  unilateral and preemptive first strike against Iraq before we have  utilized our diplomatic options.   My amendment provides an option and the time to pursue it. Its goal  is to give the United Nations inspections process a chance to work. It  provides an option short of war with the objective of protecting the  American people and the world from any threat posed by Iraqi weapons of  mass destruction.   The amendment urges the United States to reengage the diplomatic  process, and it stresses our government's commitment to eliminating any  Iraqi weapons of mass destruction through United Nations inspections  and enhanced containment.   It emphasizes the potentially dangerous and disastrous long-term  consequences for the United States of codifying the President's  announced doctrine of preemption.   The administration's resolution forecloses alternatives to war before  we have even tried to pursue them.  [[Page H98]]    We do not need to rush to war, and we should not rush to war. If what  we are worried about is the defense of the United States and its  people, we do not need this resolution.   If the United States truly faced an imminent attack from anywhere,  the President has all of the authority in the world to ensure our  defense based on the Constitution, the War Powers Act and the United  Nations Charter.   Our own intelligence agencies report that there is currently little  chance of chemical and biological attack from Saddam Hussein on U.S.  forces or territories. But they emphasize that an attack could become  much more likely if Iraq believes that it is about to be attacked. This  is a frightening and dangerous potential consequence that requires  sober thought and careful reflection.   President Bush's doctrine of preemption violates international law,  the United Nations Charter and our own long-term security interests. It  will set a precedent that could come back to haunt us.   Do we want to see our claim to preemption echoed by other countries  maintaining that they perceive similar threats? India or Pakistan?  China or Taiwan? Russia or Georgia?   I would submit that we would have little moral authority to urge  other countries to resist launching preemptive strikes themselves. This  approach threatens to destabilize the Middle East, unleash new forces  of terrorism and instability and completely derail any prospects for  peace in the region.   Unilateralism is not the answer. Iraqi weapons of mass destruction  are a problem to the world community, and we must confront it and we  should do so through the United Nations. Multilateralism and steadfast  commitment to international law should be the guiding principle as we  move into the 21st century.   As I said, the purpose of my amendment is to let the United Nations  do its work. Let us give inspections and other containment mechanisms a  chance to succeed once again. Inspections did make real progress in  eliminating weapons of mass destruction in the 1990s despite Saddam  Hussein's best effort at obstruction and deceit. U.N. inspectors  destroyed large stockpiles of chemical weapons, missiles and weapons of  mass destruction. We can and should renew and expand this process. In  addition to inspections, we should improve border monitoring through an  enhanced containment system to prevent shipments of nuclear materials  or other weapons to Iraq. And we should install surveillance technology  on the border to detect such materials.   As part of enhanced containment, we should work with the countries  bordering Iraq and with regional seaports to ensure that United Nations  Security Council resolutions are enforced, and we should plug holes in  the current arms embargo blanket. We should also work on  nonproliferation efforts globally to secure weapons materials.   All of these are diplomatic options that we can and should undertake  and which can lead to success.   What we are doing today is building the framework for 21st century  international relations. It will either be a framework of unilateralism  and insecurity or multilateral cooperation and security. It is our  choice.   During the Cold War, the words ``first strike'' filled us with fear.  They still should.   I am really appalled that a democracy, our democracy, is  contemplating taking such a fearsome step and really setting such a  terrible international precedent that could be devastating for global  stability and for our own moral authority.   We are contemplating sending our young men and women to war where  they will be doing the killing and the dying. And we, as  representatives of the American people, have no idea where this action  will take us, where it will end and what price we will pay in terms of  lives and resources. This too should cause us to pause. We have  choices, however, and we have an obligation to pursue them, to give  U.N. inspections and enhanced containment a chance to work. What this  resolution does state very clearly and firmly is that the United States  will work to disarm Iraq through United Nations inspections and other  diplomatic tools. It states that we reject the doctrine of preemption,  and it reaffirms our commitment to our own security and national  interests through multilateral diplomacy, not unilateral attack.   I urge you to protect our national interests by giving the United  Nations a chance by supporting this amendment.    Mr. Chair, to the gentleman from New York, I would  like to enter into a colloquy regarding creosote contamination in the  18th Congressional District.   I certainly rise to support enthusiastically H.R. 535. For decades  the residents of the Fifth Ward and surrounding areas, residential  areas in Houston, which is located on the northern side of my district,  have long suspected that creosote was making them sick. They were  exposed to creosote through soil and water contamination through a  railroad yard.   Last April, during a community meeting I hosted for residents on the  topic of creosote contamination, I requested a cancer study from the  Texas Commission on Environmental Quality after person after person  spoke about cancer and their relative dying.   The study found that three adult respiratory-system-related cancers  occurred in that Fifth Ward and surrounding areas, including Kashmere  Gardens. The cancers included, lung and bronchus, esophagus, and  larynx. Toxic substances, such as creosote, should not be in common use  where human activity is present, and it should not take decades for  hazardous environmental concerns expressed by citizens to get  addressed.     I yield to the gentleman from New York for the  purpose of a colloquy.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.    The communities like the Fifth Ward and surrounding  areas in Houston can be invaluable to assisting agencies in identifying  ways to improve on the information provided to the general public--they  live it every day. These are life or death issues--on the means and  methods available to citizens to report environmental concerns and how  these products are used amongst the community for products that are  very needed in the community, and have those concerns adequately  addressed.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman very much, and as I  leave the floor, just want to take note of the contamination in the  State of Texas and this is what we are fighting.   Mr. Chair, as a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland  Security, I rise in strong support of H.R. 535, the PFAS Action Act of  2019, which will regulate in a comprehensive fashion Per- and poly-  fluoroalkyl substances (referred to as PFAS).   I support the legislation because it also protects public health by  containing provisions to clean up contaminated sites.   I have long held concerns regarding environmental justice issues that  impact urban and rural communities who disproportionately face problems  associated with contaminated water, soil, and air pollution.   My work to protect residents of the 18th Congressional District from  harms caused by contaminants over the last year include: creosote  ground water contamination and the opposition of permitting of a cement  manufacturing facility near residential spaces in Fifth Ward Houston  and Acres Homes respectively.   Through a series of major community meetings on environmental hazards  I held last year I can attest that people are literally fighting for  their lives and the lives of their children because of disparate  conditions regarding managing containment and cleanup of an existing  ground water creosote contamination site and the threat of cement dust  contamination of a residential area if a State issued permit be allowed  to stand.   Concerns about the health impact of creosote and other harms to human  health have existed in Acres Homes and 5th Ward Houston for decades.   Because of recent actions on the part of the responsible party for  containing the effects of creosote contamination of ground water, I  called a community meeting including all relevant entities in April of  2019.   As an action item from that meeting I requested, that the Texas  Commission on Environmental Quality arrange a cancer cluster study of  the 5th Ward area of Houston that would be conducted by the Texas  Department of State Health Services (DSHS).   The DSHS analyzed census tracts in Houston to determine the  incidences of cancer.   The analysis examined cancers--specifically those associated with  adults.   The study analyzed a half-dozen types of adults referencing cancers  in the Texas Cancer Registry.   It concluded that ``the numbers of esophagus, lung and bronchus and  larynx cancers were statistically significantly greater than is  expected based on cancer rates in Texas.''   The DSHS's work was incomplete--we do need more data.    This report, however, confirmed the fears of constituents in my  district, as expressed at my April town hall meeting.   According to the report, incidences of cancer outside of normal  probabilities has occurred in 5th Ward Houston.   Specifically, the DSHS analyzed the Texas Cancer Registry available  from 2000 to 2016, as it relates to the affected areas, in which  ``[l]ung, bronchus esophagus, and larynx cancers were statistically  significantly greater than expected.''   The report also found that the types of cancers which were identified  in the study are consistent with those present in arsenic, which  comprises creosote.   Given the findings of the DSHS report, and the impact this has on the  health and wellbeing on my constituents in Kashmere Gardens, I will be  working to address the need to place energy and effort to address  community environmental concerns more effectively.   And there have been critical, tangible health consequences to the  emergence of these cancer clusters for decades that went  uninvestigated.   In my April community meeting and in December during a media event  and tour, I heard stories that were stark in their nature, compelling  and tragic on the incidence of illness and cancer that has plagued  residents of 5th Ward.   Speaker after speaker at these community meetings spoke of the  existence of the cancer, either in themselves or in their relatives.   It was startling.   One participant spoke of having a vegetable garden and concerns about  whether it was safe to eat the food grown.   Another resident spoke of a recent diagnosis of cancer and the number  of neighbors and family members who had contracted cancers over the  years.   The open over 20 feet deep creosote dipping pit that abutted back  yards of residents for decades was real.   The runoff from rain storms tainted with creosote that filled ditches  with oily black and brown smelly residue happened.   The persistent smell of creosote near where they lived was constant.   A few weeks ago, I walked Lavender and Lily streets and engaged with  residents who had thyroid cancer or lung cancer who shared  [[Page H123]]  their stories with me in hopes that something can be done.   I remain concerned about the existence of cancer clusters in  Houston's Fifth Ward.   The safety and well-being of the Kashmere Gardens Community and  surrounding areas are my overriding concern.   My advocacy on this issue and on behalf of those identified in the  city is longstanding and unwavering, and I will not relent until the  community and its citizens have answers about the impact creosote has  in the lives and health of my constituents.   This is why I am in strong support of H.R. 535.   This legislation addresses PFAS chemicals, which are an urgent public  health threat because PFAS are persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic,  and communities across the country are discovering PFAS contamination  in their air, land, and water.   Mr. Chair, PFAS are a class of man-made chemicals defined by the  presence of fluorinated carbon atom, the strongest carbon bond  possible.   Because of this bond, these chemicals are extremely persistent in the  environment and are known to bioaccumulate in humans and wildlife,  which is why they are called ``forever chemicals.''   PFAS have long been linked with adverse health effects including  cancer, immune system effects, infertility, impaired child development,  high cholesterol, and thyroid disease.   Contamination has been found across the country, much of it around  industrial facilities and Department of Defense installations.   According to monitoring by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),  millions of Americans are exposed to unsafe levels of PFAS through  their drinking water.   Mr. Chair, it is urgent that this Congress enact this legislation  because the U.S. Environmental Protection Administration and industry  have failed to address known threats presented by PFAS chemicals.   EPA and industry have known about the risks from PFAS chemicals for  decades but failed to act to prevent the spread of this contamination.   Industry studies showing adverse health effects as early as 1950 have  now been made public.   EPA has recognized the risk of these chemicals since at least 1995,  when the agency amended its polymer exemption to exclude new PFAS  chemicals.   Despite that knowledge, EPA took no action on PFOA and PFOS until  2006, and then relied on a voluntary industry phase out instead of  using the regulatory tools available.   EPA is continuing to allow new PFAS onto the market, some without any  review under ``low volume exemptions'' to the Toxic Substances Control  Act.   Last year, EPA issued a ``PFAS Action Plan'' that did not take needed  action to address cleanup of contaminated sites, set limits on PFAS in  drinking water, or even require reporting of PFAS releases.   In fact, the only commitments made in the action plan were to make  some determinations by the end of 2019--commitments that were not met.   H.R. 535 will provide the protections impacted communities need  quickly and for the long term.   The PFAS Action Act of 2019 would require EPA to use tools under  several environmental statutes to:   1. Stem the flow of PFAS contamination into the environment by  requiring cleanup of sites contaminated with PFOA and PFOS, setting air  emission limits, prohibiting unsafe incineration of PFAS, and limiting  the introduction of new PFAS chemicals into commerce;   2. Identify health risks by requiring comprehensive health testing  for all PFAS, reporting of PFAS releases, and monitoring for PFAS in  drinking water;   3. Limit human exposure to PFAS by requiring a drinking water  standard for PFAS that protects public health, including the health of  vulnerable subpopulations like pregnant women, infants, and children,  and holding polluters accountable.   In addition, H.R. 535 provides grants to impacted water systems,  creates a voluntary label for cookware that is PFAS free, and provides  guidance for first responders to limit their exposures.   Mr. Chair, H.R. 535 addresses a critical threat to the public health  and safety and that is why I support and urge my colleagues to join me.
