 Mr. Speaker, had I been present, I would have voted  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 119.    Mr. Speaker, I would have voted by proxy today for Ms.  Stefanik of New York District 21. Had I been present, she would have  voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 119.    Madam Speaker, there is a crisis at our Nation's southern  border, as you heard when our minority whip   Steve Scalise outlined it  earlier.   Last month, more than 170,000 illegal immigrants were encountered and  rescued by border agents at our southern border, and almost 19,000 of  them were children, the most ever in a single month.   This is a humanitarian catastrophe, as cartels are profiting at  record levels from this egregious human trafficking scheme.   I visited the border, including a child processing center at the El  Paso Sector, and witnessed this firsthand. I left with an even deeper  sense of respect and admiration for the men and women of U.S. Customs  and Border Protection  [[Page H1880]]  agency and those other agencies tasked to assist them.   Chief Gloria Chavez leads her force along the El Paso Sector with  incredible tenacity, courage, compassion, and great energy. The team of  agents under her command are doing an excellent job in a nearly  impossible situation. These terrific people are overwhelmed because of  the dangerous and inhumane policies now coming from Washington. I am  grateful to Chief Chavez and her team for their insights.   Human trafficking is a nonpartisan issue. We must come together to  stop it. We must finish the border wall, improve barrier technology  around the wall, and we must reform this disastrous immigration policy.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding.   I just wanted a moment to take the opportunity to share something  that I launched this week with Representative Garcia from California,  and that is the Election Integrity Caucus.   In that caucus, our mission is to make sure that we have and preserve  integrity in our election process, and that we have people understand  just how important the right to vote is and why it is such a sacred act  and a cornerstone of our constitutional Republic and the democratic  principles that we hold dear.   A lot of people don't realize how important their right to vote is,  and we just want to make sure that people understand that. We don't  want it to be undermined.   We think that the Speaker's signature legislation, H.R. 1, undermines  the integrity of the right to vote. We think every person who has a  legal right to vote should vote in every election, but just once, not  multiple times.   One of the things I wanted to mention because I just have a few  minutes here, is that we would love to have all the Members join the  caucus. Obviously, we would love to have a bipartisan caucus, but I am  reaching out to everyone across the Nation to support our efforts to  try to bring integrity to our election process and to understand how  sacred the right to vote is.   I think it is really great that  Mike Garcia, the Representative from  California, who won by 333 votes, is joining me. I won by 109 votes in  upstate New York in one of the longest election cycles in the Nation  and did not even get sworn in until February 11.   So we just wanted to make sure everyone understands that we want to  expand the number of people that vote. You know, you hear all the time  that the Republicans want to suppress the vote. Nothing could be  further from the truth.   We know so many great Americans through our Nation's history that  have lost life and limb for this sacred right to vote privately, and we  want those people to exercise that right and feel that their vote  actually counts.   I think one thing that my race and Representative Garcia's--also our  colleague, Mariannette Miller-Meeks, who recently was confirmed the  winner again in Iowa's Second District--shows is that every vote does  count. And it should be something that people joyfully do, is to  exercise that right to vote because I think a lot of people don't  realize, we have a self-governing constitutional Republic; it is by and  for the people.   I think one of the enduring themes, one of the reasons I love our  former President Lincoln was that he used to talk about: Can we save  the Republic? Can we be self-governing? And we want to be sure that we  preserve all of that and how great this country is by actually forming  this Election Integrity Caucus to travel around the country and  encourage people to register to vote, and to vote.   And I will add, I just visited the border. And we have a great  community of refugees where my district is up in New York's 22nd  District, and I can't tell you how excited so many of these people are  when they finally get to be citizens, and when they have a chance to  vote, and when they have a chance to vote privately without somebody  looking over their shoulder or knowing how they voted.   We just want to make that act sacred, and we want to make everyone  aware that they have the opportunity to vote, and their vote is secure,  and no one is going to take their vote or dilute their vote. We need to  make sure that we preserve the integrity of our voter rolls.   It is interesting; I come from New York, and people think of New York  as being this liberal bastion, which it is. But Article II of New  York's Constitution talks about the right of suffrage.   In my own district, the first women to vote in New York State voted  in Lisle, New York, in my district of New York. So we know how sacred  that right is for women to have the right to vote. Susan B. Anthony and  Elizabeth Cady Stanton all hailed from New York State, so we have a  great tradition of voting, and we want to lead the way toward that.   I know that we would love to have the gentleman join if he is  interested in joining our caucus.    And we have many safeguards in place to reserve that  right to vote, but also to encourage people to go out and realize that  their vote does count. And wouldn't it be great if every legal citizen  voted in every election? That would be a true self-governing Republic  that we all aspire to maintain and preserve.   Once again, I cannot emphasize enough, we urge everyone to join the  caucus, including our Democratic friends. I think they would like what  we are going to be standing for. We are going to be preserving and  protecting the votes in all districts across the entire Nation, and I  think it is going to be an exciting initiative.   I thank the gentleman for being willing to join. I know my time is  limited today, but I wanted to take advantage of this. And I want to  also thank the gentleman for taking this opportunity to be in this  amazing place.                                time  1330    It is an honor to be elected to this great body, with so many good  Members on both sides of the aisle, and to be able to do the business  here for the people of our country in such a tough time, in so many  ways, as we are emerging, hopefully, from the pandemic.   I am grateful that you take this time and talk about the news and  events of the day that may sometimes get missed in the mainstream  media. I am grateful to you, and I want to wish you the best and  everyone a great weekend.   Let's talk about election integrity.
