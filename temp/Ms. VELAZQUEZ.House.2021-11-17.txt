 Madam Speaker, on Wednesday, November 17, I regret not  being present for one vote session due to a committee briefing. Had I  been present, I would  [[Page H6336]]  have voted ``aye'' on the motion on ordering the previous question on  the Rule H. Res. 795, roll No. 377.

We all walk the same hallways and took the same oath of office. We  are here to serve our districts and the American people. The graphic  video that Rep. Gosar posted violates every sense of mutual respect  that we should have for one another. Not only that, but it also  dangerously promotes violence towards a sitting member of Congress who  is a powerful Latina. It's exactly the type of misogynistic and racist  recklessness that the previous President deployed, and social media  companies eventually stripped him of his accounts.   Rep. Gosar needs to be held accountable for this and that's what we  are doing today. We need to deliver a message that in the people's  house, this dangerous behavior will not be tolerated.
