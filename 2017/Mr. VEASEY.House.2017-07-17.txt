 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, it is great to be here with you this evening  and to talk about a very important topic.   Before I get into the topic of this hour, it is with great honor that  I rise today to coanchor this CBC Special Order hour with my dear  friend, Delegate Stacey Plaskett from the Virgin Islands, and also  acknowledge our CBC chair, the Honorable Cedric Richmond from the great  State of Louisiana.   For the next 60 minutes, we have a chance to speak directly to the  American people on issues of grea importance to the Congressional Black  Caucus, the Congress, the constituents that we represent, and all  Americans on this very important issue of voter suppression.    Before I go into my remarks, Mr. Speaker, we do have some colleagues  here that would like to also speak about this very timely and important  topic.   There have been many developments that have occurred over the last  week dealing with commissions that are being formed out of the White  House to help aid in voter suppression and other things that have been  very troubling.   So I am going to ask for the first speaker to rise, and that would be  my colleague, also from the great State of Texas, from Harris County  and the city of Houston, the Honorable Sheila Jackson Lee, who has been  very thoughtful and been a great voice on expanding the rights to vote  of all Americans. I thank Representative Jackson Lee for taking the  time during this hour to come out and talk about this very important  topic.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my fellow Texan and colleague for  her timely remarks. I think the American public really would be  interested in what she talked about with the criminal background  history that this Commission wants.   I know that there are a lot of people--both Democrats and  Republicans, quite frankly, people of all political stripes--that made  mistakes when they were younger and now maybe they go and vote. They  are good Americans. They assimilate themselves into society. They have  learned from their mistakes, and they would be very disturbed to know  that this sort of information about something that they did when they  were 21 years old and now they are 40-something years old, they would  be very disturbed to know that this type of information was being  collected. I thank her for raising that issue.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne), my  friend, to also speak on this issue. I thank him for taking the time to  come out here today and share some of the concerns that he has.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey,  particularly for pointing out about the  [[Page H5908]]  hands that built this building. That is something that is not widely  known, that the hands that built this building were not hands of free  men but hands of slaves that built this building that we stand under  today, that people come and admire from all around the world, and we  admire this building as a symbol of freedom. But the hands that built  it were not free hands.   And of course what followed emancipation in this country--Jim Crow,  voter suppression, and all of those things--once we finally got past  the late sixties and seventies, to see some of that coming back again  is very, very disturbing, and I want to thank him for his timely  comments on that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty). I  thank her spending so much time here on the House floor working the  Special Order hour, and particularly when it comes to the thing that we  are so worried about right now, which is the voter suppression  commission.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Beatty. I really  appreciate her participating again and her comments, and we are going  to take her call and continue to push on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to invite my friend and colleague up from  the great State of Pennsylvania, Representative Dwight Evans, to also  speak about this subject. Of course, throughout the history of African  Americans, Philadelphia and Pennsylvania have played a very critical  role. I am glad that my colleague from Pennsylvania is stepping up and  speaking about this very timely issue of voter suppression in the wake  of Shelby County.   I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments and  appreciate him taking time out to talk about this very critical  announcement.   As soon as everyone in the Black community, Black communities around  the country, and elected officials around the country who are concerned  about voter suppression and other tools and tactics that have been used  to suppress the African-American vote, we went to action, and I  appreciate that the gentleman was one of the first people to step up  and appreciate his participation tonight.   Mr. Speaker, my colleague, Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson, who  was not able to make it here this evening, will be including a  statement in the Record. She represents the 30th Congressional District  of Texas and is my next-door neighbor. She represents Dallas and the  southern suburbs of Dallas. I appreciate her weighing in on this topic  as well.   Mr. Speaker, the foundation of American democracy is that, no matter  who you are, we are all equal once we step into that voting booth. And  the courage that has been displayed by brave foot soldiers who risked  and, in some cases, gave their lives to guarantee that constitutional  promise was fulfilled must never be forgotten, and this is really  important to point out.   I mean, we have Representative John Lewis, who is a hero of the civil  rights movement. But I always encourage people to watch the  documentary, ``Eyes on the Prize'' so they can see how people were  treated, how people were treated by law enforcement, how people were  treated by people who were in positions of power, people who were  active in the community, people who belonged to the Lions Club,  belonged to the Elks Club, the way they treated people who were simply  trying to register to vote.   There is one scene that I will never forget; it was about a woman who  was trying to go and vote, and she was being kicked and shoved and hit  and knocked to the ground by law enforcement in Alabama for simply  trying to exercise her right to vote that was given to her in the early  1900s when women in this country were finally given the right of  suffrage.   It is really in their memory that Congress originally passed the  landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965. And for years, both Republicans and  Democrats reauthorized the Voting Rights Act, agreeing that equal  access to the polls must be preserved for generations to come.   But sadly, Mr. Speaker, in 2013, that tradition dramatically changed.  The Supreme Court ruling in Shelby County v. Holder struck down section  4 of the Voting Rights Act and made Congress responsible for updating  the VRA. The Court has left it to Congress to create a new formula for  determining which States and other jurisdictions should be discovered  under section 5 of the Voting Rights Act to ensure protection against  discrimination.   But 4 years later, we can confidently say that the Supreme Court  ruling set into motion what most of us feared--that minorities and low- income Americans would have to face unfair and punitive barriers from  exercising their most basic right as American citizens, and that is the  right to vote.                                time  2000    In the years since the Shelby County decision, Republican  legislatures nationwide have been in power to unleash an avalanche of  purposely restrictive laws that have been aimed to keep, again, mostly  Black and Latino voters away from the poll. Even when you do discovery  and when you look into why these laws were passed by State  legislatures, it is clear what the intent was.   It is a tactic that the Republican Party has indirectly endorsed,  since they believe that trying to earn the vote of the growing minority  population, that they would rather keep them away from the polls  altogether.   Prior to Shelby, States with a history of voter suppression and  discriminatory practices were required to preclear any changes in their  election laws with the Department of Justice prior to enactment. But  now, in the absence of an updated VRA, States no longer require the  DOJ's approval.   I want to talk about my own State, the State of Texas, which has  really served as an incubator for the suppressive tactics that  Republicans nationwide have been eager to enact for years. I saw this  up close and personal in the 8 years that I spent in the Texas  Legislature, where I saw Texas Republicans enact SB 14, which severely  restricted the types of IDs that voters could bring to the polls in  order to cast the ballot. Texas Republicans claimed that limiting  acceptable IDs would prevent widespread in-person voter fraud. As vice  chair of the Voter Identification and Voter Fraud Select Committee in  the Texas state house, I witnessed how Texas Republicans failed to  produce any piece of evidence to prove that massive voter impersonation  was occurring statewide.   Hearing after hearing--you can go back and look at the record, going  back to 2005--I and my other colleagues who served on the committee and  who were concerned about some of the voter suppression tactics asked  the question: Show us evidence that voter suppression is taking place.  We have time here during this legislative session.   That was what we would ask over and over again, and not one person  could bring any evidence that this had happened.   Their flawed argument justified limiting voter IDs and instead  favored an approach that would exclude student IDs but actually say  that it was okay to use a concealed handgun license as a form of ID.   What is interesting about that is that these student IDs, campus law  enforcement, which, in the State of Texas, where I am from, again, if a  kid has alcohol or if someone is roaming around campus and the police  need to be able to verify who they are and identify them, that student  ID that is issued by a State university in the State of Texas serves as  ID for law enforcement personnel on those campuses to be able to verify  whether that student is, in fact, who they are and belongs on that  campus. That same ID, again, that is issued by the State of Texas could  not be used to go and vote. It just doesn't make any sense.   When the law was enacted, of course, the DOJ blocked the measure.  However, hours after the Shelby decision, Governor Perry enacted Texas'  restrictive voter ID law. I became a named plaintiff in the case  because I knew that, despite Republicans' claims that the law would  disproportionately disenfranchise Latino and African-American voters-- the State's own estimates showed that it would potentially  disenfranchise over 600,000 Texans who are registered but do not have  one of the required forms of ID. And there are lots of different  reasons why people may or may not have an ID.   If they were born in a foreign country and they are now American  citizens, they may have a hard time getting access to some of those  documents. They may not have the money  [[Page H5910]]  or the transportation to go to the county that they were born in to be  able to get the documents that they need in order to get one of these  IDs. Again, there are costs and there are transportation and geographic  barriers that may take place.   You may have people who were born in the country by midwives, and  they are particularly African-American baby boomers and older that  migrated from places like Longview, Texas; Marshall, Texas; Tyler,  Texas, and they weren't really even raised in those cities. They were  raised in smaller towns outside of those cities and they may not have  those proper forms of ID.   Remember, segregation was very rampant back then in Texas, and many  people were born by midwives, were born in their houses and what have  you. There are variations of spellings of last names. I have that in my  own family. There are just so many other examples of that.   I am proud to report that two Federal courts, including the Fifth  Circuit Court of Appeals, which is easily considered by most to be the  most conservative appeals court in the country, have found the law to  be discriminatory in its intent and its effect. Despite this victory,  we knew that Texas was only the beginning. We have heard about so many  other laws around the country that exclude people from being able to  register to vote unless they have a passport, or unless they have their  birth certificate, which makes it almost impossible for nonprofits to  set up a table at a busy grocery store, for instance, on a Saturday and  do any sort of voter registration. There are just all sorts of issues  out there. There are organizations like King Street Patriots, for  instance, that pride themselves on their ability to try to suppress the  minority vote. Again, Texas was only the beginning. And, sadly, Mr.  Speaker, unless we can find a new way to come together to do what is  right when it comes to suffrage in this country, it seems like this is  going to be something that we have to fight for a long time.   Now, sadly, I am ashamed to say that our President has also taken a  page out of the Republican playbook and has begun to perpetuate the  same myths about widespread voter fraud that, sadly, we have been  fighting since the Reconstruction era, Mr. Speaker. Very, very, very  sad.   Nearly 3 months after winning the Presidency, President Trump could  not handle the fact that, despite winning the Presidency, he lost the  popular vote. An unsatisfied with the results, President Trump does  what he does best: he went to Twitter to blame his unpopularity on  widespread voter fraud.    And, worse, now he has created this Presidential commission on  election integrity. It is a sham commission that will, no doubt, work  to justify claims that elections are being compromised by our own  citizens and serve as a catalyst to continue the wave of voter  suppression and intimidation that we have witnessed across this  country.   I am proud that the Congressional Black Caucus, the Congressional  Hispanic Caucus, and the Asian Pacific American Caucus have all gotten  together to introduce legislation to ensure that not a single dollar  from the taxpayers is spent towards this phony commission.   Again, I think that everybody should be concerned about this  commission. Any commission that wants to gather private information on  citizens, put it in a database, information that--quite frankly,  mistakes that people made back when they were in college. There are a  lot of people out there that I know, that I went to high school and  college with, people that I have known around the Fort Worth and Dallas  community for a long time, all around the State of Texas, they made  mistakes when they were younger. Maybe it was a DWI. Maybe it was some  other sort of issue, but they have assimilated themselves back into  society. They are working. They are paying taxes. And the fact that  this database would want to take the mistakes that they made in their  youth and put them in this database and to look at whether or not they  are committing some sort of fraud is just something that--again,  doesn't matter if you are Democrat or Republican, there are a lot of  people out there who made mistakes when they were younger. It is just  awful that this could come back to haunt them.   The fact is that the voter fraud myth has been debunked by various  reputable research organizations, including the ACLU, the Brennan  Center for Justice, the Campaign Legal Center, and the Pew Research  Center, to name a few. But that has not changed the fact that  Republicans and now our President want to turn back the clock on voting  rights. It is really sad, Mr. Speaker.   The commission recently requested sensitive voter information as part  of their fake investigation, and we are already seeing the effects. Out  of fear of having their Social Security, voting history, party  affiliation, again, their criminal background history that I talked  about in a concentrated voter base, news sources have already reported  voters deregistering to vote. That is sad because that is exactly the  type of voter intimidation that Republicans want to nationalize.   House Republicans have purposely dragged their feet on updating the  VRA and ignored their duty to uphold the Constitution and ensure the  sacred right of all Americans to be able to cast their vote.   Even as these courts begin to rule against the purposely prejudiced  tactics of these GOP State legislatures, it is up to us to bring our  voices together and lift the veil on their true intentions. It is our  duty now to stand up against these discriminatory practices that are  being implemented nationwide, because the President's sham commission  will have its first meeting this Wednesday, and we have to send one  message loud and clear: We will not allow voter suppression to become  normal. We have to make that clear.   I thank my colleagues for working alongside me in this fight, because  every member of the Congressional Black Caucus is talking about this in  their district when they are going back, townhalls, various other  events that are out and about in their respective areas that they  represent around our country to let them know what is in store.   I have got to tell you, Mr. Speaker, I am confident that we will once  again be able to ensure that the sacred right to vote is not denied to  a single American. It has been overcome a lot. We are going to continue  to overcome this, just like we have after the Reconstruction era, like  we did in the 1960s, and we are going to fight this all the way until  we get the fairness that we want.   I want to remind everybody that there is going to be a voter  suppression forum tomorrow that members of the Congressional Black  Caucus, along with the House Judiciary Democrats, will host on this  very topic, voter suppression in the wake of Shelby County, which is  the name of the Special Order that we are working on right now. And  Members will hear from Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan  Grimes and others about the President's voter fraud commission and the  bipartisan backlash that it is facing. The forum will be live-streamed  on the House Judiciary Democrats' Facebook page. I invite all Americans  to join in this very important and crucial conversation that is going  to be taking place on Wednesday.   I thank everybody again that came out to participate for this Special  Order hour on voter suppression in the wake of what happened in Shelby  County.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time
