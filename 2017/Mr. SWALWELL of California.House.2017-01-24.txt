 Madam Speaker, I stand with women and men  across our country in opposition to H.R. 7, the latest effort from  Republican leaders to take the opportunity for women to make choices  about their own healthcare decisions.   This weekend, my colleagues and I marched arm in arm with our  constituents in women's marches across the country. I heard these  Americans, and if you were listening, you would have heard them say,  ``my body, my choice''; ``her body, her choice.'' This bill ignores the  voices of women and male feminists in the United States.   Particularly disturbing, H.R. 7 prevents small businesses that use  ACA tax credits from using them to pay for comprehensive health  coverage for their employees that includes abortion services. Passage  of this bill means the government, whom my colleagues claim is too big,  will dramatically expand its role in a woman's healthcare decision.   As we have seen time and time again, restrictions like these  disproportionately affect low-income women, younger women, and women of  color. All women deserve the ability to make their own healthcare  decisions without government interference. It is her body. It is her  choice.   I urge my colleagues to recognize the intrusive, unfair, and unequal  consequences of H.R. 7.
