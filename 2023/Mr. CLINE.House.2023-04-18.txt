 Mr. Speaker, last fall the American people voted for a  Republican-led House majority to reverse course from the failures of  the Pelosi-led House of the 117th Congress.   In just the first 100 days, House Republicans have kept our promises  by passing the Parents Bill of Rights and the REIN IN Inflation Act,  repealing funding for Biden's IRS army, and unleashing American energy  with H.R. 1, while preserving our SPR and protecting it from China.   We have also restored the people's House back to its rightful owners  and ensured our colleagues show up for work by ending proxy voting,  held the government accountable, defended life, and forced the  President to end the COVID National Emergency once and for all.   As a catalyst for these results and continued victories, we have  secured the most transparent, open, and Member-driven rules package in  the House's history.   Change has come to the people's House, and it is here to stay.                            ____________________
