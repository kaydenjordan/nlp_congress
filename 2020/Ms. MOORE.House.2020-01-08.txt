 Mr. Speaker, today marks a sobering anniversary. Three  years ago today, Scarlett Lillian Pauley, a magnetic, vibrant, 16- month-  [[Page H16]]  old died suddenly and unexpectedly. She was born at 11:25 a.m. on  August 31, 2015, a happy and healthy 6-pound, 4-ounce, 20-inch-long  baby.   This vibrant little girl loved her mama and her dada and her pets.  Scarlett loved books. She could read for hours. Her favorite book was  ``Barnyard Dance!'' by Sandra Boynton. She loved and she was loved.   Unfortunately, this is not an isolated story. Each year, hundreds of  children die unexpectedly and their deaths go unexplained, even after  an investigation. Each year, nearly 3,500 children up to age 1 die  suddenly. Among infants, my colleagues may have heard of the leading  cause being SIDS, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.   These devastated families want answers which, unfortunately, don't  come. One reason is that States and municipalities all over the country  collect inconsistent and often incomplete data on these unexplained  sudden deaths; and, even with these efforts, they are irreconcilable.   If we can't even collect good and consistent data, how can we expect  to reverse this trend or even prevent it?   Mr. Speaker, we can and we must do more to save the lives of our most  vulnerable, which is why I introduced the Scarlett's Sunshine on Sudden  Unexpected Death Act, H.R. 2271, named in honor of little Scarlett.  This bill would authorize efforts to improve the investigation of these  deaths nationwide to help find answers that can guide prevention  efforts.   It would also support better data initiatives of safe sleep education  and other efforts to prevent such deaths and support for grieving  families, among other provisions.   Mr. Speaker, I was so inspired to do this because I have, in fact,  been to the homes of grieving parents who have lost their child to  sudden infant death.   I am so grateful that this is bipartisan legislation. There are 62  bipartisan sponsors, and I just want to name a few of them on the other  side.     Tom Cole is the cosponsor on the Republican side, along with Jaime  Herrera Beutler, who has given birth to three children since she has  become a Member of this body, and Cathy McMorris Rodgers, who is on the  Energy and Commerce Committee.   This bipartisan legislation has also been endorsed by the American  Academy of Pediatrics, the March of Dimes, Children's Hospital  Association, Cribs for Kids, First Candle, SUDC Foundation, KID:  Fighting for Product Safety, Aaron Matthew SIDS Research Guild of  Seattle Children's Hospital, the Mackenzie Blair Foundation of New  Jersey, Jaxin's Cause in Ohio, the Scarlett Lillian Pauley Foundation,  Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, and Safe Kids Worldwide.   Today, the Health Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce  Committee will hold hearings on this legislation, bringing it one step  closer to law. One of the witnesses will be Scarlett's mom, someone who  took her grief and turned it into activism, and I believe she is going  to speak eloquently of the challenges that families across our country  who experience such a tragedy face.   Though Scarlett is gone, she is not forgotten. Passing this  bipartisan bill is one way we can honor her and save lives. If this  bill helps save one life--and I am confident that it will do more than  that--it is worth it.   I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation.                            ____________________
