 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an act, co- sponsored  [[Page S191]]  by Senator Hagerty, that addresses the importance of foreign affairs  training to national security and, more specifically, intends to  improve training and professional development of the Foreign Service  officers and civil service staff at the U.S. State Department.   This act calls for the State Department to move beyond its  traditional approach towards a more robust professional training  program, incorporating innovative education and training courses,  methods, and opportunities. Employees of the State Department have a  long, honorable tradition of providing excellence in diplomacy, but it  is time to modernize the training and professional development they  receive, enabling them to more effectively promote our national  security interests abroad and ensuring the retention of our best and  brightest employees.   The legislation will accomplish the following: provide a more  effective and updated training program for employees of the State  Department, to include increased virtual instruction that is  interactive and more accessible to personnel deployed around the world,  as well as increased training provided by partner organizations such as  universities, industry entities, and nongovernmental organization,  NGOs: establish a Chief Learning Officer position to serve as the  principal adviser to the Secretary of State and strategist for State  Department training and development; and establish a nonpartisan Board  of Visitors to provide independent advice and recommendations regarding  training at the Foreign Service Institute.   Other key elements of the legislation include establishment of a  clear link between required employee training and promotional  opportunities and assignments at the State Department; a ``training  float'' strategy that will allow 10 to 15 percent of Foreign Service  and civil service officers and staff to participate in training at any  given time; a call for the State Department to establish new fellowship  programs for Foreign Service and civil service officers and staff in  addition to the current Pearson and Brookings Fellowship Programs,  allowing them to participate in short- and long-term opportunities at  think tanks, nongovernmental organizations, the Department of Defense,  industry entities, and relevant university programs; and establishment  of a Center for Innovation in Training and a Provost position at the  Foreign Service Institute, to evaluate all courses and curriculum  offered by FSI and identify necessary updates to meet the frequent  changes required by officers due to changing global dynamics.   The Department of State is a crucial national security agency, whose  employees, both Foreign Service and civil service, require the best  possible training at every stage of their careers to prepare them to  promote and defend U.S. national interests and the health and safety of  U.S. citizens abroad.   As chair of the Subcommittee on U.S. State Department and USAID  Management, International Operations, and Bilateral International  Development, along with Ranking Member Senator Hagerty, I have presided  over the first two in a planned series of subcommittee hearings on  modernization of the State Department. The most recent hearing, held in  November of last year, made clear that the numerous studies issued  about the State Department's need to change its culture, starting with  an innovative training and professional development program, were on  the mark.   During the hearing, we heard that ``everything is fine'' at State in  terms of training, while the Department's retention rate indicates the  loss of experienced Foreign Service officers and civil servants.  External witnesses Ambassador David Miller, president of the Diplomatic  Studies Foundation, and Joshua Marcuse, who formerly served as the  Executive Director of the Defense Innovation Board, painted a very  different picture, calling for an overarching effort to change the  culture of the State Department--which as one of the oldest Federal  Departments is steeped in tradition and protocol--to transform it once  again into the lead Agency executing American foreign policy overseas.   The level of challenges the State Department faces now around the  world are almost unprecedented, with the return of great power  competition, the rise of authoritarianism, the collapse of Afghanistan,  climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic, and--not least--assisting  American citizens around the world. Professional education and training  must be top priorities at the State Department, and we must strengthen  the professionalization of our diplomats through a career-long program  that focuses on mastery of substantive foreign policy issues,  diplomatic expertise, superb customer service for American citizens  abroad, and leadership.   Secretary of State Antony Blinken gave a speech last fall on  ``Modernizing American Diplomacy,'' and one of the five pillars he  described is that of building and retaining a diverse, dynamic, and  entrepreneurial workforce, and empowering and equipping State  Department employees to succeed. This bill will kick-start the  rebuilding effort Mr. Blinken spoke about, putting the emphasis on  training and professional development of the Department's greatest  asset: its people.   I remain committed to continuing to work with the Biden  administration and my colleagues in Congress to provide every  opportunity for State Department employees to receive the best possible  training at every stage of their careers, to prepare them to promote  and defend U.S. national interests and the health and safety of U.S.  citizens abroad.                                  ______                                         By Mr. CARDIN (for himself and Ms. Collins):   S. 3493. A bill to require guidance on extending expiration dates for  certain drugs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions.    Mr. President, I rise today to highlight legislation I am  introducing with the senior Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, to address  prescription drug shortages. We rely on prescription drugs to battle  infectious diseases like SARS-CoV-2, for the treatment of cancer and  hormonal disorders and in countless other facets of modern medicine.  When drug shortages, which are unforeseen supply disruptions, occur,  healthcare teams must scramble to develop new plans of care because the  optimal treatment is no longer available. The Drug Shortages Shelf Life  Extension Act will help tackle drug shortages by enabling the Food and  Drug Administration, FDA, to extend the shelf of certain drugs at risk  of shortage in a safe fashion.   Prescription drug shortages are a persistent problem, leading to  diminished access to vital medications and potentially catastrophic  outcomes for patients. FDA wrote in its 2019 Drug Shortages Task Force  Report that discarding drugs if they exceed an unnecessarily short  expiration date can exacerbate drug shortages. Essentially, the shelf  life for certain drugs can be safely extended, and I support empowering  authorities to do so to prevent drug shortages.   Last year, I introduced the Drug Shortages Prevention & Quality  Improvement Act. The legislation would address some of the main causes  of drug shortages and provide solutions to mitigate their effects. The  legislation would give the FDA additional tools to mitigate drug  shortages, such as extending shelf lives for certain essential drugs.  This legislation also seeks to address prescription drug shortages by  creating incentives for manufacturers to upgrade their facilities to  prevent shortages. Some of the facilities FDA has tied to drug  shortages have been operating continually since the 1960s with minimal  upgrades to manufacturing lines and facilities. The FDA Drug Shortages  Task Force report found that quality concerns caused 62 percent of drug  shortages from 2013 to 2017.   Last April, Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, HELP,  Committee Chair Murray and Ranking Member Burr announced plans to  develop a bipartisan initiative to prepare the Nation for future public  health emergencies in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. I applaud this  effort to modernize our national response efforts for the current  pandemic and future pandemics and look forward to consideration of this  legislation on the floor of the Senate. I was particularly pleased to  see language included in the HELP Committee's discussion draft for this  preparedness initiative from the Drug Shortages Shelf Life Extension  Act. Extending shelf lives of certain  [[Page S192]]  drugs is not only critical to prevent drug shortages but also to enable  our prescription drug supply chain to be more responsive and better  prepared to respond to public health emergencies.   Domestically, we continue to battle the COVID-19 pandemic. We are  nearing record-high hospitalizations due to COVID-19, including record- high levels for children. In my State of Maryland, we have encountered  a new record-high hospitalization level every day since December 29.  For many patients, the severity and mortality rates are lower due to  higher vaccination levels and better treatments gleaned from our  experience in battling COVID-19 so far, but these high hospitalization  rates are straining an already overburdened system.   As we continue fighting the pandemic, in addition to other diseases  and illnesses, timely access to medications is essential for our  healthcare providers and their patients. The Drug Shortages Shelf Life  Extension Act would require FDA to update guidance tied to manufacturer  testing of the shelf life of prescription drug and to report to  Congress on actions taken to update the shelf life dates of relevant  drugs. Shelf life expiration dates are established through regulations  governing prescription drug stability testing, which need to be  reexamined since they have not been amended since 1981. I look forward  to working with the Biden administration as it implements this  essential legislation and related regulations.   I urge my colleagues to join Senator Collins and me in support of the  Drug Shortages Shelf Life Extension Act to improve access to essential  prescription drugs and to prevent or mitigate future drug shortages. No  one should have to go without essential prescriptions drugs when usable  supplies are available but have potentially inaccurate use-by dates  stamped on their box or bottle.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an act, co- sponsored  [[Page S191]]  by Senator Hagerty, that addresses the importance of foreign affairs  training to national security and, more specifically, intends to  improve training and professional development of the Foreign Service  officers and civil service staff at the U.S. State Department.
