 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the Liberian  community and to bring attention to an issue that Liberian refugees are  experiencing in my district and across the country.   In December 2019, as part of the NDAA, we passed the Liberian Refugee  Immigration Fairness Act, which would provide a pathway to citizenship  to 10,000 Liberians who have resided in this country legally for years,  with a 1-year window to accomplish this.   However, between administrative delays in publishing the rules to  obtain this relief, and pandemic closures, 8 months have passed without  a single application being processed.   The House Judiciary Committee held a hearing with USCIS this week to  find out why, and we did not receive answers. We are a nation of  immigrants, immigrants who enrich our communities and represent exactly  what makes our country great.   I am proud to represent one of the largest Liberian-American  communities in our country and just this weekend was honored to  celebrate Liberian Independence Day with them.                            ____________________
