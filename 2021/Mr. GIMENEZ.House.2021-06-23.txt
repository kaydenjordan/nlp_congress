 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, during our time tonight, my colleagues and  I will address the major crises happening here at home and happening  abroad. Our message tonight will all have a consistent theme: House  Republicans are leading the fight, whether it is protecting the Hyde  amendment, taking action to fix President Biden's economic crisis, or  holding China accountable for the COVID-19 coverup once and for all.   On the last point, the time has come for Congress to take seriously  its job to hold China accountable for their role in the proliferation  of the COVID-19 pandemic. This pandemic has killed over 600,000  Americans, ruined the American economy, forced into closure many  people's livelihoods, and destabilized our way of life.   Just as we did in the aftermath of 9/11 and in response to the Great  Recession, Speaker Pelosi and her colleagues on her side of the aisle  cannot abdicate Congress' constitutional responsibility to investigate  the origins of COVID-19 and the roles both the Chinese Communist Party  and the World Health Organization played in preventing an expeditious  global response.   A March 2020 report by the University of Southampton found that if  interventions in China could have been conducted 1, 2, or 3 weeks  earlier, then cases could have been reduced by 66 percent, 86 percent,  and 95 percent, respectively. That is inexcusable.   Luckily for the American people, Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy and  House Republicans have a plan to hold China accountable and ensure an  atrocity such as the CCP virus never happens again.   The American people deserve transparency. That is why Congress must  declassify information related to the origins of COVID-19. Yes, that  includes any report that comes from President Biden's recent requests.   For far too long, the government has allowed individuals with known  ties to the CCP or Chinese state-owned enterprises to benefit from  American research and innovation. That is why we must continue to  pursue policies that curb any gains made by the Chinese Communist  Party.   It is also time for Congress to prohibit the National Institutes of  Health or any entity that receives grants and funding from NIH from  conducting research or spending resources on research with malicious  foreign actors. This includes China. Our taxpayer dollars should not be  going into arming our adversaries.   Foreign policy is a crucial element in holding China accountable.  Congress must compel the administration to flex its foreign policy  posture and reform the World Health Organization. As more information  comes forward, it is evident that the WHO was complicit in China's  coverup of the exploding pandemic. Their negligence is directly  responsible for the loss of millions of lives. We need trusted actors  such as Taiwan to form part of the organization.   In keeping in line with a tough foreign policy stance, Congress must  implement a new round of tough and deliberate sanctions on anyone-- whether they are Chinese nationals with ties to the CPP or high-level  executives at the World Health Organization--who willfully participated  in the coverup of the COVID-19 pandemic and helped prevent a robust  global response. Millions of lives are on their hands.   Another tool at our disposal is for Congress to pass the resolution  introduced by my Florida colleague, Congressman   Michael Waltz, and  Senator Rick Scott to prevent Beijing from hosting the Winter Olympics.   Finally, we need to allow them to sue the Chinese Communist Party and  any CCP official who participated in the coverup that killed over half  a million Americans. They deserve no sovereign immunity.   Mr. Speaker, it is time for us to do our jobs and join Leader  McCarthy and the House Republicans in holding China accountable,  holding our adversaries accountable, and ensuring an atrocity such as  this never happens again.   Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to introduce the Congressman from Texas,  Congressman Van Taylor. Congressman Van Taylor is a decorated Iraq  [[Page H3072]]  War veteran and an important member of the Financial Services  Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Taylor).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my esteemed colleague from Texas  for his great words.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the 22nd District of Texas  (Mr. Nehls), who is a veteran law enforcement officer.    Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to introduce the Congressman  from California,  Mike Garcia. Congressman Garcia flew over 30 combat  missions during Operation Iraqi Freedom as a naval aviator. We thank  him for his service.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Garcia).    Mr. Speaker, Glenn Grothman from Wisconsin is an  experienced legislator in Wisconsin and a United States Congressman.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Mr. Speaker, I couldn't agree more with the gentleman  about the Hyde amendment. I think the majority of Americans couldn't  agree with the gentleman more about the Hyde amendment. We need to  maintain that the majority of Americans do not want to fund taxpayer- funded abortions.   Mr. Speaker, Congressman   John Rose from Tennessee is an eighth- generation farmer and a key member of the Financial Services Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Rose).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.   Congressman Glenn Thompson from Pennsylvania is the ranking member of  the Agriculture Committee. Mr. Thompson and I share a common experience  as former firefighters.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Thompson), a Congressman and a former firefighter.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Thompson for his comments.   Mr. Speaker, Congressman Scott Perry from Pennsylvania retired as a  brigadier general in the Army and now represents the people of  Pennsylvania's 10th District. I thank the gentleman for his service.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the Congressman for his comments. I  couldn't agree with him more. My opening statements were about China  and their complicity, and we do need to investigate China and the World  Health Organization and find out what did they know and when did they  know it. Again, as I said, if we had known about this 1, 2, or 3 weeks  earlier, we could have saved an incredible number of lives.   Mr. Speaker, Congressman   Michael Cloud represents the 13th District  of Texas and is the only Texas Republican on the Agriculture Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cloud).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Cloud for his comments.   Mr. Speaker, Congressman   John Joyce of Pennsylvania is part of the  Doctors Caucus and has worked with the U.S. Navy at Naval Hospital  Portsmouth in Virginia during Operations Desert Shield and Desert  Storm. I thank the gentleman for his service.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce).    Mr. Speaker, who would know better about protecting life  and saving life than the good doctor from Pennsylvania and my  colleague, Congressman   John Joyce.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), who  has led a distinguished career in business and public service and  serves as a member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Meuser), who comes from a family dedicated to public service. He  serves as a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee and the Education  and Labor Committee.  [[Page H3075]]         Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from  Pennsylvania's 13th District for those strong words and strong ideas on  why we need to hold the people accountable who unleashed this horrific  virus on the United States and the world at large.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Miller),  who is a farmer, a business manager, and a member of the Agriculture  Committee and Education and Labor Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I couldn't agree with the Congresswoman  more. As a father and a grandfather, it is atrocious, the debt that we  are going to be leaving our children and our grandchildren. We are  stealing their future. They will not have the money that they need to  provide for their programs and their infrastructure that they are going  to need to fund in the future. That is one of the reasons why I  wholeheartedly agree with her.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Mann), who is  a fifth generation Kansan and proudly serves on the Agriculture  Committee and Veterans' Affairs Committee. He represents Kansas' First  District.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr.  Carl), who is a successful small business owner and a valued member of  the Armed Services Committee and Natural Resources Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Babin), who represents Texas' 36th District. He is a lifelong  resident of east Texas and my colleague on the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee and the Science, Space, and Technology  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Franklin), my friend and colleague. He has served as a naval aviator in  the U.S. Navy for 26 years. I thank him for his service.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Tennessee  (Mrs. Harshbarger). She has been a successful pharmacist and business  owner for over three decades.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Wittman). He is an experienced government official. We share a common  background in local government, having both served as mayors.    Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from  California (Mr. LaMalfa). He represents California's First District. He  serves on the Agriculture Committee and the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
