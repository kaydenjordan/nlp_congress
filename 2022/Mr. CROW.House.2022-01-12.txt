 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the members of South  Metro Fire Rescue for their bravery and professionalism in combating  the devastating Marshall fire that swept across Boulder County.   As we prepared to ring in the new year, Colorado experienced the most  destructive wildfire in its history. Faced with hurricane-level winds  that fueled rapid spread, our very own South Metro firefighters jumped  into action. They sacrificed time with family during the holidays and  put their lives on the line to protect thousands of homes, save  countless lives, and make our community proud.   Rising temperatures and prolonged drought have made wildfires a part  of everyday life in Colorado. As Coloradans inevitably face similar  challenges in the coming years, I am grateful to have the heroes at  South Metro representing and protecting our community.   I am honored to recognize the members of South Metro Fire Rescue for  their service to our community and thank them for inspiring a hope in  our future, a hope that together we can face the challenges of this new  future head-on.                            ____________________
