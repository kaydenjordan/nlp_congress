 Mr. President, we need to support our Capitol Police, and  we  [[Page S5155]]  will. We need to repay our National Guard, and we will. We need to  protect our allies who kept our troops safe, and we will.   Emergencies arise, and the biggest threat to dealing with them, in my  opinion, is fiscal irresponsibility in DC. We could have easily paid  for the major parts of this legislation with offsets within the DOD.   I think our spending process is broken at every level. We don't do  budgets anymore. We vote that the rules don't matter. It seems like  Congress can only agree on one thing: Deficits and debt don't matter  anymore. But they do. And both parties are to blame. And they threaten  our ability in the long run to respond to emergencies when they arise,  like the important ones in this bill, not to mention that everything we  do here currently is on borrowed money literally from our kids and our  grandkids.   My point of order reference has my friend Mike Enzi's name at the top  of it. I am speaking here today for the reasons I just mentioned and in  honor of him as well.   I yield the floor.                              Amendment No. 2123    (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute.)    Mr. President, Senate amendment No. 2123 would make new  budget authority available for fiscal year 2021. The Senate Committee  on Appropriations has not filed its suballocations as required by the  Congressional Budget Act.   Therefore, I raise a point of order against the amendment pursuant to  section 302(c) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.
