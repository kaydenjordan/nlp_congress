 Madam Speaker, I stand today to voice my support for H.R.  18, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, which would protect the  American people from a gross misuse of taxpayer dollars.   I cosponsored H.R. 18 during my first few days in Congress, because  I, along with the majority of American voters, believe that no person  should be required to pay for abortions or abortion services. President  Biden himself pledged never to force taxpayers to pay for abortions,  and yet he has broken that promise by failing to include the Hyde  amendment in his new budget proposal.   Devaluing the life of unborn children has desensitized America. We  should never use taxpayer dollars to fund abortion services. Instead,  we should focus on lifesaving resources that focus on both the mother  and the child.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Energy  and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 18, and I  [[Page H3891]]  ask for its immediate consideration in this House.
