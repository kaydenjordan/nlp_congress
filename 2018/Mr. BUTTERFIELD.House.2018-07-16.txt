 Mr. Speaker, let me first thank the gentlewoman from  Nevada (Ms. Titus) for her friendship, leadership, and for yielding me  the time this afternoon. I also thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Barletta) as well.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 3460, that  seeks to name the United States courthouse located at 323 East Chapel  Hill Street in Durham, North Carolina, as the John Hervey Wheeler  United States Courthouse.   This bill, Mr. Speaker, has the support from my friends in the North  Carolina congressional delegation and the entire Durham community. It  was favorably reported out of the Transportation and Infrastructure  Committee several days ago.   John Hervey Wheeler, Mr. Speaker, was a prominent African American  bank president, civil rights lawyer, political activist, civic leader,  educator, statesman, and philanthropist. He was a family friend as  well.   Mr. Wheeler was born on the campus of Kittrell College in Vance  County, North Carolina, on New Year's Day in 1908, as the second child  to the former Margaret Hervey and John Leonidas Wheeler.   After the Wheeler family relocated to Atlanta, Georgia, John Wheeler  attended high school at Morehouse Academy from 1921 to 1925, and then  matriculated to Morehouse College from 1925 to 1929, where he graduated  summa cum laude in June of 1929.   After graduation, Mr. Wheeler moved to Durham where he began his  career  [[Page H6223]]  with the Mechanics & Farmers Bank as a bank teller. He advanced through  the company's ranks and in 1944, became executive vice president. Eight  years later, Mr. Wheeler would become bank president. At the age of 44,  he was the youngest African American bank president in the country.   As president, Mr. Wheeler saw the bank grow from operating branches  in two cities, Durham and Raleigh, to also having a branch in  Charlotte. During his tenure the bank's assets grew from $5 million to  $41 million.   John Wheeler, Mr. Speaker, was instrumental in making loans to  hundreds of families in North Carolina, enabling them to purchase their  homes. He made loans to churches and businesses, loans they otherwise  would not have been able to obtain because of discriminatory lending  practices.   John Wheeler was eager to become a lawyer. He enrolled in law school  at the North Carolina College for Negroes, now North Carolina Central  University, where in 1947 he was among the first law school graduates.   John Wheeler became a thoughtful activist through his involvement  known as the Durham Committee on Negro Affairs, a community-based civil  and political organization founded in Durham in 1935. Mr. Wheeler began  serving as chairman in 1957, a position he held until 1978. The  organization continues today as the Durham Committee on the Affairs of  Black People.   During my entire time in Durham, Mr. Speaker, as a student at North  Carolina Central University, John Wheeler was a titan of a community  leader, well respected, and effective. On many occasions, he personally  counseled me by providing advice that I recall to this day.   It was through the Durham Committee on Negro Affairs that Attorney  Wheeler and Attorney M. Hugh Thompson and Attorney Oliver Hill of  Richmond, Virginia, challenged several North Carolina school boards by  alleging they were failing to provide equal funding to African American  schools. It was a constitutional challenge.   In the case of Blue v. Durham Public School District filed on May 18,  1949, Wheeler, Thompson, and Hill were successful in proving that the  Durham Public School District was violating the 14th Amendment of the  United States Constitution.   The court entered its order and I have a copy with me today, Mr.  Speaker. I will simply read one sentence:         The net result of what has been done leaves Negro school       children at many disadvantages which must be overcome.    The court ordered equal funding for the schools on January 26, 1951,  in the very building we are naming today.   Incidentally, Mr. Speaker, the State courthouse in Richmond,  Virginia, is named for his cocounsel, Oliver Hill. In my home county of  Wilson, also in 1949, Black residents employed Attorney Wheeler to  represent them in a similar lawsuit because the Wilson County School  Board refused to build any public schools in the rural portions of the  county for African American children.   Mr. Wheeler won that case as well, and because of the litigation, two  consolidated schools were constructed. Thousands of African American  children in Wilson County benefited by obtaining a high school  education.   Mr. Wheeler ultimately filed several school desegregation lawsuits  before the end of the decade. In 1956, he and several other Durham  attorneys, including future CORE chairman, Floyd B. McKissick, Sr., won  the U.S. Supreme Court case of Frasier v. Board of Trustees of the  University of North Carolina, which led to the first three African  American undergraduates to gain admission to our State's flagship  institution.   In 1961, President Kennedy appointed John Wheeler to the President's  Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity. In 1963, Mr. Wheeler became  an incorporator of the North Carolina Fund, an ambitious antipoverty  agency established by then-Governor Terry Sanford to help eradicate  poverty. Mr. Wheeler joined the organization's board, and his bank  became the repository for its accounts.   In 1964, then-Governor Terry Sanford named John Wheeler as a delegate  to the Democratic Party's national convention in Atlantic City, New  Jersey. Mr. Wheeler was the first African American in North Carolina to  be a convention delegate.   That same year, Mr. Wheeler became the first African American  President of the Southern Regional Council, a civil rights organization  founded in 1944 and based in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1967, John Wheeler  received an honorary doctorate from Morehouse College for his tireless  leadership as a member of the school's board of trustees. He had  previously received honorary doctorates from Shaw University in  Raleigh, Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte, and Tuskegee  University in Tuskegee, Alabama.   In 1970, Mr. Wheeler was awarded an honorary doctorate from Duke  University, and that same year received the Frank Porter Graham civil  liberties award for his defense of freedom for all North Carolinians.   In 1971, North Carolina Central University, my alma mater, also  honored him with an honorary doctorate degree. On January 4, 1976,  Morehouse College formally dedicated the John H. Wheeler Hall as the  school's social sciences and business administration building.   On December 25, Christmas Day, in 1935, Mr. Wheeler married the  former Selena Lucille Warren, the daughter of Julia McCauley and Dr.  Stanford L. Warren, a cofounder and one-time president of the Mechanics  & Farmers Bank. They had two children, Julia Taylor and Warren Hervey  Wheeler. Mr. Wheeler passed away 40 years ago on July 6, 1978, at the  age of 70.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, John Hervey Wheeler gave so much of himself  to his community, State, and country. He accomplished more in his time  on Earth than some could hope to accomplish in two lifetimes.   It is for these reasons that I respectfully urge my colleagues to  vote ``yes'' on H.R. 3460, to direct that the United States courthouse  be named in his honor.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5554, the  Animal Drug and Animal Generic Drug User Fee Act of 2018. These user  fee agreements are important to millions of North Carolinians living  with companion animals. They are also important to the agricultural  community. Some of you may not be aware that North Carolina is the  second largest pork producer, the second largest turkey producer, and  the third largest poultry producer in the country. Our agricultural  community and family farms are essential to feeding our nation and they  depend on medicines to keep animals healthy.   I am pleased that the final legislation includes language that I have  worked on with my colleagues including Representatives Hudson and  Schrader to enable conditional approval of innovative veterinary drugs  that have been demonstrated to be safe to use and have a reasonable  expectation of effectiveness. The FDA already has this authority for  unmet medical needs in minor uses and minor species, and this expanded  authority can help improve protections for animal and human health.   This legislation must be passed before Congress adjourns for August  or the FDA will be required to halt the programs. I urge my colleagues  to support this important legislation.
