 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1085, a bill to award  Congressional Gold Medals to the United States Capitol Police and those  who protected the Capitol on January 6, 2021.   I thank Speaker Pelosi for bringing this legislation to the floor in  a timely manner, and I thank the chairwoman of the Financial Services  Committee, my friend, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Waters).   What happened to this institution on January 6 was horrific. This  building is a working monument to our Nation's Founding Fathers and our  principles. It is a testament to the freedoms we hold dear.   Mr. Speaker, the brave men and women who stood and faced danger on  January 6 deserve to be recognized for their actions. Without their  courageousness, many of us here today could have been seriously injured  or worse. When I say ``us,'' Mr. Speaker, I don't just mean Members of  Congress. I mean the staff; I mean the administrative personnel and  peaceful visitors.   Once H.R. 1085 is enacted, a Congressional Gold Medal will be  displayed at the U.S. Capitol Police headquarters, another will be  displayed at the D.C. Metropolitan Police headquarters, and the third  will be given to the Smithsonian Institution, so everyone who visits  D.C. will be reminded of the bravery shown that day.   We have seen bravery from the Capitol Police many times before.  January 24, 1998, we were reminded of Officers Chestnut and Gibson; a  few years ago, on a baseball field, Crystal Griner and Special Agent  David Bailey. These men and women are heroic. They put their lives in  danger, and January 6 was certainly no exception to that.   I speak for all of my colleagues when I say thank you. Thank you to  each and every officer who was here on January 6. Your bravery will not  be forgotten. The U.S. Capitol Police and those who protected us on  January 6 deserve Congressional Gold Medals.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1515     Madam Speaker, once again, we are reminded of the dangers  that law enforcement face every single day, and January 6 was one of  those days.   Our thoughts and prayers continue to go out to the family of Brian  Sicknick, a true hero to our country, a great emblem of the bravery and  heroism of the Capitol Hill Police. Again, he will be remembered fondly  by this institution and by the American people for his sacrifice for  freedom.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers at this time, and  I am prepared to close.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I, too, urge my colleagues to support this legislation and to award  the Capitol Police with the Congressional Medal of Honor.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
