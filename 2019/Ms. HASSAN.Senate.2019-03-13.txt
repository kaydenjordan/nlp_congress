 Thank you, Mr. President.   It is good to hear from my colleague from Texas. I am here to talk  about two different issues, but I did just want to say that I have had  the pleasure and honor of visiting Senator Cornyn's wonderful State. In  fact, I was at the border last spring. It is a beautiful State that is  full of hard-working and welcoming people. Certainly, our men and women  on the frontlines at the border are working incredibly hard and have a  lot of excellent ideas about how to secure the border.   I do just want to make one point, which is simply that in addressing  a humanitarian crisis at the border, we shouldn't create another one by  separating families at the border. To be clear, there is nothing in our  law that requires families to be separated at the border. We simply  should not be harming children as we deal with this issue.   I would welcome Senator Cornyn to our Homeland Security Committee,  where we have discussed the various options that would keep us from  hurting children in our care.    Mr. President, when Gerald Kotkowski of Hampton,  NH, was preparing for retirement, he knew he would have more time on  his hands and wanted to find a way to give back to his community.  Inspired by his own life experiences, Gerald chose to serve as a  volunteer driver to help people undergoing cancer treatment, as well as  those who experience visual impairments. Since he started working with  both Future in Sight and the American Cancer Society, Gerald has  provided more than 400 rides to his fellow Granite Staters in need. For  his incredible volunteerism, I am proud to recognize him as March  2019's Granite Stater of the Month.   Gerald began driving people undergoing cancer treatment after he  heard about the program from a coworker. The cause, he said, touched  him because of his own experiences; he and his wife both have had  cancer scares, and their daughter was diagnosed with leukemia as a  child. While his daughter has thankfully been cancer-free for over two  decades, he still remembers the impact that the diagnosis had on his  family. Gerald also provides rides to Granite Staters who experience  visual impairments through Future in Sight, inspired by a friend with  low vision. Many of the people Gerald drives are from rural parts of  our State or don't have the support networks they need while undergoing  treatment and are profoundly grateful for the simple act.   In addition to providing rides, Gerald is also active in supporting  adult Granite Staters who experience disabilities. Inspired in part by  raising his own daughter who experiences Down syndrome, every Monday,  Gerald plays basketball with adults who experience disabilities through  Friends in Action NH, an organization dedicated to providing social and  recreational activities to those who experience disabilities. Gerald  also serves on the board of the organization.   For his selfless work to support those who need care in his community  and to ensure that those who experience disabilities are fully  included, I am proud to recognize Gerald as the March 2019 Granite  Stater of the Month.                            ____________________
