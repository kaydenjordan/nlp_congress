 Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Thornberry, and I rise  today in strong support of the Lamborn amendment requiring a report on  Iran's use of commercial aircraft to support terrorist groups in rogue  regimes around the Middle East.   The Lamborn amendment delivers a simple message to Iran, to Assad,  and all companies considering selling aircraft to the world's leading  state sponsor of terrorism, and that is: Congress is watching.   Congress is watching midnight flights take off from military bases in  Iran and land in war-torn Damascus carrying terrorists, guns, and  explosives, which will only be used to shed more innocent blood in the  Syrian civil war.   Congress is watching as Boeing and Airbus shake hands and cut deals  with former leaders of Iran's National Revolutionary Guard Corps like  Hossein Alaei, CEO of Aseman Airlines, who has called to destroy U.S.  naval ships sailing in international waters.   Congress is watching as iconic American and European companies are  choosing to fuel Iran's terror campaign around the world.   Mr. Chair, Congress is watching, and Congress will act to ensure that  Western companies do not become complicit in the Syrian massacre.   Please support the Lamborn amendment.
