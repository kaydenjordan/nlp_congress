 Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge that any long-term  infrastructure agreement reached between Congress and the President  must invest in the resiliency of coastal communities.   Lake Ontario is already over 11 inches higher than average, and as  rain falls and water levels continue to climb, my community and others  like it are bracing for yet another season of devastating flooding.   We must take proactive steps to adjust to changing weather patterns,  the impacts of Plan 2014, and improve our community's ability to  withstand, recover, and adapt to weather-related events.   The Army Corps of Engineers will soon be conducting a study to  develop a coastal resiliency plan, and it is imperative that any long- term infrastructure agreement include significant investments in these  findings.   I look forward to working with my colleagues towards a comprehensive  infrastructure package that makes these investments a reality and  better protects my district and the Great Lakes coastline.                            ____________________     ``After it was reported that Cohen intended to cooperate  with the government, however, the President accused Cohen of `making up  stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam (taxicabs  maybe?),' called Cohen a `rat,' and on multiple occasions publicly  suggested that Cohen's family members had committed crimes. The  evidence concerning this sequence of events could support an inference  that the President used inducements in the form of positive messages in  an effort to get Cohen not to cooperate, and then turned to attacks and  intimidation to deter the provision of information or undermine Cohen's  credibility once Cohen began cooperating.'' Volume II, page 154.    ``Congress can permissibly criminalize certain  obstructive conduct by the President, such as suborning perjury,  intimidating witnesses, or fabricating evidence, because those  prohibitions raise no separation of powers questions. . . . The  Constitution does not authorize the President to engage in such  conduct, and those actions would transgress the President's duty to  `take care that the laws be faithfully executed.' ''   Volume II, page 170.
