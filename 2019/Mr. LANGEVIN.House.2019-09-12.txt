 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to celebrate the life of  Marca Bristo, whose unyielding commitment to advancing disability  rights improved the lives of millions.   As the founder of Access Living and a leader of the National Council  on Disability, the National Council on Independent Living, and the  United States International Council on Disabilities, Marca fought  passionately to ensure that people with disabilities have the same  rights as their able-bodied peers, including the right to live  independently in the community.   She was a crusader for the Americans with Disabilities Act, and her  steadfast advocacy was instrumental in the passage of this landmark  civil rights legislation.   Her work tearing down barriers cleared the way for people with  disabilities to pursue their own dreams, which, ultimately, also helped  me realize my dream of becoming a United States Congressman.   Marca's legacy is the continued improvement of the lives of people  with disabilities. She made a difference, and my condolences go out to  her entire family and her friends.                            ____________________
