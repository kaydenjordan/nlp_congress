 Mr. President, later today, the Senate will take the  first procedural step to begin consideration of our annual Defense  bill.   For more than six decades, Democrats and Republicans have worked in  good faith to pass the NDAA. This year's Defense authorization bill is  a prime example of how Senate D's and R's can work constructively to  provide our Nation's defense, take care of our servicemembers and DOD  civilians, and make the investments necessary to innovate and build up  our military intelligence capabilities.   I hope we can have an open and constructive amendment process for the  NDAA, without needless delay or dilatory tactics. I certainly hope we  do not see the kind of controversy that severely hindered the NDAA  process over in the House. Both sides should defeat potentially toxic  amendments and refrain from delaying the NDAA's passage.   So far, we have thankfully avoided all of that. Over the weekend,  nearly all the committees across the Senate worked around the clock on  a substitute, with a managers' package that has 51 amendments--21 from  Republicans, 21 from Democrats, and 9 bipartisan. We have had many  great amendments. This is a good start, and we are working toward a  second managers' package with even more priorities for Democrats and  Republicans.   I want to thank Chairman Reed, Ranking Member Wicker, all the other  chairs and rankers, and all of my colleagues and the staff who worked  long and hard over the weekend for their good work on this bill.   There are a few items that are in the bill that deserve some  attention, and, in the largeness of the bill, I would like to highlight  them. I want to highlight a few items added to the managers' package  that are very important and bode well for our country's future,  particularly on AI, on outcompeting the Chinese Government, and on  tackling our Nation's fentanyl crisis.   First, I am pleased that the managers' package includes an amendment  I worked on with Senators Rounds, Young, and Heinrich that takes some  early initial steps on AI legislation, the first steps this body is  taking in a  [[Page S2968]]  while. The Senate has already done important preliminary work to bring  ourselves up to speed on this issue, but the NDAA will be the Senate's  first opportunity this year to pass real AI legislation.   My AI amendment includes provisions that will boost AI oversight  within the national security space, including an increase in data  sharing within the DOD, new risk studies to examine explainability and  similar issues, and it provides for ``bug bounty programs'' that will  help sniff out vulnerability in AI systems used by the DOD.   This year, our first managers' package also makes a critical down  payment on the Senate's efforts to outcompete the Chinese Government.  We have over a dozen amendments related to our ongoing competition with  the Chinese Government, including measures that make progress on the  AUKUS defense cooperation agreement between the United States, the UK,  and Australia. Senator Menendez and I wanted more, but we have a good  compromise in the bill, and I hope we can add more in the amendment  process.   We have provisions to strengthen our partnership with Taiwan, boost  the development of quantum information technologies, and strengthen the  United States' position in the Indo-Pacific region, to name a few.   As you know, we are working on a bipartisan China competition package  that will deal with the excesses and wrongs of the Chinese Government.  But this, in the DOD bill, is a good first start.   And I also want to praise my colleagues Tim Scott and Sherrod Brown  for their work to combat our Nation's fentanyl crisis. This is one of  the most devastating health crises happening in our country.   In 2021, the DEA, the Drug Enforcement Agency, seized enough fentanyl  to give every single American a lethal dose--every single American. A  lot of blame for this crisis lies at the feet of the chemical suppliers  located in China that operate with little or no accountability, which  represent the bedrock of the international fentanyl supply chain.   I felt this is very important that we do more to stop the scourge of  fentanyl from coming into our country. So I pushed very hard to get  this amendment in the managers' package, and I am glad it was-- championed, as I said, and passed in the Banking Committee, by Chairman  Brown and Ranking Member Scott. It declares the international  trafficking of fentanyl a national emergency and adds teeth and  potential sanctions to the administration's ability to hold wrongdoers  accountable. The ability to declare this a national emergency gives the  President broader powers and allows him to do more to stop the flow of  these precursor chemicals coming from China and other countries. The  bill was passed unanimously, I am proud to say, by the Banking  Committee--another great example of regular order here in the Senate.   Finally, I am pleased the NDAA will include my amendment on  increasing transparency on UAPs, Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena. UAPs  generate a lot of curiosity from many Americans, and with that  curiosity, sometimes comes misinformation. My amendment will require  the National Archives and Records Administration to create a collection  of records from across government Agencies that can be declassified for  the public's use, similar to the approach used in 1992 with the J.F.K.  Assassination Records Collection Act. These records will carry a  presumption of immediate disclosure, which means they can only be made  classified with good reason.   I thank my colleagues who worked with me on this legislation-- Senators Rounds, Rubio, Heinrich, Gillibrand, and Young--for their  partnership on this amendment. And as many know, my mentor and dear  friend whom I miss so much, Harry Reid, was passionate about this  issue, and so were Senators Stevens and Inouye. So I am glad we could  get this into the managers' amendment.   For these and many other reasons, I look forward to beginning floor  consideration of the NDAA bill today. The four things I mentioned-- dealing with fentanyl, dealing with competition with China, dealing  with AI, and making public the UAP phenomena and what we know about  them in an unclassified way--are all important additions to the Defense  bill. I am glad we added them in.   I thank both sides for their good work, and I hope we can pass this  important bill without needless delay or controversy.
