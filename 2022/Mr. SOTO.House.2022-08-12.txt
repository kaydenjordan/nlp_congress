 Madam Speaker, we have been elected to Congress to solve  the greatest challenges of our time, and today, we are doing just that.   We are taking action to combat climate change.   We are taking action to lower drug prices for seniors with a $2,000  cap on out-of-pocket expenses.   We are taking action to keep ObamaCare affordable for millions of  Floridians.   We are taking action by increasing vaccine access with our HAPPY Act.   We are doing it all while reducing the deficit by over $300 billion  over the next 10 years.   We are lowering costs; we are fighting inflation; and we are saving  the planet. This is the largest investment to resolve the climate  crisis in our Nation's history. It will reduce carbon emissions by 40  percent by 2030.   When generations look back years from now, they will read that this  was a turning point. How many more category 5 hurricanes, how many more  massive wildfires, deadly floods, dried-up rivers, and record heat  waves do you need?   How many more seniors have to get sick or die because they can't  afford their medication?   How many more families have to be kicked off their health insurance?   How much longer before you all get it?   We are not waiting any longer. The Republicans' plan is to do  nothing. In contrast, we in the Democratic majority will lead. Today,  we will act. Today, we will do what is necessary to protect this  generation and the next.
