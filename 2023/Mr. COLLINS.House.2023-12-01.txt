 Madam Speaker, one of our colleagues recently asked what  our House majority has been doing that we can campaign on, things we  can take back to the American people.   In addition to   James Comer and   Jim Jordan exposing Biden's  corruption, all committees have exposed Federal agencies, keeping them  in check. It is not just here in D.C. We have been taking our hearings  all over the country to learn what needs fixing from the American  people.   We have passed bills to unleash our energy sector, secure our border,  and cut spending. We have sent bills over to the Senate to modernize  Federal agencies and reduce regulations. We have passed 7 of 12  appropriations bills that cut spending and rein in unelected  bureaucracies. We would have had all 12 of our appropriations done by  now if Members would not stop making perfect the enemy of the good by  taking down rules and bills that cut spending.   To those who want to make more cuts, I do, too, and we can work on  that. Let's at least start by getting off the Pelosi budget and cutting  something. That is something we could campaign on, but only if we do  it.                            ____________________
