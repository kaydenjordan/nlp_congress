 Madam Speaker, I want to take a moment to honor a  distinguished member of my district. Priscilla Gardner has been a  staple of the Jersey City community during her 50-year career at the  Jersey City Free Public Library. Priscilla is known for many successes  during her time there.   She created the library's first computer learning center when the  internet was in its infancy.   Ms. Gardner established the Jersey City Free Public Library  Foundation to raise desperately needed funds to improve and expand the  library when necessary, a successful venture that still exists today.   Ms. Gardner was project director when they built the first new  library since 1962, a gorgeous new facility with community and  children's areas that opened in 2004.   Ms. Gardner drove fundraising efforts for the library to have a  bookmobile, one that provided residents with 2,000 books, computer  terminals, and other media stations.   Most importantly, Ms. Gardner has been instrumental in the renovation  and restoration of Jersey City's historic 120-year-old main library.   Ms. Gardner leaves the library and her city a much better place. Ms.  Gardner will be sorely missed, and I wish her all the best in her  retirement.                            ____________________
