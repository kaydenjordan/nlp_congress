 Mr. Speaker, with TrumpCare 2.0, Republican leaders took a  bad bill and made it worse.   On top of causing at least 24 million more Americans to be uninsured,  raising costs for middle class families, imposing an age tax on older  Americans, and making everyone pay more for less coverage, this bill  now guts protections for patients with preexisting illnesses and  removes the essential health benefits: guaranteed coverage for things  like prescription drugs, emergency care, maternity care, and mental  health. All this while still giving billions in tax breaks to  millionaires.   Stop being ideologically driven. Put people above partisanship. Put  patients first, and let's work for a bipartisan plan to reduce out-of- pocket costs for care and medicine for all Americans.                            ____________________
