 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the  distinguished accomplishment of Kansan Paul Kaster on the occasion of  his 2017 National Federation of Independent Business, NFIB, Young  Entrepreneur Award.   Mr. Kaster, of Leawood, KS, is the founder and owner of Crooked  Branch Studio, which specializes in woodworking. I ask that my  colleagues join me in recognizing Paul on his outstanding achievements.  I wish him nothing but the best for his future entrepreneurial and  educational endeavors.                            ____________________
