 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Rush  County on the grand occasion of its bicentennial.   Rush County was founded in 1822 by one of the signers of the  Declaration of Independence, Dr. Benjamin Rush. Not only is the history  rich in Rush County, but so is the hospitality and the heart of its  residents.   Rushville, the county seat, was recognized by my State of Indiana as  a ``Stellar Community,'' one of only 12 communities to be honored as  such.   From its lively history to its heartwarming and welcoming citizens,  we invite everyone here today in the House to celebrate with us this  bicentennial year for Rush County.                            ____________________
