 Mr. Speaker, the actions of Justice Thomas and his  wife, Virginia, have undermined the Constitution.   Ms. Thomas was in direct communication with the Trump White House in  a conspiracy to undermine the peaceful transfer of power between  Presidents.   Justice Thomas should recuse himself from cases related to his wife's  involvement. Yet, he took part in Court rulings and voted to prevent  the disclosure of White House communications.   Justice Thomas failed to disclose his wife's nearly $700,000 in  income from The Heritage Foundation, an organization working to stop  the January 6 investigation.   Justice Thomas has repeatedly failed to meet his ethical obligations  of recusal and disclosure that are expected of a Federal judge.   The American people entrust Members of Congress and the Supreme Court  to defend our Constitution, our laws, and our democracy. His wife's  involvement in the attempt to overthrow the 2020 election, and Justice  Thomas' failure to recuse himself, have made him ethically compromised.  He is unfit to be a natural arbiter of justice.   Justice Thomas should resign from the Supreme Court.                            ____________________
