 Mr. President, I rise today to respectfully request  bipartisan support from my Senate colleagues on the Cornyn-Casey  amendment No. 931, the Outbound Investment Transparency Act. This  amendment would establish a program to provide visibility on U.S.  investments going to the People's Republic of China and critical supply  chains and technology sectors.   Here is what the amendment does. The proposed amendment would  establish a program led by the Department of the Treasury, in  coordination with the Department of Commerce, that would require U.S.  companies planning to invest in national security technology sectors in  countries of concern to notify--notify--the Department of the Treasury  before those deals are completed.   This proposal has been vetted by industry, by the Senate Banking  Committee, and by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review  Commission.   Those are the fundamentals of this amendment.   We all know that this year's Defense bill that we are going to be  voting on today that we started last week tackles the toughest national  security issues that face our Nation, and technological competition  with the People's Republic of China is certainly at the top of that  list.   Right now, we are in competition with a communist government that  doesn't play by the rules. The Chinese Government employs economic  espionage, and it exploits the United States' open research and  innovation to build up its own capabilities.   U.S. companies are sending capital, intellectual property, and  innovation to the People's Republic of China, fueling its advance in  dual-use critical technological areas.   A recent report by the National Security Advisor in the last  administration, GEN H.R. McMaster, states as follows:         Outbound investment harms U.S. strategic interests when it       facilitates inappropriate technology transfer, allows for       underinvestment in domestic capabilities, or undermines the       long-term competitiveness of American firms.    Testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee--the committee on  which both Senator Cornyn and I sit--noted that in 2020, U.S.  companies' capital investment in China totaled over $200 billion just  in artificial intelligence, so-called AI--$200 billion just in AI--over  $21 billion in semiconductors, and over $50 billion in biotechnology.  These numbers don't even account for the transfer of operational know- how and intellectual property. You can't even quantify those values. We  need a targeted response to these risks to our national security.   Again, this amendment would require U.S. companies planning to invest  in national security technology sectors in countries of concern to  notify only--to notify the Department of the Treasury before those  deals are completed. We need this type of outbound investment  notification to understand just how much critical technology we are  transferring to our adversaries via these capital flows. With this  information in hand, we can begin to take control of our own economic  future. By utilizing this information, we can make determinations as to  how to protect U.S. talent, U.S. technology, and U.S. supply chains.   This issue--and this is true of a lot of the Defense bill--this issue  transcends party lines and gets to the heart of one of the most  significant national security threats that we must confront.   I want to thank Senator Cornyn for his strong bipartisan work on this  issue over the last 3 years.   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of amendment No. 931.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Paul  Katsarelis from my staff be granted floor privileges for the duration  of today's proceedings.
