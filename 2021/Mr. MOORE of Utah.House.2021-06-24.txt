 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak in opposition  to the CRA before us.   Innovation in our financial industry lifts Americans across all  levels of the socioeconomic spectrum. A great example of this has been  the emergence of the fintech industry, which has helped more Americans  access secure, affordable credit.   Unfortunately, government regulation has stymied innovation as  regulatory uncertainties have imposed artificial barriers to our  creativity. Recent court rulings have only exacerbated this uncertainty  by creating confusion about who the true lender of a loan is when a  bank works with a third party.   In 2020, the Office of the Comptroller sought to clarify this  uncertainty by finalizing the true lender rule. This rule allowed our  local community and regional banks to provide expanded access to  banking services and lower the cost of banking to consumers across the  Nation. It is that simple.   Commonsense reforms that help banks and the fintech industry do  business, in turn, make life easier for families, individuals, and  businesses. Unfortunately, my Democrat colleagues are seeking to roll  this rule back.   Nullifying the rule will decrease credit accessibility for  underserved communities, hurt community banks' ability to utilize new  technologies, and dissuade innovation in the financial services sector.
