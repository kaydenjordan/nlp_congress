 Madam Speaker, I have got a prediction to make, and here  is my prediction: In the course of this debate, the opponents of H.R. 7  will not acknowledge nor give voice to Congressman Smith's claim of  saving 2 million lives. Why? Because to acknowledge 2 million lives  that are saved is to acknowledge the weakness of an argument; that is,  those people are to be dismissed.   Madam Speaker, how do you dismiss 2 million people? How do you  dismiss 2 million people, over 60,000 people every year?   If you can imagine what it would be like if someone came in here and  with certainty, absolute confidence, said unambiguously, if you pass  this law you are going to save 2 million lives, we would line up. We  would be voting on that over and over and over again.   And yet, my prediction is, during the remainder of this debate-- because we have not heard about it so far--the opponents will be silent  about those 2 million lives.   We need to vote for this and save lives in the future.
