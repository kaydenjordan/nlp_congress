 Madam Speaker, as chair of the Select  Committee on the Climate Crisis and as a mom, I am proud to say the  Inflation Reduction Act is a big climate deal.   This is the largest investment in clean energy and climate solutions  ever in U.S. history, and it comes at a crucial time.   We must urgently slash climate pollution to avoid the worst impacts  and to lower costs, create good-paying jobs, and build safer, more  resilient communities.   Today, I am optimistic that America will lead the world in solving  the climate crisis, and I thank the young people all across this  country who pushed us to take this historic step.   The Inflation Reduction Act is also good news for Floridians, as  Democrats will lower the costs of prescription drugs, empower Medicare  to negotiate drug prices, institute a $2,000 cap, and much more.   It is a big deal for the 2.8 million Floridians who purchase high- quality health coverage under the Affordable Care Act. With these tax  credits, those policies will be more affordable.   Yes, this is good news indeed, a true people over politics moment for  all of our neighbors, their health, their pocketbooks, and the  obligation we have to our kids to provide a livable planet.   I thank Speaker Pelosi for her vision for the Select Committee on the  Climate Crisis, and I also thank Chairman Frank Pallone and my  colleagues for their inspiring work.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote.
