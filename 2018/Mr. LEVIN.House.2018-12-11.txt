 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution calling  for the release of the two journalists imprisoned after investigating  attacks against the Rohingya ethnic minority in Burma, also known as  Myanmar.   As I said in the resolution I introduced in early September calling  for their release: ``The Burmese police captain involved in their  arrest reportedly admitted during the trial that his superior ordered  him to entrap the journalists.''   The atrocities committed against the Rohingya--mass killings; rape  perpetrated on a massive scale; whole villages burned to the ground,  with people being burned alive in their homes; and over 700,000 fleeing  the violence to neighboring Bangladesh--have been so extreme that the  United Nations issued a report earlier this year calling for Burma's  military leaders to be investigated and prosecuted on the charges of  genocide. There can be no doubt about the culpability of Burma's  military in the oppression and violence inflicted on the Rohingya.   I had the privilege of meeting Aung San Suu Kyi a few years ago as  part of a delegation led by Nancy Pelosi, joining in admiration for her  perseverance and triumph over oppression. There has been a hesitation  by some to criticize Suu Kyi, worrying that it could make it more  likely the military would take over the civilian government she leads.  But her words and actions in the face of what, in reality, has been  genocide have been deeply disturbing, contrary to her past example as a  beacon of freedom.                                time  1430    In 2017, the late John McCain and Richard Durbin introduced in the  Senate and I introduced in the House a resolution that encouraged  ``Aung San Suu Kyi to live up to her inspiring  [[Page H10064]]  words upon receiving the 2012 Nobel Peace Prize with respect to ethnic  reconciliation in Burma, and in particular to address the historic and  brutal repression of the Rohingya in Rakhine State.''   Unfortunately, that resolution was not acted upon.   When Aung San Suu Kyi later said: ``We believe that, for the sake of  long-term stability and security, we have to be fair to all sides,'' it  was a disturbing message of minimization.   Suu Kyi later said: ``In a way we can say that we understand our  country better than any other country does, and I'm sure you will say  the same of yours, that you understand your country better than anybody  else.''   As Bishop Desmond Tutu said in a letter to Suu Kyi: ``My dear sister:  If the political price of your ascension to the highest office in  Myanmar is your silence, the price is surely too steep.''   This resolution speaks out against the genocide and crimes against  humanity that occurred in Rakhine State. All of humanity must speak out  clearly and decisively.   Mr. Speaker, I urge unanimous support for this resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I will start first by applauding the  leadership of this committee: Mr. Royce, who has worked so hard, and  the gentlewoman from Florida.   We went to Bosnia together some years ago, and they have worked so  closely with Mr. Engel. I think it really demonstrates what can be done  when people work together.   The Congressional Ukraine Caucus cochairs--Representatives Marcy  Kaptur,  Andy Harris, Brian Fitzpatrick, and I--issued this statement  rebuking the Russian Federation's aggressive attack on Ukraine near the  Kerch Strait in the Sea of Azov: ``As cochairs of the Congressional  Ukraine Caucus, we strongly condemn Russia's dangerous naval assault on  Ukrainian ships. This episode, as well as Russia's blockade of  Ukrainian ports, is a deeply disturbing sign of continued Russian  aggression in its efforts to tighten its bloody grip and illegitimate  occupation of the Crimean peninsula.   ``We join the international committee and our NATO allies in resolute  affirmation of the fact that Crimea and its surrounding waters belong  to Ukraine. We call on Russian authorities, in accordance with  international law, to cease any and all interference with access to  Ukrainian ports and the Azov Sea. Russia must end this bloody and  unjust occupation of Ukrainian sovereign territory.''   I was in Ukraine at the time of the Russian attack. I was at meetings  where the President of Ukraine spoke out clearly against the Russian  action on behalf of the people of Ukraine. He also spoke out on what  was the main aim of Russia's military actions: to undermine Ukraine's  efforts to build democracy.   Today, there is a dangerous tilt to authoritarianism in many places  around the world. This makes Ukraine's struggle to resist aggression,  safeguard its independence, and develop democracy all the more  important.   Ukraine has witnessed firsthand that the challenges of democracy are  not easily overcome. That makes it all the more important to overcome  the threats to democracy, such as injustice and corruption.   The United States must support Ukraine in its efforts. We must deepen  our determination to help the fight for freedom and democracy, never  making heroes out of dictators. That is what this resolution is all  about. May it pass unanimously.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Engel and thank my pal from Florida for  their work.
