 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to discuss why  this body needs to pass the JUST Act of 2023. This bill will strengthen  civil rights accountability at the United States Department of  Agriculture.   Some may question why this bill is necessary. The USDA has a long and  checkered history of racial policies and discrimination against Black  and other minority farmers.   In the 20th century, the USDA farm lending programs undermined  African-American farmers' ability to continue their operations, and the  numbers don't lie.   At the beginning of the 1900s, there were more than 925,000 Black  farm operators who owned more than 16 million acres of land.   The most recent numbers from 2017 paint a bleak picture. There are  only 48,000 Black family farm operators left. So let's strengthen civil  rights accountability at the USDA by passing the JUST Act.                            ____________________
