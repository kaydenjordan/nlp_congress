 Mr. President, it was a powerful opportunity to join my  colleague from Delaware, Senator Carper, in traveling to the Northern  Triangle of Central America--Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador--to  try to understand more about the dynamics in that region, which are  driving so many families to come north, to take the difficult journey  through Central America, through Mexico, to come to our border and to  ask for asylum.   This has been a significant flow, which has expanded greatly. We have  seen in the past that most of those arriving on our border were men  from Mexico who were seeking work but not so much now. Now we have this  flow of families from Central America. These families are traveling to  find something better for their lives and for their children's lives.  It is not an easy journey, and it is a journey that has created quite a  conversation here in the United States of America.   The conversation coming from our President has been this: How do we  stop them from asserting asylum at the border?   President Trump has a number of strategies to deter families from  coming. His strategy was to separate children from their parents, treat  those fleeing as criminals, create great trauma for the children, and  use this as a strategy of deterrence. This was first laid out very  clearly by John Kelly just months into the administration. In March of  2017, he said: Yes, this is exactly what we are considering.   The administration then proceeded to implement it first as a pilot  project and later as an all-out strategy to treat those migrating as  criminals, lock up the parents, separate the children, inflict trauma,  and deter people from coming. I can state that any strategy that  involves mistreating children as a political tactic--a political  message of deterrence--is simply evil. It comes from a very, very dark  place in the heart of this administration to deliberately injure  children in this fashion.   Why doesn't the President look to Central America and ask: What is  motivating these families to come? How can we change that motivation?  What are the forces at work in that region?   Those were the questions that Senator Carper and I were undertaking  to answer on our recent trip, and I appreciate so much that he went  through the great work of organizing it.   We went first to Guatemala, then to Honduras, then to El Salvador. We  met with the President. We met with the incoming President of El  Salvador. We met with the civil society organizations--those who  understand the roots of what is going on within the society--and here  is what we learned. We learned there were three powerful forces driving  families to leave those countries: security, economics, and corruption.   Let's talk a little bit about those three things.   Security. I had the chance to meet a woman and her daughter,  Gabriella and her baby Andrea. Gabriella told me about her journey. She  said that her family took a loan from a private bank, which probably  meant a financial loan from the local drug cartel or financial group  associated with a drug cartel. The family wasn't able to repay the  loan. They were given a deadline. They were told: If you don't repay  the loan, one of your family members dies, and that will be you,  Gabriella.   Gabriella was pregnant. She figured that as long as she was pregnant,  they would not kill her. So when she was 8 months pregnant--1 month  ago--she fled the country to save herself and to save her baby.   I met her and her baby on the border. They had just crossed the  bridge into the United States of America. I asked her: How did you get  past the American border guards, who wouldn't allow anyone across the  bridge if they didn't have a passport or visa? Her face lit up for a  moment. She said: Well, I was rebuffed time and again at the center of  the bridge, not allowed to come across and assert asylum, and I was  desperate, blocked on the Mexican side.   Then I saw there was a pedestrian bridge and a car bridge, and on the  car bridge were folks who were washing windows for tips. So I asked to  use an extra squeegee from one of the window washers, who gave it to  me, and I washed windows on the car bridge to get into the United  States of America. And there she was at the foot of the bridge with her  baby.   She told me that because she fled with her baby, those who were  enforcing that private loan from that private bank killed her uncle.  That is the security issue that comes with all of the various versions  of that story.   I met another woman, Patricia. Patricia had a 14-year-old daughter.  Patricia had to pay extortion money. The President of Guatemala told me  that every business has to pay extortion money. In this case, though,  Patricia had no money left to pay the extortion. So the drug gang--or  the gang that controls the streets and runs the extortion--came to her  house and assaulted her 14-year-old daughter. So she fled. She fled to  protect her daughter from any other such horrific circumstances. She  came to the United States.  [[Page S1766]]    That is a security issue. This is not a situation where if you don't  pay the extortion money, they break your window. This is: If you don't  pay the extortion money, we kill you; we rape your daughter; we kill  your family--maybe we torture them. That is the security issue.   Then there is the economic issue. In Guatemala, the median age is 18.  I believe they said it is the youngest median age on the planet. A huge  number of young people are coming into working age, and while they are  working to create jobs, they are not possibly creating enough jobs. So  you have this huge number of people without jobs. What are they going  to do?   I will state that one thing they do is go hungry. Malnutrition is a  horrendous demon haunting the country of Guatemala. One individual  showed us a picture of Guatemalan children against a wall and their  average heights; they had lines across the wall for their heights. They  had a similar picture of Guatemalan children being raised in the United  States. It was to dramatize the fact that the children growing up in  Guatemala at age 9 are 6 inches shorter than the Guatemalan children  growing up in the United States at the same age. It is stunting-- stunting from persistent malnutrition. So joblessness and malnutrition,  an insufficient network of schools and trained schoolteachers--all of  these things are economic challenges.   Let me tell you, it is not just the fact that you don't have a job.  It is that in your small village across the country--across all three  countries--you may see on a street, as was described to us, a shack, a  second shack, a third shack, a fourth shack, and then a beautiful  house. That beautiful house was there because somebody in that village  made it to the United States of America, and they have been sending  back money year after year in sufficient quantities that the family is  now prosperous. They can build that beautiful house.   That beautiful house stands as a billboard. It is an advertisement  for what might happen if you can make it to the United States and get a  job. So on the one hand, there are no jobs, and on the other hand, this  beacon of hope is saying to you: If you can make it across the border,  you might be able to be prosperous yourself and, basically, enable your  entire family to be prosperous.   Then we have corruption. This isn't garden variety corruption. For  generations--for hundreds of years--there has been a class in these  countries that is beyond the law. They call their efforts to change  this a campaign against impunity. That is not a word we use a lot in  America--``impunity''--but it means individuals who are never touched  by the legal system. They can do whatever they want. They pay no fines.  They never go to prison. They suck money out of the country. They suck  money out of all of those layers of the economy below them. They have  become extraordinarily rich. They talk about the 8 families in  Guatemala and the 14 families in El Salvador.   So that corruption we have been working to take on. We, the United  States, in partnership with the governments there, have been working to  take that on. So those three things--security, the economy, and  corruption--are the factors driving people to flee north.   A few years ago, then-Vice President Biden went to Central America to  understand those issues better. Out of that came the Alliance for  Prosperity--the Alliance for Prosperity--a strategy based on Plan  Colombia, as my colleague from Delaware laid out, that would strengthen  the programs to take on the security issues, to take on the corruption  issues, to take on the economic challenges that are draining those  countries so that people didn't feel that to survive, they had to flee  north.   We funded this at a modest level in fiscal year 2016. It was $754  million. Think of that as it compares to money we have been spending on  the border--billions and billions and billions of dollars for physical  infrastructure, for border security, for high-tech sensors, for a  system of courts to adjudicate asylum, all of that. We spent only about  three-quarters of a billion dollars to strengthen those three  countries.   Along comes the Trump administration, which says that it is  concerned--very concerned--about this flow of people coming from  Central America to our border, and they propose a 34-percent cut in  this program. They propose cutting it from $754 million to a proposal  of $460 million. Well, the Democrats and Republicans restored funding,  put it back, not quite to the $750 million number but to $627 million.   The Trump budget came out the next year and cut it again; they  proposed a 30-percent cut. Again, here in Congress, we worked to  restore those programs, not where they were before but, basically, $100  million more than the Trump administration asked for.   So to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle: Doesn't it make sense  for us to support the Alliance for Prosperity? For each dollar we send,  they provide between $4 and $7; that is $4 to $7 in very poor  countries.   Doesn't it make sense to support the commissions against impunity,  the commissions against corruption? In the last 2 years, the Trump  administration has been undermining these commissions against  corruption. Well, that is just wrong.   The result, as you saw in El Salvador, was the election of the mayor  of San Salvador, Nayib Bukele, a very young fellow in his thirties.  What did he run on? Taking on corruption, taking on impunity. Shouldn't  we be a partner with them in this?   If we don't want families to flee north, then we shouldn't want the  elite to operate with impunity and suck all of the resources out of the  country and leave people starving. Let's partner with the governments  there to take on corruption, not undermine these commissions of  support.   A trip to Central America will make you really appreciate our  institutions, our economy, our education system, our healthcare system,  our court system, our opportunities for our children. We can do far  better, for sure, but every piece of what we have that works so much  better than those parallel systems in Central America calls out to  those there to come and participate in our society. If we want families  to stay where they are, they are going to have to have an opportunity  where they are, which means we have to take on the security issues,  including the street-level extortion. We have to help them take those  on. We have to help them improve their economy and their education  system. We have to help them take on the systemic, high-level, massive  corruption that drives resources into the hands of the very few at the  expense of the very many.   That is the mission we should be talking about here on the floor-- wrestling with here on the floor. Maybe we shouldn't return to the  levels that Obama had that we had passed in a bipartisan way here.  Maybe we should do double what was done in 2016--or triple--if we  really want to help anchor those societies' rudders that have people  fleeing for their lives to come here.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I speak now to a bill we will introduce  this Wednesday, the Equality Act. The Equality Act will be introduced  by a group of us in the Senate and by another group led by Congressman  Cicilline in the House.   It is an appropriate moment for us to ponder in this Chamber why this  piece of legislation is part of our American journey toward the vision  of opportunity for all and why we all should be supporting this  beautiful legislative proposal.   My involvement in the Equality Act began in my home State of Oregon,  when I was serving in the legislature there, and we had the question of  how can we change the systematic discrimination against our LGBTQ  brothers and sisters. How can we give them the same opportunity  everyone else has?   So we came together and said we should do an Oregon Equality Act, an  Oregon Equality Act that would create the same basic protections the  Civil Rights Act has for race and gender and ethnicity.   We went about doing that. I was the speaker. I worked very hard to  make that happen, and we succeeded. We ended discrimination in Oregon  based on who you are or whom you love. Discrimination should be ended  across the whole country.   I arrived here in January 2009, and I was assigned to the Health,  Education,  [[Page S1767]]  Labor, and Pensions Committee--the Health Committee. I asked Senator  Kennedy if I could possibly serve on this committee to help fight for  health and education and labor, and he arranged that. I will never  forget having his voicemail on my phone saying: Yes, you are a member  of the committee.   A few months later came the real surprise. Senator Kennedy was  struggling with the brain cancer that killed him later that year, and  through his team, he asked me to take on one of his civil rights bills,  the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.   That was to end discrimination for LGBTQ Americans in employment,  give them a fair chance to get a job here. Well, this is something that  had been part of our Equality Act in Oregon. We had gotten that done,  and because I helped lead that fight, he asked me to take over and lead  the fight to end employment nondiscrimination.   That was 2009. It took 4 years of work--work with the community and  work with our legislators inside this building. Then, finally, in 2013,  the time was ripe to put it on the floor and have this debate. This  Chamber, with the supermajority, bipartisan vote, said, yes, let's end  discrimination in employment, and we passed the Employment Non- Discrimination Act.   Then I went over to the House, and it died without consideration. I  got together with the advocates and asked, where do we go from here  with the House not acting? Do we simply continue to reintroduce the  Employment Non-Discrimination Act--which had been first introduced in  1996, first considered on this floor and almost passed just one vote  short in 1998. Do we continue to do that?   Out of that conversation, we developed a different vision. Let's do a  full Equality Act like Oregon has done, like a number of other States  have done and end discrimination not just in one sector or another, not  just in places of accommodation, not just in financial transactions,  not just in serving on a jury, not just in terms of housing, not just  in terms of employment, let's base the Equality Act on providing the  full spectrum, the full measure of protection for opportunity.   I thought that was a pretty good idea. Later that year, I introduced  the Equality Act in partnership with many others. We laid out that  first Equality Act in the Johnson Room--the Johnson Room, which looks  out at the Supreme Court and reminds us of 1964. In 1964, when the  Civil Rights Act was passed, driven forward by President Johnson, who  came from Texas, who came from the South, and said: It is time to end  discrimination in the United States of America based on race and gender  and ethnicity. He drove that legislation through, and it has been a  foundation we haven't questioned since because we know it is right. We  know it is part of this journey of the United States of America going  back to our Declaration of Independence, going back to our  Constitution--a vision of opportunity for all and liberty for all.   We know it was imperfect, and we have worked now for almost two and a  half centuries to perfect that vision of opportunity. Senator Ted  Kennedy once said: ``The promise of America will never be fulfilled as  long as justice is denied to even one among us.'' The promise of  America--that promise of America that Thomas Jefferson so eloquently  put, in 1776--is a vision where we are all created equal, with  ``unalienable Rights . . . Life, Liberty and the pursuit of  Happiness.''   How can that vision be propelled, sustained, and promoted if, in  fact, as you pursue your life, the door is slammed shut on you, saying,  ``No. There is opportunity for that individual but not you,'' and the  door is slammed shut--liberty for that person but not you, and the door  is slammed shut.   We have come to understand that is just wrong. It is completely  incompatible with the vision that was laid out, the vision of our  Declaration and the vision of our Constitution.   In fact, in this Chamber, we start with a pledge, and we talk about  one Nation under God with liberty and justice for all. Classrooms  across the country start their day with a pledge of liberty and justice  for all, but what is liberty if the door is slammed shut? That is the  denial of liberty. That is the opposite of freedom. That is the  crushing of opportunity.   So the story of America goes forward. The fight goes forward. We had  the 1964 Civil Rights Act that was a culmination itself of decades of  work. We had the voting rights struggle during the same time period,  and the Voting Rights Act in 1965. We fought a number of battles-- battles of discrimination against those with disabilities. We fought  for workers' rights, but our LGBTQ brothers and sisters still face  discrimination all across this country. We are still in a situation  where so many doors are slammed shut.   We have had a lot of progress in the last 10 years. Ten years ago, we  had the Defense of Marriage Act, and now we don't. We had don't ask,  don't tell in the military, and now we don't. We had only three States  that recognized same-sex marriage, and now it is the law of the land as  the Supreme Court weighed in and said it is required by the vision of  our Constitution.   Discrimination in all kinds of ways is still legal in 29 States--more  than half the country. In more than half the country, you can be  married in the morning, denied service at a restaurant for lunch, fired  from your job in the afternoon, and kicked out of your apartment that  night because discrimination is still legal against LGBTQ Americans in  29 States.   LBJ gave a definition of freedom. He said: ``Freedom is the right to  be treated in every part of our national life as a person equal in  dignity and promise to all others.'' Discrimination is the opposite of  freedom.   Let freedom ring in this Chamber as we introduce the Equality Act  later this week. Let freedom ring down the hall as the House of  Representatives holds a debate in committee and on the floor in the  months to come, and when that freedom bell rings so loudly that they  pass that bill, the Equality Act in that Chamber, let them bring it  down this hallway right into the Senate; that we might debate the same  and put an end to the extraordinary, disgraceful discrimination that  still marks the lives and slams the doors shut on millions and millions  of Americans every single day.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
