 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 7301.   The COVID-19 global pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented  economic decline that has greatly affected the health and well-being of  the people I represent in St. Louis, Missouri, and millions of other  Americans.   As the Brookings Institution pointed out recently, the United States  housing crisis is not new, because even before the coronavirus  pandemic, 10 to 15 percent of households reported being housing  insecure. With unemployment at all-time levels, the housing crisis is  not just affecting those on the margins.   I want my colleagues to step back and imagine being a Black person in  St. Louis, Los Angeles, or Chicago and having to deal with all of the  problems of a global pandemic on top of the usual unbridled racism that  comes with being Black in America. It is mentally debilitating, but for  Blacks in America, just another day in the office.   I received a letter last week from Legal Services of Eastern  Missouri, which states: ``Thousands of families have gone from  stability to sudden loss of income, which threatens access to basic  needs--food, housing, healthcare--and many who were already living on  the economic margins are now in even more dire circumstances.''   In short, the past 3 months have been a disaster for many Americans.  Just when we see signs of things getting better, new statistics show an  increase in forbearance requests. But today, we can help mitigate the  harmful effects of the pandemic and help millions of Americans keep a  roof over their head by voting for this act.
