 Madam Speaker, what we are seeing at our southern border  is an undeniable crisis. An unthinkable amount of fentanyl and  fentanyl-related substances are coming across our border. There is  enough fentanyl coming across our border to kill every American seven  times over. Think about that.   This only exacerbates our existing drug problem in the United States,  like the rising use of meth in the Central Valley of California.   In October, U.S. Customs and Border Protection apprehended over  160,000 illegal immigrants attempting to cross our southern border, the  highest number of apprehensions for October on record.   I have always been supportive of immigration. After all, I am the son  of immigrants. But we have to respect and enforce our laws. By refusing  to enforce immigration laws, this administration is sending a dangerous  message that our border is open for business to cartels and encourages  people to put themselves in harm's way to cross our border.                            ____________________
