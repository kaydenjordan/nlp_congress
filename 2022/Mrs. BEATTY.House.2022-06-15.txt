 Mr. Speaker, let me first thank Chairman Green for  yielding and for his outstanding job of managing the floor today.   I also thank Chairwoman Maxine Waters for her leadership in bringing  diversity and inclusion to the forefront of the conversation in the  financial services industry. It was her vision to create the Financial  Services Committee's Subcommittee on Diversity and Inclusion, and I  have had the honor to serve as its chair since its inception.   The racial justice equity package before us today is very much the  product of the subcommittee's work over the past 3-plus years, and I am  proud to say that many of its provisions were authored by subcommittee  members. Republicans participated in the hearing, and today, when we  deflect to issues like what we are hearing, it is very alarming. There  is nothing controversial in this package or the bills I am going to  reference.   Two of my bills are included in this package, the Diversity and  Inclusion Data Accountability and Transparency Act, referred to as the  D&I DATA Act, that will direct the Office of Minority and Women  Inclusion to collect data on the financial institutions they oversee.  This will allow us to measure the progress that banks and other  financial institutions are making on diversity performance.                                time  1245    My second bill is the Expanding Opportunity for Minority Depository  Institutions Act that will codify a program at Treasury that pairs  mentor businesses with protege MDIs, giving the smaller lenders access  to things like technical assistance and contracting opportunities.   I am so pleased; in my Third Congressional District of Ohio a new MDI  has been approved.   I also note that my bill, the Ensuring Diverse Leadership Act, has  been made in order as an amendment and will be considered later. That  amendment will require the Fed to consider candidates of diverse  ethnicity and gender when filling vacancies in the Federal Reserve  Bank.
