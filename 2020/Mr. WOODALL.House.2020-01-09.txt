 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I introduced this amendment in partnership  with my friend from California (Mr. DeSaulnier), with whom I serve on  the Rules Committee and with whom I serve on the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee.   I have a poster here, Mr. Chairman, of what it looks like when the  foam is released to prevent a fuel fire in an airport hangar. If you  can't tell from where you are sitting, this is the tail of the airplane  being lifted up above the foam.   As currently drafted, I certainly agree with the ranking member that  this bill is much too expansive. But in this one limited case, it  doesn't go far enough. Our building code enforcement agencies locally,  our local fire codes, require that in order to have a hangar permitted,  it must have these fire suppression systems.   But what we found in our research, Mr. Chairman, is that more often  than not, these systems go off unintentionally. In fact, in the last 16  years, there have been 174 hangar foam releases like this one. Only 37  of those were in response to an actual incident. The other 137 were  accidental releases.   If we are concerned about these toxic chemicals, certainly having  them available for a dire firefighting need but released accidentally,  it advantages no one. In fact, even in the 37 incidents that were in  response to a fire event, none of those were in response to the fuel  fire event that the building code requires these systems be installed  to suppress.   What my amendment does, Mr. Chairman, in partnership with Mr.  DeSaulnier, is to say that when we are having these conversations about  how to restrict the use of these foams, we need to have the FAA present  in those conversations, and we need to have the local enforcement  authorities for fire and building code safety present in those  conversations to prevent these types of releases, again, that advantage  no one.   It is an opportunity to take what is a very well-intended effort to  reduce the use of these chemicals and reduce it even further.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, may I ask how much time I have remaining.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Shimkus), who is the ranking minority member.    I thank the gentleman for his question. Absolutely not.  What the amendment does is it has language, Madam Chair, that inserts  the words ``or contact with'' to make that point that firefighters are  not using the foam; they are responding after the foam has already been  used.    As Mr. Shimkus knows, when they come in contact with the foam in the  course of their duties, it is our intent to lower the probability of  any release of toxic foam on airfields. As I said, most of these  releases are accidental releases. By bringing the building code  inspectors to the table, we believe that we can reduce all instances of  release without opening the dialogue on the topics about which he  inquired.    Madam Chair, I will close by saying we may disagree  about, again, the breadth of the overall legislation, but as it comes  to this individual line-item, we are talking primarily about accidental  releases of a very important firefighting foam but one that we know we  want to reduce the usage of, the bipartisan partnership that we have  created with the support of the chairman and ranking member. I am  grateful to them for their leadership and support.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1930
