 Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, today marks a significant step forward for the American  taxpayer as we take up the bipartisan Taxpayer First Act.   The goal of this bill is simple: move the Internal Revenue Service  toward being a truly customer service-focused agency, placing a renewed  focus on treating taxpayers with respect and dignity.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Ways and Means Oversight  Subcommittee Ranking Member,  John Lewis, for cosponsoring this  legislation with me.   Together, the subcommittee held 13 formal committee events over the  past 3 years, looking at many aspects of how the IRS functions and  where improvements are clearly needed. It is in all of our interests  for taxpayers to know that the IRS is treating them fairly and with  respect.   As a CPA, Members might have heard me talk before about my concerns  with the interactions between the IRS and taxpayers. Not only have I  heard these concerns while practicing in the private sector, but in my  congressional office as well.   In handling constituent services requests through my office, I have  found many instances of just outright lack of common sense in  administering our Tax Code. As we looked at what changes needed to be  made, we focused on the relationship between taxpayers and the  government. That means a customer service experience akin to what  Americans expect from the private sector, with online services,  callback options, and improved support on the phone. To make sure  taxpayers receive a fair and impartial review of disputes, we  established the Independent Office of Appeals.   This commitment to fair and impartial treatment is the bedrock of the  faith Americans place in the IRS.    The vast majority of tax revenues come into the Treasury voluntarily.  According to the National Taxpayer Advocate, only 2 percent of all tax  revenue collected comes from IRS enforcement actions. A service- oriented, taxpayer-first IRS is key to supporting voluntary compliance.   Our bill also makes permanent the IRS Free File Program, which is not  only a win for the taxpayer, but saves the IRS time as well. This  commonsense provision is one of the many included in this legislation  that has strong bipartisan support and furthers the IRS mission to  promote electronic filing.  [[Page H3418]]    This bill also includes important taxpayer protections to ensure that  the IRS enforcement powers are fair and transparent. For example, this  bill includes safeguards to ensure that individuals and small  businesses are protected from improper seizures by the IRS.   Lastly, the bill tasks the IRS to develop and submit to Congress a  comprehensive plan to restructure the agency, ensuring that it is best  positioned to meet the needs of taxpayers today and into the future.   In short, this is the reform I promised my constituents in Kansas and  the reforms that all Americans deserve.   Mr. Speaker, I would also like to note that we have received a score  from the Congressional Budget Office, which I include in the Record.                                                      U.S. Congress,                                     Congressional Budget Office,                                     Washington, DC, April 16, 2018.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has       prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 5444, the       Taxpayer First Act.        If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be       pleased to provide them.            Sincerely,                                                        Keith Hall,                                                          Director.        Enclosure.                       H.R. 5444--Taxpayer First Act   As reported by the House Committee on Ways and Means on April 13, 2018                                   Summary         H.R. 5444 would make a number of changes to the management       and oversight of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The bill       would:        Aim to improve customer service and the taxpayer appeals       assistance process;        Restrict certain IRS enforcement activities;        Modify the agency's organization; and        Change the operations of the U.S. Tax Court.        The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT)       estimates that enacting the bill would reduce revenues by       $102 million over the 2019-2028 period, and CBO estimates       that enacting H.R. 5444 would decrease direct spending by $51       million over the same period. On net, H.R. 5444 would       increase deficits by $52 million over the period. CBO has not       completed an estimate of the bill's costs that are subject to       annual appropriation.        Because enacting the bill would affect direct spending and       revenues, pay-as-you-go procedures apply.        CBO and JCT estimate that enacting H.R. 5444 would not       increase net direct spending or significantly affect on-      budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-year       periods beginning in 2029.        JCT has reviewed H.R. 5444 and determined that it contains       no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in       the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA).                   Estimated Cost to the Federal Government         The estimated budgetary effect of H.R. 5444 is shown in the       following table. The costs of the legislation fall within       budget function 800 (general government).  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                  By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--                                                  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                                                                            2019-   2019-                                                    2018    2019    2020    2021    2022    2023    2024    2025    2026    2027    2028    2023    2028 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                   DECREASES IN REVENUES   Estimated Revenues..............................       0     -32     -57     -12      -1       *       *       *       *       *       *    -101    -102                                                                DECREASES IN DIRECT SPENDING a   Estimated Budget Authority......................       0     -16     -29      -6       *       *       *       *       *       *       *     -51     -51 Estimated Outlays...............................       0     -16     -29      -6       *       *       *       *       *       *       *     -51     -51                                           NET INCREASE IN THE DEFICIT FROM CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING AND REVENUES   Effect on the Deficit...........................       0      16      29       6       *       *       *       *       *       *       *      51      52 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Components may not sum to totals because of rounding; * = between -$500,000 and zero. a CBO expects that implementing the bill would increase spending for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that is subject to appropriation. CBO has not   completed an estimate of those costs. In 2018, the Congress appropriated $11.1 billion for IRS operations.                             Basis of Estimate         For purposes of this estimate, CBO assumes that H.R. 5444       will be enacted by the end of fiscal year 2018.                                   Revenues         Under current law, the IRS is authorized to use private       debt collection companies to locate and contact taxpayers who       owe federal taxes and to arrange for the payment of those       amounts. The bill would prohibit the use of private       collection companies when the affected taxpayer's adjusted       gross income is at or below 250 percent of the poverty level       (as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury). The       provision would take effect six months after the enactment of       the legislation and end in December 2019. JCT estimates that       the change would reduce revenues by $102 million over the       2019-2028 period. The provision also would affect direct       spending, as discussed under the heading, ``Direct       Spending.''        JCT estimates that other provisions in the bill would       reduce revenues by an insignificant amount in each year.                               Direct Spending         The bill's prohibition on using private debt collectors in       certain cases would reduce direct spending. Under current       law, the IRS enters into contracts with private companies to       collect delinquent tax liabilities owed to the federal       government. Under those contracts, the IRS may allow those       businesses to retain up to 25 percent of the amounts they       collect. Another 25 percent of the amounts collected is       available to the IRS to spend on enforcement activities. CBO       estimates that repealing the private debt collection       authority and allowing the current contracts to expire would       reduce direct spending by $51 million over the 2019-2028       period, or 50 percent of the estimated reduction in revenues       stemming from this provision.        Other provisions in the bill would have an insignificant       effect on direct spending.                         Pay-As-You-Go Considerations         The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 establishes budget-      reporting and enforcement procedures for legislation       affecting direct spending or revenues. The net changes in       outlays and revenues that are subject to those pay-as-you-go       procedures are shown in the following table.

Mandates         JCT has reviewed H.R. 5444 and determined that it contains       no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in       UMRA.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Roskam).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Young).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Kustoff).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LaHood).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, this thoughtful, bipartisan legislation will help  refocus the IRS on its taxpayer service mission.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 831,  I call up the bill (H.R. 5445) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of  1986 to improve cybersecurity and taxpayer identity protection, and  modernize the information technology of the Internal Revenue Service,  and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the  House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and submit extraneous material on H.R. 5445, currently  under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, we have a significant opportunity to improve tax  administration as we take up H.R. 5445, the bipartisan 21st Century IRS  Act. This bill seeks to move the Internal Revenue Service into the 21st  century by placing a renewed focus on modernization of the IRS and  improving taxpayer experience.   Before we talk more about this bill, I would like to take a moment to  thank the bill's original cosponsors, Representatives  Mike Bishop of  Michigan and Suzan DelBene of Washington, for their strong leadership  on this bill. I would also like to thank Representative  John Lewis of  Georgia and his staff for being such great partners in this effort.   I think this bill and the others we have put forward as part of the  larger IRS package are all the better for having worked through this  process in a bipartisan fashion. Together, we have held 13 formal  committee events over the past 3 years, hearing testimony and receiving  comments from a diverse group of taxpayers, practitioners, and advocacy  groups; and together, we have developed what we believe are bipartisan  solutions that help improve the agency and, more importantly, the  experience of all taxpayers.                                time  1430    Now turning to this bill. Over the past 2 years, the Ways and Means  Oversight Subcommittee has spent significant time, on a bipartisan  basis, focusing on IRS management of information technology and  cybersecurity. Through this process, we sought to have deeper,  [[Page H3425]]  ongoing conversations with the agency to better understand its current  and future needs and challenges.   We have also met with taxpayers and other stakeholders to understand  their experiences and concerns, and we have sought to provide strong  public accountability for the IRS' IT and cybersecurity failures where  we felt it was most needed. These collective interactions helped to  shape many of the provisions in the bill before us today.   While the IRS spends approximately $2.4 billion annually on IT, it  continues to struggle with undertaking and completing large IT  modernization efforts to update its legacy systems, some of which date  back to the 1960s. In the era of 5G and broadband Internet, it is still  hard to imagine why the IRS continues to use technology our children  wouldn't even be able to recognize.   In addition, the IRS continues to face ongoing cybersecurity threats  and fraud schemes, which seem to exploit IRS systems and steal taxpayer  information and refunds. These issues result in the waste of billions  of taxpayer dollars spent maintaining old systems.   We have also seen these outdated systems severely impact the IRS'  ability to assist taxpayers. Whether it be long processing times for  tax refunds or frustrations over the inability to reach the IRS by  phone, the IRS' underlying IT affects all aspects of the taxpayers'  experience.   For example, just yesterday we saw the magnitude of what can happen  when the IRS IT systems fail. Yesterday, starting at 2 a.m., dozens of  IRS systems integral to a successful filing season went down, leaving  the agency unable to accept tax returns on the day when they were  needed the most. While the full impact of these outages remains to be  seen, this is simply unacceptable.   The bill before us today seeks to address many of these issues. It  starts by requiring ongoing strategic IT planning, codifying and  clearly laying out the roles and responsibilities of the chief  information officer, and requiring additional oversight of two of the  largest and most problematic IRS IT systems. Doing so strengthens IRS  accountability for its IT modernization efforts, ensuring that the IRS  spends taxpayer funds in ways that produce measurable results.   This bill also encourages the IRS to more proactively work with its  State partners and the private sector to proactively combat criminals  who use taxpayer information to steal tax returns. The bill provides  the IRS with additional authority to allow the agency to work more  closely with its partners.   Finally, the bill also sets forth a new goal for the IRS to have  secure online accounts available for taxpayers and their designated  preparers by 2023. The IRS has taken far too long to provide even the  most basic of online services, and this bill ensures that the IRS will  focus on providing more robust online services for those who want them.   As we think boldly about the IRS of the future, one that is oriented  towards helping taxpayers, we should also think boldly about what a  modern IRS looks like:   One where taxpayers can easily access their information, day or  night; readily have their questions answered; and quickly resolve  issues;   One where the IRS can be trusted to adequately protect taxpayer  information; proactively combat identity theft, tax return fraud; and  readily assist taxpayers when they are victims of this fraud;   And one where the IRS meets the taxpayer where they are, whether it  be online, in person, or on the phone.   It also means having an IRS that is held accountable when  modernization efforts fall short. As we work towards the first major  overhaul of the IRS in 20 years, our goal is to ensure that these  reforms are built upon IT systems that are state-of-the-art, ones that  work for the taxpayer, not against them. These reforms are necessary  and long overdue.   I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a score that we have received  from the Congressional Budget Office.                                                      U.S. Congress,                                     Congressional Budget Office,                                     Washington, DC, April 16, 2018.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has       prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 5445, the 21st       Century IRS Act.        If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be       pleased to provide them.            Sincerely,                                                        Keith Hall,                                                          Director.        Enclosure.                      H.R. 5445--21st Century IRS Act   As reported by the House Committee on Ways and Means on April 13, 2018         H.R. 5445 aims to:        Combat identity theft and tax refund fraud at the Internal       Revenue Services (IRS);        Create an automated system to verify taxpayer information       for authorized users;        Modernize information technology (IT) systems within the       IRS; and        Expand the use of electronic information systems within the       IRS.        According to the IRS, most of the provisions in the bill       regarding fraud and identity theft would codify current IRS       policies and practices and implementing them would have no       significant cost. However, other provisions, including       modernizing the IRS's IT systems, developing a system to       provide taxpayer income information to authorized users, and       expanding the use of electronic information systems, would       have a significant cost over the 2019-2023 period. For       example, over the past five years, the IRS has spent an       average of $290 million annually on modernizing its business       systems. CBO has not completed an estimate of the cost of       implementing those provisions.        The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT)       estimates that enacting H.R. 5445 would increase revenues by       less than $500,000. Pay-as-you-go procedures apply because       the bill would affect revenues. Enacting H.R. 5445 would not       affect direct spending.        CBO and JCT estimate that enacting H.R. 5445 would not       increase net direct spending or on-budget deficits in any of       the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2029.        JCT has reviewed H.R. 5445 and determined that it contains       no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in       the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act.        The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Matthew       Pickford. The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss,       Deputy Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Estes).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Walorski).  [[Page H3427]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bishop).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I, too, want to thank, once again, the ranking member,  the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis),  [[Page H3428]]  for his hard work on this issue, and I appreciate the staff's  dedication to getting this to the floor today. This is a thoughtful,  bipartisan piece of legislation that will help move the IRS forward and  refocus the agency on the taxpayer experience, and I urge all Members  to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
