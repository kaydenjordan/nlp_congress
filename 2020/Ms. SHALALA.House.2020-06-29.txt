 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1425, the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act.   Our country is facing multiple interwoven catastrophes: a global  pandemic, an economic crisis, and a reckoning over the denial of racial  justice. Our job as Congresspeople is to help the American people  through these trying times. This bill does just that, and the time to  pass it is long overdue.   Madam Speaker, my district has the highest enrollment in the  Affordable Care Act's marketplaces, with more than 100,000 people  getting their health insurance from the ACA. My constituents are likely  to have never had health insurance before the Affordable Care Act  became law, but there still are at least another 120,000 people in  Miami-Dade County who do not have access to health insurance because my  State, the State of Florida, has refused to expand Medicaid.   This bill will take critical steps to improve and expand the ACA and  lower drug costs. It requires the Secretary of HHS to negotiate with  drug manufacturers for affordable drugs for all Americans, a power I  would have loved to have had when I was Secretary. It does exactly what  the President asked for during his campaign. This provision alone will  save Medicare $448 billion.   Other critical provisions include expanding tax credits deeper into  the middle class so that everyone can get affordable, comprehensive  health coverage.   My constituents are worried about their jobs, their loved ones, their  healthcare, and their country. Let's help them not worry about how they  will pay for critical healthcare if they get sick.
