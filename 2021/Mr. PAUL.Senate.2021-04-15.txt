 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I will  recognize an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the  American entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to  recognize a family-owned small business and southern Kentucky staple,  Hunter's Bar-B-Q of Albany, KY, as the Senate Small Business of the  Week.   On Hunter Shearer's 13th birthday, when other boys wanted skateboards  or baseball gloves, Shearer asked for a new Weber gas grill. From that  point on, he was cooking for family and friends every chance he could.  As a welder, Shearer built his own mobile grill and smoker, which he  used to cook at family and church events. He first sold barbeque to the  public in 2009, at the 127 Yard Sale. Seeing a business opportunity,  Shearer decided to pursue his boyhood dream of owning a restaurant. In  2012, Hunter began working with his father-in-law Mike Duvall to  convert an old service station into a restaurant. Sixteen months later,  Hunter's Bar-B-Q welcomed its first customers in 2014.   In 2021, Hunter's Bar-B-Q continues to serve up some of the best BBQ  in southern Kentucky, and folks drive from all over the State to enjoy  their signature hickory smoked meat and family-friendly hospitality.  Hunter's care and attention to detail are evident in every aspect of  his restaurant and catering business. At the restaurant, everything is  made from scratch, from handmade picnic tables and cooking equipment to  the smoke shack, pits, and charcoal makers. Even the charcoal is made  on site, using hickory wood from local sawmills.   Locally, Hunter's Bar-B-Q is known as ``the place with the big  flag.'' It  [[Page S1979]]  boasts a 25 by 40-foot American flag atop a 100-foot flagpole almost as  big as the store. Thanks to the smokers and pits, Hunter's Bar-B-Q can  feed around 3,000 people a day. The pulled pork and sliced shoulder are  favorites, attracting customers from all over the country. Catering is  also a large part of the business, with Hunter's Bar-B-Q catering  events as far away as Louisville.   Together with his wife, Shannon, Hunter seeks to give back to their  community in any way possible. Locally, Hunter's Bar-B-Q sponsors  Little League and high school sports teams. They regularly support  community organizations, including sponsoring Project Graduation, the  All for Benny Fundraiser, and the American Cancer Society's Relay for  Life. Additionally, Hunter's Bar-B-Q has supported numerous fundraisers  that have covered emergency and medical expenses for local members of  the community. Hunter's Bar-B-Q is a proud member of the Albany/Clinton  County Chamber of Commerce. Notably, Hunter's Bar-B-Q is one of two  caterers designated by the Lake Cumberland District Health Department  to provide food for events in Clinton County, Kentucky.   Hunter's Bar-B-Q is a remarkable example of how hard work, ingenuity,  and discipline can turn a childhood dream into reality. Small  businesses like Hunter's Bar-B-Q form the heart of communities across  Kentucky, regularly stepping up to support their communities.  Congratulations to Hunter, Shannon, and the entire team at Hunter's  Bar-B-Q. I wish them the best of luck and look forward to watching  their continued growth and success in Kentucky.                            ____________________
