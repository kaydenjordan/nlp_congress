 Madam President, I would like to go back a little further  in history than last year's warmed-over conspiracy theories that we  just heard my friend from Iowa talk about.   I so appreciated Senator Bennet's discussion of sort of the history  of voting rights and the history of this body. The American public  certainly doesn't know what cloture means. The American public really  doesn't know all that much about the filibuster either.   But go back a few decades. The filibuster was used to suppress the  vote. The filibuster was used by many people in my political party-- back when too many Democrats were on the wrong side of history and the  wrong side of civil rights--was used by southern segregationists. It  was finally overcome by some northern Republicans, with a whole bunch  of northern Democrats.  [[Page S300]]    But think about what else the filibuster has been used for. The  filibuster was used in the 1970s and 1980s to protect Big Tobacco in  Kentucky. The filibuster was used to protect Big Oil. Now, it is used  to protect Wall Street. The filibuster is used to protect big tech  companies. The filibuster is used in case after case after case to  protect big drug companies. So we know that the whole purpose of the  filibuster has been to protect the most affluent, the most privileged,  the wealthiest corporate interests in this society that just get their  way in this body day after day, week after week, month after month,  year after year.   Now, this weekend--and many referred to this--we honored Dr. Martin  Luther King. We heard a lot of words extolling his legacy. Those words  from many who are for whatever reason not supporting voting rights  today--those words sounded pretty empty.   Few people told the story of Dr. King in Memphis, why Dr. King was in  Memphis.   In early February of 1968, sanitation workers in Memphis--some of the  most abused, taken-advantage-of workers in our country; mostly Black  workers doing a dirty, difficult job in a segregated city with a very  racist mayor, who let that be known in the ensuing months--these  sanitation workers were not even given rest periods, particularly when  they were in White neighborhoods. There was nowhere to go when they  were picking up the garbage in White neighborhoods. There was no place  to go for the rest periods.    Two workers in early February, in a rainstorm, got in their garbage  trucks to protect themselves from the rain for a few minutes. The  garbage truck malfunctioned. Those two workers--underpaid, with no real  benefits and no insurance and no help for their families--those two  workers were killed.   Dr. King went to Memphis the first time to help lead that strike, to  join the striking workers. The second time he went back, that is when  he was assassinated.   Dr. King understood that the dignity of work was intertwined with  voting rights. Worker rights and voting rights always went together.  Dr. King insisted that no job is menial if it pays a decent wage. Those  sanitations workers, as I said--low wages, no benefits, no health  insurance, no retirement--none of that--and few days off.   Dr. King said:         What does it profit a man to be able to eat at an       integrated lunch counter if he doesn't earn enough money to       buy a hamburger and a cup of coffee?    He talked about the dignity of work--a term mostly popularized by  him--and he said no work is menial if it pays an adequate wage.   Until all workers have dignity in the job, Dr. King's work will  remain unfinished. We can't get there if workers cannot vote. I don't  mean just workers who put on a tie and sit at a desk; the vote should  be open to everyone--I mean all workers, whether you punch a clock,  whether you swipe a badge, whether you work for tips, whether you are  on salary, whether you are raising children, whether you are taking  care of aging parents.   We know who powers our economy. It is workers. It is not the rich  donors and the corporate contributors who fund the politicians who are  pushing for gerrymandering and voter suppression in the takeovers of  local election borders; it is workers.   I think about what we did in the Senate last week--with some  difficulty, but ultimately, it worked. We unanimously passed a  resolution honoring the custodians and the maintenance workers. We had  talked often about the police officers, some of whom gave their lives  and dozens who were injured, all who were courageous. We honored them,  as we should. We also, last week, though, passed a resolution honoring  custodial workers and maintenance workers. They get little recognition.  They work for too low pay.   Last January, 1 year ago, these workers--largely Black and Brown  workers, many of them immigrants--were forced to clean feces off the  wall, clean up after the destruction of the White supremacists, and  restore dignity to our Capitol after domestic terrorists ransacked it.  The insurrectionists destroyed; the Black and Brown workers cleaned up.  The carpenters and the maintenance workers and the painters union  members all rebuilt. Last week, we came together to honor their  service. They deserve more than words, more than gratitude.   So often, they and other working people don't have much of a voice in  this country. They don't have the high-priced lobbyists who come here.  Many of you have looked down the hall and seen, in front of Senator  McConnell's office--you have seen the lobbyists lined up, who always  seem to get what they come for. Workers don't have corporate lobbyists.  They aren't going on campaign donor retreats. But workers have the vote  or should have the vote.   The voting booth is where all of us are supposed to have an equal  voice. The voting booth is where workers are supposed to be able to go  to hold the wealthy and the powerful accountable. So it is not  surprising that politicians who pass corporate tax cuts--the same  politicians who do the handouts for the wealthiest 1 percent--don't  want lots of workers to vote.   We know whom voter suppression and election subversion is aimed at.  It is at the parents working two jobs to pay the rent and make sure  their kids have a decent meal, with no control over their work lives  and their work hours if they don't have a collective bargaining  agreement. It is students. It is people who don't get a day off. It is  seniors in nursing homes. It is home healthcare workers who care for  them. So often, these are women of color, working the graveyard shift  after coming straight from their second job.   We know whose votes these politicians want to throw out after they  are cast. We know which cities the former President went after. One is  Philadelphia, PA, Senator Casey; and Atlanta, GA, Senators Ossoff and  Warnock. What do they have in common? They are diverse places with a  whole lot of Black and Brown workers who cast ballots that the rich and  powerful don't like.    Ultimately, as others have said, it comes down to this: These  politicians want to cherry-pick their voters rather than the voters  picking their elected officials. Through gerrymandering, through voter  suppression, and through meddling in local election boards, politicians  want to pick and choose whose votes are counted.   President Trump carried my State twice by 8 points. My State, though,  is about a 53, 54, 46, 47--slightly Republican State now. For the last  decade, the Members of Congress in my State--12 Republicans and 4  Democrats in 2012, in 2014, in 2016, in 2018, and 2020. None of that  changed. Not one of those districts changed because Republicans, with  their corruption and with their skill at drawing maps, drew those maps  in ways that there were no real fair elections.   We know whose votes they don't want to count. It is the votes of the  low-paid and the overlooked; the votes of workers who power this  country yet don't have much power; the votes of people who might hold  politicians accountable, who might demand fewer tax cuts for rich  people and an increase in the child tax credit and the earned-income  tax credit, the largest tax cut for families in our Nation's history.   Ninety percent of families in Colorado, in Georgia, in New Jersey, in  Ohio, and all over this country--90 percent of families with children  get at least a $3,000 tax cut because of what we did in this body when  we said: No more Republican freight trains carrying tax cuts down the  track. We are going to give tax cuts to moderate-income people and  working families.   The votes of people who hold politicians accountable, the votes of  people who understand the dignity of work--if you say you support  American workers, you support their right to vote.   I ask my colleagues of both parties to come together to protect the  right of every American to have a voice in this country no matter who  you are, no matter where you work, no matter where you live.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to print the  following letters into the Congressional Record.
