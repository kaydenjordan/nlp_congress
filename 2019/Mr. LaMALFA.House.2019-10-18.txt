 Madam Speaker, I rise today because I would sure like  for Congress to get back to work doing what the American people really  need.   It has been more than a year since the USMCA, a trade agreement with  Canada and Mexico, was agreed to. We still haven't voted on it here in  the House, despite bipartisan support. Why? Because a new and improved  trade deal with our closest neighbors looks like it might be too much  of a win for the President for the Democratic leadership to allow.   Since the Democrats have been in control of the House, what do we  have to show for it, other than investigation after investigation? What  have we accomplished in this Chamber for the American people? Not what  we should be.   Hyperpartisan language has been injected into bills that both parties  would otherwise support. Good, bipartisan legislation on lowering  prescription drug prices that could pass committee unanimously  languished because of hyperpartisan activity, undoing the good work of  our committees and hurting Americans who are paying too much for  prescription drugs.   As my Democratic colleagues dive headfirst into finding any excuse to  impeach this President, they are leaving the American people hung out  to dry.   Let's get to work. There are countless things other than this witch  hunt.                            ____________________
