 Mr. President, I am proud to recognize Vernis  Jackson of Portsmouth as February's Granite Stater of the Month.  Jackson is the founder of the Seacoast African American Cultural Center  and played a critical role in establishing the African Burying Ground  in downtown Portsmouth.   Jackson moved to Portsmouth from her hometown of Savannah, GA, in  1963 and in 1974 joined another Granite Stater in organizing the first  chartered organization, Kwanza, for African-American women in New  Hampshire. The group worked to support young people and communities on  the Seacoast; however, Jackson felt that there was more that she could  do to elevate African-American achievements in the State.   In 2000, Jackson founded the Seacoast African American Cultural  Center, which holds concerts, educational programs, and exhibits to  help highlight the contributions, both modern and historical, that  individuals of African descent have made to communities on the Seacoast  and around the world.   Jackson, who taught for 38 years in the Portsmouth school system,  wanted to make sure that the center could be used as a resource for  students. Thanks to Jackson's leadership, the center works closely with  schools across Portsmouth, including holding art exhibits for middle  school students and providing scholarships for high school students of  color.   In 2016, the center featured an exhibit featuring dolls of color, and  last year it hosted an exhibit showcasing photos from former President  Barack Obama's White House photographer Pete Souza.   Jackson also helped lead efforts in Portsmouth to establish the  African  [[Page S889]]  Burying Ground, which commemorates the spot where 13 individuals of  African descent were buried in the 18th century.   Jackson's work to elevate the stories and culture of African  Americans on the Seacoast and around the world represents the best of  New Hampshire's efforts to create a more informed, inclusive, and just  State that is welcoming of all people and backgrounds. I am honored to  recognize her efforts and wish the center continued success.                            ____________________
