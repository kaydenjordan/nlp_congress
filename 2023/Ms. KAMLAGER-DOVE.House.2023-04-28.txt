 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  legacy of Harry Belafonte, who passed away this week at age 96. This is  a hole in the soul of goodness.   He broke barriers in Hollywood, becoming one of the first Black faces  on-screen. His unique sound led him to success in the music industry,  with classics like ``Day-O,'' ``Banana Boat,'' and ``Jamaica  Farewell.''   His artistry spoke to the soul of many Black Americans who did not  see themselves represented in music or on-screen. He touched the West  Indies diaspora of New York and lent that island sound to his top hits.   He had great success with his ``Calypso'' album when it topped the  charts for 31 weeks straight before a man known as Elvis Presley came  on the scene.   He also took up the mantle of civil rights to work alongside Dr.  Martin Luther King, Jr., Stokely Carmichael, and others to promote  racial equity. He will be remembered as a multitalented entertainer who  shattered barriers while continuing to battle racial prejudice and help  clear the way for those who came after him.   May we remember his powerful legacy and his remarkable efforts to  progress justice, equality, and civil rights.                            ____________________
