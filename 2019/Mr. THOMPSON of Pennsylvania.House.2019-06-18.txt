 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  National Pollinators Week.   It is a time when we encourage protection of pollinator species--such  as honeybees, native bees, birds, bats, and butterflies--as essential  partners of farmers and ranchers in producing food.   These pollinators are vital to keeping items like fruits, nuts, and  vegetables in our diet, and healthy pollinator populations are crucial  to the continued economic well-being of rural America and the U.S.  economy.   Worldwide, approximately 1,000 plants grown for food, beverage,  fiber, spices, and medicines need to be pollinated by animals to  produce the goods we depend upon.   The number of honeybee hives has declined from 6 million in the 1940s  to about 2.5 million today, and we need to increase these habitats.   American farmers have no better friend than the honeybee, and more  than one third of the U.S. crops require pollination, including  blueberries, chocolate, coffee, melons, peaches, pumpkins, vanilla, and  almonds.   Mr. Speaker, as one who has had a beehive in my backyard, I fully  support efforts to raise awareness and keep our pollinators buzzing for  generations to come.                            ____________________
