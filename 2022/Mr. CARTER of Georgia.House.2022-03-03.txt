 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  a great man, Mr. Jones Webb. Jones was a fellow Young Harris College  graduate with an innate love and passion for the college.   Young Harris ran in Jones' blood, as his grandfather owned a store  and rooming house for male students at the college. His father attended  Young Harris Academy and Young Harris College, where he graduated in  1916 and was the editor of the college's first yearbook.   Jones was a dedicated servant to the college and served his many  years on the Academic Affairs Committee, Executive Committee, Planned  Giving Committee, and the Properties Committee.   He spent 35 years on the Young Harris College Board of Trustees  before being elevated to emeritus trustee status in 2013. Additionally,  Jones spent time as the secretary of the board for 17 years, from 1991- 2008, and served as college counsel for several years.   He wore many hats and provided his keen insight, legal acumen, and  wise counsel to ensure the college that he loved so dearly was even  better for the next generation of students. His passion and dedication  will always be remembered.    My thoughts and prayers will remain with his family and friends  during this most difficult time.                            ____________________
