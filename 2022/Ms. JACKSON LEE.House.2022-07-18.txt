 Madam Speaker, I hold in my hand the interim report  2022 Investigative Committee on the Robb Elementary School Shooting.  Tragically, I was there within days of the shooting in May. Tragically,  I got to listen to parents whose children bled out. All of us know the  story of a little girl who smeared blood on herself just to have them  think she was dead.   Part of what this report says is at Robb Elementary School, law  enforcement responders failed to adhere to their active shooter  training, and they failed to prioritize saving the innocent victims  over their own safety. There was no command post, as this report says,  and there was no point of command.   But really I think what is important is that we are due for Federal  involvement, as I have called. It is time now to give answers to our  community. And let me simply say the words that struck me in this  executive summary: We recognize that the impact of this tragedy is felt  more profoundly by the people of Uvalde in ways we cannot fully  comprehend. Their children are dead, and we have no answers, and there  are people who failed to save the children's lives.   I call for a congressional investigation and hearings so that we can  give them solutions and not just concerns. They need it, because their  children's lives are lost.                            ____________________
