 Madam Speaker, today I proudly rise in  support of the Equality Act.  [[Page H658]]    Today, I am the voice of so many people, like my constituent, Chanel;  my friend, James; my sister, Danielle and her fiance, Marlena; my  staffer, Kristina and her partner, Vivian; and all of my friends back  home on the front lines with Georgia Equality.   For far too long, the inherent rights of LGBTQ people have hung in  the balance. I am in Congress to ensure that everyone can share in the  promise of America, no matter who they love or how they identify.   LGBTQ people have lived in fear of punishment and retaliation for far  too long. The right to exist in this country is not a privilege, but an  inalienable right.   I have the great honor of representing Atlanta, a city vibrant with a  long history of LGBTQ-plus pride. To my LGBTQ-plus constituents, know  that it is my honor to represent you. I hear you. I see you. I stand  with you. The promise of America excludes no one.
