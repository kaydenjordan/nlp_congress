The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Mitchell) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.  [[Page H7279]]    The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.    Mr. Chairman, our Nation faces a dire fiscal situation.  We have now reached our debt ceiling and are determining how to control  spending while funding necessary programs.   The path we are on is not sustainable. It jeopardizes our future, our  children's future, and our national security. We must get our fiscal  house in order and take this problem seriously.   Paying lip service to the problem will not solve it. We must be  responsible now before it is too late. The reality is that we can make  cuts to the size and cost of our Federal Government without impacting  essential programs. In fact, the right cuts will allow our economy to  grow by stopping overeager bureaucrats who seem to believe everything  should be regulated until it no longer functions.   We in Congress need to be focused on growing and protecting Main  Street, not protecting an already bloated Federal Government and  bureaucracy. The amendment I propose today is simple. It makes a cut to  the bureaucracy of several offices of division F relating to Labor,  Health and Human Services. My amendment cuts funds from the same  Department of Labor that gave us the overtime rule and the persuader  rule. This is an agency of bureaucrats that wishes to legislate through  regulation.   My amendment puts forth a modest 10 percent reduction of  administrative expenses, which would save taxpayers $351 million  annually on Labor and HHS alone. Let me restate that: We can actually  save $351 million annually by just cutting administrative costs.   We, in fact, may well find the money to put the additional $10  million into youth employment services if we cut our bureaucracy.   I come from a world of privacy business, so I understand that fiscal  responsibility starts on a small scale and requires commitment to  changing the trend. My amendment, when combined with similar measures  across all appropriations, will yield big savings to taxpayers, and  will do so without cutting projects or essential programs that we hold  dear.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to seriously consider my amendment as  we work to secure our fiscal future, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate the efforts of the chairman,  and, in fact, all of the appropriations efforts. In fact, this week we  will pass a full set of appropriations bills out of the House to send  to the Senate--something that has not happened here in a very long  time, although I am new.   The reality is that many of the cuts we have talked about thus far  are cuts to the increases many agencies requested. I worked in the  private sector where a cut meant you really spent less real dollars.   Now, I believe there are a number of programs we need to be very  careful of. Item by item would be the best way, but at some point in  time, we need to draw a line. We can't continue spending what we are  spending, and I hope that we are going to be fiscally responsible down  the road.   So I appreciate the chairman's comments. I worked very carefully with  him, and, yes, I agree that entitlement reform is a huge issue and we  have got to take it on. We need to amend the Budget Control Act. There  are so many things we need to accomplish.   I am going to support our appropriations package and continue to try  and work to tweak those so we actually save money, and we are  efficient, and we save programs that we hold dear that are productive.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment to  increase funding for current technical education programs. For some  people, pursuing their desired career means securing a college degree.   In my 30-year career in workforce education, I have seen firsthand  this  [[Page H7296]]  isn't the right path for everyone. Unfortunately, too often, success  has been defined by the 4-year-or-bust model, leaving students who  would be better served by current technical education behind, out in  the cold, and leaving job creators unable to find qualified workers for  in-demand jobs.                                time  2000    Democrats and Republicans agree that the skills gap is a serious  problem challenging our workforce. More importantly, my constituents,  schools, and employers throughout my district recognize this is a  crisis that needs to be addressed.   Mr. Chairman, I urge passage of the amendment.
