 Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 48,  S.J. Res. 14, the methane CRA.    Mr. President, at the start of the year, the Senate  Democrats pledged that one of our top priorities would be tackling  climate change. I directed all of our incoming committee chairs to hold  hearings and prepare legislation on the climate crisis. I promised that  any infrastructure bill would be green and focused on creating the  green jobs of the future. Both of these efforts, I am happy to report,  are well under way.   And, today, as we approach the 100-day mark of this new Congress, the  Senate will take the first major step in combating climate change on  the Senate floor, by reinstating safeguards against methane emissions.   Specifically, today's vote will use the Congressional Review Act to  reimpose commonsense regulations against methane leaks from the oil and  gas industry, from production and processing to transmission and  storage.   And let me note that this would be the first time that the Senate  Democratic majority has used the Congressional Review Act. It is no  mistake that we have chosen to use the law first on the subject of  climate change.    Under this Democratic majority, the Senate will be a place where we  take decisive, ambitious, and effective action against climate change.  And this CRA, the reinstatement of the rule dealing with methane  emissions, will be the most significant act that the  [[Page S2258]]  Senate has taken on climate change in more than a decade--and maybe  several decades. This measure will help us address the climate crisis  in a very serious way.   Methane doesn't get as much attention as CO2, carbon  dioxide, but it packs a bigger punch. Over 20 years, a ton of methane  warms the atmosphere 86 times more than carbon dioxide. Thankfully,  methane degrades faster in our atmosphere, and curbing methane  emissions is relatively cheap.   So when it comes to global warming, tackling methane delivers a huge  bang for your buck. Even a little bit of methane reduction goes a long  way, and it moves far more quickly than carbon dioxide reduction. So as  we move on this bill, which will have its effect on global warming  within a year, it gives us some time, although we don't have much, to  deal with the longer term and even more difficult issues of carbon  dioxide.   That is why President Obama put the rules in place nearly 6 years  ago. And at the time, amazingly enough, even the oil and gas industry  welcomed them. Industry doesn't want leaks in their pipelines and  production any more than we do.   But President Trump, inexplicably, did away with these safeguards  last September. It seems he does these things out of pique, mindlessly  opposing something just because his predecessor, Barack Obama, did it.  It is very possible that the President didn't even understand what he  was doing. But he so often acted out of anger and vindictiveness, not  out of what was good for the country, that he ended up doing this.   I am greatly looking forward to righting that wrong today, hopefully,  in a bipartisan fashion. We have at least one Republican Senator who  has joined us, and I hope that many more will follow suit. If the  leaders of the oil and gas industry are for this, how could our  Republican friends not vote for it? I won't speculate on the reasons,  but none of them are good.   I want to commend my colleagues who have been leaders on this issue:  Senator Heinrich, Senator King, Senator Markey. President Biden has  challenged the United States to cut its greenhouse gas emissions in  half by 2030. The best way to achieve this ambitious goal is through  bold action by this Congress, through legislation to reduce greenhouse  pollution while creating millions of jobs and economic prosperity in  the new clean energy economy.   This is the first and a large step in that direction. We have many  more steps we must take, of course. The Senate begins the important  work of dealing with the climate crisis today by passing these very,  very significant, commonsense rules on methane.                            American Families Plan    Mr. President, now on a different matter, this morning, President  Biden unveiled landmark legislation designed to give American families  a better chance to succeed in the 21st century economy, combining  investments in education, childcare, and workforce training.   The American Families Plan, as it is called, makes exactly the types  of investment our country should have been making for a very long time.  In many of these areas, the United States has lagged well behind other  developed countries. Governments throughout Europe dedicate a  significantly higher portion of their GDP to workforce retraining and  offer more flexible family leave policies.   Some say these kinds of policies are not infrastructure, but they  very much are. Childcare is a necessity in the 21st century, and a lack  of access to childcare can be a throttle on future economic growth  because it affects millions of American families.   As technology and automation replace jobs in certain sectors of the  economy, workforce training is a must. Giving our children a head start  earlier in life with pre-K education has benefits that span a child's  entire life and so will affect our country positively for decades to  come, economically, socially, and in renewing the American spirit,  which is so important to our future.   These things are just as important. The kinds of policies that deal  with human infrastructure are just as important as roads and bridges,  which, of course, are, no doubt, important in their own right. This is  not an either/or--human infrastructure or brick-and-mortar structure.  We must say yes to both. We don't want to choose one versus the other.  That is like choosing between children, both of whom we love.   In the modern world, we need both infrastructure that matches a 21st  century economy and human infrastructure that allows our workers and  families to succeed in it. So I applaud President Biden for putting  this plan together. It is just the right approach.   I would add one final comment here. All of our Republican  colleagues--every single one--regrettably, chose to oppose the American  Rescue Plan, despite the fact that a majority of Republican voters  approved of the legislation. There seems to be a huge dichotomy between  Republicans in Washington and Republicans in the rest of the country  who approve of many of the policies in President Biden's plans.   Republicans in the rest of the country approved of the checks and  investing in vaccines, and they approve of investing in infrastructure.  I suspect many of these policies in the American Families Plan will get  high marks as well. Childcare is popular. Early pre-K is popular. Early  school-hood training is popular. Free community college is popular. The  list goes on.   Will our Republican colleagues start to listen to their constituents  as well as the rest of the country, or are they still the party of  Donald Trump, a party that opposes the other side at all costs? That is  no good for America; that is no good for bipartisanship; and it is not  even good for the Republican Party's future                                First 100 Days    Mr. President, now, tonight President Biden will address a joint  session of Congress to mark the progress of our first 100 days and talk  about where we, as a country, still need to go. I expect President  Biden, unlike his predecessor, will lay out the facts and appeal to our  better angels. That is what he has been doing over these past 100 days:  restoring respective, truthful, and responsive government.   Almost as important is what President Biden is not doing. President  Biden is not constantly stoking division, outrage, and racial animus.  He doesn't fan the flames of every single culture war. He doesn't seek  to personally dominate every single news cycle. He doesn't insult,  degrade, or constantly lie. And it matters.   Newspapers are littered with firsthand accounts of Americans who feel  they can finally sleep at night without worrying about what new  scandal, outrage, or unhinged tweet the next morning would bring. As  one Republican operative put it recently, ``Now there's a sense of  relief. Imagine there's a car alarm that's been going off for a long  time and suddenly it's quiet.''   Politics is an important part of American life, but it is not meant  to be all-consuming. It is not supposed to keep average citizens up at  night. Politics is supposed to be where we come together to solve our  differences amicably, not an arena of endless partisan warfare or a  bottomless pit of chaos.   So as President Biden prepares to address the Nation tonight, it is  worth noting that, as much as we have accomplished in the first 100  days, the contrast in style, tone, and effectiveness between President  Biden and President Trump is important too.   As we seek to repair the wounds left by January 6, as we seek to  restore faith in government and in our democracy, it is important--so  important--to have political leaders who act with dignity, honor, and  have fidelity to the truth.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, now, as we approach the 100-day mark of  this new Congress, the Senate is about to take its first major step in  fighting climate change. In a moment, the Senate will vote on  reinstating commonsense rules to reduce methane emissions. It will be  the first time the Senate Democratic majority has used the  Congressional Review Act, and it is no mistake that we have chosen to  use the law first and foremost on the subject of climate change.   Under this Democratic majority, the Senate will be a place where we  take decisive, ambitious, and effective action against climate change.  Of course, reducing methane emissions is not the only thing we need to  do to fight climate change, but it is a very significant and large  first step.   Methane accounts for roughly a quarter of all the human-caused global  warming that has transpired since the Industrial Revolution. Restoring  these methane-reducing rules will be one of the most significant  climate actions that the Senate has taken in more than a decade.   I urge my colleagues to vote yes and commend Senators Heinrich, King,  and Markey for their great work on this issue.   I ask for the yeas and nays.
