 Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me thank the gentleman from  Illinois for co-hosting this Special Order hour with the gentlewoman  from Missouri. I thank Representative Cori Bush as well for  spearheading the ERA and for working toward this fight for all of us.   I rise today to observe Women's History Month and to reiterate this  year's Black History Month theme of Black Resistance.   Since we last celebrated Black History Month and Women's History  Month, Ketanji Brown Jackson has become the first Black woman on the  Supreme Court; Beyonce claimed the record for most Grammys won in a  lifetime; Serena Williams retired as one of the most accomplished  athletes of all time; Congresswoman Summer Lee became the first Black  woman to represent Pennsylvania in Congress; and Jennifer McClellan  became the first Black Congresswoman from Virginia.                                time  2015    In my home of Charlotte, North Carolina, Vi Lyles made history as  both the longest serving woman and the longest serving Black mayor in  our city's history.   In Winston-Salem, North Carolina, my friend and mentor, the late  Annie Brown Kennedy, the first Black woman to serve in the North  Carolina General Assembly, passed away at the age of 98 after a long  and storied career.   These women join the legacy of other women we are celebrating here  today, the women who helped lead the movement for the adoption of the  equal rights amendment.   The equal rights amendment is still absolutely necessary because,  according to the Constitution, we are not equal. Just look at the Dobbs  decision. Look at all of the legislation from the State to the Federal  level that aims, intentionally or not, to tell women what they can do  with their own bodies.   Look at the maternal health crisis in America. Even as science,  technology, and healthcare make amazing advances, the number of women  dying due to childbirth is going in the wrong direction, and Black  women have mortality rates that are three times that.   As Women's History Month comes to an end, we must continue to teach  the history of women--Black women, indigenous women, LGBTQ women, and  women of color--from the halls of our campuses to the Halls of Congress  because if you learn women's history, you learn very quickly how far we  have come and how much further we have to go.   Each of us have a role in this history. If you learn this history,  teach it. If you live this history, make it.   Join me and join us, join the CBC and all of my colleagues in  renewing the push for the equal rights amendment and equality for women  not only in the United States but across the world.
