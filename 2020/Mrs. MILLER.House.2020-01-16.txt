 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the hard work of  Patricia Price, who has devoted the past 42 years to Big Brothers Big  Sisters of the Tri-State, an organization in Huntington, West Virginia,  which provides volunteer mentors for children in adverse living  situations.   Patti came to Big Brothers Big Sisters in 1978 fresh out of graduate  school with a servant's heart. She started as a case worker, eventually  rising to become the executive director. Throughout her career she  committed herself to developing a consistent, encouraging, and safe  environment for underprivileged children in our region.   Under her leadership, Patti organized hundreds of volunteers and  staff, and created countless successful fundraising initiatives.  Through these efforts, Big Brothers Big Sisters of the Tri-State has  grown to provide mentorship for over 160 children every year.   As she moves into the next phase of her life, Patti leaves behind a  legacy of  [[Page H316]]  compassion, selflessness, and perseverance. Patti Price has changed the  lives of thousands, and we are all so grateful for her work.                            ____________________
