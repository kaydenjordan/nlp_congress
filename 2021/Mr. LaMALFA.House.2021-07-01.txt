 Mr. Speaker, here we go again. The laughable attempt by  senior White House officials to cast Republicans as those that want to  defund the police is completely ridiculous.   They put up this fig leaf concept because we didn't support an  irresponsible, nearly $2 trillion spending package, which had a tiny  portion of it--$350 million out of $2 trillion--possibly to be able to  go for local government to decide its own use for police. That is what  the whole premise is on. So somehow, Republicans are defunding the  police.   Well, I think that is the mantra we have seen come from the  Democrats, some in this Chamber and many at the local government level.   In New York, for example, one Member from this Chamber said:  ``Defunding police means defunding police.'' New York City proceeded to  cut $1 billion from the NYPD.   In Minneapolis, another Member said that it is time to ``reimagine  public safety in Minneapolis.'' They went on to cut over $6 million.  But after seeing the error of their ways, they are now restoring the  money.   In Los Angeles, for example, there were calls for a cut of $100  million, and now they are restoring that. Amazing.                            ____________________
