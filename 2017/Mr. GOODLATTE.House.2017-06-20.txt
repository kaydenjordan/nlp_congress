 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 1393) to limit the authority of States to tax certain  income of employees for employment duties performed in other States.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1393          Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Mobile Workforce State       Income Tax Simplification Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. LIMITATIONS ON STATE WITHHOLDING AND TAXATION OF                     EMPLOYEE INCOME.         (a) In General.--No part of the wages or other remuneration       earned by an employee who performs employment duties in more       than one State shall be subject to income tax in any State       other than--        (1) the State of the employee's residence; and        (2) the State within which the employee is present and       performing employment duties for more than 30 days during the       calendar year in which the wages or other remuneration is       earned.        (b) Wages or Other Remuneration.--Wages or other       remuneration earned in any calendar year shall not be subject       to State income tax withholding and reporting requirements       unless the employee is subject to income tax in such State       under subsection (a). Income tax withholding and reporting       requirements under subsection (a)(2) shall apply to wages or       other remuneration earned as of the commencement date of       employment duties in the State during the calendar year.        (c) Operating Rules.--For purposes of determining penalties       related to an employer's State income tax withholding and       reporting requirements--        (1) an employer may rely on an employee's annual       determination of the time expected to be spent by such       employee in the States in which the employee will perform       duties absent--        (A) the employer's actual knowledge of fraud by the       employee in making the determination; or        (B) collusion between the employer and the employee to       evade tax;        (2) except as provided in paragraph (3), if records are       maintained by an employer in the regular course of business       that record the location of an employee, such records shall       not preclude an employer's ability to rely on an employee's       determination under paragraph (1); and        (3) notwithstanding paragraph (2), if an employer, at its       sole discretion, maintains a time and attendance system that       tracks where the employee performs duties on a daily basis,       data from the time and attendance system shall be used       instead of the employee's determination under paragraph (1).        (d) Definitions and Special Rules.--For purposes of this       Act:        (1) Day.--        (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), an employee is       considered present and performing employment duties within a       State for a day if the employee performs more of the       employee's employment duties within such State than in any       other State during a day.        (B) If an employee performs employment duties in a resident       State and in only one nonresident State during one day, such       employee shall be considered to have performed more of the       employee's employment duties in the nonresident State than in       the resident State for such day.        (C) For purposes of this paragraph, the portion of the day       during which the employee is in transit shall not be       considered in determining the location of an employee's       performance of employment duties.        (2) Employee.--The term ``employee'' has the same meaning       given to it by the State in which the employment duties are       performed, except that the term ``employee'' shall not       include a professional athlete, professional entertainer,       qualified production employee, or certain public figures.        (3) Professional athlete.--The term ``professional       athlete'' means a person who performs services in a       professional athletic event, provided that the wages or other       remuneration are paid to such person for performing services       in his or her capacity as a professional athlete.        (4) Professional entertainer.--The term ``professional       entertainer'' means a person of prominence who performs       services in the professional performing arts for wages or       other remuneration on a per-event basis, provided that the       wages or other remuneration are paid to such person for       performing services in his or her capacity as a professional       entertainer.        (5) Qualified production employee.--The term ``qualified       production employee'' means a person who performs production       services of any nature directly in connection with a State       qualified, certified or approved film, television or other       commercial video production for wages or other remuneration,       provided that the wages or other remuneration paid to such       person are qualified production costs or expenditures under       such State's qualified, certified or approved film incentive       program, and that such wages or other remuneration must be       subject to withholding under such film incentive program as a       condition to treating such wages or other remuneration as a       qualified production cost or expenditure.        (6) Certain public figures.--The term ``certain public       figures'' means persons of prominence who perform services       for wages or other remuneration on a per-event basis,       provided that the wages or other remuneration are paid to       such person for services provided at a discrete event, in the       nature of a speech, public appearance, or similar event.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 1393, currently  under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, the Mobile Workforce State Income Tax Simplification  Act provides a clear, uniform framework for when States may tax  nonresident employees who travel to the taxing State to perform work.  In particular, this bill prevents States from imposing income tax  compliance burdens on nonresidents who work in a foreign State for 30  days or fewer in a year.   The State tax laws that determine when a nonresident must pay a  foreign State's income tax and when employers must withhold this tax  are numerous and varied. Some States tax income earned within their  borders by nonresidents even if the employee only works in the State  for just 1 day.   These complicated rules impact everyone who travels for work and many  industries. As just one example, the Judiciary Committee heard  testimony in 2015 that the patchwork of State laws resulted in a  manufacturing company issuing 50 W-2s to a single employee for a single  year. The company executive also noted, regarding the compliance  burden, that ``many of our affected employees make less than $50,000  per year and have limited resources to seek professional advice.''   States generally allow a credit for income taxes paid to another  State; however, it is not always dollar for dollar when local taxes are  factored in. Credits also do not relieve workers of substantial  paperwork burdens.   There are substantial burdens on employers as well. The committee  heard  [[Page H4948]]  testimony in 2014 that businesses, including small businesses, that  operate interstate are subject to significant regulatory burdens with  regard to compliance with nonresident State income tax withholding  laws. These burdens distract from productive activity and job creation.   Nevertheless, some object that the States will lose revenue if the  bill is enacted. However, an analysis from Ernst & Young found that the  bill's revenue impact is minimal. There is little motive for fraud and  gaming because the amount of money at issue, taxes on less than 30  days' wages, is minimal.   Also, the income tax generally has to be paid; the question is merely  to whom. Nor does this bill violate federalism principles. On the  contrary, it is an exercise of Congress' Commerce Clause authority in  precisely the situation for which it was intended.   The Supreme Court has explained that the Commerce Clause was informed  by structural concerns about the effects of State regulation on the  national economy. Under the Articles of Confederation, State taxes and  duties hindered and suppressed interstate commerce. The Framers  intended the Commerce Clause as a cure for these structural ills. This  bill fits squarely within this authority by bringing uniformity to  cases of de minimis presence by interstate workers in order to reduce  compliance costs.   Last year's version of the bill passed the House on suspension by  voice vote. This year's version is nearly identical, with two changes:   The professional entertainer exemption is narrowed from ``a person  who performs services'' to ``a person of prominence who performs  services'' in order to ensure that other entertainers retain the  benefit of the bill's protections.   Second, the list of exclusions is expanded to cover film production  employees if associated tax credits for instate productions are  contingent on withholding film production wages earned in the State.  This avoids disruption in such arrangements.   I commend the bill's lead sponsors, Representatives Bishop and  Johnson, and thank all of the bill's cosponsors.   Madam Speaker, I urge the bill's passage, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to respond to  the gentleman from New York.   I would like to point out that those revenues that might flow to New  York because of their onerous system of imposing taxation for as little  as one day's work in New York redounds to the benefit of the other 49  States, who would then receive that tax benefit, as it properly should.   Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Bishop), the lead sponsor of the legislation.    Madam Speaker, I am the only speaker remaining and  prepared to close, so I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   This bill enjoys broad bipartisan support. It has 57 cosponsors from  both sides of the aisle. This bill will minimize compliance burdens on  both workers and employers so they can get back to being productive,  creating and performing jobs. We have received letters of support from  hundreds of entities across the employment spectrum.   But this bill is not just about business; it is about individuals.  One businessman told the Judiciary Committee that the compliance  burdens from the patchwork of State laws falls on his employees, who  make less than $50,000 per year and have limited resources to seek  professional advice.   It has been questioned whether there will be revenue lost to the  States. Analysis shows the impact is minimal, affecting mainly the  allocation of revenues, not the overall size of the tax revenue pot.   Similarly, concerns about tax evasion are unfounded. Unlike in the  general income tax context, there is little motive here for fraud or  gaming.   The amount of money at issue, taxes on less than 30 days' wages, is  minimal. More importantly, except in nine States, the employee will  have to pay the tax, in any event, to the employee's home State, so the  only savings would be from minor rate differentials between the two  jurisdictions.   This legislation is a great example of Congress working in a  bipartisan way to relieve burdens on hardworking Americans.   I want to thank the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bishop) and the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson) for their bipartisan work on this  legislation. I urge all of our colleagues to support the bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.
