 Madam President, in 2002, 18 years ago, Senator Tom  Daschle raised a similar resolution--a resolution on the importance of  the Pledge of Allegiance. With unanimous support in the U.S. Senate, it  passed on the floor uneventfully and without amendment. This body can  choose to do the same today--to reaffirm our support for the Pledge of  Allegiance.   I also rise to honor a Hoosier who understood the innate value of the  Pledge of Allegiance to civic education.   In 1969, Red Skelton, an American comedian and entertainer who was  well known for his program on CBS, ``The Red Skelton Hour,'' wrote a  speech on the importance of the pledge. In reflecting on his time in  Vincennes, IN, he wanted to talk about how important the value  instilled by it is still applicable today. After the performance of his  speech, CBS received 200,000 requests for copies. His speech would go  on to be sold as a single by Columbia Records and performed at the  White House. I think it would be an honor to repeat this, and I will do  so after yielding the floor to my colleague, Senator Scott from  Florida.    Madam President, I thank Senator Scott. The emphasis on  faith, family, community, freedom, liberty, and equal opportunity is  what makes this country great. We can never forget it, for it is  embedded in the Pledge of Allegiance.   I return now to reading the point of view from Red Skelton. This is  in terms of his recollection when he was a kid back in Vincennes, IN.   He begins:         I heard, I think, one of the most outstanding speeches I       have ever heard in my life. I think it compares with the       ``Sermon on the Mount,'' Lincoln's ``Gettysburg Address,''       and Socrates' speech to the students.        We had just finished reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, and       he [Mr. Laswell, the principal of Vincennes High School]       called us all together, and he says, ``Uh, boys and girls, I       have been listening to you recite the Pledge of Allegiance       all semester, and it seems that it has become monotonous to       you. Or, could it be, you do not understand the meaning of       each word? If I may, I would like to recite the pledge, and       give you a definition for each word.''    I saw this many years ago myself, and when I looked at the video  again, I  [[Page S5847]]  thought it would behoove everyone to listen to his own words back when  he did it on CBS.         I--Me; an individual, a committee of one.        Pledge--Dedicate all of my worldly goods to give without       self-pity.        Allegiance--My love and my devotion.        To the Flag--Our standard. ``Old Glory''; a symbol of       courage. And wherever she waves, there is respect, because       your loyalty has given her a dignity that shouts ``Freedom is       everybody's job.''        of the United--That means we have all come together.        States--Individual communities that have united into 48       great states; 48 individual communities with pride and       dignity and purpose; all divided by imaginary boundaries, yet       united to a common cause, and that's love of country--        Of America.        And to the Republic--A Republic: A sovereign state in which       power is invested into the representatives chosen by the       people to govern; and the government is the people, and it's       from the people to the leaders, not from the leaders to the       people.        For which it stands.        One Nation--Meaning ``so blessed by God.''        [Under God]        Indivisible--Incapable of being divided.        With liberty--Which is freedom; the right of power for one       to live his [or her] own life without fears, threats, or any       sort of retaliation.        And Justice--The principle and qualities of dealing fairly       with others.        For All--That means, boys and girls, it's as much your       country as it is mine.    Afterward, Mr. Laswell asked his students to recite the Pledge of  Allegiance together, with a newfound appreciation and reinvigoration  for the words: ``I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States  of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation,  indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.''   Mr. Skelton concluded his speech by saying:         Since I was a small boy, two States have been added to our       country, and two words have been added to the Pledge of       Allegiance: ``Under God.'' Wouldn't it be a pity if someone       said, ``That is a prayer''--and that be eliminated from our       schools, too?    Just as those students that day, Mr. Red Skelton included,  recommitted to the meaning of the words of the Pledge of Allegiance, I  call upon the U.S. Senate to recommit to the meaning of these words.   There are times today that the words of the pledge are tossed around  without too much care. Other times, they are altered to remove what  today is deemed offensive or antiquated, but Americans should not  misuse or abuse the Pledge of Allegiance. The Pledge is meant to remind  Americans of our guiding principles and inspire adherence to those  ideas which make our country great: equality under the law and  recognized rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   Madam President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous  consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 715,  submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to,  the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    I yield the floor.                            ____________________
