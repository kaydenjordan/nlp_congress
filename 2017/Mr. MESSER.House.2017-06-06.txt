 Mr. Speaker, on the 50th anniversary of the reunification  of Jerusalem and on behalf of Hoosiers from Indiana's Sixth  Congressional District, I rise today to send my prayers and best wishes  to the Jewish state.   It is our hope that the special relationship between America and  Israel continues to be strengthened and to grow. Israel is our most  important friend in that region of the world and among America's  strongest allies anywhere in the world. On this anniversary, let it be  reaffirmed that Indiana and America stand with Israel.   The Holy City is a place of prayer for all people, and this day  provides us with an opportunity to pray for the Jewish state. May it  remain a beacon of light, representing democracy and freedom, and may  peace and prosperity reign for its people.   The eternal capital of the State of Israel, Jerusalem, is also a seat  of parliament; and from one representative body to another, we say  ``Shalom'' and ``God bless.'' Our prayers are with Israel today,  tomorrow, and always.                            ____________________
