 Madam Speaker, I rise in full support of the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020.   First, I thank Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Thornberry, the  committee staff, and others who worked tirelessly on this bill. It is a  good one, and I urge support from all.   As chairman of the Subcommittee on Readiness, I worked closely with  Members on and off the committee to ensure that this bill addressed  three priority areas.   First, the NDAA requires the Department of Defense to plan for and  respond to the threat that climate change poses to military  installations and military operations by developing installation master  plans that fully assess current and future climate vulnerabilities and  updating building standards for military construction to promote energy  conservation, climate and cyber resiliency, among many other important  aspects.  [[Page H10085]]    Second, the bill includes a number of provisions aimed at addressing  problems associated with the management and oversight of military  family housing programs, including that military services must  establish a tenants' bill of rights for our military family housing.   Third, the bill authorizes additional funding and includes bipartisan  provisions to mitigate contaminated drinking water for households and  agriculture resulting from PFAS and fluorinated compounds that have  been used on military installations.   I am also pleased that there is a 3.1 percent pay raise for our  troops and also that the bill includes provisions from my bill, H.R.  2617, the OATH Act, the Occupational and Environmental Transparency  Health Act, which requires the DOD input any occupational environmental  hazard that troops may have been exposed to.   Finally, a couple of things that are positive, but there are also  some concerns. The bill does not delay the deployment of the new low- yield nuclear warheads for submarines, which I believe is not a good  idea at all for our boomers. Secondly, the bill does not deal with the  funding for our military programs and for the military that had been  ripped off for the wall.                                time  1615
