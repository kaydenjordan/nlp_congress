 Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary  Committee Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, I want to thank Erica  Songer for her service in the Senate and in particular for her service  as the subcommittee's minority chief counsel. The Intellectual Property  Subcommittee has been the most active subcommittee's in the Senate, in  no small part due to Erica's work. We have worked in a bipartisan  fashion to modernize our intellectual property system through forward- looking legislative reforms. Across numerous hearings on various  aspects of intellectual property law, as well as several bills, Erica  has been a vital resource to my team and me.   During this session, Erica has served the subcommittee in countless  ways. From promoting women in the intellectual property field to  reforming our  [[Page S5781]]  Nation's patent eligibility laws, Erica has been an innovator and go- getter. There were countless times throughout this Congress when the  subcommittee's work would get tough and it appeared we were at an  insurmountable impasse. Each time, Erica found a way forward and kept  us moving towards our shared goals: a stronger intellectual property  system.   While I am sad that the Senate and the subcommittee will be losing a  staffer as valuable as Erica, I am grateful for her public service  these past 4 years. Erica has shown that she will excel at whatever she  commits to, whether graduating from Harvard Law School or making  partner at one of the largest law firms in the world or serving as the  chief counsel to my good friend Chris Coons--and I am excited for her  as she steps into a new role and begins a new adventure.                            ____________________
