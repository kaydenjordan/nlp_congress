 Mr. Speaker, I rise to condemn action taken by the  People's Republic of China, or PRC, in the Ladakh region of India that  led to deadly clashes between the two countries on June 15.   Since the truce in 1962, the PRC and India have been divided by a  2,100-mile-long Line of Actual Control. In the months leading up to  this clash, the PRC military reportedly amassed about 5,000 soldiers  along this boundary, and that clearly meant to redraw longstanding  settled borders by force and aggression.   A skirmish, unsurprisingly, broke out on June 15 as a direct result  of these troop movements, leaving at least 20 Indian soldiers and an  unconfirmed number of Chinese soldiers dead.   This intentional encroachment and escalatory tactics used by the PRC  are consistent with other provocative actions its forces have taken  throughout South and Southeast Asia. To counter this aggression, I am  glad that the House of Representatives passed an amendment that I  cosponsored with Congressman Krishnamoorthi that calls on China to  cease its military aggression and urges immediate diplomatic action to  prevent any further escalation of conflict.   I will continue to work with my colleagues here in Congress to find  ways to help bolster our vital relationship with India.                            ____________________
