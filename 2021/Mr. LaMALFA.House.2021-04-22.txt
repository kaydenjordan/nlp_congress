 Mr. Speaker, yet another blatant political power grab is  underway on the heels of H.R. 1, nationalizing all that is wrong with  our elections, the packing of the Supreme Court, and now we have H.R.  51, an unconstitutional bill to create a State of Washington, D.C.   The Founders were very clear and specific to leave our District out  of the coercion and the tentacles of a State trying to influence it.   No. This is yet another naked power grab to ensure two new Democratic  Senators in a 90 percent Democrat district. That is the result they are  trying to get. This new State would be 1/17th the size of Rhode Island  and about the same population as Fresno, California.   In 1847, the Virginia Retrocession Act took some of the excess land  that they weren't using and put it back into Virginia. We can do the  same thing with a bill I am coauthoring, taking the unneeded part and  putting it back into Maryland, instead of trying to create a State  against the Constitution.   This is a power grab that must be stopped. It is unconstitutional,  and it goes against the grain of what our Founders had in mind to have  separation.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I am amazed at the smoke and mirrors and  fog of obfuscation surrounding the debate on this bill.   What Republicans are doing here today is defending the Constitution  and what was put in place by the Founders, that Washington, D.C., the  District, would not be part of a State, where it could be coerced or  leveraged by a State to get things from it.   I have just heard the last few minutes solutions offered to my  colleagues that could probably be passed in 6 weeks or less, to allow  what it is they claim they are saying for the citizens of Washington,  D.C. Folding those 700,000 residents through a Maryland retrocession,  as has happened with Virginia in 1846, would accomplish the goal of the  same type of representation they are talking about.   No, the politics is over on that side of the aisle because they have  turned down a constitutional solution that this would be, instead, for  an unconstitutional one that flies in the face and produces a 66- square-mile State that is \1/18\th the size of Rhode Island, with a  population just a little bit larger than the city of Fresno,  California, because they want to accomplish a political goal while we  defend the Constitution.
