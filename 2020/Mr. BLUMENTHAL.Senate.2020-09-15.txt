 Madam President, today I rise to recognize the  Healy Foundation as it celebrates 10 years of supporting and  facilitating the quality education of remarkable students across the  country.   The James P. and Debra Fitzgerald Healy Foundation was created in  2010 by Jim and Debra's 10 children in honor of their parents' lifelong  devotion to education. The couple dedicated their lives to ensuring  their children received an outstanding education. Both Jim, who passed  away last year, and Debra unfailingly demonstrated the importance of a  strong work ethic through their tireless efforts on behalf of their  family at work and at home.   Based in Naugatuck, CT, the foundation provides assistance to high- achieving college students who encounter unexpected hardships and  subsequently need financial help to continue their education. This  support has been essential for countless students who deserve to finish  their degrees, regardless of any obstacles they have encountered.   Now, as COVID-19 poses unprecedented health and financial challenges  in Connecticut and across the globe, the Healy Foundation's work is  more necessary than ever. It is critical that education remains  equitable and accessible to everyone, and the foundation continues to  uphold that mission, awarding scholarships to 11 new students this  year.   Committed to furthering a family legacy by bolstering bright,  deserving young scholars, the Healy Foundation sets a positive example  of encouraging and advancing well-earned education. I applaud their  accomplishments and hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating  the Healy Foundation on 10 years of helping others achieve their  academic dreams.                            ____________________
