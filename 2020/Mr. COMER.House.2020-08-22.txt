 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 8015, the Delivering  for America Act. This is the result of a legislative process only  slightly less absurd than the conspiracies, insinuations, and  fabrications that gave rise to the purported need for it.   I mean, just this second, the sponsor of the bill says she has data  now that we can all receive while we are voting on the bill. I mean, is  this data from a whistleblower? We all know their record with  whistleblowers.   The process is broken. Regardless, we are here today debating a bill  to simultaneously hamstring and bail out the Postal Service. We have  had no committee hearings or markups. On Monday, we will hear from the  new Postmaster General, after we vote on the bill. It makes no sense.  The result is deeply flawed.   Although Dr. Fauci advised that there is no reason Americans cannot  vote in person, citizens choosing to vote by mail must have their  ballots delivered in a timely manner. The Postmaster General has  pledged that is his mission. And on Friday, before the Senate, he  pledged ballots would be delivered faster than first-class mail,  without rate increases.   I want to turn now and, one by one, debunk the Democrats' conspiracy  theories.   First, Democrats claim DeJoy is removing blue collection boxes to  sabotage the election. This is an absurd claim. This removal process is  routine. The Postal Service has removed 35,000 boxes over the last 10  years. Under President Obama, at least 12,000 mailboxes were removed,  and no one cried foul then.   Second, Democrats claim Postmaster DeJoy is removing mail sorters to  intentionally slow the mail. These sorters were on track to be removed  prior to his appointment and reflect the reality that mail volume is  down 33 percent over the past 15 years.                                time  1345    The third Democrat claim is that the Postal Service cannot manage  volume resulting from the upcoming election. In 2019, the Postal  Service handled an average of 471 million pieces of mail each day.  Assuming all 158 million registered voters decided to vote by mail, the  total volume of requested and mailed ballots would not exceed a typical  day of total USPS mail volume.   Fourth, the Democrats claim the Postmaster General's pilot program  and his efforts to reduce excessive overtime were intended to sabotage  the election. The Postmaster General testified he never sought to  eliminate overtime. Instead, he sought to get postal operations on time  so there would be less need to rely on overtime and reduce extra mail  truck trips. With overtime costs of $1.1 billion in 2018 alone, why  wouldn't you try to improve on that?   The Fifth Democratic claim is that the Postal Service General Counsel  sent letters to the Senate election boards to intimidate and stoke  fears. Letters were also sent in May, well before Postmaster DeJoy took  over--remember, the Postmaster has only been in office 60 days--saying  what the U.S. Postal Service has been saying for years, that some State  election boards have deadlines and requirements that simply do not  consider the reality of Postal Service operations and logistics  constraints.   If a State allows voters to request absentee ballots 1 day before the  election, why wouldn't the Postal Service advise there might be a  problem.   Sixth. Democrats are acting like any mail delays are new and  orchestrated by Postmaster General DeJoy. As I have said time and time  again, I have been hearing about postal delays for years. Where there  are delays, it makes sense to figure out why, and it makes even more  sense to do something to fix them.   And, finally, the false narrative that the Postal Service is running  out of money and will cease operations before the election. Currently,  the Postal Service has over $15 billion cash on hand, that's enough to  keep it solvent until August 2021, and enough time for us to do the  right thing.   Like the Russia hoax and the impeachment sham, the Democrats have  manufactured another scandal for political purposes.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), a member of the Education Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I want to add, there is no evidence of the  charges of the gentleman from Virginia.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.  Massie).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Hice), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on  Government Operations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Ferguson), the chief deputy whip.     Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Georgia.    Mr. Speaker, obviously the last speaker, the gentleman  from Maryland, missed the part where one of his Members proclaimed that  the President was the greatest threat to democracy.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Grothman), the ranking member of the Committee on Oversight and  Reform's National Security Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the balance of our time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Cloud), another Oversight and Reform Committee ranking member.    Mr. Speaker, that ship has sailed.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Gibbs), another great member of the Oversight and Reform Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Ohio.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Norman), another great member of the Oversight and Reform  Committee.    Mr. Chair, I have to comment on what the chairwoman said  about the briefings. A briefing is not a committee hearing. With a  briefing, there are no notice requirements. Oftentimes in the beginning  we weren't allowed to have witnesses, and there are no transcripts. So  there is a big difference between a briefing and a committee hearing.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Keller), who is another member of the Oversight and Reform  Committee.    That ship has sailed.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Dakota  (Mr. Armstrong) who is another valuable member.    Mr. Speaker, Ms. Waters forgets that President Obama  removed 12,000 of those blue boxes that she just asked that they quit  removing.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr.  Westerman).    Mr. Speaker, I have the most respect for my friend, the  chairwoman of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, but I believe she  misspoke.   She said the President wanted to defund the Postal Service. That is  not what the President wants to do. The only time I have heard the word  ``defund'' lately was by the liberal progressive wing of the majority  party that wants to defund the police.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr.  Palmer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Jordan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McCarthy), the Republican leader.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio,  Mr. Latta.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Biggs).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Williams).

Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Utah (Mr. Curtis).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), who is the Republican whip.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Nunes).    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time each side has  remaining.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Walberg).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Gohmert).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Arrington), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, despite the passionate arguments made by supporters of  H.R. 8015, the truth is simple: The new Postmaster General is not  trying to sabotage the election. He is doing the exact opposite. In  fact, he is ensuring that States are educated on the reality of the  Postal Service operations so that enough time is given for American  citizens to vote by mail if they choose to do so.   Just yesterday, the Board of Governors announced a bipartisan  committee to focus on election mail issues. Voting by mail is a crucial  way that American citizens can exercise their constitutional right to  vote, and it is important that all ballots be counted.   The Postal Service will be able to handle an increase in mail volume  ahead of the election as they have already handled a larger volume of  Census forms and stimulus checks earlier this year.   This increase in mail will also bring in revenue, strengthening the  U.S. Postal Service's fiscal outlook. Let's not forget that the Postal  Service already has approximately $15 billion in cash on hand, which  will allow it to be operational through August of 2021. It also has a  $10 billion line of credit from the CARES Act that it has not drawn  down.   The USPS clearly does not need a bailout for the 2020 election  season. To provide these funds without a concrete business reform plan  that modernizes the post office for long-term viability would be  reckless.   We all want to see an operational, efficient Postal Service that best  serves every American. My grandmother was a rural mail carrier for 27  years. As both her grandson and as a Representative elected by rural  Kentuckians, I know firsthand the importance of a reliable Postal  Service in helping small businesses thrive, ensuring Americans get  their medications on time, and allowing folks to share greeting cards  with loved ones.   Americans deserve an improved Postal Service, but this bill  potentially makes things worse.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I am opposed to the bill in its current form.    Mr. Speaker, my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have  shown immense passion today for both their constituents and the  integrity of this upcoming national election. There is no doubt that  voting by mail will be more relied upon than it has been in previous  elections.   The Postal Service will be a crucial link in the chain of custody  between voters and State or local election boards. For the Americans  who choose to cast their vote via mail, they need to be sure that their  ballot, their voice, will be safe. We, therefore, need the proper  measures in place to ensure that integrity is maintained.   In addition, if we are going to give the Postal Service funding, I  think my colleagues on both sides of the aisle need assurances that it  will be spent where Americans need it more. The prioritization of  medical deliveries and ballots for this election.   My motion contains reasonable additions to H.R. 8015 that ensure that  this funding gets to where it needs to go. These provisions ensure that  funds must only be spent on operating expenses to keep our postal  workers paid and to keep them safe with personal protective equipment.   These provisions will also ensure that a portion of these funds go to  prioritizing pharmaceutical deliveries to get life-saving medicines to  Americans quicker. Lastly, these provisions ensure that these funds are  used to prioritize ballots as well as establish penalties for postal  employees who tamper or interfere with election mail.   For instance, any postal employee will face penalties if they  knowingly and willfully slow down the processing of mail or use their  official authority to interfere with the election of a Federal  candidate. This upcoming election will put millions, possibly hundreds  of millions of votes, in the literal hands of Postal Service workers  who we must trust to deliver ballots safely and on time.   The election will put our collective faith in our Postal Service like  we have never seen before, and those who break the trust of the  Americans need to face the consequences.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this motion to  recommit, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
