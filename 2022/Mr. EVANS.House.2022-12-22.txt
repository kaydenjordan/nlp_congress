 Madam Speaker, I rise today to strongly support this  legislation.   I am proud to serve on the Ways and Means Committee which, under the  chairman's strong leadership, oversees and protects our Nation's tax  code. Tax fairness is a top priority for me and the Democratic members  of the Ways and Means Committee.   The chairman's legislation sends a real message of fairness,  something we haven't seen before. I encourage all my colleagues to  support this legislation.
