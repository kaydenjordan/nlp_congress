 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the Democrats talked this morning about the  Affordable Care Act and what the reform efforts are trying to do and  what they are not trying to do. I want to associate myself with the  comments made by my colleague, the Senator from Nebraska, earlier  today.   A lot of talk has been thrown around about how the new effort would  cut Medicaid spending. As my colleague from Nebraska mentioned, here in  Washington a cut is not a cut anywhere else. But if you deal with the  rate of growth, if you raise spending only by the Consumer Price Index  rather than the medical Consumer Price Index--5  [[Page S6106]]  percent rather than 6 percent, for example--then you are somehow  cutting the program.   We know that the program as it currently stands is unsustainable. I  think we all recognize that. So any efforts to deal with and to allow  Governors and others at the local level to have more of a say on how  these funds are spent and to gain efficiencies that way are frowned  upon. It is said that we simply can't do that because it would be  cutting Medicaid. That simply isn't the case.   Arizona, for example, has a version of Medicaid called AHCCCS. It is  done far more efficiently than some of the other States do it. That is  because at the local level they have been able to do what local  governments do best. The government that is closer to the people  generally spends money more wisely and finds efficiencies that the  Federal Government simply can't find.   Let me mention that on the exchange, the Affordable Care Act dealt  with a couple of different things. It is a so-called exchange where  people who can't get insurance otherwise or don't get it through their  employers will buy it on either a Federal exchange or a State exchange.  Then you have the Medicaid side. Let me speak for a minute on the  exchange side.   Arizona has been ground zero for the failure of the ObamaCare  exchange. We have 15 counties in Arizona. In all 15 counties, if you  are a family of four and you are buying on the exchange, you are paying  more on average for your healthcare premiums than you are for your  mortgage. Think about that for a minute. You are paying more for your  healthcare premiums than you are for your mortgage in every county in  Arizona. In some counties in Arizona you are paying double. In every  county it is more, in some counties significantly more, and in a couple  of counties you are paying double for your healthcare premiums--much  more than what you are paying for your mortgage.   I spoke yesterday with an elected official from Arizona from one of  the rural counties. He told me that his healthcare premium, which he  simply can't afford anymore for his family of four children, would have  been $2,800 a month. That is what it has gone up to. It has doubled  virtually every year. In some counties in Arizona, we saw increases of  116 percent. He owned insurance prior to ObamaCare, was paying a  reasonable amount for a premium, and had copays and deductibles that  were reasonable as well. But when the Affordable Care Act came in, the  promise that you could keep your doctor or keep your plan simply wasn't  the case. His premiums have gone up, up, and up until now; he has a  premium of $2,800 monthly for his family of four children.   Keep in mind, as well, that there are the deductibles on top of that.  Were he to use that insurance, by the time he satisfies the family  deductible, which is about $12,000, he has paid--or he will pay if he  has any medical issues--between premiums and deductibles, more than  $40,000 before the first insurance dollar kicks in.   So when we hear from the other side of the aisle that there is no  problem with ObamaCare, that the only thing we have to worry about is,  for some people who have gained insurance, to make sure they keep  that--I agree we have to make sure those with preexisting conditions  have access to affordable care. But when you have people on the  exchange who simply can't find affordable care and if they do have a  policy they can't afford to use it because deductibles and copays are  so high, we have a problem.   The latest figures tell us that 155,000 Arizonans woke up this  morning without any insurance. Most of them had insurance prior to the  Affordable Care Act, but then insurance was priced out of their reach.  So 155,000 people are paying a fine to the Federal Government because  of their inability to find affordable insurance. They pay that fine,  and they still have no insurance. Tell me that is not something we have  to fix. We have to fix that. That is what we are responding to here.   This notion that it is all hunky-dory--keep with the plan--belies the  fact that 155,000 Arizonans woke up this morning and said: We are  paying a fine to the Federal Government because we can't find  affordable care, and still we have no care, and we are somehow supposed  to be OK with that. Somehow we are supposed to wait until we can find a  solution for it all before we address that specific situation.   I submit that we have to fix this. People in Arizona and elsewhere  are hurting. Let's stop with the rhetoric that this is somehow a cut  and people will be left on the streets. We heard that back in 1996 with  welfare reform. It was said that the Governors or others at the local  level couldn't participate, couldn't be in charge of this program  because people would be dying on the streets. Guess what. Within a  couple of years, the welfare rolls had been cut in half. We are doing  better, and the Federal Government's obligation in that regard has been  sustainable, unlike the current situation we have with the so-called  Affordable Care Act.   I hope we can stop the outrageous rhetoric on this and actually fix  the problem. Let's fix the problem for Arizonans who are hurting right  now.   With that, I yield back.
