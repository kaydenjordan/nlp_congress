 Madam Speaker, it has been 22 days since the last time  this body has met, and in those 22 days that the Speaker has refused to  work on real relief packages, people have lost their jobs, small  businesses have closed, and Main Streets have suffered. The American  people were left with the question: Where are our leaders?   I have begged, the President has begged, and the Senate has begged:  Please call the House back into session to work on a bill to help  suffering Americans.    Now we are back in Washington for less than 12 hours. It is  embarrassing that, while we could be working on vaccine funding, saving  small businesses, and justice reform, the Speaker will gavel us out and  Americans will once again be wondering: Where are our leaders?   I introduced legislation that will fund better training for police  officers, increase the number of body cameras, and fund important  grants to police departments that help with community policing, which  builds trust and lasting relationships in the communities they serve.   It has been 89 days since George Floyd's tragic death, and in those  89 days, Senator Tim Scott and I have put forth legislation to fix and  improve our policing. We have begged Democrat leadership to come to the  table and address this issue that Americans and our communities have  asked for.   Yet, what do we get? Twelve hours in Washington, D.C., and no action  on vaccine funding, no action on small business relief, and no action  on police reform.   Madam Speaker, I urge defeat of the previous question so we can  consider  [[Page H4268]]  this important bill and get Congress back to work, because a Congress  at work is America at work.
