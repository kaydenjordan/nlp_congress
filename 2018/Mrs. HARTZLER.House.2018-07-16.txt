 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask support for H.R.  4960, which would name the downtown Columbia, Missouri, post office in  memory of one of our Nation's heroes, Specialist Sterling William  Wyatt, who proudly served in the United States Army.   I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member and so many of my  colleagues for your support of this legislation.   Sterling was born and raised in Columbia, Missouri, located in the  heart of Missouri's Fourth Congressional District.   Early on, Sterling showed his commitment to service by being an  active participant in his youth group and in his church. Through his  service and hard work, he was quite an accomplished young man. He  earned the rank of Eagle Scout, a first degree black belt in tae kwon  do, and a certification as a certified nurse attendant, all before  graduating from high school in 2009.                                time  1630    Soon after, he decided to continue his lifestyle of service by  joining the United States Army. He was assigned to the 5th Battalion,  20th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry  Division at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington.   Tragically, Specialist Wyatt was killed on July 11, 2012, while on  patrol in Kandahar, Afghanistan. He was only 21 years old. His vehicle  was attacked with an enemy improvised explosive device. His awards and  decorations for his service are many, including, but not limited to,  the Medal of Valor and Bronze Star.   Specialist Wyatt's dedication to serving his community and country  were a testament to his faith and his family, especially his loving  parents, Randy and Sherry Wyatt.   It is fitting that we bring this bill today for a vote before the  United States House of Representatives, because just a few days ago we  solemnly remembered the 6-year anniversary of his passing.   As representatives of the people who bravely serve our country,  especially those who pay the ultimate sacrifice, we owe it to their  lives and memories to never forget all that they have done for us.   Although Sterling was taken from us too soon, this bill will enshrine  his memory in our community for posterity so everyone can know this  brave soldier and be reminded that freedom is not free.   And maybe, when others learn about Sterling's story and sacrifice,  they, too, will put service above self and answer the call to serve,  which is the noblest and most honorable action anyone can take. Truly,  greater love has no one than this, to lay down one's life for one's  friends. Sterling did this for his brothers and sisters in arms, for  those who yearn to be free in a desperate land, and for all of us. We  will forever be grateful.   And, with the renaming of this post office in Columbia, Missouri, the  Specialist Sterling William Wyatt Post Office Building, we will always  remember and always be grateful.   I ask my colleagues to support this legislation to honor Specialist  Wyatt's memory.
