Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, nearly 250 years ago, a group of visionaries met in  Philadelphia for the Second Continental Congress. Out of this unusual  meeting of daring patriots, a declaration was produced stating to the  world that, for the first time in the modern world, 13 Colonies would  join together to become one independent nation--the United States of  America, the greatest experiment in democracy that the world has ever  seen.   Madam Speaker, these leaders boldly declared that no more would  Americans live under the tyranny of a nation 3,000 miles away. They  acted with unity and decided that our Nation will not be built upon  privilege inherited by birth, but natural rights that belonged to each  and every person.   In 2026, the United States will celebrate 250 years of independence.  While we have not always lived up to these lofty ideals, we have  continued to work to make progress and right the wrongs.   To commemorate and celebrate the founding of our Republic in 2016,  Congress established the United States Semiquincentennial Commission.  The Commission's goal is to encourage Americans to remember our past,  celebrate our present, and look forward to a promising future. The  Commission works with public and private entities across the country to  make celebrations of our 250th year of independence a time to remember  for years to come.   Madam Speaker, while the Commission has done incredible work thus  far, the Commission Amendments Act will make needed updates to ensure  that the Commission has the resources and talent it needs to fulfill  its mission of national importance.   This bill will expand the membership to include cultural and  historical perspectives from individuals such as the chairperson of the  National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the  Humanities. In addition, the bill will provide necessary intellectual  property protections for the materials created by the Commission.   This commonsense legislation will serve to further enable the  Commission to carry on its important work. It has never been more  important for us to come together or remember our past, acknowledge our  present, and look forward to our future as one nation devoted to the  ideals of liberty and justice for all.   As someone who was born in 1976, in Philadelphia, the year of our  bicentenary, this has a particular meaning to me.   Madam Speaker, I thank Senator Toomey and others on the committee for  advancing this. Our Nation will be the first multiracial, multiethnic  democracy in the history of the world, and it is a credit to our  founding vision.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reiterate my support for this  legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
