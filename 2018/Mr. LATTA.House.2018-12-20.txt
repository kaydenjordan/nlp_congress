 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7328, which  includes the bill I authored, H.R. 5333, the Over-the-Counter Monograph  Safety, Innovation, and Reform Act.   With more than 240 million Americans using OTC products every year,  it is time to update and complete the outdated regulatory framework  used for oversight of these medicines.   This bill will modernize the broken monograph system, strengthen  consumer protection, spur innovation, and increase consumer choice.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the Senate amendment to my bill,  H.R. 4227, the Vehicular Terrorism Prevention Act. It previously passed  the House by a vote of 417-2 and was amended by the Senate to make  simple technical corrections.   Over the past several years, we have seen an increased frequency of  terrorists around the world using vehicles, oftentimes rental vans or  trucks, to commit violence. The United States has not been immune to  these attacks as we saw in New York City at the end of last year when a  terrorist killed 8 people and injured 11.   This bipartisan legislation will ensure that the Department of  Homeland Security is doing their due diligence to guard against attacks  like this in the future. It would require the DHS Secretary to assess  the activities the Department is undertaking to combat the threat of  vehicular terrorism and submit a strategy to Congress on its findings  and recommendations.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman McCaul, Ranking Member  Thompson, Senator Bill Cassidy, and the staffs of both the House and  Senate committees for their work in advancing this legislation. I urge  my colleagues to join me in concurring with the Senate amendment to  H.R. 4227.  [[Page H10415]]    Again, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.
