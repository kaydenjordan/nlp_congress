 Mr. Speaker, I received a heartfelt letter  from a constituent expressing her frustration with the dire crisis in  Puerto Rico. She described the panic of not being able to reach her  family on the island. She said: ``It is becoming an island of chaos and  sadness. I am helpless here in Chula Vista. I cannot contact my family.  We need Congress to send more relief. We Puerto Ricans are American  citizens, whether people remember it or not.''  [[Page H7499]]    As we speak, Puerto Rico remains without power, communication lines  are down, and a major dam could burst. We are proud of how Americans  came together for Texas and Florida. Let's not abandon Puerto Rico. We  must act now. We are seeing a major humanitarian crisis unfold on U.S.  soil.   Mr. Speaker, is there any reason why U.S. citizens are being ignored  in these times of desperate need?   We must help Puerto Rico now.                            ____________________
