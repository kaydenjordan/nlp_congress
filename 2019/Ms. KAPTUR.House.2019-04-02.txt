 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn President Trump and  his anti-life Republican enablers in Congress as they seek to repeal  the Affordable Care Act, cutting off millions of Americans from their  lifeline of affordable healthcare.   Just last week, the Trump administration announced its support of a  Federal ruling that would strike down the  [[Page H2976]]  entire Affordable Care Act. To do so would threaten the lives of  millions upon millions of Americans, including 130 million Americans  with preexisting conditions.   If President Trump and Republicans get what they want and the entire  ACA becomes invalidated, then the current cost of healthcare for  millions of people will skyrocket.   More than 130 million Americans, more than one-third of our people,  live with preexisting conditions, and they would no longer receive  protection under Federal law.   Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve a caring President and  Congress; they deserve a President who is committed to expanding access  to affordable healthcare; they deserve a Congress that is committed to  protecting those with preexisting conditions; and they deserve a  government willing to stand up to the insurance industry and Big  Pharma, whose profits will soar even more if the Affordable Care Act is  struck down.   We were elected by the people to work together to strengthen our  healthcare system, not destroy it. I thank Representative Allred for  introducing a resolution condemning the administration's attack on the  American healthcare system, and I urge its swift passage through this  House and Senate.                            ____________________
