 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the work  being done by First 5 San Luis Obispo County for families on the  central coast.   I stand to endorse their Children's Bill of Rights. This document  serves as a guide well beyond San Luis Obispo County that every  lawmaker in this Nation should work toward, especially the right to  visit a doctor to help children stay physically and mentally healthy.   This week marks the eighth anniversary of the Affordable Care Act  that covers 1 million children through the State and Federal  marketplaces. The ACA also made significant investments in our  Children's Health Insurance Program.   I urge my colleagues to continue to work together to strengthen this  legislation. By controlling the cost of prescription drugs, ensuring  cost-sharing reduction subsidies, and adding a public option to bring  down the cost of health insurance plans, we can ensure that we continue  to raise healthy children.                            ____________________
