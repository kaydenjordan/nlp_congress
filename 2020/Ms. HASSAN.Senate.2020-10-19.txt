 Mr. President, today I would like to honor the  life of a woman who made immense contributions to improve the lives of  children throughout New Hampshire, Miriam Stahl.   Originally from the Midwest, Miriam moved to New Hampshire to be near  her family, and once here, she began working at a critical community  resource and early intervention center called the Richie McFarland  Children's Center.   Founded in 1971, the Richie McFarland Children's Center works to  provide social and therapeutic programs for children, including those  who experience disabilities. This center helps children learn, grow,  and thrive, while also empowering families and working to meet the  needs of every child. The center and its remarkable staff are often the  first professional resources made available to a family and child  grappling with developmental challenges. To say that the center serves  as a lifeline is an understatement.   According to her colleagues, the Richie McFarland Children's Center  would not be what it is today without Miriam's vision and leadership.  Miriam served as the executive director of the center for a decade, and  she believed passionately in the power of early intervention to help  children develop.   During her tenure, Miriam did all that she could to use her talent,  energy, and quiet determination to prioritize the needs of children and  to provide them with vital support. Her advocacy was clear, no  nonsense, and nonjudgmental. She made inroads as a  [[Page S6327]]  result. After she retired, she remained in New Hampshire and remained  close with her colleagues at the center.   Miriam passed away last month at the age of 88, and she will be  sorely missed. Her legacy, though, will live on through her family and  through the lasting impact she made on children and families throughout  New Hampshire.   I hope that you join me in honoring the life of a champion for all  children, Miriam Stahl.                            ____________________
