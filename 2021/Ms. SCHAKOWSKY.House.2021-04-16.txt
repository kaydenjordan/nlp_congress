 Madam Speaker, workplace violence has reached  epidemic levels and is the third greatest cause of job death right now.   Nurses, medical assistants, emergency responders, and social workers  face some of the greatest threats, suffering more than 72 percent of  all workplace assaults. Women suffer two out of every three serious  workplace violence incidents.   This is unacceptable. We need to protect workers and require  employers to put in place effective workplace violence prevention  plans. It is simple. Make a plan.   We need to protect our healthcare and social service workers who have  done so much for us during the pandemic to care for us. Now, we need to  care for them.   We need H.R. 1195 now. Let's come together and get it done.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an editorial column from  Bonnie Castillo and a letter from the AFL-CIO.                       [From The Hill, Apr. 9, 2021]    We Can't Afford to Lose One More Nurse--Passing Workplace Violence                         Prevention Bill Would Help                 (By Bonnie Castillo, Opinion Contributor)         ``My children were very distraught to see their mom with a       black eye,'' said Luciana Herr, a registered nurse in the       inpatient psychiatry unit at Abbott Northwest Hospital in       Minneapolis, Minn. Herr entered a hospital room in early       March to find a patient hitting and biting her co-worker.       With no security or other staff around, she tried to help and       was punched in the face twice and kicked several times. It       was the second time she had been assaulted in just a few       months.        Tragically, Herr's story is all too common. According to       the Bureau of Labor Statistics, health care and social       service workers have a five times greater likelihood of       experiencing a workplace violence-related injury than workers       overall. This extremely high rate of violence is       unacceptable, a fact driven home by the pandemic. We cannot       let nurses and other health care workers go one more day       fighting for optimal COVID protections while also wondering       whether they will be assaulted at work.        That's why National Nurses United (NNU), the largest union       of registered nurses in the United States, is fighting to get       a critical bill across the finish line. The Workplace       Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social Service       Workers Act (H.R. 1195) would mandate that federal OSHA hold       health care and social service employers accountable for       developing and implementing a comprehensive workplace       violence prevention plan, publicly reporting incidents of       violence, and not retaliating against workers who report       violence.        The legislation passed the U.S. House in the 116th Congress       and was reintroduced this session by U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney       (D-Conn.). It will come up for a floor vote soon in the       House, and nurses across the country urge congressmembers to       vote yes.        Planning to prevent violence means everything because once       violence happens, it's already too late. This truth really       hit home when our beloved NNU member Cynthia Palomata, a       registered nurse in California, was killed by her patient in       2010. Countless nurses across the country are attacked       physically and verbally each year, and the violence may be       growing. A November 2020 National Nurses United survey of       15,000 registered nurses across the country found that 20       percent of respondents reported an increase in workplace       violence during the pandemic.        It's important to remember that when nurses aren't safe,       patients, visitors, and family members are also not safe.       Violence can harm anyone in the vicinity.        According to Herr, staffing at an optimal level, adding       security, and making sure patients are assessed and placed       where they are best served are examples of actions her       employer could take to curb violence before it happens. But       there is no federal mandate for health care and social       service employers to have a comprehensive, unit-specific       prevention plan. This bill will establish one. In our profit-      driven health care system, employers will never invest in       prevention unless they are held accountable.        ``All I got was an `I am sorry that happened to you,' ''       said Melanie Autrey, a general surgery registered nurse at       Mission Hospital in Asheville, N.C., who--along with her co-      worker--was attacked in January by a patient with dementia.       ``It made me feel like I was not safe working here. It made       me feel like `What does it take?' ''        In Autrey's case, simple things may have helped, like the       hospital investing in ``sitters,'' staff who can watch over       patients in need of supervision and notice changes in       behavior before a patient grows violent. There are so many       clear actions that health care employers can take to prevent       violence from happening and to ensure nurses can focus on       caring for patients, not on wondering whether they will be       hurt or killed on the job. But if we don't hold profit-driven       employers accountable, they will never change.        As of early April, more than 3,570 registered nurses and       other health care workers have already died of COVID-19. We       can't afford to lose one more--not to the virus, not to       violence, not to preventable causes. Congress must pass the       Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social       Service Workers Act without delay.                                   ____                                                          AFL-CIO,                                     Washington, DC, April 13, 2021.        Dear Representative: I am writing on behalf of the AFL-CIO       to urge you to vote for the Workplace Violence Prevention for       Health Care and Social Services Workers Act (H.R. 1195) when       it is brought to the floor this week. This bill would direct       the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to       issue a federal workplace violence prevention standard to       protect workers in health care and social services from       injury and death. We also urge you to oppose Keller #6.        Workplace violence is a serious and growing safety and       health problem that has reached epidemic levels. Workplace       violence is the third leading cause of job death, and results       in more than 30,000 serious lost-time injuries each year.       Nurses, medical assistants, emergency responders and social       workers face some of the greatest threats, suffering more       than 72% of all workplace assaults. Women workers       particularly are at risk, suffering two out of every three       serious workplace violence injuries.        An OSHA standard under H.R. 1195 would protect these       workers by requiring employers in the health care and social       service sectors to develop and implement a workplace violence       prevention plan, tailored to specific workplaces and worker       populations. As part of the plan, employers would be required       to work with employees to identify and correct hazards,       develop systems for reporting threats of violence and       injuries, provide training for workers and management and       protect workers from retaliation for reporting workplace       violence incidents. Common sense prevention measures include       alarm devices, lighting, security, and surveillance and       monitoring systems to reduce the risk of violent assaults and       injuries.        The requirements for a workplace violence prevention plan       are based upon existing recommendations from OSHA, NIOSH and       professional associations, and scientific studies have found       these guidelines to significantly reduce the incidence of       workplace violence. Similar measures have been adopted in a       number of states and implemented by some employers.       Currently, however, there is no federal OSHA workplace       standard, which would ensure these measures are in place. The       majority of healthcare and social service workers lack       effective protection and remain at serious risk while OSHA       has been slow to act.        The AFL-CIO opposes Keller # 6, the Amendment in the Nature       of a Substitute, as it will continue to delay protections for       workers and will weaken the underlying protections of H.R.       1195. Working people need protection from workplace violence       now, and should not have to wait seven years or more, the       average time it takes for OSHA to issue a safety and health       standard. It has been over four years since OSHA issued a       Request for Information on workplace violence. Since this       initial step, the agency has not taken additional action.        In recognition of the urgency to protect these workers from       dangerous assaults, we support the underlying bill, which       requires OSHA to develop an interim standard within one year       and a final standard within 42 months. OSHA issued its first       guidance to employers on protecting health care and social       service workers from workplace violence  [[Page H1862]]       25 years ago in 1996. These frontline workers cannot wait any       longer; their lives are in danger.        The underlying bill has broad support from health care       professionals, safety and health professionals and healthcare       unions including the National Association of Social Workers,       American Public Health Association, American Industrial       Hygiene Association and American Society of Safety       Professionals. Also, this important legislation passed the       House during the 116th Congress with 251 votes and continues       to have strong bipartisan support.        We urge you to support H.R. 1195 to help protect health       care and social service workers from the growing threat of       workplace violence and unnecessary injury and death. We also       urge you to oppose any Motion to Recommit, which would have       the effect of killing the bill.            Sincerely,                                                 William Samuel,                                       Director, Government Affairs.
