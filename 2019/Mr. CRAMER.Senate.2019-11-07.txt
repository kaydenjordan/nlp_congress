 Mr. President, on this Veterans Day 2019, I wish to pay  tribute to all veterans and thank them for their service. The freedoms  we enjoy in America today are because of them.   For more than 200 years, our veterans have fought across the globe  defending our freedoms, while their families waited and worried at  home. Thanks to them, the forces of tyranny and oppression have been  turned back and defeated time and again.   As Americans across the Nation come together on Veterans Day, I will  be participating in a program in Fargo,  [[Page S6471]]  one of many being held in communities across North Dakota. Next  Wednesday in Williston, several military organizations and Williston  State College will sponsor a presentation by Medal of Honor recipient  SSG Clinton Romesha.   As one of only 3,507 recipients in American history to receive this  honor, Staff Sergeant Romesha was the fourth living Medal of Honor  recipient for the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. It was presented in 2013  for his heroism during the Battle of Kamdesh in October 2009, a 12-hour  battle that was significant in the Global War on Terrorism.   During this intense attack by some 300 Taliban fighters, despite his  own shrapnel wounds, Romesha continued to fight. His actions helped  mount a successful counterattack that eliminated Taliban machine guns  and allowed for wounded soldiers to be taken to an aid station.   In his bestselling memoir, ``Red Platoon: A True Story of American  Valor,'' published in 2013, Romesha shares the account of the Battle of  Kamdesh and how one person can make a difference against seemingly  impossible odds.   Now a resident of Minot, ND, he travels extensively as a motivational  speaker, sharing the message about how the capacity for leadership and  bravery resides within everyone.   I commend Williston State College and its Foundation, the Williston  Basin Chapter of the American Petroleum Institute, Williston Post 37 of  the American Legion, Military Affairs Committee, VFW-Post 12169, and  Williston Chapter 9 of the Disabled American Veterans for bringing this  inspirational message by a true hero to their community.   Mr. President, on this Veterans Day, may we be reminded to be  thankful every day for all who serve our country. May God bless all  veterans and their families. They are all heroes.                            ____________________
