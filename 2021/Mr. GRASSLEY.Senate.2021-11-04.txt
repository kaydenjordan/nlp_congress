 Mr. President, I would like to expand on my tribute to  former Iowa Congressman Neal Smith.   As I said yesterday, he was a true public servant, interested in  doing right by his State rather than seeking self-aggrandizement. He  was a real legislator, not a would-be pundit seeking the spotlight.  These are attributes that make him a role model, and I feel lucky to  have been mentored by him. When I was elected, I was the only  Republican in the Iowa delegation. He didn't care that I was of a  different party. He knew we both had our political views, but we were  both there to represent the state we love. I will never forget his  kindness in taking me under wing.   Neal Smith is a legend in Iowa, as evidenced by the fact that his  name is attached to several Iowa institutions, including the Neal Smith  Wildlife Refuge, which he was instrumental in establishing, the Neal  Smith Trail, the Neal Smith Federal Building in Des Moines, which I  helped to name after him with Senator Harkin, and the Neal and Bea  Smith Law Center at their alma mater, Drake University.   His legislative legacy includes a long stint as a senior member of  the Appropriations Committee.   Neal Smith was instrumental in creating Lake Red Rock, Saylorville  Lake, and Lake Rathbun, which help protect Iowans from flooding, serve  as reservoirs, and provide recreational opportunities for Iowans.   He also authored legislation to help small businesses after a  disaster and legislation helping small businesses with federal  government contracts.   Perhaps his most prominent legislative accomplishment was passing  legislation combatting nepotism in the Federal Government.   Neal Smith served in World War II as a bomber pilot, was shot down,  and received a Purple Heart, as well as other medals.  [[Page S7785]]    He and his wife Bea attended Drake University Law School together.  When they graduated, she was offered less than him for the same job  with the same firm despite her having had better grades, so he turned  down the job and opened a practice with her.   He soon entered public service locally, serving as assistant Polk  County attorney and as chairman of the Polk County Welfare Board.   In 1958, Neal Smith was elected to the House of Representatives,  where he served for 36 years, longer than any other Iowan has served in  the U.S. House.   Even though he represented Iowa's largest metropolitan area, he came  from a farm background like me and continued to farm near Altoona  during his time in office.   I remember him as a strong defender of agriculture.   I value the friendship I had with Neal Smith starting as a freshmen  Congressman and continuing through his time after leaving Congress.   Again, I pay tribute to this humble public servant. Barbara and I  will continue to remember his family in our prayers.                            ____________________
