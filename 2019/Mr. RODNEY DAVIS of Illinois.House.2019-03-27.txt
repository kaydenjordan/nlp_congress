 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate Colonel Craig Osborne, a soldier in my district who will  be retiring this week after 30 years of service in the United States  Army.   Colonel Osborne graduated from Illinois State University in 1989 as a  distinguished military graduate, and during his time with the Army, he  has participated in a total of five combat deployments: Operation  Desert Shield, Operation Desert Storm, Operation Joint Guard, Operation  Enduring Freedom, and Operation Iraqi Freedom.   Time and time again, Colonel Osborne has answered the call to serve  his country. He has served at the headquarters of Allied Land Forces  Southeastern Europe in Turkey, as well as the chief of staff for a  combined, joint, and interagency task force in Kabul, Afghanistan.                                time  1100    In his current position with the National Defense University, he  contributes to the education of future generations of our  servicemembers.   Among his many distinctions, Colonel Osborne has earned three Defense  Superior Service Medals, the Legion of Merit, five Bronze Star Medals,  three Defense Meritorious Service Medals, the Combat Infantryman's  Badge, and numerous other awards.   Words cannot express how thankful I am for Colonel Osborne's service.  He is a great example of someone who has dedicated his life to serving  his country, and I am proud to honor him today.   Congratulations on your retirement, Colonel.                            Remembering Gary Jones     Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember  Gary Jones, a good friend and dedicated police officer who passed away  earlier this month after a long battle with cancer.   Gary and I both grew up in Taylorville, Illinois. After graduation,  he went on to serve in the Army and in the Army National Guard. He  eventually became a police officer in our hometown. He was proud of his  job and always loved going to schools to teach students about the  police station and his job protecting our community.   Outside of work, Gary's greatest hobby was firearms. He was a  gunsmith, a proud member of the NRA, a master firearms instructor, and  my and my wife's concealed carry instructor. Gary loved teaching people  about the responsibility of owning firearms and teaching people the  importance of gun safety.   I will remember Gary as a true example of patriotism and service to  our community that we share as a hometown. He made a tremendous impact  on the lives of many in Taylorville, and he will truly be missed.   My prayers are with his wife, Gina; their four children, Logan,  Kaylee, Tanner, and Dylan; and all those like me who were blessed to  know Gary Jones.                    Slow Down to Protect First Responders     Madam Speaker, I rise today to  highlight a dangerous, disturbing, and unacceptable trend in Illinois  and across the country. It is the rising number of first responders  being struck by drivers.   We are not even 3 months into this year, and 14 members of the  Illinois State Police have been struck by drivers while on the road or  responding to incidents. These accidents have resulted in one fatality  and more than a dozen injuries.   Our first responders put their lives on the line every day to protect  us, and it is inexcusable to have this number of them injured by errant  and distracted drivers. These numbers average out to more than one  trooper struck per week and is nearly double the number of incidents in  all of 2018.   Even though every State has laws requiring drivers to change lanes or  slow down when vehicles or emergency personnel are on the side of the  road, these tragedies keep occurring. For the safety of our first  responders, construction workers, and tow truck drivers, please slow  down, avoid distractions, and be alert on the road to help save lives  and buck this tragic trend.                            ____________________
