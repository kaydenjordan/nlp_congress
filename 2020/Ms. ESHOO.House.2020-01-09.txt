 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this concurrent resolution,  which requires President Trump to immediately terminate military  operations against Iran. It is about time that Congress exercised its  war powers authority under the Constitution. I believe this is long  overdue.   The President has taken our Nation to the brink of war without  properly consulting Congress or seeking the legal authority to do so.  Only Congress can authorize military action under Article I of the  Constitution.   To add insult to injury, the Trump administration has failed to fully  explain to Congress and the American people what exactly the imminent  threat was to the United States that required the strike that was  undertaken. My constituents and people  [[Page H108]]  across the country have been terrified about the prospect of a new war  in the Middle East.   Now, let me be clear: No Member of Congress carries a brief for  Soleimani or the Iranian Government.    No President has unilateral authority to take our Nation  to war without authorization from Congress. I urge my colleagues to  vote ``yes.''
