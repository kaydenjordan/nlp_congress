 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, last night, in the San Diego Federal  District Court, U.S. district court judge Dana Sabraw made a critical  ruling that will affect the lives of thousands of people who have been  the focal point of America's attention over the last several weeks.   Judge Sabraw was appointed to the Federal bench by President George  W. Bush. In reading about him online, he is a Japanese American whose  background was in private practice law before he assumed the Federal  bench.   He was given the responsibility of ruling on the Trump  administration's zero tolerance policy. You will remember that policy.  It started in April. It was a decision by the Trump administration and  Attorney General Sessions to separate children from their mothers and  parents if they attempted to enter the United States without having  legal authorization. The net result of that policy was the separation  of thousands of children from their parents.   It has been on the news almost every day for weeks now. A firestorm  of opposition has come about on both political sides of the aisle.  Democrats and Republicans have said this is unfair; that it is not  right. Even the First Ladies--Democrats and Republicans--have come  together in an unusual show of unanimity in their opposition to  President Trump and Attorney General Sessions' zero tolerance policy.   Attorney General Sessions defended the policy and said he had a  Biblical defense for what they were doing. President Trump made it  clear he was behind the policy as well. Yet the opposition grew and  grew in its intensity to the point at which there were statements made  by the Pope, as well as by an evangelical supporter of the President,  Franklin Graham, when they called the administration's decision  immoral.   Late last week, President Trump issued an Executive order that said  he was ending this family separation, but that order didn't contain one  word about what was going to happen to these children. There was no  resolution of the whole question of reuniting these children with their  parents.   I learned about this matter months ago--well, several weeks ago, at  least--when we learned that a mother from the Congo had made it through  South America and Central America to our border in California. She  presented herself with her 6-year-old daughter and asked for asylum  because she feared persecution and death back in her home country. That  happened over 6 months ago. They removed her 6-year-old daughter from  her custody and flew the girl 2,000 miles to Chicago. So the mother  remained in San Diego, and the daughter was in Chicago. That was when  we learned about it in my office.   We started pursuing it. After we brought it to the attention of those  at the Department of Homeland Security, they said that was not the  policy, and they were going to work on it. They did reunite the mother  and child, but the separation of this family led to this lawsuit, the  lawsuit Judge Sabraw ruled on last night.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the opinion of the court  be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Judge Sabraw's order begins as follows:        ``Eleven weeks ago, Plaintiffs leveled the serious       accusation that our Government was engaged in a widespread       practice of separating migrant families, and placing minor       children who were separated from their parents in government       facilities for ``unaccompanied minors.'' According to       Plaintiffs, the practice was applied indiscriminately, and       separated even those families with small children and       infants--many of whom were seeking asylum. Plaintiffs noted       reports that the practice would become national policy.       Recent events confirm these allegations. Extraordinary relief       is requested, and is warranted under the circumstances.        On May 7, 2018, the Attorney General of the United States       announced a ``zero tolerance policy,'' under which all adults       entering the United States illegally would be subject to       criminal prosecution, and if accompanied by a minor child,       the child would be separated from the parent. Over the       ensuing weeks, hundreds of migrant children were separated       from their parents, sparking international condemnation of       the practice. Six days ago on June 20, 2018, the President of       the United States signed an Executive Order (``EO'') to       address the situation and to require preservation of the       ``family unit'' by keeping migrant families together during       criminal and immigration proceedings to the extent permitted       by law, while also maintaining ``rigorous[]'' enforcement of       immigration laws. See Executive Order, Affording Congress an       Opportunity to Address Family Separation Sec. 1, 2018 WL       3046068 (June 20, 2018). The EO did not address reunification       of the burgeoning population of over 2,000 children separated       from their parents. Public outrage remained at a fever pitch.       Three days ago on Saturday, June 23, 2018, the Department of       Homeland Security (``DHS'') issued a ``Fact Sheet'' outlining       the government's efforts to ``ensure that those adults who       are subject to removal are reunited with their children for       the purposes of removal.''        Plaintiffs assert the EO does not eliminate the need for       the requested injunction, and the Fact Sheet does not address       the circumstances of this case. Defendants disagree with       those assertions, but there is no genuine dispute that the       Government was not prepared to accommodate the mass influx of       separated children. Measures were not in place to provide for       communication between governmental agencies responsible for       detaining parents and those responsible for housing children,       or to provide for ready communication between separated       parents and children. There was no reunification plan in       place, and families have been separated for months. Some       parents were deported at separate times and from different       locations than their children. Migrant families that lawfully       entered the United States at a port of entry seeking asylum       were separated. And families that were separated due to       entering the United States illegally between ports of entry       have not been reunited following the parent's completion of       criminal proceedings and return to immigration detention.        This Court previously entered an order finding Plaintiffs       had stated a legally cognizable claim for violation of their       substantive due process rights to family integrity under the       Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution based on       their allegations the Government had separated Plaintiffs       from their minor children while Plaintiffs were held in       immigration detention and without a showing that they were       unfit parents or otherwise presented a danger to their       children. See  Mr. President, let me read some of the words Judge Sabraw  wrote last night in his order, in his conclusion, about the zero  tolerance policy of separating children from their parents.         The unfolding events--the zero tolerance policy [the judge       writes] serve to corroborate Plaintiffs' allegations. The       facts set forth before the Court portray reactive       governance--responses to address a chaotic circumstance of       the Government's own making. They belie measured and ordered       governance, which is central to the concept of due process       enshrined in our Constitution. This is particularly so in the       treatment of migrants, many of whom are asylum seekers and       small children. The extraordinary remedy of classwide       preliminary injunction is warranted based on the evidence       before the Court. For the reasons set out above, the Court       hereby GRANTS Plaintiffs' motion for classwide preliminary       injunction, and finds and orders as follows.    It goes into detail, and I will not read it in its entirety since it  is now going to be printed in the Record, but it reads, clearly, that  the court is enjoining the government--the Trump administration--from  separating minor children from their parents.   It goes on to read that it also orders the Trump administration to  reunify all class members with their minor children who are under the  age of 5 within 14 days of the entry of this order, and defendants must  reunify all class members with their minor children who are aged 5 and  older within 30 days of the entry of the order. Defendants must  immediately--and this is the government--take all steps necessary to  facilitate the regular communication between class members and their  children.   The court went on to say that within 10 days, the government--the  defendants--must provide parents telephonic contact with their children  if the parent is not already in contact with his or her child.   Last Saturday, the Department of Health and Human Services issued  [[Page S4464]]  what I consider to be a rosy and misleading press release about how  much information they had about the parents and their children and how  much telephone communication was taking place. I will tell you, in  having contacted various people who are well aware of the situation,  they have really overstated the contact information as well as the  context between parents and children. Now they are being tested. The  court has told them to return these children to their parents.   Last Friday, I was in Chicago at one of the agencies that was the  custodian for 66 of these children who have been the victims of  President Trump's zero tolerance policy. It was an experience I still  remember and will not ever forget--of seeing six little children walk  into a conference room, where I was sitting--little kids--and learning  that two of them, who I thought might be twins because they had similar  hairdos, were, in fact, as one of them said to me, ``just amigas,''  friends. One was 5 years old, and one was 6 years old.   As a father, it is hard for me to remember my kids at that age, but I  can sure visualize my grandkids for a moment, who are now 6, 7, and 8,  if they were to be separated from their parents by thousands of miles  for weeks at a time. That was the policy of zero tolerance--to put  pressure on those who consider seeking protection or asylum in this  country.   I just left a meeting downstairs with a person whom I admire greatly.  His name is King Abdullah of Jordan. I admire him for so many things-- his efforts to find peace in the Middle East--but especially because  that tiny Kingdom of Jordan, in the Middle East, has done something  which should be a lesson to the world. That nation of 7 million  Jordanians has accepted 3 million refugees. It is at their political  peril for them to have that large of a population within their borders.  Yet, time and time again, refugees have presented themselves to Jordan  and have been given not only humane treatment but good treatment under  the circumstances.   The United States and many other nations have helped, and I am glad  we have, for it is the right thing to do. Compare what we have done in  the United States when it comes to refugees. Historically, we have  accepted 75,000 to 100,000 refugees a year after careful screening,  inspection, and vetting. In some cases, we have gone way beyond that.   When the Cubans came over and said they wanted to escape Castro's  communism, we opened our doors. Thank goodness, we did, as they have  made a great addition to America. Three Members of the U.S. Senate are  Cuban Americans, and I am sure they are very proud of their family  heritage. We opened our doors to Cuban refugees. We opened our doors to  refugees as well from the Soviet Union and to people who wanted to  practice their Jewish religion and felt they were being discriminated  against. We opened our doors for them. We opened our doors for the  Vietnamese to come here after the war and to become part of America  because they had been on our side and had fought for freedom in their  country and had run the risk of being killed. Time and again, the  United States has opened its doors.   What has happened under this administration? First, the President  announced last year that he was reducing the number of refugees to  45,000 a year who would be allowed in America--a dramatic cutback. How  many have been accepted so far this year as we are well over the  halfway point of this fiscal year? There have been less than 16,000  refugees. After careful screening, there have been less than 16,000.   I believe we can do better. I believe there are those who are in need  of help. I believe this is the definition of who we are as Americans-- the way we treat the people at our borders. If we are humane, if we are  civilized, if we are caring, it is a message to the world. If we are  the opposite, it is also a message to the world. Right now, we have to  look at the scoreboard. The kids have won, and zero tolerance has lost.   I hope now we can sit down and come up with a rational, reasonable  approach. America cannot accept every person who wants to live here. I  wish we could, but we can't. We have to have an orderly process, and we  must have border security, but we need to do it with clarity and with  humanity. We need to follow our Constitution, which the President, I  hope, is reminded of after this decision last night.   This decision reads that due process is a part of the Constitution  and that the chaotic governance of this administration is not  consistent with the Constitution and its principles. It is time now for  the President to understand that and to reunite these children under  the age of 5 within 14 days. Within 30 days, those under the age of 18  need to be reunited as well. Then we can move forward and put this sad  chapter in American history behind us.   I yield the floor.    Will the Senator from Texas yield for a question?    Mr. President, I would like to make one point and then  ask a question.   When President Obama, who was my friend and colleague in the Senate,  came up with family detention policies under his administration, I  objected, as well, and I can show the Senator from Texas the objection.    The question I have for the Senator from Texas is this:  If our goal is to make sure that the person presenting himself or  herself actually appears as scheduled for the required hearings to be  considered for eligibility under American law, if that is our goal, I  would like to suggest to the Senator from Texas--and I think he can  find in his own State evidence of this--over 90 percent of those in  that circumstance appear at a hearing, as required, if they have one of  three things: legal counsel; second, case management, which is the  counsel of groups like Catholic Charities or Lutheran family services;  or in some circumstances, ankle bracelets, where the government can  monitor where they are. Over 90 percent show up, as required, for a  hearing. It costs as little as $4 or $5 a day. It costs over $300 a day  to detain a family. It is certainly not in the best interests of  taxpayers to spend an amount that is unnecessary. Wouldn't the Senator  agree that we ought to look for alternatives to detention that would  also guarantee the appearance of individuals?    Mr. President, 27 years ago this week, one of the  towering giants of American justice announced that he was retiring.  Thurgood Marshall was a pillar of America's civil rights revolution,  architect of the legal strategy that ended the shameful era of official  segregation in this Nation, and the first African-American Justice of  the U.S. Supreme Court. His name will be forever linked with such civil  rights icons as Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks, Fannie Lou Hamer, and  John Lewis.   But the moral arc of the universe is never bent by just a few hands.  We know that. The foot soldiers for justice in America's civil rights  revolution also includes millions of people whose names are not  recorded in history books--people like the men and women of Montgomery,  AL, who walked to work and church and every other place for more than a  year in 1955 and '56 rather than ride on the back of segregated city  buses. The moral arc of the universe was bent by thousands of ordinary  men and women who risked their livelihoods and sometimes even their  lives by daring to try to register to vote in some states in the Deep  South before the Voting Rights Act of 1965.   The city of Chicago was honored to be the adopted home for more than  70 years of a men who bent the moral arc of the universe more than  most. George Leighton's name may not be as well known as that of his  old friend, Thurgood Marshall, but his contribution to the civil rights  movement and to American justice was profound. Judge Leighton died  earlier this month at the age of 105. If you think that is remarkable,  consider this: He only retired 6 years ago, at the age of 99, still  strong and sharp as a tack.   As a pioneering civil rights lawyer, George Leighton took on  entrenched racism and injustice in Chicago and far beyond. He fought  for fair housing and integrated public schools in Illinois and for  voting rights and equal access to jury service in the Deep South, and  he won. Several of his legal victories took him all the way to the U.S.  Supreme Court.   George Leighton was also a distinguished law professor and a judge.  In 1969, he made history as the first African American ever to sit on  the Illinois Appellate Court. Six years later, President Gerald Ford  nominated him to serve on the Federal bench as a U.S. District Court  Judge for the Northern District of Illinois. As a fellow judge and  admirer and recently, Judge Leighton defined for generations of  Chicagoans what it meant to be a lawyer.   He was a man of enormous intelligent, integrity, and courage who  dedicate his first to seeing that the law was applied equally to all.  He had a heroic imagination. Board and raised in the era of Jim Crow,  he had the vision to imaging a more just America and the courage to  help bring that America into existence. His work and his sacrifices  broke barriers and changed the meaning of equality in this country.   Judge Leighton was eloquent, with a rich baritone voice. He dressed  impeccably, elegantly, and stood ramrod straight well into his 90s. He  was a champion chess player. Despite all of that, he was a remarkably  humble man.   He was born in 1912 in New Bedford, MA, one of seven children of  immigrant parents from the Cape Verde Islands off the western coast of  Africa. His family's name was Leitao--a Creole name--but a fourth-grade  teacher changed his name to Leighton, reasoning that he would go  further in life with a name that sounded more American.   He and his siblings worked with his parents in cranberry bogs and  picked strawberries and blueberries from March until late November  every year. His early education was hit-or-miss, since education had to  fit in around the demands of farm work. He had reached only the seventh  grade by age 17, when he left home to work on an oil tanker sailing  from Fall River, MA, to Aruba, off the northern coast of South America.  That job ended when the ship's crew mutinied.   George Leighton returned to New Bedford, working in restaurant  kitchens and playing percussion in a dance band.   Always a voracious reader, he borrowed books wherever he could and  took classes through the Works Project Administration. In 1936, he tied  for first place in a local essay contest. With his $200 prize money, he  talked Howard University into admitting him on a conditional basis,  without a high school diploma. He made the dean's list that first  semester and every semester and graduated from Howard 2 years later,  Phi Beta Kappa.   It was during his Howard years that he met Virginia Quivers, the  woman who would become his wife and the love of his life.   After Howard, George Leighton attended Harvard Law School on  scholarship--one of the few African Americans of his generation to  attend that prestigious school--working odd jobs to support himself.   His law studies were interrupted after 1 year by World War II. For 3  years, he served as an officer in the U.S. Army's fabled 93rd Infantry  Division, an all-Black division, in places such as Guadalcanal.   He returned to Harvard after the war's end and graduated a year  later.   He moved to Chicago to start his legal career. He had never been to  Chicago before, but he knew two things about the city: It was a  cauldron of racial tension, and Chicago voters had just elected the  only African-American Member of Congress. There was important work to  do in Chicago, and there was a glimmer of hope that change was  possible.   The Chicago that greeted George Leighton was a hard place. Even with  a Harvard law degree, George Leighton couldn't rent office space or  dine in many of the restaurants or stay at a hotel in the Loop. He was  not allowed to join the segregated Chicago Bar Association or the  American Bar Association.   For 18 years, he practiced law with other African American attorneys,  from an office in the shadow of Comiskey Park on Chicago's South Side.  When his clients couldn't afford to pay him, which was not uncommon, he  worked for free.   He built a national reputation for criminal and civil rights cases  and several times won cases before the U.S.  [[Page S4501]]  Supreme Court. He helped integrate the Chicago Housing Authority and  the public schools of Harrisburg, IL. In the South, he successfully  challenged an amendment to the Alabama State constitution that used a  ``constitutional knowledge'' test to deny African Americans the right  to vote. He also helped to end the exclusion of African Americans from  jury duty in Mississippi.   In 1951, 5 years after arriving in Chicago, George Leighton was  indicted by a Cook County grand jury. His ``crime''? Telling his  clients, an African-American family, that they had a legal right to  rent an apartment in the then all-White Chicago suburb of Cicero.  Enraged neighbors rioted, nearly burning the apartment building nearly  to the ground.   The county grand jury indicted George Leighton on charges of  conspiracy to incite riot and lower property values. Judge Leighton was  represented by his friend, Thurgood Marshall, and the indictment was  quickly dismissed.   Not long after that, with the support of Chicago Mayor Richard J.  Daley, George Leighton was elected as a Cook County judge. He was later  elevated to the State appellate court, the first African American to  sit on that bench.   He served as a Federal judge from 1976 until 1989. He would have  preferred to stay on the bench, but his beloved wife, Virginia, had  suffered several strokes some time before. Judge Leighton's insistence  to provide her with round-the-clock medical care had depleted the  family's savings, and he needed to make more money.   He returned to private law practice, joining the Chicago firm of Neal  & Leroy. His new partner, Langdon Neal, was the son of Judge Leighton's  old friend. Judge Leighton could have joined any law firm in Chicago,  but he chose once again to go with a small, minority-owned firm. That  was important to him.   Langdon Neal tells the story about walking into the office early one  morning to find the lights already on. He looked into Judge Leighton's  office, saw him sprawled out on the floor, and feared the worst. Before  his law partner could say a word, Judge Leighton pushed himself up and  did 10 more push-ups. He was taking a rest during his morning  exercises.   At 77, he still had a lot of fight still in him. For the next 22  years, he would practice law, looking and sounding like a man decades  younger. At 97, his hearing, vision, and cholesterol were all still  perfect, and he was only 3 pounds heavier than when he was released  from Active military duty.   As a Cook County judge in 1965, Judge Leighton acquitted two Latino  men accused of beating and slashing a Chicago police officer. Judge  Leighton believed that the officers who testified against the men were  lying, and he told them so.   The decision touched off a public furor and angry calls to remove  Judge Leighton from the bench. A Chicago Tribune reporter asked the  judge if he feared for his safety. No, Judge Leighton quipped, ``I'm  making careful plans to die of old age in office.''   Six years ago this month, June 2012, the Cook County courthouse where  Judge Leighton acquitted those men, the courthouse where he first made  his name as a civil rights lawyer in the 1940s and '50s and where he  began his career as a judge, was renamed in his honor. ``26th and Cal''  is now the Judge George N. Leighton Criminal Court Building. It is one  of many tributes in his honor.   In 2005, the main post office in his boyhood home of New Bedford, MA,  was renamed in his honor. In 2008, the Illinois Supreme Court Historic  Preservation Commission established the Honorable George N. Leighton  Justice Award. Judge Leighton accepted these and other honors with  grace, humility, and a bit of puzzlement. He was always genuinely  surprised that people found his life worth celebrating in such ways.   There was only one honor that Judge Leighton wanted for himself at  the end of his life. His final wish was to be buried in Arlington  National Cemetery.   Judge Leighton died in New Bedford on June 6, the 74th anniversary of  D-Day. In a reflection of Judge Leighton's distinguished military  service, his place in American history, and the esteem in which he was  held by so many, Arlington National Cemetery has approved his burial in  those hallowed grounds.   Sometime in the not-too-distant future, Judge George Leighton, the  son of immigrants who bent the moral arc of history, will be laid to  rest at Arlington National Cemetery. He will rest there in honor among  such other American heroes as his old friend, Thurgood Marshall,  General Benjamin O. Davis, the commander of the Tuskegee Airmen and the  first African-American general in the U.S. Air Force, and other members  of the Army's 93rd Infantry Division, with whom Judge Leighton fought  with in World War II. It is a fitting final tribute to a great man who  fought so long and in so many ways to preserve and defend freedom and  liberty for all.   I am honored to have known him, and Loretta and I want to offer our  condolences to his family, especially to his daughters, Virginia and  Barbara, and their husbands, to Judge Leighton's five grandchildren and  eight great-grandchildren, and to his friends and colleagues.                            ____________________
