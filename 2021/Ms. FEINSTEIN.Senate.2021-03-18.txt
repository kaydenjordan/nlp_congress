 Mr. President, nationally, psychostimulant overdose  deaths, including methamphetamine-related deaths, increased by nearly  42% between July 2019 and July 2020. This increase is second only to  synthetic opioids, a category which includes fentanyl.   My home State of California has been particularly hard hit. Between  2014 and 2019, methamphetamine-caused deaths in San Diego increased  from 262 to 546, a stunning 108 percent increase in just five years.  Similarly, in Los Angeles County, methamphetamine was involved in 44  percent of all drug overdose deaths in 2018.   Unfortunately, these figures are not unique to California, as other  localities throughout the country are also seeing increases.   That is why I am introducing the Methamphetamine Response Act, which  was passed by the Senate unanimously during the last session of  Congress, with my colleague, Senator Grassley.   This bill does two things. First, it declares methamphetamine an  emerging drug threat. Second, it requires the Office of National Drug  Control Policy (ONDCP) to develop and implement a national plan that is  specific to methamphetamine, in accordance the ONDCP Reauthorization,  which I was proud to co-author, and which was enacted in 2018 as part  of the SUPPORT Act.   This plan must include: An assesment of the methamphetamine threat,  including the current availability of, and demand for, the drug, and  the effectiveness of evidence-based prevention and treatment programs,  as well as law enforcement programs;   Short- and long-term goals focused on supply and demand reduction and  the expansion of prevention and treatment programs;   Performance measures related to the plan's goals; and   The level of funding needed to implement the plan, including an  assessment of whether available funding can be reprogrammed or  transferred, or whether additional funds are needed.   It is clear that methamphetamine is re-emerging as a major drug  threat to our Nation:   Data shows that methamphetamine use is no longer limited to Mid-West  and Western States, but is increasingly prevalent in Northeastern  States.   Between 2018 and 2019, psychostimulant overdose deaths, including  methamphetamine deaths, increased in 27 of the 38 States that provide  drug-specific data to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  This amounts to a 27 percent increase nationally.   Methamphetamine continues to be highly potent, pure, and cheap. By  the end of 2019, its availability and use had both increased.   Between 2016 and 2019, the number of individuals aged 12 and older  with a methamphetamine use disorder increased from 684,000 to one  million. That's a 46 percent increase in just three years.   Emergency room admissions for suspected stimulant overdoses,  including methamphetamine, increased by 23 percent between January 2019  and 2020. These increases occurred in 36 States and the District of  Colombia.   Two of the largest methamphetamine seizures on record occurred in  2019: U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) seized 3,000 pounds of  methamphetamine at the port of Otay Mesa while the Drug Enforcement  Administration seized 2,224 pounds of methamphetamine in Riverside  County. Both of these seizures were in California.   Given the increasing size of these seizures, it is not surprising  that in the first five months of fiscal year 2021, CBP has already  seized more than 75,000 pounds of methamphetamine.   In a one year span, psychostimulants, including methamphetamine,  killed more than 21,000 Americans. Absent immediate action and a  comprehensive plan, these fatalities will continue to increase.   I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate and in the  House to see Methamphetamine Response Act enacted.   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. KAINE (for himself, Mr. Portman, Ms. Baldwin, Mr.          Blumenthal, Mr. Blunt, Mr. Braun, Mr. Brown, Mrs. Capito, Mr.          Cardin, Ms. Collins, Mr. Coons, Mr. Cramer, Ms. Duckworth, Ms.          Ernst, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. Gillibrand, Ms. Hassan, Mr. Hoeven,          Mr. Kelly, Mr. King, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Marshall, Mr. Moran,          Mrs. Shaheen, Ms. Sinema, Ms. Smith, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Wicker,          Mr. Sullivan, and Mr. Inhofe):   S. 864.
