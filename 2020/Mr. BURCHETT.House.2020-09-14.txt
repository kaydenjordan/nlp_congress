 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Velazquez and Ranking  Member Chabot for this opportunity as a freshman. It doesn't escape me  that you all have allowed me to move forward with a meaningful piece of  legislation as a freshman, and I can assure you that the people I  represent thank you all very much.   Mr. Speaker, small businesses, whether in urban centers or rural  areas, deserve access to small business administration resources.   The Microloan Transparency and Accountability Act is strong,  bipartisan legislation that improves rural access to the SBA microloan  program and will help ensure that community-based businesses, and not  just the heavy hitters, have access to needed resources.                                time  1445    As a former local mayor, I know the difference that easy access to  loans, even small ones, can make for our American mom-and-pop shops.   Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, rural small businesses often don't get  enough consideration from microloan providers. To incentivize interest  in supporting our rural small businesses, this legislation would  establish a 5 percent technical assistance grant for intermediaries who  make 25 percent of their loans to these small businesses. Rural small  businesses will have more opportunity to grow and innovate with the  help of this legislation.   This bill also improves transparency within the SBA microloan program  so American taxpayers know their dollars are being invested  responsibly. Under this legislation, Mr. Speaker, the SBA would update  Congress with a portfolio risk analysis of microloans on an annual  basis.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill and the  steps it takes to promote fair access to financial resources for every  American small business. I am proud to work with my friend  Representative Kim on this bill, and I thank him for his efforts to get  it across the finish line. I also thank the chairwoman and the ranking  member.
