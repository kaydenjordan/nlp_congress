 Mr. President, for two Congresses, Angus King and I have  introduced bipartisan legislation to streamline and simplify student  loan repayment programs. Our proposal would make the current, overly- complicated loan repayment programs easier to navigate and more  predictable for both borrowers and the Federal Government.   Today, students are asked to choose between nine different loan  repayment plans, each with different eligibility and income  requirements. The uncertainty created by too many competing options has  made it nearly impossible for the Federal Government to accurately fund  the program, leading to billions of dollars in budget shortfalls.   Just last year, the Office of Management and the Budget said the  Direct Loan Program would cost $64 billion more than previously  anticipated in just a single fiscal year prior to the COVID-19  emergency. The COVID-19 emergency caused $39 billion in additional  unplanned for costs to the program through congressional and  administrative actions. This is unsustainable, and it is unnecessary.   We need to make it easier for student borrowers to find the best  repayment plan that works for them, and we need to make it easier for  the Federal Government to accurately account for a program on which so  many students depend. The REPAY Act would do just that, and I am here  again to introduce this commonsense proposal to help all new borrowers,  which represents approximately 20 percent of Federal student loan  borrowers each year. This bill has been previously supported by a  number of cosponsors, including Senators Warner, Rubio, Collins,  Capito, Shaheen, Carper, Wicker, Manchin, and Portman.   The REPAY Act would simplify this process by establishing just two,  easy-to-understand loan repayment plans.   The first is a fixed 10-year payment option, like most borrowers pay  now.   The second is a simplified income-driven repayment plan, which takes  into consideration how much a student borrowed verses how much they  earn.   First, this plan provides forgiveness of all outstanding debt after  the borrower fulfills their obligation to pay monthly on a 20-year term  if the student borrowed less than the maximum undergraduate borrowing  limit of $57,500 and pay monthly on a 25-year term if the student  borrowed more than the undergraduate limit.   Second, this plan provides reasonable expectations for monthly  payments. Very low-income borrowers would have a zero dollar payment.  No payments are required until a borrower earns above 150 percent of  the poverty line, which adjusts by family size and income. Modest- income borrowers would have a very low payment equal to 10 percent of  the earnings they make above 150 percent of the poverty line. Higher  income borrowers would pay 10 percent on the first $25,000 of  discretionary income they earned and 15 percent on any income above  that.   A single income-driven repayment plan assures students that there is  a reasonable repayment plan available based on their individual  earnings. It means students won't be unnecessarily discouraged from  pursuing careers that may pay less but for which they have a passion,  such as education or social work.   As I said, this is not the first time Senator King and I have  introduced this legislation, but there is added urgency this year  because of the COVID-19 pandemic and because of the reckless proposals  to simply transfer hundreds of billions in debt from individual  borrowers to the Federal Government.   Last year, as the Nation struggled to combat coronavirus, Congress  paused loan repayments for all borrowers through September 30, 2020.  The Trump and Biden administrations then extended that pause through  September 30, 2021. No borrower has been required to make a student  loan payment for the last 12 months. As the American economy recovers,  however, we cannot continue to pause payments indefinitely or, even  worse, erase large swaths of loan balances, regardless of an  individual's economic circumstance. Instead, Congress must put forward  a commonsense plan that reflects the interests of student loan  borrowers and American taxpayers.   I have cautioned Secretary Cardona against pursuing a dangerous  proposal to simply forgive student debt through administrative action,  an action which neither complies with the Federal Claims Collection  Act, the Higher Education Act, or the related regulations. Not only do  I think this isn't a legal idea, I don't believe it is a wise one,  either. It is reckless policymaking to forgive massive amounts of  existing student debt and doing so will create a profound moral hazard.  What happens after existing debt is forgiven? Will colleges magically  lower their tuition and fees, so no student ever needs to borrow again,  or will colleges continue to charge for their services, and will  students load right back up on exorbitant debt that 5, 10, or 30 years  from now the American taxpayer will be asked to write off once again?  This is an unserious gambit that doesn't come close to addressing the  real drivers of student debt.   Rather than a flash-in-the-pan trick, I propose that we take up a  durable policy solution, which includes the commonsense, bipartisan  legislation that Senator Angus King and I are advocating. Our proposal  helps ensure student loan repayment programs are understandable and  workable for future students who need them. As ranking member of the  Education Committee, I will work with our committee's chairman to move  this legislation forward. I hope that we will find a willing partner in  the White House and at the Department of Education.                                  ______                                         By Mr. THUNE (for himself, Mr. Murphy, Mr. Barrasso, Mrs. Capito,          Mr. Cramer, Mr. King, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Rounds, and Mr.          Wicker):   S. 844.
