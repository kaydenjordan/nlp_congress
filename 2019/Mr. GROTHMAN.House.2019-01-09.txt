 Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss the speech the  President gave last night. I was disturbed to see that some people, in  dealing with the crisis, including a leader on the other side of the  aisle, said that some people felt that a wall would be immoral. There  are people on late-night talk shows saying we don't have a crisis here.   I am going to point out that 90 percent of the heroin that comes in  this country, that kills over tens of thousands of people every year in  this country, comes across the border. I don't see how anybody could be  so insensitive as to say that is not a crisis and not something we have  to deal with at this time.   In the last 10 years in Texas alone, they have arrested over 2,900  people who they believe commit homicide who have come across the  border. How in the world is it not a crisis when 2,900 people--that is  almost as many people who died in the Twin Towers--are killed by people  who are in this country illegally? It is completely undermining our  immigration law.                            ____________________
