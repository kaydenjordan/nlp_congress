 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in  the Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 1222) to amend the Public Health  Service Act to coordinate Federal congenital heart disease research  efforts and to improve public education and awareness of congenital  heart disease, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the Senate amendment is as follows:   Senate amendment:         Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the       following:       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Congenital Heart Futures       Reauthorization Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. NATIONAL CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE RESEARCH,                     SURVEILLANCE, AND AWARENESS.         Section 399V-2 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C.       280g-13) is amended to read as follows:       ``SEC. 399V-2. NATIONAL CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE RESEARCH,                     SURVEILLANCE, AND AWARENESS.         ``(a) In General.--The Secretary shall, as appropriate--        ``(1) enhance and expand research and data collection       efforts related to congenital heart disease, including to       study and track the epidemiology of congenital heart disease       to understand health outcomes for individuals with congenital       heart disease across all ages;        ``(2) conduct activities to improve public awareness of,       and education related to, congenital heart disease, including       care of individuals with such disease; and        ``(3) award grants to entities to undertake the activities       described in this section.        ``(b) Activities.--        ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall carry out       activities, including, as appropriate, through a national       cohort study and a nationally-representative, population-      based surveillance system, to improve the understanding of       the epidemiology of congenital heart disease in all age       groups, with particular attention to--        ``(A) the incidence and prevalence of congenital heart       disease in the United States;        ``(B) causation and risk factors associated with, and       natural history of, congenital heart disease;        ``(C) health care utilization by individuals with       congenital heart disease;        ``(D) demographic factors associated with congenital heart       disease, such as age, race, ethnicity, sex, and family       history of individuals who are diagnosed with the disease;       and        ``(E) evidence-based practices related to care and       treatment for individuals with congenital heart disease.        ``(2) Permissible considerations.--In carrying out the       activities under this section, the Secretary may, as       appropriate--        ``(A) collect data on the health outcomes, including       behavioral and mental health outcomes, of a diverse       population of individuals of all ages with congenital heart       disease, such that analysis of the outcomes will inform       evidence-based practices for individuals with congenital       heart disease; and        ``(B) consider health disparities among individuals with       congenital heart disease, which may include the consideration       of prenatal exposures.        ``(c) Awareness Campaign.--The Secretary may carry out       awareness and educational activities related to congenital       heart disease in individuals of all ages, which may include       information for patients, family members, and health care       providers, on topics such as the prevalence of such disease,       the effect of such disease on individuals of all ages, and       the importance of long-term, specialized care for individuals       with such disease.        ``(d) Public Access.--The Secretary shall ensure that,       subject to subsection (e), information collected under this       section is made available, as appropriate, to the public,       including researchers.        ``(e) Patient Privacy.--The Secretary shall ensure that the       data and information collected under this section are made       available in a manner that, at a minimum, protects personal       privacy to the extent required by applicable Federal and       State law.        ``(f) Eligibility for Grants.--To be eligible to receive a       grant under subsection (a)(3), an entity shall--        ``(1) be a public or private nonprofit entity with       specialized experience in congenital heart disease; and        ``(2) submit to the Secretary an application at such time,       in such manner, and containing such information as the       Secretary may require.        ``(g) Authorization of Appropriations.--To carry out this       section, there are authorized to be appropriated $10,000,000       for each of fiscal years 2020 through 2024.''.       SEC. 3. REPORT.         Not later than 3 years after the date of enactment of the       Congenital Heart Futures Reauthorization Act of 2017, the       Secretary of Health and Human Services shall submit to the       Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the       Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House       of Representatives a report summarizing any activities       carried out pursuant to section 399V-2 of the Public Health       Service Act (as amended by section 2), including planned       activities, and a summary of any research findings and       ongoing research efforts, gaps, and areas of greatest need       within the Department of Health and Human Services regarding       congenital heart disease in patients of all ages.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials into the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1222, the Congenital  Heart Futures Reauthorization Act.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Representative Gus Bilirakis of  Florida, who is a valued member of our Energy and Commerce Committee,  for bringing this bill forward and for his passion on this very  important issue. As one of the original authors of this legislation, he  drove this reauthorization forward, and I am proud to stand in support  of it once again with Mr. Bilirakis.   As the parent of a child who died from a congenital heart defect, I  know how much today's vote gives hope to the parents, infants, and  adults across the country who live with the effects of congenital heart  disease, the most common birth defect and the leading cause of birth  defect-related infant mortality.   This affects 40,000 families every year. Nearly 1 in every 100 babies  is born with a congenital heart defect and roughly 25 percent of those  will need heart surgery or other significant interventions to survive.  Up to 200 each year do not survive. That is why this bill is so  important.   Originally passed in 2010, the Congenital Heart Futures Act expanded  infrastructure at the CDC and increased research at NIH to better  understand and treat patients with congenital heart defects.   The reauthorization before us today ensures continued investment in  that research, to identify the root causes of these defects and how to  address them from birth to adulthood.   Mr. Speaker, this House passed a version of this legislation earlier  this year by a vote of 394-7, and the amended version we will vote on  today passed the Senate unanimously.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to take this important step for  families across the country and to support passage of this bill into  law.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Burgess), the chair of our Subcommittee on Health.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), who has worked so  diligently and hard on this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his kind comments on this  bipartisan legislation. I think it is another fine work product from  the Energy and Commerce Committee in the area of healthcare, health  research, and helping families cope with these terrible tragedies that  befall us.   The Committee on Energy and Commerce, as you know, Mr. Speaker, has  done a lot of good work this cycle. I am especially proud of their work  on opioids and opioid addiction. Their investigative report now is  public--over 300 pages of work--looking at how Americans got hooked on  opioids, who is responsible, and what we should do going forward.   This legislation on H.R. 1222, the Congenital Heart Futures  Reauthorization Act of 2017, is another very important piece of  legislation. It too will save lives and bring hope to American  families.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in  the Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 6615) to reauthorize the  Traumatic Brain Injury program.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the Senate amendment is as follows:   Senate amendment:         Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the       following:       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Traumatic Brain Injury       Program Reauthorization Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF INJURIES.         Part J of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42       U.S.C. 280b et seq.) is amended--  [[Page H10281]]         (1) in section 393C (42 U.S.C. 280b-1d) by adding at the       end the following:        ``(c) National Concussion Data Collection and Analysis.--      The Secretary, acting through the Director of the Centers for       Disease Control and Prevention, may implement concussion data       collection and analysis to determine the prevalence and       incidence of concussion.'';        (2) in section 394A(b)(42 U.S.C. 280b-3(b)), by striking       ``$6,564,000 for each of fiscal years 2015 through 2019'' and       inserting ``$11,750,000 for each of fiscal years 2020 through       2024''; and        (3) by striking section 393C-1 (42 U.S.C. 280b-1e).       SEC. 3. STATE GRANTS FOR PROJECTS REGARDING TRAUMATIC BRAIN                     INJURY.         Section 1252 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C.       300d-52) is amended--        (1) in subsection (a), by inserting ``, acting through the       Administrator for the Administration for Community Living,''       after ``The Secretary'';        (2) by striking subsection (e);        (3) by redesignating subsections (f) through (j) as       subsections (e) through (i), respectively; and        (4) in subsection (i), as so redesignated, by striking       ``$5,500,000 for each of the fiscal years 2015 through 2019''       and inserting ``$7,321,000 for each of fiscal years 2020       through 2024''.       SEC. 4. STATE GRANTS FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY SERVICES.         Section 1253 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C.       300d-53) is amended--        (1) in subsection (a), by inserting ``, acting through the       Administrator for the Administration for Community Living,''       after ``The Secretary''; and        (2) in subsection (l), by striking ``$3,100,000 for each of       the fiscal years 2015 through 2019'' and inserting       ``$4,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2020 through 2024''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6615, the Traumatic Brain  Injury Program Reauthorization Act of 2018. I thank Representative Bill  Pascrell of New Jersey for his good work on this important legislation.  I am glad to support his efforts to bring another bipartisan public  health bill forward for the full House to consider.   Mr. Speaker, the House unanimously passed a version of this bill just  last week, and now that the Senate has made some technical changes, we  are here to pass it once again and send it to President Trump's desk so  it can become law.   H.R. 6615 will reauthorize the CDC's traumatic brain injury  initiatives, and establish a national concussion surveillance system.  This surveillance system will be able to accurately determine how many  Americans, both children and adults, get a concussion each year, and  the cause of that concussion. This data would provide real benefits to  public health officials and patients in local communities and States  across the country as we seek to better understand traumatic brain  injury and best practices surrounding these injuries.   I know all too well from personal experience--I have a brother who  was injured in a motorcycle accident and suffered pretty severe TBI--as  somebody who has dealt with that, continues to, and works with men and  women in uniform and those in my district, this is important  legislation. It will help bring hope and better health outcomes for  people who suffer from TBI and maybe even prevent a few of those  injuries along the way.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Burgess), the chairman of our Subcommittee on Health, who  has done so much work on the cause of good public policy related to  healthcare.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this is really important work. Again, I commend Mr.  Pascrell for his incredible efforts on this initiative. I know it has  taken 20 years. I might say, maybe it just took the right chairman of  the Energy and Commerce Committee to get it done finally, but it is  probably more than that.   But I just want to say, this will bring hope. It will bring better  health outcomes and will save lives with this legislation as well.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1530     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 2076) to amend the Public Health Service Act to authorize the  expansion of activities related to Alzheimer's disease, cognitive  decline, and brain health under the Alzheimer's Disease and Healthy  Aging Program, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2076         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2076, the BOLD Infrastructure  for Alzheimer's Act.   I would like to thank Representative Brett Guthrie from Kentucky for  his work to bring this bill to the House floor and for his terrific  partnership as a member and real leader on our Energy and Commerce  Committee.   Now, the BOLD Act is another bipartisan bill. It will enhance our  Nation's public health infrastructure. It will improve lives for  patients.   More than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer's. It is the most  expensive disease in our country. It costs our health system hundreds  of billions of dollars each and every year, and those numbers are only  going up.   This legislation before us now will help us address those trends by  establishing centers of excellence to improve coordination of care with  local  [[Page H10284]]  public health departments for patients in our communities. These  centers will increase data collection, analysis, and timely reporting  to better inform researchers and policymakers across the country.   For patients and their families, early intervention and coordination  of care provided at these centers can make the burden of Alzheimer's  just a little bit lighter.   I have heard about the importance of the bill from Marya in Medford,  who, in 2012, became one of the 180,000 Oregonians who serve as unpaid  Alzheimer's caregivers for a loved one. In her case, that loved one was  her father.   When her father was diagnosed, she was faced with not only a daunting  system and difficult choices to make without information, but also an  unexpected cost of care of $342,000, on average.   According to Marya, if passed, the BOLD Act would ensure States such  as Oregon have the resources necessary to support earlier detection and  diagnosis of Alzheimer's and help healthcare givers like her to grapple  with this devastating disease.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of patients and their families across our  Nation, I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this important  legislation as well.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the gentleman from New  York for his leadership on this issue as well.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Burgess), so that he can speak on the legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie), another leader on healthcare in the Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Bilirakis) to speak on the legislation.                                time  1545     Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Florida.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time remains on  each side.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter), who is a pharmacist on our  committee and a great leader on health issues on the Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I, too, join my friend and colleague from  New York and our friends across the building in the Senate in support  of the BOLD Act, S. 2076.   Mr. Speaker, I urge our colleagues to support it, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 2278) to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide grants  to improve health care in rural areas.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2278         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``State Offices of Rural       Health Reauthorization Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. STATE OFFICES OF RURAL HEALTH.         Section 338J of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C.       254r) is amended to read as follows:       ``SEC. 338J. GRANTS TO STATE OFFICES OF RURAL HEALTH.         ``(a) In General.--The Secretary, acting through the       Director of the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy       (established under section 711 of the Social Security Act),       shall make grants to each State Office of Rural Health for       the purpose of improving health care in rural areas.        ``(b) Requirement of Matching Funds.--        ``(1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary       may not make a grant under subsection (a) unless the State       office of rural health involved agrees, with respect to the       costs to be incurred in carrying out the purpose described in       such subsection, to provide non-Federal contributions toward       such costs in an amount equal to $3 for each $1 of Federal       funds provided in the grant.        ``(2) Waiver or reduction.--The Secretary may waive or       reduce the non-Federal contribution if the Secretary       determines that requiring matching funds would limit the       State office of rural health's ability to carry out the       purpose described in subsection (a).        ``(3) Determination of amount of non-federal       contribution.--Non-Federal contributions required in       paragraph (1) may be in cash or in kind, fairly evaluated,       including plant, equipment, or services.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2278, the State Offices of  Rural Health Reauthorization Act led by Senator Pat Roberts and by my  Energy and Commerce Committee colleagues Representative Markwayne  Mullin of Oklahoma and my fellow Oregonian, Kurt Schrader, here in the  House.   This important legislation reauthorizes and enhances Federal grants  to States for improving healthcare in rural areas through the operation  of State Offices of Rural Health.   Now, in my home State of Oregon, the Oregon Office of Rural Health  has been the coordinating body for frontier health since the 1970s.  This office partners with the Oregon Health & Sciences University to  improve the delivery of statewide resources to rural areas, such as the  Second District.   Telehealth, rotational programs for medical students in rural  communities, and recruitment of healthcare providers are just a few  examples of the Oregon Office of Rural Health's work to help patients  in Oregon's rural areas.   I am proud of the great work that they do, and this bill will enhance  their ability and those of all State Rural Health Offices to equip  communities with the tools they need to strengthen the delivery of  healthcare in rural and underserved areas.   So, Mr. Speaker, I strongly support passage of this legislation. I  urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Mullin), who is a cosponsor of this very important  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Burgess), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Health.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I, too, want to thank Members on both sides of the  aisle, my colleagues who have worked so hard on this legislation, and,  frankly, our friends in the Senate, as well, who worked with us on  this. We are glad to bring this to a conclusion and another very  important healthcare bill will make its way to the President's desk.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
