 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her terrific  leadership in the Strength in Diversity Act.   I am afraid the gentlewoman from North Carolina completely  misunderstood my amendment. My amendment would allow the 30 school  districts that were prevented from applying for the Opening Doors,  Expanding Opportunities grant--it would just give them the  [[Page H4411]]  first shot at reapplying. It does not guarantee acceptance for these 30  school districts but, rather, gives them a first shot at correcting the  racial injustices in their districts.   It is very sad that Secretary DeVos' first action in office was to  cut this critical program, so this offers an opportunity to right that  wrong.   I want to commend, again, the gentlewoman from Ohio for her terrific  leadership on this bill. I would like to thank Chairman Scott,  Bobby  Scott, the head of the whole committee. I would also like to thank  Barbara Lee for her critical support of this amendment.
