 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize my  home community of Gering-Scottsbluff, Nebraska for being honored as one  of the top western towns by True West Magazine.   As executive director Bob Boze Bell said in the article, ``There's so  much history, so many stories that are told in the places, the events,  the attitude of the people who live there. Scottsbluff and Gering,  together, is truly a top western town.''   Now in our sixth generation as Scotts Bluff County natives, my family  would have to agree. Sharing this honor with famous western towns such  as Tombstone, Arizona; Deadwood, South Dakota; and Sheridan, Wyoming,  Scottsbluff and Gering have their own important part of American  history and the role it played in our westward migration.   Home to one of the most famous Oregon Trail landmarks, the Scotts  Bluff National Monument, this area was known as one of the most  breathtaking sights on the journey west.   Community support and involvement has led us to this recognition.  There truly is no place like Nebraska, and I am proud to call the  Gering and Scottsbluff area my home.   I thank Brenda Leisy and Karla Neidan-Streeks for their work in  promoting our community. I also thank the people of Gering-Scottsbluff,  who, together, make our community a great place to live.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, we know that smoking is bad for us. We all agree we  don't want kids using tobacco or vaping, which is why we came together  on a bipartisan basis last year to make it hard for kids to access  these products by raising the legal age to buy them to 21.   I cosponsored last year's bill to raise the age. Mr. Suozzi was also  a cosponsor of that bill, and I am glad we got that done.   The questions we are addressing today from the Committee on Ways and  Means' perspective, however, are whether we should tax vaping products  and by how much.                                time  1030    I am going to vote ``no'' today because we don't have a good answer.   I will give the sponsor of this proposal credit. They endeavored to  tax liquid nicotine at a per-unit level comparable to the tax-to- nicotine ratio of cigarettes, and they appear to have come very close  to that goal.   However, tobacco isn't taxed because it contains nicotine. It is  taxed because we understand the serious health consequences which come  with smoking or chewing tobacco itself, and those health consequences  create vast costs for programs like Medicare and Medicaid.   If we are going to consider taxing vaped nicotine, we first need to  address the underlying issues, such as the value of vaping as a  smoking-cessation tool, the relative safety of vaped nicotine versus  cigarette smoking and what really caused the spate of vaping-related  illnesses we have seen in the past year. I will start with the easiest  one first.   According to the CDC, the vaping-related illnesses can be tied back  to vitamin E acetate, an oil used in THC vaping, not to the ingredients  used to vape nicotine. Taxing nicotine does nothing to address vitamin  E acetate.   Second, how safe is vaping compared to smoking, and what is its value  as a smoking-cessation tool?   The British Journal of Family Medicine found e-cigarettes are 95  percent safer than traditional smoking, based on the fact most harmful  chemicals from smoking are not present, and those which are present  pose a limited amount of danger.   Another study from Britain's NHS found e-cigarettes were nearly twice  as likely as nicotine gum or lozenges to help quit long term.   At the same time, a study from the nonpartisan National Bureau of  Economic Research found the State of Minnesota's efforts to bring  parity to the taxation of cigarettes and e-cigarettes actually  flatlined the State's smoking-cessation trend, while other States which  didn't raise taxes continued to see smoking decrease.   Let me say that again. The State of Minnesota's efforts to bring  parity to the taxation of cigarettes and e-cigarettes actually  flatlined the State's smoking-cessation trend, while other States which  did not raise taxes continued to see smoking decrease.   At the same time, JCT's economists tell us increasing the cost of e- cigarettes with taxes will cause some people to choose cigarettes over  e-cigarettes. That is not a choice we should be encouraging people to  make.   These are all factors which we could have considered in a bipartisan  fashion before the Ways and Means Committee marked up this bill had we  had any hearings whatsoever on vaping or this proposal itself.   Madam Speaker, we should be open to a conversation about the best way  to ensure the tax code treats tobacco and e-cigarettes appropriately.  Rushing this bill through is not the solution.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Ferguson).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from  Georgia an additional 2 minutes.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs. Miller).    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Estes).    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record 10  letters in opposition to H.R. 2339.   The first letter is from a group of letter-writers that would include  the Drug Policy Alliance, the Law Enforcement Action Partnership, the  National Action Network, the National Association of Criminal Defense  Lawyers, the National Association of Social Workers, the Center for  Popular Democracy, and the American Civil Liberties Union.   Other letters come from the National Taxpayers Union, Freedom Works,  R Street Institute, Citizens Against Government Waste, and the National  Association of Convenience Stores.                                          Monday, February 24, 2020.      Re Coalition Concerns with Blanket Prohibition on Menthol and           Other Flavored Tobacco within H.R. 2339, Reversing the           Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act.       Hon. Frank Pallone,      Chairman, House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington,           DC.        The undersigned civil rights and civil liberties       organizations write to express concerns with a broad       prohibition on menthol and other flavored tobacco products       within H.R. 2339, the Reversing the Youth Tobacco Epidemic       Act of 2019. While this legislation is a well-intended effort       to address health issues associated with tobacco use among       youth, we have concerns that a blanket prohibition on menthol       and other flavored tobacco products, which will apply to       adults, will (1) disproportionately impact people and       communities of color; (2) trigger criminal penalties,       prioritizing criminalization over public health and harm       reduction; and (3) instigate unconstitutional policing and       other negative interactions with local law enforcement.   I. H.R. 2339 Disproportionately Impacts People and Communities of Color         Of adults, approximately 80 percent of Blacks and 35       percent of Latinx who choose to smoke prefer menthol       cigarettes. Thus, any ban on menthol cigarettes will       disproportionately affect people of color. While H.R. 2339       and similar legislation are often motivated by the desire to       decrease and  [[Page H1277]]       eliminate smoking among certain populations, Blacks and other       people of color should not disproportionately bear the brunt       of enforcement of such prohibitions, which a menthol ban       would ensure.        Similarly, enforcement of a ban on flavored cigars will       also disproportionally impact people of color given cigar       preferences. Black adults are 60% of cigarillo and non-      premium cigar smokers, with these products often flavored.       Additionally, at Committee markup, H.R. 2339 was amended to       exempt certain traditional, expensive cigars from a       prohibition of online tobacco sales. There is no       justification for differentiating a La Palina from a Black       and Mild. Making this distinction undermines the public       health arguments made for this bill and suggests that some       tobacco preferences, within certain communities, will be       prioritized and protected over others.        II. H.R. 2339 Increases Criminal Penalties Over Public Health         H.R. 2339 prohibits menthol and other flavored tobacco       products under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act).       This prohibition criminalizes the manufacturing, importing,       distributing, or selling of menthol and other flavored       tobacco products under the FD&C Act, imposing up to three       years of imprisonment. Violating a menthol and flavored       tobacco ban would implicate other federal criminal penalties       as well. For example, the Federal Cigarette Contraband       Trafficking Act would be implicated, allowing up to five       years of imprisonment.        With a criminal legal system that incarcerates Blacks at       nearly six times the rate of white Americans and a prison       population that is 67 percent Black and Latinx, any       prohibition on menthol and flavored tobacco products promises       continued overcriminalization and mass incarceration of       people of color. A ban on menthol and flavored tobacco       products could reintroduce many of the harms imposed by the       failed war on drugs as lawmakers work to legalize cannabis       and take a public health approach to opioids. A bill       criminalizing tobacco is contrary to those efforts. Righting       the wrongs of earlier failed drug policy requires       consideration of the unintended consequences of well-      intentioned policies, especially on the most vulnerable       communities. It also requires us to remember that harm       reduction, including education and counseling, are what work       to reduce usage and harm in our society, not prohibition.              III. H.R. 2339 Encourages Harmful Police Practices         Recent history shows us that drug prohibitions and bans       increase negative interactions between law enforcement and       people of color. The New York Police Department's (NYPD) stop       and frisk program resulted in nearly 700,000 stops in 2011,       with drugs serving as the alleged pretext for most of those       stops. Ninety percent of those stops were of Black and Latinx       people. We are concerned that law enforcement's attempts to       enforce a menthol and flavored tobacco ban will undoubtedly       lead to fines, arrests, and eventual incarceration for those       who continue to use and sell menthol and flavored tobacco       products. While the legislation was amended at Committee to       try to minimize law enforcement practices here, it only       applies in the context of federal enforcement of the FD&C       Act; it does not govern local enforcement around any state       and city prohibition policies that will follow.        The death of Eric Garner in 2014 generated national       attention not only for the brutality he experienced at the       hands of NYPD police, but for the reason that led to the       encounter with law enforcement. Mr. Garner died from an       illegal chokehold having been stopped by police for selling       single cigarettes in violation of state law. Gwendolyn Carr,       Eric Garner's mother, cautions: ``When you ban a product sold       mostly in Black communities, you must consider the reality of       what will happen to that very same overrepresented community       in the criminal justice system.'' With a federal prohibition       on menthol and flavored tobacco products, states will develop       their own prohibition and enforcement policies that could       result in harmful police practices like that witnessed with       Mr. Garner.        Based on our concerns, we urge you to not impose a blanket       ban on menthol and related tobacco products. A prohibition on       all menthol and flavored tobacco products will not achieve a       public heath goal of reducing smoking among Black people,       young people, or others. We hope we can work together to       avoid repetitions of policies that are intended to protect       youth and communities of color, but instead only further       engrain systemic criminalization and racism.            Sincerely,        American Civil Liberties Union, Drug Policy Alliance, Law       Enforcement Action Partnership, National Action Network,       National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, National       Association of Social Workers, The Center for Popular       Democracy.                                   ____                                         National Taxpayers Union,                                                  February 25, 2020.        National Taxpayers Union urges all Representatives to vote       ``NO'' on H.R. 2339, the ``Protecting American Lungs and       Reversing the Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act'' of 2020. This       disastrous legislation would significantly raise taxes and       limit the ability for cigarette smokers to transition to less       harmful vapor and e-cigarette products.        As written, H.R. 2339 contains one of the largest tax       increases considered by the 116th Congress to date. This       legislation would levy a new excise tax on nicotine contained       in vaping products to match the rate of the federal cigarette       excise tax and could raise nearly $10 billion, according to       CBO. It's a significant tax hike that will severely harm       consumers and small business owners. While there is likely to       be harm to the economic health of the country, there would       also be damage to the health of adults transitioning away       from deadly cigarettes. According to a study published by the       National Bureau of Economic Research, taxing vapor products       at the same rate as traditional cigarettes would deter       approximately 2.75 million Americans from kicking their       habit. In other words, tax policy alone could make it less       likely that millions of Americans make choices that would       improve their health.        It is particularly concerning that this legislation       prohibits all flavors of tobacco products, including menthol.       In their attempts to quit, adult tobacco smokers typically       start with tobacco-flavored e-liquid, but research indicates       many end up switching to other flavors that this legislation       would prohibit. Cracking down on legal-age buyers of flavored       e-cigarettes will limit access to less harmful alternatives       that could potentially save hundreds of thousands of lives       each year. Blanket prohibitions are seldom successful and       often lead consumers to untaxed and unregulated black markets       to access products.        These devastating provisions completely disregard the       benefits vapor products have as an important cigarette       cessation tool. Vapor products still allow users to consume       nicotine, but avoid the traditional combustion of cigarettes,       which contain toxins and other dangerous chemicals. Some       government studies have found that e-cigarettes are 95       percent safer than traditional tobacco products and can be as       much as twice as effective as gum or patches to help users       quit. Smoking is a high-risk activity and providing smokers       with a way to consume nicotine in a safer way is a large       public health benefit, increasing life expectancy and       reducing mortality.        Roll call votes on H.R. 2339 will be heavily-weighted in       NTU's annual Rating of Congress and a ``NO'' vote will be       considered the pro-taxpayer position.                                   ____                                                     FreedomWorks,                                                  February 26, 2020.               Key Vote No on the Quit or Die Act, H.R. 2339         On behalf of FreedomWorks' activist community, I urge you       to contact your representative and ask him or her to vote NO       on the ``Protecting American Lungs and Reversing the Youth       Tobacco Epidemic Act,'' H.R. 2339. This bill is nothing short       of an assault on the vaping industry, which provides smokers       with a method of harm reduction that is 95 percent safer than       traditional, combustible cigarettes. The message House       Democrats are sending with H.R. 2339 is that Americans who       want to kick the habit through vaping should either ``quit or       die.''        H.R. 2339 would outright ban online sales of flavored       vaping products, and ban the flavors themselves. The bill       would also require graphic health warnings on tobacco       packaging. This is nanny state governance at its worst.        Despite the bill's wildly misleading short title, it will       not, in fact, do anything to combat youth usage of tobacco       products. What it will do is make it more difficult for adult       smokers to quit on their own terms. This bill prohibits the       use of any and all characterizing flavors of tobacco       products, including menthol. It's important to note this is       not limited to e-cigarettes. Traditional menthol cigarettes       would become illegal if this bill were made law.        The sponsors of H.R. 2339, Reps. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) and       Donna Shalala (D-Fla.), have put a stark choice before       smokers in the United States: quit or die. Studies have shown       that e-cigarettes are both 95 percent less harmful than       traditional cigarettes and a more effective means of       quitting. H.R. 2339 takes that option entirely off the table.       Under this legislation, if smokers cannot quit cold turkey,       they are left to suffer the crippling medical consequences on       their own.        This bill also presents a variety of First Amendment       concerns. It would require tobacco companies to provide       graphic health warnings on their packaging. This is compelled       commercial speech by the government, something that's been       ruled unconstitutional a number of times. The late Supreme       Court Justice Lewis Powell set forth a test for government       regulation of commercial speech. The two prongs were that in       order to be regulated, the existing labeling must actively be       misleading and there must be a substantial government       interest involved. The Pallone-Shalala bill fails both tests.        Furthermore, this bill greatly increases the Food and Drug       Administration's (FDA) authority to regulate this space. The       FDA would have the ability to hand down even more stringent       regulations on the sale of existing products and collect fees       or taxes on them. This is an unacceptable growth of an       unelected bureaucratic agency.        Amusingly, this package contains a provision that would       require a study to be conducted on the effects of e-      cigarettes. This is a clear admission by the drafters of this       legislation that they not only ignored the medical research       surrounding vaping but that they also have no intention of       doing so before they wholesale ban an entire category of       products.  [[Page H1278]]         H.R. 2339 also includes the text of H.R. 4742. This aspect       of the bill would impose a new excise tax on nicotine used in       vaping, at a rate of $50.33 per 1,810 milligrams or at a       proportional rate. The Congressional Budget Office projects       that H.R. 4742 would increase tax revenues by nearly $10       billion over ten years. Obviously, this bill is aimed at       deterring people from vaping by increasing the costs, which       will be passed along to the consumer at the point of sale.        This kind of excise tax typically impacts lower-income       individuals. The National Center for Biotechnological       Information notes, ``In 2013, the prevalence of smoking among       US adults living at or below the US Census poverty threshold       was 80% greater than that of those living above the poverty       line (33.8% compared to 18.7%). This elevated prevalence is       in part due to the reality that compared to more advantaged       smokers, over time disadvantaged smokers have a lesser       likelihood of quitting.''        We find it peculiar that House Democrats, who have so       frequently relied on class warfare rhetoric to push a       socialist agenda, have sought to protect the state and local       tax (SALT) deduction--which overwhelmingly benefits higher-      income earners in high-tax states like California, New       Jersey, and New York--but are so willing to hit lower-income       individuals with such a regressive tax. We find the hypocrisy       palpable.        Because H.R. 2339 creates new prohibitions on certain       activities--including banning menthol and other flavors--it       opens up the possibility of criminal penalties under the       Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 333) and the Federal       Cigarette Contraband Trafficking Act (18 U.S.C. 2344). In       short, individuals who participate in this behavior could be       exposed to fines and prison time.        FreedomWorks will count the vote on H.R. 2339 on our 2020       Congressional Scorecard and reserves the right to score any       related votes. The scorecard is used to determine eligibility       for the FreedomFighter Award, which recognizes Members of the       House and Senate who consistently vote to support economic       freedom and individual liberty.            Sincerely,                                                      Adam Brandon,      President, FreedomWorks.                                   ____                                                         R Street,                                  Washington, DC, February 25, 2020.        Dear Speaker Pelosi, Minority Leader McCarthy and Members       of the House of Representatives: The R Street Institute--a       nonprofit, nonpartisan public policy research organization       focused on pragmatic solutions to policy challenges--has a       number of concerns with H.R. 2339, the ``Reversing the Youth       Tobacco Epidemic Act of 2019.'' We recognize that preventing       non-smoking young people from establishing both e-cigarette       and combustible cigarette use is vital to the future health       of the population. However, it is important to recognize that       smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the       United States, and we must continually evaluate the available       strategies for decreasing tobacco-related morbidity and       mortality. E-cigarettes provide such a strategy.        Undoubtedly, the youth use trend is cause for concern and       continued investigation. However, this cannot be the only       measure of the effect of e-cigarettes on population health.       Based on the body of research as a whole, we urge the       committee to consider pursuing policies that reflect the       short- and long-term population health impact of e-cigarettes       relative to the known harms of combustible cigarettes.         E-cigarettes are a harm reduction and smoking cessation tool         The best available science indicates e-cigarettes are not       likely to exceed 5 percent of the harm associated with       combustible cigarettes, a conclusion supported by both Public       Health England and recently the National Academies of       Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. Also, like traditional       nicotine replacement therapies, e-cigarettes do not produce       environmental tobacco smoke that harms bystanders. It is       estimated that e-cigarettes have the potential to save up to       6 million lives by 2100 if only 10 percent of current smokers       switch to e-cigarettes in the next 10 years.        Many experts recognize that e-cigarettes present a reduced       risk because they do not employ the traditional cigarette       combustion process that releases around 7,000 chemicals--some       of which are highly carcinogenic. For this reason, one such       expert, former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb, has made       reduced-risk products like e-cigarettes central to the FDA's       roadmap:        While it's the addiction to nicotine that keeps people       smoking, it's primarily the combustion, which releases       thousands of harmful constituents into the body at dangerous       levels that kills people. This fact represents both the       biggest challenge to curtailing cigarette addiction--and also       holds the seeds of an opportunity that's a central construct       for our actions. E-cigarettes may present an important       opportunity for adult smokers to transition off combustible       tobacco products.        Although there are a number of pharmaceutical products that       can help smokers quit, it is important to remember that it is       not only nicotine dependence that makes quitting combustible       cigarettes difficult. For some, smoking offers stress relief,       comradery or other psycho-social pleasure, and some even       consider it a component of their identity. This often makes       the physical act of smoking just as difficult to quit as the       nicotine. Unlike the FDA-approved methods of smoking       cessation, e-cigarettes do not force a smoker to forgo the       secondary pleasure they get from the act of smoking while       they are adjusting to the physiological effects of decreased       nicotine.        Indeed, e-cigarettes have quickly become the number one       quit tool in many parts of the world, allowing an untold       number of smokers to quit cigarettes. Public health modeling       has suggested that e-cigarettes are contributing to more       rapid declines in smoking rates than were seen in previous       years. In the United States and the United Kingdom e-      cigarettes have outpaced traditional quit methods       (varenicline, nicotine replacement therapies and counseling)       and demonstrate a higher degree of success. Furthermore, in a       randomized trial, smokers who used e-cigarettes as a       cessation device achieved sustained abstinence at roughly       twice the rate of smokers who used nicotine replacement       therapy.       Flavors help smokers transition away from combustible cigarettes         The availability of non-tobacco flavors also assists       smokers with the transition away from combustible cigarettes.       The International Journal of Environmental Research and       Public Health reports that limitations in flavor choices       negatively impact user experience. About 40 percent of former       and current adult smokers predict that removing their ability       to choose flavors would make them less likely to remain       abstinent or attempt to quit. In fact, data suggests that       current smokers are partial to the flavor of traditional       tobacco, while fruit and sweet flavors are preferred by       former smokers, indicating a correlation between flavors and       sustained abstinence from combustible cigarettes.        Moreover, it has recently been demonstrated that e-      cigarette users who use non-tobacco flavors, including       menthol and non-menthol (fruit, sweet, dessert) flavors are       more likely to completely switch from combustible cigarettes       than those who choose tobacco flavors. Flavored e-liquids are       yet another way that e-cigarettes can help smokers       disassociate combustible cigarettes--and the characteristic       flavor--from their pleasurable effects.        Although many organizations and leaders suggest flavors       attract young people to e-cigarettes, the 2019 National Youth       Tobacco Survey casts doubt on that assertion. Among middle       school and high school students, the most commonly endorsed       reason for using e-cigarettes was ``I was curious about       them.'' Overall, 53 percent of students surveyed indicated       curiosity as a reason they use e-cigarettes. The second most       common reason for use was if a student's friend or family       member used e-cigarettes. With just 22 percent of students       endorsing availability of flavors as a reason for vaping, it       is clear that social factors, not flavors, are the driving       force behind youth e-cigarette use.    R Street applauds raising the age of purchase of all tobacco products                                   to 21         Of course, smokers are not the only population impacted by       e-cigarettes, and addressing youth use is important. Our       organization, the R Street Institute, endorsed raising the       minimum age of purchase for all tobacco products to 21, which       was signed into law Dec. 20, 2019. This change will help       prevent youth access in high school by limiting opportunities       for younger students to buy from peers who, prior to the       federal minimum-age-to-purchase increase, obtained the       products legally. In combination with more stringent point-      of-sale age verification and meaningful penalties for       merchants who violate minimum-age-to-purchase laws, this       change will significantly limit youth access.        The impact of nationwide 21-to-purchase legislation is yet       to be evaluated; however, evidence from areas that raised the       minimum age to purchase prior to the federal legislation       suggests that this change will be highly effective at       decreasing youth tobacco use. Following implementation of a       21-to-purchase law in Needham, Massachusetts, there was an       unprecedented 47 percent reduction (from 13 to 7 percent) in       past 30-day smoking rates among high schoolers over four       years (2008-2012).        R Street does not support banning non-face-to-face sales of e-                                cigarettes         It is imperative that the availability of reduced-risk       alternatives remains in place for people who use e-cigarettes       as a cessation tool. According to the 2016 Surgeon General's       Report, in 2014, 20 percent of all e-cigarette sales occurred       online. It is estimated that in 2018, 32 percent of all e-      cigarette sales occurred online. As more proposals arise to       limit what kinds of brick and mortar establishments are able       to sell e-cigarettes or other reduced-risk products--all       while protecting combustible sales--online sales may be the       only point of access for people who, for many reasons, cannot       reach specialty stores. It should not be a surprise to the       committee that people who live with disabilities, are       economically disadvantaged or live in rural areas are       overrepresented in the smoking population. These particular       factors represent true barriers to face-to-face access to       specialty products. Online sales and delivery may be the only       way that smokers have access to safer products.        Furthermore, there is a misperception that online sales of       e-cigarettes are more vulnerable to underage access. Legal       retailers that sell their products online have strict FDA-      mandated age verification systems that are successful in       preventing underage access to their products. Unverified       underage sales  [[Page H1279]]       largely occur on eBay or other websites where age       verification is not vital. Banning non-face-to-face sales       will not stop illegitimate online sales to underage persons       from occurring, as these sales are already illegal.                  the fda's role in protecting public health         Finally, it is important to recognize that the FDA has       developed a regulatory pathway to evaluate the safety and       public health impact of all new tobacco products, including       considerations of flavors. This is a process that has been       carefully designed over several years to ensure new tobacco       products, like e-cigarettes, will not have a negative impact       on the health of the population as a whole. Given that       manufacturers must file their Premarket Tobacco Applications       for all deemed tobacco products, which includes virtually all       e-cigarettes, by May 12, 2020 or risk removal from the       market, it makes sense to delay enacting any federal bans.       Allowing the safety and regulatory experts at the FDA to lead       the way in authorizing the sale of these products is the most       appropriate way forward, something acknowledged by       Sec. 103(d.2) of this bill.        Policies that treat e-cigarettes the same as combustible       cigarettes encourage current smokers to continue doing       enormous harm to their health by discouraging a switch from       combustible products. Conversely, policies that reflect the       lesser harm of e-cigarettes can significantly reduce the       enormous burden of disease that combustible cigarettes impose       on society.        One thing is certain: We are all striving to improve and       protect the nation's health. To do so, we must recognize the       potential for e-cigarettes to mitigate risks associated with       combustible cigarettes if we wish to encourage a healthful       populace. We encourage you to consider policies that reflect       the reduced risk of e-cigarettes compared to combustible       cigarettes as we work towards creating a healthier       population.        Thank you for your time and consideration.            Respectfully submitted,      Carrie Wade, Ph.D., M.P.H.,        Director of Harm Reduction Policy, R Street Institute.      Chelsea Boyd, M.S.,        Research Associate in Harm Reduction Policy, R Street       Institute.                                   ____                                                  February 14, 2020.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On November 19, 2019, H.R. 2339, the       Reversing the Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act of 2019, was       reported out of the Energy and Commerce Committee. It is       likely you will vote on this legislation before the end of       February.        The Council for Citizens Against Government Waste (CCAGW)       understands the concerns Congress has with youth use of       tobacco products, particularly electronic nicotine delivery       systems (ENDS) and vaping, but legislation was passed in       December 2019 that raised the age from 18 to 21 for the legal       use of any tobacco product. It would seem obvious that       Congress should allow that new law to take hold before H.R.       2339, a far more drastic measure, is even considered. If this       bill should become law, it would create a black market that       will cause great harm to our citizens. On behalf of the more       than 1 million members and supporters of CCAGW, I ask that       you oppose H.R. 2339.        The legislation would make it illegal to sell any flavored       ENDS product and ban flavors in other tobacco products,       including menthol, mint, and spice flavors found in       combustible cigarettes and non-combustible products like       flavored cigars and chewing tobacco. Only natural tobacco       flavor would be allowed.        Adults use ENDS and other non-combustible harm-reduction       tobacco products to quit smoking because they enjoy the sweet       and fruity flavors, finding them essential in moving away       from smoking. Banning menthol and other flavors, like spices       and herbs found in combustible cigarettes and other products       like chewing tobacco, will encourage many current users to       find other sources of these flavors. Menthol crystals can       easily be bought and enterprising street vendors will be       eager to sell a variety of flavorings for all tobacco users.        Much of the impetus behind H.R. 2339 was based on reports       that youth use of e-cigarettes had climbed significantly. The       2019 National Youth Tobacco Survey data showed that 64.8       percent of youth had never tried an e-cigarette and 6.7       percent had used an e-cigarette in their entire life for more       than 100 days. The largest percent of youth purchased their       e-cigarette from a friend, not a store. Certainly, 6.7       percent is a number to be concerned about but whether that       should be considered an epidemic and warrant passing such       radical legislation that will hurt adults who are using harm       reduction tobacco products to quit smoking is questionable.        For example, according to 2017 Centers for Disease Control       (CDC) statistics, it was found that among high school       students, during the past 30 days, 30 percent drank some       amount of alcohol; 14 percent binge drank; 6 percent drove       after drinking alcohol; and, 17 percent rode with a driver       who had been drinking alcohol. Yet despite these numbers,       Congress is not calling for a ban on alcohol. That was tried       before with disastrous results.        In late summer and into the early fall, there were reports       of severe illnesses and death due to a national outbreak of       ``e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung       injury'' or EVALI. The CDC admits that as of February 11,       2020 the data shows tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-containing e-      cigarette, or vaping products, which were obtained from       ``informal sources like friends, family, or in-person or       online dealers, are linked to most EVALI cases and play a       major role in the outbreak'' and that ``Vitamin E acetate is       strongly linked to the EVALI outbreak.''        In other words, it was the illicit market that caused the       problem, not the legitimate ENDS market that produces       thousands of jobs and helps millions of ex-smokers stay away       from combustible cigarettes that Congress and the Food and       Drug Administration are so keen to destroy.        Fortunately, the EVALI cases have dropped significantly, so       Congress and health officials should take heed. Tobacco is a       legal product in the U.S. and even if Congress could ban it,       there should be little doubt that China would step in and       flood an illicit market as it is the leading producer of       tobacco in the world. The same result will occur if flavors       are banned, especially with ENDS products. Current adult       users will either go back to combustible cigarettes, which       are deadly, or take the chance and purchase illegal products.       Congress will have created a real health crisis that could       have been avoided.        Again, I urge you to vote no on H.R. 2339. All votes on       this legislation will be among those considered for CCAGW's       2020 Congressional Ratings.            Sincerely,                                                        Tom Schatz,      President, CCAGW.                                   ____                                                             NACS,                                  Alexandria, VA, February 24, 2020.      Re Key Vote Alert: Oppose the Reversing the Youth Tobacco           Epidemic Act of 2019 (H.R. 2339).       Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leader McCarthy: The National       Association of Convenience Stores (NACS) represents the       convenience industry, which has approximately 153,000 stores       in the United States and employees over 2.36 million workers.       In 2018, the convenience industry generated $654.3 billion in       total sales. Convenience stores serve about 165 million       people per day--around half of the U.S. population--and the       industry processes nearly 75 billion payment transactions per       year. Yet, the industry is truly an industry of small       businesses--approximately 62 percent of convenience store       owners operate a single store, and approximately 74 percent       of NACS' membership is composed of companies that operate ten       stores or fewer.        The industry has devoted a substantial amount of time and       resources to ensuring that convenience store operators are       equipped to comply with federal, state, and local tobacco       regulations. NACS shares Congress's concern with the number       of underage users of e-cigarettes and supports legislative       efforts to curb underage use of tobacco products.        NACS, however, opposes certain provisions in the Reversing       the Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act of 2019 (H.R. 2339). H.R. 2339       would ban all flavored tobacco products--including menthol       cigarettes, flavored smokeless tobacco, and flavored cigars--      which in turn would create an illicit market for these       flavored tobacco products.        It's important for lawmakers to understand the impact that       banning flavored tobacco products would have on the market.       Today, the menthol market accounts for roughly 30 percent of       cigarette sales and the flavored market accounts for roughly       50 percent of cigar sales. What's more, nearly 86 percent of       smokeless tobacco sales are for flavored products. It is       unreasonable to assume that consumers will simply transition       away from these flavored products to unflavored tobacco       alternatives.        Instead, a ban on menthol cigarettes, flavored smokeless       tobacco, and flavored cigars will undoubtedly lead to a black       market for these products because of the broad consumer base       that exists among adult users. When that happens, the illicit       purveyors of menthol cigarettes, flavored smokeless tobacco,       and flavored cigars, operating outside of the law, will not       discriminate among their customers based on age. We already       see this problem in the large illicit tobacco market that       exists today.        Moreover, growth in the illicit market for tobacco       increases health concerns. Congress, when it passed the       Tobacco Control Act in 2009, granted the Food and Drug       Administration (FDA) the authority to regulate tobacco       products, including oversight into how tobacco products are       manufactured. Tobacco manufacturers create products that are       fully scrutinized and regulated by FDA; black market       suppliers may ignore those regulations. Banning menthol       cigarettes, flavored smokeless tobacco, and flavored cigars       will eliminate FDA's oversight of these products, an       important public health safeguard that Congress intended in       the Tobacco Control Act.  [[Page H1280]]         A ban of menthol cigarettes, flavored smokeless tobacco,       and flavored cigars also will create a ``grey'' market.       Without a domestic source for these products, adult users       will purchase them over the Internet, when they travel       abroad, and through bulk importers/distributors. Again, these       products will be unregulated by the FDA, therefore losing       whatever health protections that Congress intended in the       Tobacco Control Act.        The FDA needs to have a plan and demonstrated ability to       deal with the problems of the illicit market for tobacco       products before anyone considers a ban on menthol cigarettes,       flavored smokeless tobacco, and flavored cigars. If a ban       comes first, children and public health will be negatively       impacted by the resulting illicit market.        Because of these concerns, NACS is key voting the bill and       urges you to vote against H.R. 2339.            Respectfully,                                                     Lyle Beckwith,                       Senior Vice President, Government Relations.     Madam Speaker, I will include letters from  Americans for Tax Reform, Altria, Taxpayer Protection Alliance, and the  Tax Foundation.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   It is important to note that I previously asked for some letters to  be entered into the Record, and I think it is important to note some of  the points that these organizations raise back to the ACLU and the  Association of Social Workers and other groups.   They talk about this bill leading to overcriminalization and mass  incarceration of people of color. It talks about the bill  disproportionately impacting people in communities of color.   I think our country has had some, I think, very constructive  conversations of late relating to these issues of mass incarceration  and overcriminalization, and I think this bill sets us back in terms of  those conversations that we have been having.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, as we have this exchange here,  it is interesting to dig a little deeper here and certainly realize  that there is a carve-out. I think we heard earlier there is a carve- out, actually, that would exempt the high-end cigars that would not  have to be subject to this tax. And I guess I struggle to think why  that would be if there are revenue concerns here and, you know, looking  at a balance and so forth.   I just hope that we can end up with good public policy, but certainly  this is not the vehicle to do that.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   As we wrap up this discussion, I think perhaps both sides have good  intentions. This would not be the first time that both sides would have  good intentions, and the outcome would accomplish the exact opposite  from what we would want.   We want youth to not vape, to not smoke. It is dangerous. And,  certainly, I think we should also respect law-abiding adults exercising  the choices that they wish to make in a reasonable context.   Madam Speaker, I think that this bill would actually set us back in  many ways. As I mentioned earlier, the National Bureau of Economic  Research found that Minnesota's efforts to bring so-called parity to  the taxation of cigarettes and e-cigarettes actually flatlined the  State's smoking-cessation trend, while other States that didn't raise  taxes continue to see smoking decrease. That is very telling. And I  think it is very instructive for all of us here as we formulate policy  and, hopefully, keep future generations in mind with good public policy  along the way.   Madam Speaker, I certainly urge a vote ``no'' on this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record these  additional letters in opposition to H.R. 2339.   6 Reasons To Oppose HR 2339 (Pallone) Total Flavored Tobacco Product                                Prohibition         1. This bill bans all flavored tobacco products.        That means menthol cigarettes (36% of market), flavored       moist smokeless tobacco (60% of market), flavored cigars (26%       of market), and most pipe tobacco.        2. The age for tobacco was just raised to 21 nationwide.        Teen vapor trends need to be reversed. That's why Congress       just raised the minimum age for all tobacco products to 21.       Also, the FDA is now taking concrete steps to remove child-      friendly vapor products from the market. We should give these       policies time to work.        3. Adults 21 + can choose flavors in alcohol and cannabis       (where legal), and they should be able to choose flavors in       tobacco.        Adults 21 and older buy alcohol (and cannabis where it's       legal). They are taxpayers, voters, and can serve in the       military. Taking this decision away from adults 21 and over       won't stop the behavior--it will just move it into the       illegal market. We should respect adults and let them make       these decisions.        4. Prohibition doesn't work. It never has.        This bill would criminalize the sale and distribution of       these products for adults. That's Prohibition. In the 1920s,       Alcohol Prohibition created an illegal market, increased       crime, burdened law enforcement, and endangered the public.        5. Youth use of traditional products is DOWN. Underage       vapor rates are too high. But underage use of traditional       tobacco products is at historic lows. Longstanding public       health efforts are working--so why take the risk of       criminalizing these products and moving them into an illegal       market where there is no regulation?        6. Banning large segments of the tobacco market guts       government revenues.        Banning the sale of flavored tobacco products to adults       would impact over a third of the industry, devastating jobs       and the economy:        Over 250,000 retail and other jobs at risk        Over $13.6 billion in federal, state, and local tax       revenues at risk annually (see states detail below)                                   ____                           Americans for Tax Reform         Today, Americans for Tax Reform issued a Key Vote Alert in       opposition to H.R. 2339.        Here are the top 6 key facts you need to know before the       vote on the full House floor vote on H.R. 2339 (Reversing the       Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act) this week:        1. Prohibition Never Works, But it Does Create Profitable       Criminal Enterprises.        2. Congress Just Passed Tobacco 21 to Address Youth Use of       Tobacco Products.        3. A Flavored Tobacco Product Ban Would Kill Over 400,000       Jobs.        4. State, Local, and Federal Government Would Lose over       $130 Billion in Tobacco Tax Revenue Over 10 Years.        5. Criminalizing The Sale of Some Tobacco Products Would       Reverse Progress on Criminal Justice Reform.        6. This Bill is a Tax Increase.        Rep. Frank Pallone's flavored tobacco product ban bill is       opposed by Americans for Tax Reform, Citizens Against       Government Waste, FreedomWorks, Heritage Action, Taxpayers       Protection Alliance, Independent Women's Forum, the       Competitive Enterprise Institute, the Consumer Choice Center,       and Reason, among others.        But it's also opposed by the American Civil Liberties       Union, the Center for Popular Democracy, the Law Enforcement       Action Partnership, the Drug Policy Alliance, the National       Association of Social Workers, the National Association of       Criminal Defense Lawyers, and Al Sharpton's National Action       Network. You can read their letter here.        Here's what you need to known regarding the inclusion of a       new national tax on nicotine e-cigarettes and vapor products       (Section 501 of the bill):        The tax imposed by this bill would result in a $5.01 tax on       an average 30 milliliter bottle of refillable vapor product       liquid that contains 6 milligrams of nicotine, the type of       products many smokers purchase in thousands of vape shops in       America. For multi-packs of ``closed-system'' products sold       in 150,000 convenience stores, the tax would be range between       $3-5 per pack. Compare that to the federal excise tax on       combustible tobacco cigarettes, which is $1.01 per pack.       Taxing reduced risk electronic cigarettes at a significantly       higher rate than cigarettes works at cross purposes with both       the government and free market's ongoing effort to reduce the       harm associated with cigarette use. That's what this bill       does.        Note: because this language was previously a stand-alone       bill (H.R. 4742), the impact on taxpayers has changed since       it was first scored. Banning products that +80% of adult       consumers use diminishes the likelihood of collecting much       money. This bill is still a net tax hike and will be scored       as such.        Americans for Tax Reform urges you to reject H.R. 2339,       which would create the biggest black market in America since       the 1920's, fueling criminal enterprises without any good       reason for doing so. This bill is a tax increase and       represents a moral crusade against disfavored consumer       choices without respect to the tools that already exist that       could address some of the concerns of proponents.                                   ____                                    Taxpayers Protection Alliance,                                  Washington, DC, February 12, 2020.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of millions of taxpayers and       consumers across the United States, the Taxpayers Protection       Alliance (TPA) urges you to vote against the Reversing the       Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act (H.R. 2339), which would, amongst       other things, impose a full ban on the sale of flavored e-      cigarette products throughout the U.S. H.R. 2339 would also       ban menthol-flavored conventional tobacco. These deeply       misguided proposals would lead to the demise of millions of       Americans by forcing smokers across the country to continue       using deadly combustible cigarettes.        The scientific evidence is overwhelming and       incontrovertible that vaping saves lives. Flavors provide an       effective exit ramp for adults to quit smoking but have no       impact upon teen uptake. Smoking rates are at their lowest in       history and dropping dramatically. Furthermore, there is no       gateway from vaping to smoking, and menthol cigarettes have       no demonstrable impact on youth uptake.        Countless studies conclude that e-cigarettes are a proven       and safe way for people to quit smoking. A recent U.S.       National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine       report on e-cigarettes found that, based on the available       evidence, ``e-cigarettes are likely to be far less harmful       than combustible tobacco cigarettes.'' The United Kingdom       (UK) Government and all major medical bodies now       ``encourage'' smokers to use e-cigarettes as a quit-smoking       aid. This is not surprising because of the overwhelming       evidence on the effectiveness of a product that is ``around       95 percent less harmful than smoking,'' a figure confirmed by       Public Health England (part of the U.K. government) and       reaffirmed every year since 2015. Similarly, air quality       studies have found that e-cigarettes pose no threat to       bystanders via ``passive smoking.'' Hundreds of studies have       been published in the course of the last few years, measuring       everything from cardiovascular health to lung capacity and       regeneration. In fact, the only study to have found any       negative impact of vaping on heart health has been thoroughly       debunked; it was discovered that the heart attacks it claimed       were correlated to vaping happened ten years prior to the       individuals taking up vaping.        So powerful is the life-saving potential of these products       that, according to the most comprehensive peer-reviewed       research on the effects of switching coordinated by the       George Washington University Medical Center, 6.6 million       lives could be saved over the next ten years if a majority of       U.S. smokers quit smoking through the use of e-cigarettes.  [[Page H1284]]         In addition, numerous studies have shown that e-cigarettes       are considerably more effective than traditional nicotine       replacement therapies. In January 2019, the New England       Journal of Medicine reported the results of the largest and       most comprehensive of these, finding unequivocally that e-      cigarettes are nearly twice as effective as conventional       nicotine replacement products (such as patches and gum) for       quitting smoking.        As a result of the introduction of vaping products, smoking       rates in the United States have plummeted in recent years. In       2018, 13.7 percent of U.S. adults smoked, a sharp decline       from 20.9 percent in 2005. Most of this decline has occurred       since the introduction of e-cigarettes, as smokers now have       more options than ever to kick their deadly habit. In       particular, 5.8 percent of high school students smoke, down       from more than 15 percent in 2011.        Contrary to anti-vaping arguments, there is no evidence       that e-cigarettes provide a ``gateway'' to smoking for youths       as they enter adulthood. This has been demonstrated through       numerous studies which instead find that vaporized nicotine       has almost exclusively been taken up by smokers attempting to       quit or lower their intake, therefore acting as a ``gateway''       away from tobacco smoking. Only 1 percent of daily users of       e-cigarettes were not previous smokers or tobacco users. A       2015 survey of nonsmoking teens aged 13-17 found interest       levels in flavored e-cigarettes of 0.4 out of a possible       score of 10. An April 2019 study funded by the UK's National       Institute for Health Research and led by Cardiff University       concluded that ``fears over a resurgence in youth tobacco       smoking because of the rise in e-cigarette use are largely       unfounded to date'' and that there is ``no evidence'' that e-      cigarettes are causing young persons to commence smoking       traditional combustible tobacco. In October 2019 the       prestigious medical journal Nicotine and Tobacco Research       found that, ``E-cigarette use does not appear to be       associated with current, continued smoking.'' As such,       ecigarettes are a gateway away from smoking and give teens       who were already smokers a safer alternative.        While flavors may be helping conventional smokers quit       smoking, the evidence shows that flavors play little to no       role in inducing middle-and-high school students to use e-      cigarettes. A 2016 study published in Tobacco Control used a       national phone survey to ascertain teenage usage and interest       in e-cigarettes and attempted to gauge the role of flavor in       increasing interest in these products. The researchers found       that, of teenagers that have never smoked, only 3.3 percent       expressed interest in trying e-cigarettes and that there was       no evidence for flavors driving e-cigarette uptake. Fewer       than a third of high school students self-report to care       about flavors, while academic studies have found that teenage       non-smokers' ``willingness to try plain versus flavored       varieties did not differ.''        Advocates of greater vaping restrictions continue to ignore       the evidence and cite instances of e-cigarettes allegedly       inducing lung illnesses. But, as confirmed by the Centers for       Disease Control and Prevention and corroborated by numerous       peer-reviewed academic publications such as the New England       Journal of Medicine, every case of illness and tragic death       has been as a result of illicit, black-market THC vaping       devices bought on the streets and laced with substances such       as Vitamin E acetone.        There is no evidence whatsoever that menthol cigarettes are       in any way more harmful or dangerous than conventional       combustible cigarettes. There is similarly no evidence that       menthol cigarettes are in any way more likely to be a       contributing factor to people taking up smoking. A recent       analysis of data from the National Survey on Drug Use and       Health found that states with more menthol cigarette       consumption relative to all cigarettes actually have lower       rates of child smoking. In addition, econometric analysis       consistently shows consistent nonpredictive relationships       between relative menthol cigarette consumption rates and use       of any age group. Youth menthol smoking has already become       less popular than non-menthol smoking, and on the current       trend line, youth usage of menthol cigarettes will be at a       rate of near-zero within the next few years. Curtailing       menthol cigarettes will only succeed in damaging already-      fraught race relations. More than 80 percent of black smokers       prefer menthol cigarettes, compared to less than 30 percent       of white smokers. As the tragic case of Eric Garner shows,       tobacco prohibition can easily escalate into deadly       encounters with law enforcement. Policymakers must consider       racial disparities in the consumption of tobacco products,       and refrain from restrictive policies with myriad unintended       consequences.        Illicit tobacco is lucrative source of funding for       terrorism, with the U.S. State Department having described       international tobacco smuggling as a ``threat to national       security.'' Their report detailed how ``we know that 15 of       the world's leading terrorist groups regularly rely on       illicit cigarettes for funding, including al Qaeda, the       Taliban, Hezbollah, and Hamas. Illicit cigarettes are now       second only to the heroin trade in helping fund some of the       Taliban militias.''        TPA urges you to carefully examine the facts and science       attesting toe-cigarettes' efficacy as a powerful quit-smoking       aid and reject this grossly irresponsible bill.            Regards,                                                       Tim Andrews,      Director.                                   ____                     [From Tax Foundation, Feb. 12, 2020]        Banning Flavored Tobacco Could Have Unintended Consequences                             (By Ulrik Boesen)         Several states have considered bans on flavored tobacco and       nicotine products this legislative session, spurred by       increased vaping by minors. Among them are California, Maine,       Maryland, New York, Vermont, and Virginia. There is also a       federal proposal to ban flavors in tobacco products. While       youth uptake is a very real concern which deserves the       public's attention, outright bans could impede historically       high smoking cessation rates. Lawmakers must thread the       needle between protecting adult smoker's ability to switch       and barring minor's access to nicotine products.        Aside from public health concerns, a ban on flavored       tobacco, especially when including cigarettes, would have       significant tax implications and result in unintended       consequences such as increased smuggling. Tobacco excise       taxes are already an unstable source of tax revenue. Further       narrowing the tobacco tax base by banning a portion of       tobacco sales altogether could worsen the instability of this       revenue source while driving up the costs of administration       and law enforcement associated with the ban, especially if       the lost revenue is made up by raising the tax rate on the       remaining tobacco tax base.        Cigarettes make up about 82.5 percent of the total tobacco       market and even more of the excise tax revenue due to higher       rates on cigarettes versus other tobacco products. According       to sales data, about 35 percent of the U.S. cigarette market       is flavored, which means that 35 percent of the revenue       collected would be affected by a ban. The flavor used in       cigarettes is almost exclusively menthol.        Below is a calculation of implicated revenue in the states       that are considering a ban. The numbers are based on tax       collections and sales of menthol cigarettes. On top of this       number one could add reduced revenues from chewing tobacco,       cigars, cigarillos, and in some states flavored vapor liquid.

The figures indicating revenue from menthol cigarettes       reflect the loss of revenue if all current consumers of       menthol cigarettes were to quit. That is almost certainly not       going to happen. In reality, some will quit, some will       substitute to other nicotine products, and some will access       the products illegally. The last option is the most fiscally       problematic because states will not only incur lost revenue,       they will also take on increased costs related to enforcement       of the ban. While it is impossible to estimate the exact       revenue effect, it is clear that revenues will decline.        The impact differs significantly from state to state with       Maryland and Virginia seeing the largest effect. This is       likely due to larger minority populations in those states. In       a national survey in 2015, 76.8 percent of non-Hispanic black       adult smokers reported smoking menthol products.        As I argue in my latest publication, there are several       problems with bans. The Pigouvian concept of internalizing       externalities suggests that inefficient market outcomes can       be addressed by an excise tax equal to the negative       externality. In other words, using taxes to price in societal       cost related to a product, such as increased governmental       medical expenses from cancers caused by tobacco smoke. This       is part of the idea behind levying excise taxes on tobacco       products. However, flavored nicotine products are helping       adult smokers quit cigarettes and switch to less harmful       products.  [[Page H1285]]         Several states seem to have had this in mind and have taken       a lighter approach to the taxation of vaping products to keep       an incentive for smokers to move towards less harmful vaping.       Thus, on the one hand there is an argument for lower taxation       on vaping to move people away from smoking. On the other hand       a ban on flavored products would push users away from vaping       and back towards more harmful traditional tobacco products or       into the illegal market.        In fact, a recent publication found that 32,400 smokers in       Minnesota were deterred from quitting cigarettes after the       state implemented a 95 percent excise tax on vapor products.        Another study concluded that vapor products are highly       elastic and ``for every one standard e-cigarette pod (a       device that contains liquid nicotine in e-cigarettes) of 0.7       ml no longer purchased as a result of an e-cigarette tax, the       same tax increases traditional cigarettes purchased by 6.2       extra packs.''        In the same way that exceptionally high tax rates on       products can create the incentives for illicit activities, a       ban certainly opens the door to contraband and bootleg       activities. Thus, bans are likely to hurt public health by       limiting adult smokers' ability to quit cigarettes and fuel       black market activity similar to when states levy heavy       taxation on cigarettes. Local bans in particular invite       smuggling activity in the same way that occurs when       localities have high cigarette excise taxes.        Cigarettes are already being smuggled into and around the       country in large quantities, and nicotine-containing liquid       is coming into the U.S. from questionable sources. Black       market liquids and cigarettes have the problem of being       extremely unsafe and cost governments billions in lost taxes.       The recent serious pulmonary diseases have prompted the FDA       to publish a warning about black market THC-containing       liquid. Other reports of illicit products containing       dangerous chemicals resulting in serious conditions have been       released over the last months.        On top of the dangers to consumers, the legal market would       suffer, as untaxed and unregulated products have significant       competitive advantages over high-priced legal products. This       would impact not only the large number of small business       owners operating over 10,000 vape shops around the country       but also convenience stores and gas stations relying heavily       on vapers as well as tobacco sales. Policymakers should not       lose sight of the law of unintended consequences as they set       tax rates and regulatory regimes for nicotine products.        These unintended consequences have a real cost which the       taxpayers would have to cover, while the ban would result in       less revenue from the legal and regulated market. In states       like California, where tobacco tax revenue is earmarked to       certain government programs, the impact on revenue could lead       to underfunded programs which will need funding from other       sources.        The prospect of a ban on flavored tobacco and nicotine       products highlights the complications of contradictory tax       and regulatory policy, the instability of excise taxes that       go beyond pricing in the cost of externalities, and the       public risks of driving consumers into the black market       through excessive taxation or regulation.
