 Madam Speaker, I am honored to represent the  University of California at San Diego, which is one of the leading  research universities in the Nation.   As I have worked with my friends on the Education and Labor Committee  to reauthorize the Higher Education Act, I have kept all the incredible  students at UCSD in mind. I am especially proud of our work to improve  access for graduate students and ease their financial burden.   Graduate students are the backbone of research universities, teaching  and mentoring undergraduates, performing groundbreaking research, and  innovating the solutions for 21st century problems. Unfortunately, many  of those same students have crippling student loan debt.   That is why I am so glad that the College Affordability Act recreates  the Federal Perkins Loan Program and strengthens the Pell Grant Program  to better address the needs of our undergraduate and graduate students.   While there is much more that we need to do to support students, I am  proud to cosponsor the College Affordability Act and will continue to  work with my colleagues to improve outcomes for our students.                            ____________________
