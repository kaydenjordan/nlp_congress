 Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I  rise to recognize the remarkable career of Monica Russo.   After decades of service, Ms. Russo is retiring as executive vice  president of 1199SEIU United Healthcare Workers East, the largest local  union in the Nation, representing more than 400,000 healthcare workers  in five States and more than 25,000 healthcare workers in Florida.   Under her leadership, 1199SEIU Florida has grown to represent more  than 30,000 healthcare workers and retirees, becoming the largest union  of healthcare workers in Florida and the Southern United States. She  also serves as international vice president of the SEIU and as  president of SEIU Florida State Council, where she politically unites  more than 55,000 active and retired SEIU members, from bus drivers and  janitors to healthcare workers.   Her emphasis on multicultural leadership development and grassroots,  member-driven organization building has given a voice and power to  healthcare workers, women, immigrants, and the working class.   Monica Russo's commitment to our Nation's working families is  exemplary, and I am proud to call her my sister and dear and treasured  friend. I will miss her guidance and wisdom, but our loss is her  family's gain. I wish her a hearty congratulations on her retirement  and am grateful for her invaluable work.                            ____________________
