 Mr. Speaker, the GOP is consumed by chaos and confusion.  My fellow Democrats and I are focused on delivering better jobs, better  wages, and a better future for hardworking Americans in Philadelphia  and neighbors nationwide.   When it comes to childcare, the Republicans are offering a raw deal  for our future leaders. We must protect, defend, and provide for the  American children. That means better childcare, healthcare, and  education. I am a firm believer that quality pre-K for our kids is an  investment in the continued success of our cities.   That is exactly what we have seen in the city of Philadelphia, a city  I have been proud to call home my entire life. Mayor Kenney's pre-K  initiative in our city is making quality, reliable pre-K a reality for  all kids. I have visited several early education providers: KenCrest,  the Parent Infant Center, and Smart Beginnings. I can tell you  firsthand that the services they offer are building a stronger city.   As your voice in Congress, please know I am working hard to deliver a  better deal for our children and families, and that means to ensure  pre-K for our children. Together we can build and level the playing  field for a stronger Philadelphia block by block and a better place for  all.  [[Page H3589]]                                ____________________
