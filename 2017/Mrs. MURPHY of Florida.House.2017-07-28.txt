 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the  Intelligence Authorization Act.   Good intelligence safeguards our Nation from adversaries. It is used  to support our Armed Forces, our diplomats, and our homeland security  professionals.   The men and women of the U.S. intelligence community make enormous  sacrifices on behalf of our country. While others seek the limelight,  they shun publicity and self-promotion. They are silent warriors and  quiet heroes.   I want to highlight section 609 of this legislation. It is a version  of a bill that I authored called the Prevention and Oversight of  Intelligence Sharing with Enemies Act, or the POISE Act.   I introduced the POISE Act in May after the President disclosed  highly sensitive information to senior Russian officials during a White  House meeting. This information had been entrusted to the U.S. by key  allies.   Under Federal law, the executive branch is required to inform the  congressional intelligence committees of U.S. intelligence activities.  The POISE Act would specify that the executive branch must notify the  committees when a member of the executive branch, including the  President, intentionally or inadvertently discloses top-secret  information to adversary foreign government.                                time  1215    It is dangerous for a U.S. official to share classified information  with an adversary, especially outside of established intelligence  channels. The adversary could use the information to harm the United  States or its allies. Moreover, our partners might decide to stop  sharing critical intelligence with us if they lose confidence in our  capacity to keep it confidential.   The congressional notification requirement in the POISE Act would  help deter inappropriate disclosures of classified information to  adversaries. Once formally notified of the disclosure, Congress would  be in a position to take any appropriate oversight action.   I am so pleased that the core of the POISE Act is contained in  section 609. I want to thank Chairman Nunes and Ranking Member Schiff  for including the provision in the bill, and I urge the bill's swift  passage.
