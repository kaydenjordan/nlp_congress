 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to attack the bill H.R. 5  because it attacks education.   Republicans call it the Parents Bill of Rights Act. In reality, it  should be called the politics over parents act.   H.R. 5 would take vital resources away from local schools and  educators. It would allow schools to be centers of indoctrination and  not education. It would allow communities to ban books if they don't  like them.   The Founding Fathers knew that public education was vital to an  educated populace and proper self-government. It has helped millions of  Americans rise out of poverty, and it has helped millions of Americans  start businesses and pursue the American Dream. Yet, Republicans  continue their assault on public education at every opportunity.   I am proud to be part of a party that supports the American Dream for  all Americans and not one that wants to reject it. Thank goodness for  the United States Senate.
