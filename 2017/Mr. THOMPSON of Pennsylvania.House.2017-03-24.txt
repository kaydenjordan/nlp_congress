 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank a  very special member of my team, Andy Leung, who is an intern in my  office.   Andy comes to us through the Congressional Internship Program for  Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities. This is a unique program  designed to give students with varying intellectual disabilities an  opportunity to gain congressional work experience. It is part of George  Mason University's LIFE Program. To date, 150 congressional offices  from the House and Senate have participated in this wonderful program.   Mr. Speaker, Andy is a part of our team, and we look forward to the  hours he spends with us each week. He quickly settled into the office,  and he is always in great spirits.   Andy is hardworking and curious. He is interested in the projects the  full-time staff are working on. He loves picking up the flags from the  Capitol, and we are truly fortunate to have such a dedicated intern.   I would like to thank Andy for his service and thank his employment  assistant and the Congressional Internship Program for Individuals with  Intellectual Disabilities for making this possible.                            ____________________
