 Madam Speaker, I rise today as chair of the Congressional  Hispanic Caucus to pay tribute to a champion for Latinos and Latinas  and a leader for all, the late CHC chair, Congressman Esteban Torres.   He did everything in his power to increase Hispanic representation in  Congress, dedicated himself to disenfranchised communities, and had an  unwavering commitment to equity.   Esteban Torres was born in Arizona in 1930 to a proud Mexican family  of migrant and copper mine workers. After the deportation of his father  through the disastrous Mexican Repatriation program, his family moved  to east Los Angeles. Torres never saw his father again.   As a self-proclaimed barrio kid, he grew up navigating the  difficulties of a young Latino male without a father in Los Angeles,  but that did not stop him from achieving excellence.   From a young age, Torres was consistently recognized as a peacemaker,  consensus builder, and leader in his community.   He knew that leadership meant serving. And when he turned 19, he  enlisted in the U.S. Army and fought in the Korean war.   Later in life, the necessities of raising a family pushed Torres to  work as a welder on the assembly line at an auto plant. There, he  became involved with the labor movement and assumed the role of chief  steward in the United Auto Workers union's local branch.   His ability to lead, inspire, and defend workers' rights drove him to  become the Nation's director of the Inter-American Bureau for Caribbean  and Latin American Affairs, and so he began his political career.   After serving under President Carter as U.S. Ambassador to the United  Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, and as  White House Special Assistant for Hispanic Affairs, Torres represented  California's 34th District, the City of Norwalk in the County of Los  Angeles, from 1983 until 1999.   From his first year in Congress, he defended workers' rights,  protected consumers, advanced environmental justice, and secured  veterans' services.   Through it all, he never forgot his community. As chair of the  Congressional Hispanic Caucus, he pushed forward transformative  legislation for immigrants in our country, such as the 1986 Immigration  Reform and Control Act.   This historic legislation gave legal status to more than 3 million  immigrants, ultimately protecting other families from the same horror  his family experienced many years back.   Torres also led the CHC at a time when our communities did not have  the representation we do today. After eight terms, he expressed: ``I  have reached the pinnacle of success in my own eyes. It is time to let  the younger generation succeed.''                                time  1030    Today, I succeed him as chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, a  role I take with much responsibility because I know I have big shoes to  fill.   Thanks to his efforts, our communities can feel seen in the 38  members of the CHC that, inspired by Congressman Torres, serve with  determination and compassion. I know that we, inspired by the late  Congressman Esteban Torres, carry the torch to expand Hispanic  representation in Congress and create a House and a Senate that is more  representative of our Nation.   Esteban Torres, mentor, leader, amigo, after 91 years of touching  lives and changing this Nation, in January 2022 you passed away. You  lived a long and impactful life of service, and you left this Nation  better than how you found it for future generations. Gracias.                            ____________________
