 Madam Speaker, the purpose of this speech is to  encourage America to wake up before the Build Back Better Act passes  here.   There are so many crises going on in this country. I still believe  the number one is the 100,000 people a month flooding the border; but  these two actions of the Biden administration intersect, and I  encourage America to pay attention.   First of all, in the Build Back Better Act, we are providing amnesty  to at least 7 million illegal aliens. To give that much amnesty not  only is an outrage in its own right, but is encouraging more and more  people to come here. The next thing that is being done is that we are  guaranteeing certain bad actors will not be removed from the country.  This bill provides parole for some felons, sex offenders, and members  of gangs. This will be a further problem.   Madam Speaker, finally, and perhaps most absurd of all, under this  bill we are getting free Pell grants, that is to say, free college for  people who are coming here illegally. The American citizen, the  American taxpayer is $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 in debt to go to  college, but people come here illegally--free college.   Wake up, America.                            ____________________
