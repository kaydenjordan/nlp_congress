 Madam President, I am proud but I am also saddened  and angry to be here introducing a measure that should never be  necessary in the United States of America.   The Women's Health Protection Act will, yes, offer protection to  women who need and deserve it, but it is only because of a hideously  misguided decision of the U.S. Supreme Court that we are here today.   When I first introduced this measure 10 years ago, the thought of  overruling Roe v. Wade was unimaginable. It was a figment of fear  dismissed by realistic scholars and advocates. It was unthinkable. And  here we are.   The U.S. Supreme Court has handed down a death sentence to women  across America. It has overturned 50 years of precedent, which I know  well because I was a law clerk to the U.S. Supreme Court Justice who  wrote that opinion in the year afterward.   We thought then--and so did most people in America--we have dealt  with this issue, we have disposed of it, and it is done in terms of  juris prudence. But this measure is now necessary to protect the rights  of all people to seek the healthcare they need and deserve.   I will tell you why I believe this measure should be passed. I trust  women. I trust women to make decisions about their own future. I trust  women more than I do elected officials or judges or government  bureaucrats to decide what is right for them individually.   This measure is necessary to stop all of the bans, prohibitions, and  medically unnecessary restrictions that  [[Page S703]]  have no purpose except to cut off care and stigmatize women seeking  healthcare services and the dedicated healthcare providers who serve  them.   Now, I have a message to the men of America. This fight is yours,  too. This isn't a women's issue. This is an American issue. It is a  family issue. And if you think you are spared the conscience and  conviction that should require you to stand up and speak out, you are  wrong. This issue is yours, too.   We have seen horror stories just in the month since Dobbs. You heard  one from my colleague Senator Baldwin. I have a similar one--Amanda  Zurawski in Texas, who sadly learned that her baby would not survive,  but doctors would not treat her as she might have done in other States.  They told her to go home. She almost died of sepsis. They brought her  back to the hospital and rushed her to intensive care.   Her husband Josh learned that, as a result, they might never have  children. He said:         Amanda almost died. That's not pro-life. Amanda will have       challenges having more kids. That is not pro-life. He called       it ``barbaric.'' That is the Texas law--barbaric, inhuman.    Protecting access to abortion through the Women's Health Protection  Act would not only help people like Amanda--women--it would help  families. It would help countless people who simply choose access to  abortion care because it is right for them and for their families, for  other children who are already part of those families. A woman simply  should not be forced to carry a pregnancy to term because some  government bureaucrat decides she should.   There is a kind of dirty little secret here, and that is that Black,  Latina, indigenous, and other people of color have always faced  inexcusable inequities in healthcare access and outcomes due to  longstanding systemic discrimination and racism and oppression. The  result of it is the practical effect of these abortion restrictions and  needless requirements fall disproportionately on them and communities  of color.   This point is so important because it goes to the heart of the  Women's Health Protection Act. At its core, this bill is about justice.  It is about reproductive justice. It was a term that was conceptualized  in 1994 by a group of Black women who rightfully saw a national need to  highlight and focus on women, families, and communities. Abortion bans  and restrictions continue to force women in communities of color who  don't wish to carry and deny them the care they need and deserve in  moments when their healthcare is at risk.   This bill is critical for communities that are disproportionately  harmed by the bans and medically unnecessary restrictions that the  Women's Health Protection Act would prohibit. It supports those who  face the greatest barriers to care.   I want to, finally, thank in this fight some of the healthcare  providers, advocates, lawyers, and staff who have been on the frontline  in these past 10 years--people like Jackie Blank, Sara Outterson, and  Liz Wagner of the Center for Reproductive Rights; Monica Edwards at  URGE; Dr. Jamila Perritt at Physicians for Reproductive Choice; Amy  Williams Navarro at NARAL; Karen Stone and Nina Serrianne at Planned  Parenthood; Leila Abolfazli at the National Women's Law Center; and so  many across the country, including, in Connecticut, Amanda Skinner and  Gretchen Raffa at Planned Parenthood, and Liz Gustafson at NARAL Pro- Choice Connecticut.   Make no mistake, this fight will continue. The Women's Health  Protection Act will pass. It may not be in the next couple of weeks or  couple of months--maybe not even in this session--but it will pass  because the conscience of America demands it. That is why referenda  have won across the country on this issue. That is why voters went to  the polls and showed with their feet where they stand. And that is why  we need to fight rulings from the courts, with hard-right Republican  judges who have declared a war on women.   As soon as next week, a judge in Texas may rule that mifepristone,  the most common form of abortion care in this country, is illegal  despite 20 years of safe, effective use with approval of the FDA of  that drug. A nationwide ban will affect women in Connecticut if he does  it.   We have seen also that Walgreens will not sell or make available  mifepristone in 21 States whose State attorneys general have threatened  to sue Walgreens if it makes that drug available. They have succumbed  to bullying. They said to those attorneys general: OK, women lose; you  win.   I urge consumers to vote with their feet and do their business  elsewhere and show where they stand.   I am proud to be here with my colleagues to continue this fight for  the Women's Health Protection Act.
