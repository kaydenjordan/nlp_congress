 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank everyone for the warm  welcome.   I also want to thank Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy for all the  attention he has given me for the past several weeks. Thank you so  much.   I am truly honored to be here and to be joined by my mother, Socorro;  my brother, Gerry; my mother-in-law, Sally; and, of course, my amazing  wife, Mary.   My approach to public policy, politics, and government is shaped by  the experiences of my family and of my community. As the son of  immigrants who believes in this country and everything it promises, I  am a living embodiment of that promise. I have a profound commitment to  protecting the rights of immigrants no matter where they are from and  no matter what God they worship.   I am also a fighter for universal healthcare, because when I was 7  years old, I ended up in the hospital with pneumonia, and that 1-week  stay in the hospital almost bankrupted my family.   I also believe that young people from working families should have  access to debt-free education, because I know from my own personal  experience that a high school degree is not always enough, and that is  why a higher education can actually transform an individual's life.   I believe everyone deserves access to clean air and clean water and  that climate change has exacerbated that challenge.   And lastly, I don't believe in the hype and the false divides that  progressives can't be for working families and for families from all  over America.   To the people of the 34th Congressional District, I know why they  sent me to Congress. They want me to fight for our families, our State,  and our values, and I will do that every single day, and I won't let  them down.                            ____________________
