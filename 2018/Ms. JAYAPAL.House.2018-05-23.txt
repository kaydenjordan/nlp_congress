 Mr. Speaker, it has been a great honor to be able to  come into Congress with Mr. Khanna and to see the years of work that he  has done before coming to Congress now turning into critical  legislation around Yemen, around workers' rights, around progressive  issues, around healthcare for all.   How proud I am that I get to serve with the gentleman in this  Congress, and how proud I am of our Progressive Caucus, which is the  largest values-based caucus in the House. We are 78 members strong, and  I believe we are going to hopefully have more members added on.   Mr. Speaker, I think the reality of what we are talking about is that  the ideas that we are putting forward are not really progressive ideas;  they are ideas that serve the interests of working families. Labor  unions are at the core of that.   I am proud to come from Washington State. We are one of the most  labor-dense States in the country. We have one of the highest minimum  wages in the country. Thanks to the labor movement, we have minimum  wage that is tied to inflation. We have had that for many years. It is  part of the reason our minimum wage has been able to rise in Washington  State. Yes, we are the place of the $15 minimum wage, and I was proud  to be on that committee to pass the $15 minimum wage in Seattle.   We are able to show that these policies, like higher minimum wages,  like paid safe and sick days--we have some of the best paid family  leave policies in the country. All of that has been brought forward by  labor unions representing workers.   When we talk about collective bargaining, what is that? For the  average person, who may not be as familiar with terminology, really all  that means is that you get to take the power that comes from having  more than one individual together to bargain for the things that are  really going to help your life. That is what collective bargaining is  about: bringing the power of many to the policies and putting policies  forward that really help us.   Mr. Khanna spoke so eloquently about--I think he said--the Danish  Ambassador visiting. There is a great TEDx talk out there, TEDxOslo.  The title of it is something like, ``Where in the World Is It Easiest  to Get Rich?'' It is a fantastic talk that really puts bullets in the  theory that, in social democracies where you provide healthcare, where  you have strong labor movements, where you provide free education,  somehow you don't have the opportunity to do well in those countries.   In fact, statistics show that, specifically because of a strong labor  movement in Scandinavian countries and because of the investment in  education, those two factors combined, everybody does well. It is a  really simple theory that we are all better off when we are all better  off, and that is what labor unions have provided to us.   I am proud to be from a strong labor family. My husband actually  started off his career as an apprentice, as a bricklayer, and he worked  his way up working for a number of different unions. He ended up being  the head of the King County Labor Council, elected by 140,000 workers  across our county, and was instrumental in helping us to win on many of  these important issues. That is, I think, what we are talking about  today.   So, when we look at the Janus decision, this is a critical issue, an  issue of critical importance for all Americans. The Supreme Court's  decision on this case is going to help determine whether or not we  really have opportunity for all workers, whether or not labor unions  are able to do the work that they need to do to collectively bargain  and bring the voices of many workers to bear. Because what happens in,  particularly, these workplaces, giant corporations: You know that, if  there is a wrong done to one, it is difficult to bring it forward just  as one. If you have collective bargaining, you have a structure within  where those issues can come forward.   So what Janus is looking at is whether or not American workers have  the freedom and the right to collectively bargain, which means to fight  back against the corporations that are expanding income inequality and  decimating the middle class that, frankly, built this country.    Let me be clear that I stand strong with labor unions like AFSCME in  opposing corporate efforts to drag working people to the bottom. Unions  made our country strong. Unions made our country strong. And Janus has  the potential to make it harder for working people to join a union.   Union members are us. They are our teachers, ironworkers, nurses,  government workers, bricklayers, firefighters, machinists. They are the  backbone of our communities. Our communities only thrive when we help  workers to thrive. Janus would do the opposite.   I want to share a statistic with you. My friend Ro Khanna just gave  you some incredible statistics. Let me repeat one, which is that  workers, on average, in 1973 earned $16.74 per hour, adjusted for  inflation. Since then, our economy has doubled, so we can assume that  worker salaries have kept up with the pace, right?   Not so fast. Wrong. Workers today make $17.86 per hour, which is  nowhere near enough to keep pace with growing income inequality and the  rising cost of living.   Here is another statistic that has captured my attention and that I  now use in every speech: Across this country, 67 percent of Americans  do not even have $1,000 in their bank account to deal with an  emergency. Mr. Speaker, 67 percent. It is a remarkable statistic.   That means that, if you have a leak in your roof, your car breaks  down, your kid has an emergency or an illness and you have to take off  from work for a couple of weeks and you don't have paid family leave  like we do in Washington State thanks to the labor movement, all of  those things mean that families are no longer thinking about thriving;  they are thinking about surviving. That decline is directly tied, if  you look at the research, to the decline in the labor movement and the  decline in collective bargaining.   So now we are facing an administration that, despite lofty campaign  promises, is putting corporations and greed first and workers second.  [[Page H4685]]                                     time  1745    Just look at the tax bill that the Republicans just passed. The  largest transfer of wealth in the history of the United States going  straight to corporations and the 1 percent. That is the reality of all  of the research is that the majority of those tax breaks went to the  largest corporations, the top 1 percent. It was used for stock buybacks  and not for any kinds of increases, permanent increases, for workers.   So unions have been fighting back, and that is why we have to ensure  that unions remain in fighting shape because they are fighting for us.  Janus is nothing more than a political attack underwritten by  corporations, and it will not make our economy stronger. It further  rigs the economy against workers, and it is, frankly, a disgrace and a  slap in the face to the union legacy that has helped our country grow.   We need to be working to make it easier and not harder for workers to  join unions, to collectively bargain for fair wages, safe working  conditions, and healthcare. And before I yield back, Mr. Speaker, I  want to thank my friends in labor, the brothers and sisters who have  been fighting for working Americans, winning worker safety protections,  sick leave, the 40-hour workweek. Don't forget about the 40-hour  workweek brought to you by your labor unions throughout our country's  history.   It is not hyperbole to say that we simply would not be where we are  without unions. And instead of trying to tear them apart by pushing so- called right-to-work laws--I don't even like to say the phrase, because  it isn't right to work. The reality is that we should have the right to  have workers collectively bargain and organize.   But by filing these harmful lawsuits like Janus, we are hurting  workers across the country. We should be working to educate and to  engage a new generation of union workers and leaders, and if history is  any indication, our country will be better off when we are all better  off. We are all better off when we have unions that represent the  voices of working people and can actually build that power, organize  together to take on that corporate power, which, frankly, has a lot of  money behind it but isn't looking out for the best interest of our  workers. With that, I thank Mr. Khanna for his tremendous leadership.
