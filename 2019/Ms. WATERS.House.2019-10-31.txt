 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman McGovern for yielding.   I rise in support of H. Res. 660 and the process that is set forth  within it by which the impeachment inquiry will continue to be  conducted.   To be clear, contrary to what these desperate Republicans have  claimed, the Constitution imposes no requirement that a procedural  resolution, such as H. Res. 660, should be voted on by the House.  Claiming otherwise is but a fabrication meant to distract from the  mountain of growing evidence that demonstrates this President abused  his power for personal benefit.   However, while not necessary, this resolution provides for impartial  procedures similar to those used during the past impeachment  proceedings.   Because Republicans requested a formal procedural vote, I expect  nothing less than their full support for H. Res. 660. Anything less  would be shameful.   As chairwoman of the Financial Services Committee, we have been  conducting credible investigations into the conduct of this  administration. And this work----   --will continue in the manner outlined by H. Res. 660. I  look forward to Democrats and Republicans alike----
