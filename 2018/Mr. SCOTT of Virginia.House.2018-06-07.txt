 Mr. Speaker, 6 months ago, Congress passed a  tax cut that cost almost $2 trillion that overwhelmingly benefited  corporations and the wealthy. Today, the Republicans are asking  struggling children and families to foot the bill.   Nearly half of the $15 billion in cuts in the Trump-GOP recessions  package targets the Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP. While  $7 billion may be a rounding error in the corporate tax cut,  eliminating this funding from CHIP will jeopardize its ability to  ensure access to healthcare for the children and families who depend on  the program every year.   The bill contains an 80 percent cut to the CHIP contingency fund.  That is particularly shortsighted and dangerous. The need for  healthcare assistance is greatest when our Nation experiences  unexpected challenges, including recessions, public health emergencies,  and national disasters. Hopefully, that money will not be needed, but  we should not be stealing from the fund that provides vital care for  children and families when their communities are confronted by these  unforeseen but inevitable challenges.   In addition, the bill also includes cuts to the Corporation for  National and Community Service, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid  Innovation, health infrastructure, rural water programs, and many other  small but important programs that protect our citizens, create jobs,  and grow the economy.   In an attempt to give taxpayers the illusion of fiscal  responsibility, my colleagues have once again revealed their misguided  priorities. We should not be paying for the irresponsible tax cuts by  making even more reckless cuts to the investments in our future.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill.
