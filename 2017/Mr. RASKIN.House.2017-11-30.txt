 Mr. Chair, I thank Mr. Connolly for his invitation, and I  am delighted to be here to speak out against H.R. 4182, the so-called  Ensuring a Qualified Civil Service Act.   The first complaint I have got to lodge about it is the process by  which it is taking place. This is a radical change in the civil service  hiring policy and in the workplace without a hearing. I know we have  grown accustomed to that, but let's just focus on the fact that here we  are in the Nation's Capital and we have got all of the employees,  managers, and supervisors, and everybody here, and we didn't even have  a hearing to discuss why this might be necessary.   Then it is passed on a completely party-line vote in the Oversight  Committee, which leads to the suspicion that this has nothing to do  with the integrity of the civil service or the excellence of the civil  service, the things that we should be thinking about, but it has to do,  in fact, with a partisan mission.    I yield to the gentleman from Virginia.    Reclaiming my time, I tremble to say here in front of the  whole body, but I don't believe that it was. I stand to be corrected by  my colleagues if there was a hearing.    I yield to the gentleman from Virginia.    Reclaiming my time, not to my knowledge. I am used to  that coming out of the State legislature, where we have endless  hearings that go on into 2 a.m. in the morning or they go on for  several days. But there were no hearings, there was no evidence, there  was no expert testimony.   I couldn't figure out what was behind it. Then I realized that there  is this effort to demoralize the Federal workforce and there was this  effort to create a kind of political control over what is going on in  the Federal workplace.    Mr. Chair, I am baffled and puzzled by the way in which  this measure came about. And I am really scared about what it means for  all of our constituents who make the sacrifice of going to work for the  Federal Government to serve the American people, because they are going  into the workplace and I think most people are used to a probationary  period of 3 months or 6 months. We had a year. Now we are doubling it  to 2 years, which means that people are living in fear at a time when  there is an administration that is intimidating people for doing their  jobs; for example, for doing research about climate change and trying  to deal with environmental problems. They are facing reprisals in the  workplace.   This is a bill that deserves to go down in defeat. Anybody who  represents Federal workers, I think, should stand up strongly against  it. It should be returned to sender and let's have some real hearings  and some real analysis.    Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Mr. Connolly, and I want to  salute him as a really ardent champion for those of your constituents  who work in the Federal Government. In Maryland, as in Virginia, we  have lots of them, but it is not just there.   Eighty-five percent of the Federal workforce lives outside of the  Washington/Maryland/Virginia area: Kentucky and California and South  Carolina and Texas. This would apply to all new employees. Millions of  new people coming into the workforce would be added, doubling the  probationary period. Imagine if you were trying to hire for your small  business and you had to tell people that they were going to be on  probation for 2 years basically, with none of the rights that you would  have vested as if you had really gotten hired and been part of the  workforce.   I want to say, they are willing, apparently, in this bill, to give  people a whole extra year on probation. They are not wanting to wait  even 1 year or a half a year, maybe, for the GAO to do a proper study  so we can use evidence-based policymaking, as the gentleman says. That  is the very least that we can do.   The good gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Comer) said that there was a  study done 10 years ago.    Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to be here this evening on  behalf of the Progressive Caucus in Congress, which is in very strong  opposition to both the House and Senate versions of the tax scam that  is speeding through the United States Congress this week. We have  several members who would like to participate in this.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr.  Cicilline). He is a passionate representative of the people of Rhode  Island and a real champion of the American middle class.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Cicilline for his strong  leadership for the people of Rhode Island and his dedication to the  middle class of America, which is besieged and under attack today in  Washington, D.C. You know, the former Secretary of the Treasury, Robert  Rubin, came and said that this is the worst piece of tax legislation he  had seen ever in the history of the United States of America.   Now, the good news is that the American people have taken a look, and  they don't like it. By more than 2-1, the American people in public  opinion polls are rejecting this plan. The Quinnipiac poll found that  American voters are rejecting the plan by more than 2-1, with 52  percent disapproving and only 25 percent approving. Every day, the more  people find out about it, the more that they hate the guts of this bill  and what is inside of the tax plan.   We are in a situation of ``beat the clock'' now. Can we get the  information out to the people, Mr. Speaker, about what is in this bill  before it is rammed through the United States Congress?   So let's start with this: 82 million middle class households are  going to see their taxes go up over the next decade. They are going to  completely obliterate the State and local tax deduction, which States  like mine, Maryland, New Jersey, Connecticut, California, Illinois, are  going to be killed by, because if you make investments in your  educational infrastructure, if you make investments in the  transportation infrastructure, now they want to abolish the State and  local tax deduction and make you pay twice for the same money that you  have earned, while driving pressure down on the States to eliminate  investment in the people who live in the States.  [[Page H9565]]    Well, so they are going to raise taxes on millions of middle class  families. Why? So they can slash taxes for the wealthiest corporations  and the wealthiest people in the country. They want to slash the  corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent at a time of record  corporate profits in America.   They say that everybody is going to get wage increases by that. But  we have already got record corporate profits, and we have seen wage  growth be stagnant under the policies that are being propounded by the  GOP in Congress.   If you want to increase people's wages, increase the minimum wage.  Have some courage. Have some honesty. Let's increase the minimum wage.  Let's give America a raise. That will work, not just showering billions  of dollars more on the richest people in the country.   By the way, it is not just the richest people in the country. One- third of corporate ownership in America goes to foreign investors. That  is right. So if we decide to give $1\1/2\ trillion to investors in  America with a corporate tax break, one-third of that money is going to  leave America immediately and go to China or Saudi Arabia or wherever  the rich corporate investors are.   The purpose of this bill isn't even just to enrich the wealthiest  people in America. It is to enrich the wealthiest people on Earth  because the money is going to be flying overseas as soon as we  institute this corporate tax cut.   Then they build up record deficits: $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion in  deficits on the House and Senate plans--which are twiddle dumb and  twiddle dumber--$1.5 trillion to $2 trillion that the children, the  grandchildren, and the great-grandchildren of the middle class are  going to be paying back for decades so there can be a party on Wall  Street; so there can be a party among the 1 percent; so Donald Trump's  family, according to The New York Times, can collect up to $1 billion  in tax relief.   How are they doing it?   Well, for example, they want to abolish the estate tax, which right  now applies only to two of the richest 1,000 families in America. You  take 1,000 families, only two of them are even paying the estate tax  because it applies only to the wealthiest people in the country. They  want to abolish that; totally in contradiction to the design of the  Founders of America who did not want to see the transmission of  millions, much less hundreds of millions, much less billions of dollars  from one generation to the next because they understood that the  intergenerational transmission of that kind of wealth is a threat to  democracy.   At a certain point, people have enough houses, they have enough  yachts, they have enough helicopters.   And now what do they want to buy?   They want to buy a governorship. They want to buy a Senate seat. They  want to buy a whole institution like the House of Representatives or  the U.S. Senate.   That is not democracy, and the Founders knew it. That is plutocracy.   So the radical economic inequality, which they want to cement into  place with this tax bill, is a direct threat to the Democratic values  of country, the Democratic values of the Founders of America.   They want to eliminate the student loan interest deduction and  lifetime learning credits, a direct assault on middle class upward  mobility. They want to make it much more expensive for young people to  go to college and then to pay their loans back.   They want to eliminate the medical expense deduction, which millions  of families have used in order to take care of a loved one who has a  serious long-term illness or is in long-term care. They just want to  get rid of the medical expense deduction. You should read the letters  and the emails that I am getting from families that are saying: ``This  will bankrupt us.''   Right now, under the medical expense deduction, if you are spending  more than 10 percent of your income on medical expenses, you can start  to deduct it. They want to get rid of that.   Oh, guess who else that hits as collateral damage in the war against  the middle class.   Families with children with special needs. Right now, families with  children with special needs can go to a private school and they can  deduct the tuition and expenses of that education as part of the  medical expense deduction.    Well, the GOP wants to get rid of that, too, because I suppose life  is just not hard enough on families in America who have kids with  autism or kids with muscular dystrophy or kids who face any other  manner of physical or neurological or mental or emotional problems.   We should be on the side of the families who are struggling with  special needs children. We should be on their side. We should be on the  side of the State and local governments that are trying heroically to  address it. Instead, this legislation will pull the rug out from  beneath families with special needs.   They want to impose dramatic new limits on the mortgage interest  deduction, which, again, has been essential for the middle class to be  able to partake of homeownership, which has been so much a part of  building the middle class in our country.   Now, because the public is rebelling against this terrible tax plan  the way the public rebelled against their terrible ACA repeal plan,  which would have stripped 30 million Americans of their healthcare--by  the way, the Senate plan now has smuggled into it a provision which  would go back to the discredited ACA repeal plan by trying to throw  millions of people off of their healthcare by overturning the  individual mandate.   Well, the public has figured this out, and, here, in Washington, it  is a race against the clock.   Will the tidal wave of public opinion reach Washington in time to  stop them from passing a special interest tax scam, which appeals only  to the top 1 percent of the country? Or will they be able to get it  through in time?   But I appeal to my colleagues across the aisle, I beseech them, and I  beg them to revisit the whole thing. This is not how we accomplish  successful tax policy in the United States of America.   We did it in 1986. The Democrats and Republicans came together to do  it.   You know how we did it?   With more than 2\1/2\ years of hearings, discussions, policy debates,  town hall meetings all over America. We invited the best ideas to come  from all sides, and it passed overwhelmingly in the House of  Representatives. It passed overwhelmingly in the U.S. Senate. The tax  reform proposal, at the end, had been vetted and debated so much,  everybody had contributed to it, it was so uncontroversial that it  passed the House on a voice vote overwhelmingly, maybe unanimously.  Nobody even asked for a rollcall vote. The Senate passed its version by  a near unanimous vote of 97-3.   You see, that is how you do real tax reform. You bring the parties  together to do it. There were more than 250 witnesses who appeared in  the House Ways and Means Committee, who appeared before the Senate  Finance Committee. Sure, there were some knockdown, drag-out fights;  sure, the Democrats and Republicans were fighting like cats and dogs,  but we were committed to coming up with a consensus product that would  work for America, and we did it.   What we are seeing in Washington today is the exact opposite. The  determination is to pass a completely partisan piece of legislation at  all costs, with a very narrow majority running over the minority  completely, and it is not going to work because America is a democracy.  Taxation is the way that we support our government; the projects that  we develop together. In taxation of all fields, we need to make sure  that we are getting the best ideas from all sides. You can't ram it  through and you can't crush the opposition.   What we are going to end up with--if they do manage to power this  through with every manner of a backroom deal and a sweetheart contract  and special interest strings attached, if they do manage to get it  through, what you are going to have is a plan that is going to bankrupt  the middle class the way that Donald Trump bankrupted four or five  businesses.   The difference is that if you bankrupt a hotel, if you bankrupt a  casino, if you bankrupt a corporation, well, there were laws that allow  you to get back on your feet, and Donald Trump used them handsomely. He  got back on his feet through the bankruptcy laws.   But what happens if you bankrupt the middle class of America? What  happens if you bankrupt the government of the United States?  [[Page H9566]]    This is irresponsible. This is not responsible governance that is  taking place, to be advancing a plan that a recent Secretary of the  Treasury has called the worst tax plan ever ventured forth in the  history of the United States of America.   We asked the majority in the House and the Senate to pull the plug on  this terrible assault on the middle class, pull the plug on the tax  scam, and let's go back to the hearing rooms and let's have some real  hearings, let's have experts come in and let's look at how to relieve  the tax burden on hardworking middle class taxpayers, relieve the tax  burden on families that have special needs children, relieve the tax  burden on people struggling to go to college and graduate school.   Why don't we try to bolster and strengthen the charitable sector and  colleges and universities and schools across the land instead of trying  to undermine them in order to occasion a dramatic shift of income in  wealth up the ladder in the country?   Let's get back to work together, because if you are able to muscle  this plan through the House and the Senate using every trick in the  book except for negotiation and compromise and cooperation, it will be  a disaster for the American people.   It will come back not only to haunt the political careers of people  who assented to it and participated in it, but it will come back to  haunt the entire country because the deficits and the debt will be out  of control. We know that from every nonpartisan budget estimate and  economist that has looked at it, every single one across the spectrum.  Even the ones who are using the GOP's preferred method of dynamic  scoring are saying it is going to be hell in terms of deficits and in  terms of the debt.   So we are going to end up having to cut Medicare, Medicaid, and  Social Security. That is what they are going to target next.   Whatever happened to the budget hawks? Are they an extinct species  now? They are certainly an endangered species. Or have they just become  budget ostriches?                                time  1800    They are hiding their heads in the sand while this highway robbery  takes place in the Halls of Congress. Then they will come back next  year, and they will say: Oh, look at these terrible deficits; we have  got to cut Social Security; we have got to cut Medicare; we have got to  cut Medicaid.   Now, suddenly, we are reborn as budget hawks again. We are born-again  budget hawks. We can expect that to happen.   In the meantime, economic inequality in the country will continue to  deepen and spread, and economic desperation will spread. We don't need  to do this, Mr. Speaker, we do not need to do this. We are at a time of  record corporate profits; record corporate prosperity. Wall Street has  never been riding higher than it is now.   Why do we need to cut corporate taxes from 35 to 20 percent? Why do  we need to start exporting more jobs abroad by instituting this new  territoriality principle for taxes? A very fancy name that they  assigned to it, do you know what it means? It means that if a business  person is going to set up a factory on Main Street America with 1,000  jobs, they are going to pay full taxes on their business; but if they  set it up in Hong Kong, or Singapore, or Mexico, or Switzerland, or the  Cayman Islands, they are going to pay zero on it because it is not made  in the United States. That is in this bill.   Now, they say they are going to recapture some of the money if it  gets really obscene, but why should we have that principle at all now?  In fact, the law today is compromised enough. It says that if they  relocate their businesses abroad, they don't pay taxes until the  profits are repatriated--until the profits come back. Now, all of it is  on paper. The companies haven't really moved anyplace. That is dubious  enough as it is.   They want to make the current system worse. They want to say that if  you set up your business abroad, if you ship it overseas, either really  or on paper--like to the Cayman Islands, or something like that--you  escape taxation completely. Maybe we will be able to recapture a little  bit of it later through some accounting tricks, but basically this is a  massive invitation to corporate America to outsource jobs overseas--to  ship our jobs overseas.   Now, I know the President of the United States is not much of a  policy wonk. I am not sure if they have apprised him of this provision  yet.   Mr. Speaker, I hope someone who is in touch with the President of the  United States gets in touch with him and tells him that his campaign  promise to put America first--promise to put American jobs first--and  the tax plan that he is about to append his name to, if this actually  happens, will be responsible for outsourcing and offshoring millions of  American jobs, and profits, and taxes. That is built into this  legislation, with a lot of other nasty surprises that surface every  single day, as we try to figure out what is happening on this speeding  train of the tax plan.   This process has nothing to do with representative democracy; it has  nothing to do with integrity in the work of the people's  representatives.   So, we ask our colleagues: Let's take a breather. The American people  don't like what they see. They are rejecting it by more than 2 to 1 in  all of the polls.   I have spoken to my colleagues across the aisle, who are getting very  nervous about their emails, and their letters, and their calls right  now, just like they got very nervous about the ACA repeal--which seemed  like a great idea, until they had a majority in Congress--and then they  realized that they were going to throw millions of people to the  streets.   Now it is a question of whether or not you want to outsource and  offshore millions of jobs, whether you want to drive a $1.5 trillion or  $2 trillion hole in the American deficit and in our economy, and  whether you want to, basically, loot the middle class for the purposes  of a big payday on Wall Street, and among foreign investors from Hong  Kong to Saudi Arabia?   Well, that is the question. That is the choice that faces America  this week, Mr. Speaker. That is what we are looking at. And who are we  as a people? And do we have some sense--some semblance even--of  community such that the GOP would want to try to get even 10 votes or  15 votes from the Democrats? No. All of the Democrats are opposing it.   Fortunately, 13 Republicans have crossed the aisle to say that they  cannot stomach what they are seeing in this bill. We understand that  there may be more coming this week, who are saying that they simply  cannot tolerate what is taking place with this legislation.   But, as always, Mr. Speaker, this is a democracy that we are aspiring  to be, not a plutocracy, not a theocracy, not a family government, not  a royal government, but a democracy, which means that we place all of  our faith and hope in the people to speak up, to talk to their  representatives, to get in touch with them, and to ask them to read the  fine print, so that we are not voting for a tax scam, instead of a tax  bill.   All of the American people have a responsibility to get in touch with  their legislators, Mr. Speaker, to ask: What is in the bill, and how is  it going to affect us and the more than 80 million middle class  families, who are going to end up seeing a tax hike over the next  decade? And how is it going to affect people who take the State and  local tax deduction and people who use the medical expense deduction  for their families? And how is it going to affect people who have  graduated from college and now are struggling to buy a house, or to get  an apartment, or to move out of their parents' basement? And how is it  going to affect them when the deduction for college student loan  interest is abolished?   We need to slow down. We need to examine the priorities and the  values that are built into this bill and see whether they actually  square with the values, the beliefs, the priorities of the American  people, and the needs of the American people.   We think this legislation is way off, Mr. Speaker. We ask the GOP  majority to consider the unanimous opposition of the democratic block  in Congress; we ask them to consider the public opinion polls, which  show the American people rejecting the details of this bill by more  than 2 to 1; and we ask  [[Page H9567]]  them to start over. Let's do it the way Congress did it back in 1986,  when Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan got together, and the Democrats and  Republicans talked about it, fought about it, and debated it. But they  came up with a plan that, in the end, the vast majority of Congress and  the vast majority of the people could support.    Let's not walk the plank for the 1 percent here. We know that there  are some tiny interests in America that want to see this pass. Let's  not walk the plank in Congress for a bill that reflects the interests  of only the tiniest group of people. Let's do the job imagined by that  great Republican President, who served in this body, proudly, from  Illinois, in the House of Representatives: Abraham Lincoln, who spoke  of ``government of the people, by the people, for the people.'' That is  the part of that great triad that we will be betraying if we pass this  bill, because it is not for the people, it is for the 1 percent.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 6 o'clock and 8 minutes  p.m.), the House adjourned until tomorrow, Friday, December 1, 2017, at  9 a.m.                            ____________________
