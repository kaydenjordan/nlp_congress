 Madam Speaker, October 11 is, in South  Dakota, Native American Day.   Now, when America turns its eyes to Indian reservations, so often-- too often--the focus is on poverty, despair, dysfunction. But there are  wonderful stories from Indian Country as well, stories of hope,  opportunity, hard work, success, entrepreneurship.   With that in mind, I want to talk to you about Tashina Red Hawk. She  is a 17-year-old member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe. She is an excellent  student, and she is a rodeo queen. She is my friend, and let me tell  you, Madam Speaker, she is impressive.   Tashina graduated early from high school, and then, when the pandemic  hit and her college classes went online, rather than do what so many  teens did, spending more time on social media or video games, she  decided to become an entrepreneur. It is just an amazing story.   Her local coffee shop had remained closed during the pandemic, so  Tashina saw an opportunity. She wanted to save money for college.   Again, as I said, she is an excellent student. She wants to be a  veterinarian. Now, she knows that path is not going to be easy, and it  is going to take a few dollars in the bank. She knew that this business  opportunity would give her a wonderful chance.   Here she is in front of Tashina's Coffee. She also wanted to make  sure that her local community, her small town, had the same amenities  that large towns do, and I think we can all agree that a powerful cup  of coffee is a great amenity. From firsthand experience, I can tell you  that her coffee really is excellent.   She works so hard, Madam Speaker, long days, long weeks, to make this  business a success. Tashina is passionate about instilling a sense of  independence and hard work among other young people on her reservation.   This woman is going places. I am proud to say that she is my friend.   Her father sums it up well. He said, Tashina ``is not a victim. She  is an advocate.''   Now, Tashina's story is one of many throughout Indian Country and the  State of South Dakota that don't get the attention that they deserve. I  think of so many Tribal leaders that I have met with over the years who  choose self-reliance: Leslie Crow, our office's inaugural Ben Reifel  fellow. She is a teacher, a college instructor, a small business woman.   I think of Lakota Vogel. She is the executive director of the Four  Bands Community Fund, and she works with Tribal members to build  economic opportunity on the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation.   I think of Myrna Thompson, secretary of the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate,  whose long-term service as secretary of that Tribe has been a  consistent and reliable source of leadership for her people.   Madam Speaker, there are so many others. It has been clear to me that  Native American people across this country are resilient. And those who  choose hard work and independence over reliance, they are so often  successful, and they are so often strong.   They provide us a great opportunity. We can be more like them. We can  be more like Tashina and Lakota and Leslie and Myrna.   This Native American Day, we should all take a moment to admire their  hard work and entrepreneurship, and we should follow their example. If  there were more Tashina Red Hawks, we would have a better Nation.                            ____________________
