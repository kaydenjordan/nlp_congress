 Mr. President, we have an opportunity before us today  to fund key priorities that we all agree are important. The American  people elected all of us to do a job, and that job is to provide for  the most important functions of our government.   For far too long, politics has prevented us from committing the  resources necessary to sustain the most critical part of our  government--the military that keeps us safe. This is a chance to cast  aside partisan differences and give the Department of Defense the  stable and consistent funding it needs so it can rebuild readiness and  execute its mission.   Just this morning, Secretary Mattis testified before Congress,  saying: ``I ask that you not let disagreements on domestic policy  continue to hold our nation's defense hostage.'' He is right. We cannot  let these basic issues distract us from the job that we have all, under  the Constitution, taken to provide for the common defense.    I just came from a classified briefing with the Secretary, and he  outlined the most important needs we must fund for our country's  security. So why not come together on issues we can agree on? Six  months ago, this Chamber passed the National Defense Authorization Act  for Fiscal Year 2018 with an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 89 to 9.  In the time since, however, our military remains hamstrung under short- term measures that are standing in the way of modernization and  readiness.   That is why I say to my Democratic colleagues, here is a chance for  you to prove that you are serious about funding the military. Many of  my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have already spoken  clearly about their desire to support the troops.   Last month, the senior Senator from Vermont remarked:         Our military leaders agree, we cannot govern by a       continuing resolution. The military cannot function under       sequestration.    The senior Senator from West Virginia said:         We want our military to be funded properly so they can       defend us.    The senior Senator from Montana said:         The uncertainty we have without a longer budget that goes       to the end of the fiscal year is unacceptable.    The senior Senator from Connecticut said:         I hope there is bipartisan consensus among us on the Armed       Services Committee and in the Chamber as a whole that we need       a strong national defense.    Even today, the minority leader told this body that Democrats  ``support increasing funding for our military.''   So why not act? There is a consensus that we desperately need to fix  the readiness issues in our Armed Forces. Why not take that step today  and vote to provide the stable, predictable funding the Department of  Defense so seriously needs?   When I swore an oath to defend the Constitution, I did it knowing  that every day I hold this office, countless numbers of my constituents  would be wearing the uniform and be in harm's way. Around the globe,  you find Nebraskans, you find Americans protecting and defending the  United States. Each of us here represents people who sacrifice and  serve American heroes. Today is a chance to show them we have their  backs because they have proven, time and time again, that they have  ours.   I urge my colleagues to put aside partisan differences and take the  vote to support our military and the programs that are critical to the  safety and the well-being of this Nation.                           Community Health Centers    Mr. President, we also have a unique opportunity today to address  another program that has a deep, bipartisan well of support in the  Senate. Today I visited with Nebraskans who made the trip to Washington  to advocate for funding for community health centers. Across our  Nation, community health centers are vital to keeping our children and  our families healthy.   Last year, nearly 85,000 Nebraskans received care at centers across  our State during approximately 296,000 visits. These centers provide  high-quality care, compassionate care, and patient-focused care.  Community health centers in my State rank second in quality measures  nationally and first in four other measures involving individual care.  Their focus and their impact on the communities they serve is very  impressive.   We all recognize the importance of these health centers, and I was  proud to recently join my colleagues in the Senate in urging that  funding be reauthorized so these centers can continue to provide the  quality care all Nebraskans and all Americans deserve.   Our military and community health centers are too important to be  caught up in politics. As we find ourselves once again facing the  prospect of yet another impasse, I urge my colleagues to join me in  showing your support for these critical areas. Article I, section 8 of  the Constitution makes clear what our job is: provide for the common  defense and the general welfare of the United States. Let's fulfill  that duty today.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
