 Mr. President, I wish to start by taking a moment to  congratulate the men's basketball team of Northern Kentucky University  for an impressive accomplishment.   My home State of Kentucky is without a doubt known for college  basketball, and now we have another reason to be proud. With last  night's win, the NKU Norse secured the Horizon League championship and  earned a ticket to the NCAA Tournament. With their recent entrance into  Division I play, this is the first year the Norse have been eligible  for a spot in the tournament, and their season of hard work has paid  off.   I would like to congratulate the team, Head Coach John Brannen, and  the entire program, and I look forward to watching them continue their  incredible season.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the passage of the Every Student  Succeeds Act was one of the great triumphs of the last Congress. It  represented the most significant education reform in over a decade. It  heralded ``the largest devolution of federal control to the states in a  quarter-century,'' as the Wall Street Journal put it, empowering  parents, teachers, and schools at the expense of Washington  bureaucrats. It passed the Senate with wide bipartisan support, 85 to  12; President Obama signed it into law.   Yet just a few months later, his administration set to shift power  back from parents and schools to the Washington bureaucracy by  regulation. The Obama administration's so-called accountability  regulation was written in direct--direct--contradiction to the law that  passed Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support and is a prime  example of the Executive overreach we in Congress are working to  overturn.   Today, however, thanks to the Congressional Review Act, we have the  opportunity to move past this overreaching regulation and empower those  closest to our kids once again to ensure our schools are held to the  highest standards.   We will also have the opportunity to move past another Obama-era  regulation that hurts students and those seeking to go into the  teaching profession. I am talking about a regulation that allows the  Federal Government to insert itself into the way States choose to  prepare their teachers for the classroom. States are supposed to be the  leaders on core curriculum and decisions on how to prepare teachers to  best meet the needs of their students--not Washington bureaucrats. By  repealing this regulation, we could help restore that process. Further,  this regulation increases administrative burdens that only divert much  needed resources and focus away from students.   As the Kentucky Association of Colleges for Teacher Education put it,  voting to remove the harmful teacher preparation regulation ``will  allow Kentucky universities and colleges to continue developing and  supporting outstanding teachers who positively impact P-12 children.''   ``Teacher preparation programs have limited and shrinking  resources,'' the letter said. ``[Our] members want to spend those  resources on developing exemplary teachers rather than working on  compliance regulations that have not been shown to result in better  prepared and higher quality teachers.''   That is from the Kentucky Association of Colleges for Teacher  Education.   Groups like this know firsthand that more flexibility is the key to  improving our schools. They know that those closest to students are  best positioned to help our children succeed. They know that the one- size-fits-all education policies of the past are unsustainable for the  future. So it is time to move past both of these harmful education  regulations.   In particular, I want to recognize Senator Sasse and Senator  Alexander, the HELP Committee chairman, for their leadership on these  issues. They introduced legislation similar to the House-passed  proposals that we will vote on this week to overturn these unfair  regulations.  [[Page S1650]]    I encourage colleagues to support both CRA resolutions so that we can  continue building upon educational policies that put America's students  and educators first.                            ____________________     Mr. President, just before the election, CNN ran an  article with the following headline. This is CNN: ``Is ObamaCare really  affordable?'' Answer: ``Not for the middle class.'' It was true then,  it is true now, and it will continue to get worse unless ObamaCare is  repealed and replaced.   In places like my home State of Kentucky, relief cannot come soon  enough. Because of ObamaCare, premiums in Kentucky shot up by as much  as 47 percent this year. Almost half of the counties in Kentucky have  only one option for insurance providers on the ObamaCare exchange.  Families are losing their doctors and are being forced into junk plans.  The list of broken promises goes on and on.   I have said it before; I will say it again: The status quo is  unsustainable. We cannot sit on our hands and do nothing. We must act  before the market collapses.   Americans have repeatedly demanded the repeal of ObamaCare, and  Republicans are fulfilling our promise to do just that. The bill  unveiled in the House this week represents an important step toward  that pledge. It will bring much needed relief to families and small  businesses. It will give Americans more control over their own  healthcare choices. It will help stabilize the marketplace. And just  yesterday, Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Tom Price sent a  letter expressing the administration's support for it. Here is what he  said: ``These proposals offer patient-centered solutions that will  provide all Americans with access to affordable, quality, healthcare,''  he wrote. They will also ``promote innovation, and offer peace of mind  for those with pre-existing conditions,'' he said.   In the coming weeks, committees in the House will publicly debate  this bill. I hope Members will take the time to consider the bill and  continue to ask questions.   Once we receive the bill from the House, the Senate will act because  here is what we know: ObamaCare is a direct attack on the middle class.  It will continue to get worse unless we act to repeal and replace it,  and we are determined to keep our promise to the American people to do  just that.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to H.J. Res. 57.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following  leader remarks on Thursday, March 9, the Senate resume consideration of  H.J. Res. 57, with the time equally divided in the usual form until 12  noon, and that at noon, the Senate vote on passage of the resolution  with no intervening action or debate. I further ask that,  notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, the Senate then resume  executive session for the consideration of  [[Page S1686]]  Executive Calendar No. 18, and that the cloture vote on the nomination  occur at 1:45 p.m.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs be discharged from  further consideration of S. 496 and the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration.    Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that  the bill be considered read a third time and passed, and the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Energy  and Natural Resources Committee be discharged from further  consideration of and the Senate now proceed to the consideration of  S.J. Res. 1.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the joint  resolution be read a third time and passed, the preamble be agreed to,  and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 84, submitted earlier  today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Thursday, March 9; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and that morning business be closed; finally, that 30 minutes of  the majority time on H.J. Res. 57 be under the control of Senator Blunt  or his designee.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of Senators Lankford  and Warren.
