 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a great trailblazer  from my district, Wynona Lipman.   Mrs. Lipman was the first African-American woman to be elected to the  New Jersey State Senate in 1971, and she was the longest serving  senator in New Jersey's history when she passed in 1999.   During her 27 years in the New Jersey State Senate, she fought for  the rights of children, minorities, and the LGBT+ community.   She was a crucial member of the Governor's Advisory Council on AIDS  and Task Force on Child Abuse and Neglect. Her work earned her the  induction into New Jersey's Women's Hall of Fame in 1998. Her legacy  lives on throughout my district.  [[Page H5932]]    There is the Wynona Lipman Ethnic Studies Center at Kean University.  There is the Wynona Lipman Child Advocacy Center for abused children;  and there is also the future Wynona Lipman Courthouse in Essex County.   Mrs. Wynona Lipman was an exceptional leader, and I am proud to  recognize her on the House floor today.                            ____________________
