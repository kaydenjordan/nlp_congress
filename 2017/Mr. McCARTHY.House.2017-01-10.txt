 Mr. Speaker, the government is many things. It is  large, it is complicated, and it is ineffective. I don't think anyone  would call it modern. While the world is rushing forward with things  like voice-based interfaces, autonomous vehicles, online retail, and  data analytics, government is stubbornly years, or even decades,  behind.   We do not have to accept it. One of the purposes of the Innovation  Initiative, our effort here in the House, is to bring government into  the modern age.   Right now, it can still take hours for citizens to get the IRS on the  phone to ask the most basic questions. Parents and students still deal  with the clunky user interfaces when applying for tuition assistance.  And the VA still uses a scheduling system that is a quarter century  old. It doesn't have to be this way.   We have a program right now, the Presidential Innovation Fellows  program, that brings in highly talented professionals from across the  country to help upgrade our government's use of technology. Now, these  are engineers, designers, innovators, and thinkers. They challenge the  old ways of thinking and introduce new approaches to make our  government work the way the American people deserve it to work.   I sponsored the TALENT Act to make sure this innovation program  continues into the future. By drawing on the great talent of the  American people, we can make government effective, efficient, and  accountable.
