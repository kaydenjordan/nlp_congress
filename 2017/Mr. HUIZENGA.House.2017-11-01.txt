 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3903) to amend the Securities Act of 1933 to expand the  ability to use testing the waters and confidential draft registration  submissions, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3903         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Encouraging Public Offerings       Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. EXPANDING TESTING THE WATERS AND CONFIDENTIAL                     SUBMISSIONS.         The Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.) is       amended--        (1) in section 5(d)--        (A) by striking ``Notwithstanding'' and inserting the       following:         ``(1) In general.--Notwithstanding'';        (B) by striking ``an emerging growth company or any person       authorized to act on behalf of an emerging growth company''       and inserting ``an issuer or any person authorized to act on       behalf of an issuer''; and        (C) by adding at the end the following:        ``(2) Additional requirements.--        ``(A) In general.--The Commission may issue regulations,       subject to public notice and comment, to impose such other       terms, conditions, or requirements on the engaging in oral or       written communications described under paragraph (1) by an       issuer other than an emerging growth company as the       Commission determines appropriate.        ``(B) Report to congress.--Prior to any rulemaking       described under subparagraph (A), the Commission shall issue       a report to the Congress containing a list of the findings       supporting the basis of such rulemaking.''; and        (2) in section 6(e)--        (A) in the heading, by striking ``Emerging Growth       Companies'' and inserting ``Draft Registration Statements'';        (B) by redesignating paragraph (2) as paragraph (4); and        (C) by striking paragraph (1) and inserting the following:        ``(1) Prior to initial public offering.--Any issuer, prior       to its initial public offering date, may confidentially       submit to the Commission a draft registration statement, for       confidential nonpublic review by the staff of the Commission       prior to public filing, provided that the initial       confidential submission and all amendments thereto shall be       publicly filed with the Commission not later than 15 days       before the date on which the issuer conducts a road show (as       defined under section 230.433(h)(4) of title 17, Code of       Federal Regulations) or, in the absence of a road show, at       least 15 days prior to the requested effective date of the       registration statement.        ``(2) Within one year after initial public offering or       exchange registration.--Any issuer, within the one-year       period following its initial public offering or its       registration of a security under section 12(b) of the       Securities Exchange Act of 1934, may confidentially submit to       the Commission a draft registration statement, for       confidential nonpublic review by the staff of the Commission       prior to public filing, provided that the initial       confidential submission and all amendments thereto shall be       publicly filed with the Commission not later than 15 days       before the date on which the issuer conducts a road show (as       defined under section 230.433(h)(4) of title 17, Code of       Federal Regulations) or, in the absence of a road show, at       least 15 days prior to the requested effective date of the       registration statement.        ``(3) Additional requirements.--        ``(A) In general.--The Commission may issue regulations,       subject to public notice and comment, to impose such other       terms, conditions, or requirements on the submission of draft       registration statements described under this subsection by an       issuer other than an emerging growth company as the       Commission determines appropriate.        ``(B) Report to congress.--Prior to any rulemaking       described under subparagraph (A), the Commission shall issue       a report to the Congress containing a list of the findings       supporting the basis of such rulemaking.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, over the last two decades, our Nation has experienced a  37 percent decline in the number of U.S. listed companies--public  companies. Equally troubling, we have seen the number of publicly  traded companies fall to around 5,700. These statistics are concerning  because they are similar to the data we saw in the 1980s when our  economy was less than half its current size.   Mr. Speaker, since 2000, the average number of initial public  offerings, or IPOs, has fallen to approximately 135 per year, which  pales in comparison to the more than 450 IPOs filed per year in  [[Page H8319]]  the early 1990s. Notably, there has not been a corresponding downward  trend in the creation of new companies over that same period. This  demonstrates that the regulatory costs associated with going public is  deterring new and emerging companies from making the decision to go  public.   Now, you may ask: Why is this important?   Well, first of all, it is preventing our capital markets from  reaching their full potential, which sounds very academic and pie in  the sky.   What does that mean, though?   What it really means is that it is not allowing Mr. and Mrs. 401(k)  from participating in the economic successes that we have seen lately.   Federal securities regulations are typically written for large public  companies, and this one-size-fits-all framework imposes a  disproportionate burden on small and emerging companies looking to go  public.   The 2012 Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, which was  a bipartisan bill signed into law by President Obama, created a new  type of issue called an emerging growth company, which allowed these  so-called EGCs with less than $1 billion in revenue to be allowed to  communicate with potential investors before an initial public offering  and file confidential draft registration statements with the Securities  and Exchange Commission.   On June 29, 2017, the SEC extended to all companies the option of  submitting in advance draft registration statements for IPOs and  follow-on offerings within 1 year of an IPO.   H.R. 3903, the Encouraging Public Offerings Act, would ensure that  all issues making an IPO would be allowed to communicate with potential  investors before an offering and file confidential draft registration  statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In other words,  we are going to codify what the Securities and Exchange Commission has  said we should be doing.   H.R. 3903 simply codifies that practice into law and it will allow  these companies to finalize their registration documents without undue  expectations from outside influences, and it allows companies to time  their offering with the market before making their Form S-1s public and  beginning an investor road show.   I commend the bipartisan work of Representatives Budd and Meeks on  this important bill to ensure that H.R. 3903 applies to all companies,  without losing valuable investor protections--a key element in this.   This bill will also help encourage companies to go public, and I  encourage all of my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 3903.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Budd), the sponsor of this very  important legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Davidson), a member of the  Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yielded myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, we know that trillions of dollars are  invested in our economy through IRAs, 401(k)s, and other investment  tools. However, these companies need to be publicly traded for Joe and  Jane IRA or Mr. and Mrs. 401(k) to even be able to have the opportunity  to invest in them. That is what this bill is trying to do.   This bill is trying to make sure that those emerging companies, those  small startup kind of companies, who may be very innovative or,  frankly, might be even more mundane, but they are small and they are  looking to grow, that they have an opportunity to do so.   Who benefits? Everyone. Everyone is going to be able to take a much  more broad view of how they are going to invest their hard-earned  dollars that they have worked so long and hard for.   Mr. Speaker, this is also, I believe, an important aspect, because we  know that economic growth comes from small- and medium-sized  businesses. That is where we are going to see really the engine of our  economy rev up.   It is maybe not as much of a headline grabber as some of those big  companies adding 100 or 200 or even thousands of jobs, but all of those  smaller companies adding people into the workforce add up to far larger  numbers than those numbers are.   Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R.  3903, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1585) to amend the Securities Act of 1933 to codify certain  qualifications of individuals as accredited investors for purposes of  the securities laws, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1585         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Investment       Opportunities for Professional Experts Act''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITION OF ACCREDITED INVESTOR.         (a) In General.--Section 2(a)(15) of the Securities Act of       1933 (15 U.S.C. 77b(a)(15) is amended--        (1) by redesignating clauses (i) and (ii) as subparagraphs       (A) and (F), respectively; and        (2) in subparagraph (A) (as so redesignated), by striking       ``; or'' and inserting a semicolon, and inserting after such       subparagraph the following:        ``(B) any natural person whose individual net worth, or       joint net worth with that person's spouse, exceeds $1,000,000       (which amount, along with the amounts set forth in       subparagraph (C), shall be adjusted for inflation by the       Commission every 5 years to the nearest $10,000 to reflect       the change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban       Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics) where,       for purposes of calculating net worth under this       subparagraph--        ``(i) the person's primary residence shall not be included       as an asset;  [[Page H8321]]         ``(ii) indebtedness that is secured by the person's primary       residence, up to the estimated fair market value of the       primary residence at the time of the sale of securities,       shall not be included as a liability (except that if the       amount of such indebtedness outstanding at the time of sale       of securities exceeds the amount outstanding 60 days before       such time, other than as a result of the acquisition of the       primary residence, the amount of such excess shall be       included as a liability); and        ``(iii) indebtedness that is secured by the person's       primary residence in excess of the estimated fair market       value of the primary residence at the time of the sale of       securities shall be included as a liability;        ``(C) any natural person who had an individual income in       excess of $200,000 in each of the 2 most recent years or       joint income with that person's spouse in excess of $300,000       in each of those years and has a reasonable expectation of       reaching the same income level in the current year;        ``(D) any natural person who is currently licensed or       registered as a broker or investment adviser by the       Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or       an equivalent self-regulatory organization (as defined in       section 3(a)(26) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), or       the securities division of a State or the equivalent State       division responsible for licensing or registration of       individuals in connection with securities activities;        ``(E) any natural person the Commission determines, by       regulation, to have demonstrable education or job experience       to qualify such person as having professional knowledge of a       subject related to a particular investment, and whose       education or job experience is verified by the Financial       Industry Regulatory Authority or an equivalent self-      regulatory organization (as defined in section 3(a)(26) of       the Securities Exchange Act of 1934); or''.        (b) Rulemaking.--The Commission shall revise the definition       of accredited investor under Regulation D (17 C.F.R. 230.501       et seq.) to conform with the amendments made by subsection       (a).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, small businesses, entrepreneurs, and emerging companies  are what drive the American economy. We meet them in our districts and  see firsthand the benefits that their dreams, their innovations, and  their hard work provide to our constituents and to our communities.   These innovators, entrepreneurs, and risk takers are critical to our  country's economic growth and prosperity. In fact, small businesses are  responsible for more than 60 percent of the Nation's net new jobs over  the past two decades. Sixty percent of all of the new jobs over the  past two decades come from these small emerging companies.   Their ability to raise capital in the private markets is critical to  the economic well-being of the United States.   So if our Nation is going to have an economy that provides  opportunities for every American, then we must promote and encourage  the success and growth of our small businesses and our startups. It is  this notion that brings us to this legislation that we are discussing  today.   Under current law, accredited investors are allowed to purchase  securities that haven't been registered with the Securities and  Exchange Commission. These types of offerings carry more risks than  public offerings. The thought is that individuals with enough financial  sophistication or net worth can bear the potential losses that may be  associated with these types of securities.   How the law works today is that this definition of an accredited  investor is solely based on wealth.   The ability to participate in a private offering should not be  limited to individuals that pass some type of Federal Government assets  test. Instead, the ability to participate should be expanded to include  all individuals who demonstrate that they have sufficient understanding  of the offering. That may be a doctor who has gone through the training  and has an idea that a new piece of equipment might work for them; or a  scientist who has done research in the lab who says: You know what,  this makes sense to me, and they understand the risk that they are  entering into.   Well, H.R. 1585, the Fair Investment Opportunities for Professional  Experts Act, introduced by Representative Schweikert and Representative  Hill, will expand the definition of an accredited investor in a way  that will appropriately increase the pool of potential investors,  thereby providing additional investment opportunities for more  Americans and enabling the businesses they invest in to create more  jobs.   The expansion of the accredited investor definition will enhance the  ability of many companies, particularly small and emerging companies  and businesses, to raise capital and grow by increasing the pool of  potential investors. These are investors, again, that are very  knowledgeable about that particular area.   This will both provide greater investment opportunities for more  Americans and will enable these businesses to begin investing to create  more jobs.   H.R. 1585 is a bipartisan bill that will help create jobs and a  healthier economy. The bill provides Americans with more investment  opportunities and enhances small companies' ability to raise capital.   This legislation overwhelmingly passed the Financial Services  Committee by a bipartisan vote of 58-2, and I urge all of my colleagues  to vote ``yes'' on this particular bill today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Schweikert), the sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Royce), a member of the Financial Services Committee  and chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee.                                time  1430     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Davidson), a member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, very quickly, just to recap, 60 percent of  all job growth over the past two decades has come from small and  emerging companies. This bill today recognizes that and encourages more  of that to happen. It allows knowledgeable but maybe not wealthy folks  to invest in areas of their expertise. In an era of crowdfunding and  fund-me pages and those types of capital raises and investing, this  bill makes sense. As the gentleman from Ohio, my friend Mr. Davidson,  pointed out, it came through the committee unanimously.   Mr. Speaker, I think we all like to point out that Congress can work  together across party lines and have some common goals that can be  achieved and recognized, and this is one of those bills. I am very  pleased to have such broad support.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage continued support for this bill, H.R. 1585,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
