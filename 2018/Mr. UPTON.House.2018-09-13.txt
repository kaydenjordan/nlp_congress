 Mr. Speaker, safe drinking water for our families is  something that we all should agree on, and this bill delivers on that  promise. It makes certain that communities like Parchment, in my  district, are able to deal with the PFAS contamination issue.   In Parchment, thanks to the proactive efforts of the State of  Michigan, we discovered PFAS in the water, and we immediately sprang  into action to solve the problem in the short term--local, State, and  Federal folks all working in tandem to fix the problem. Specifically,  the bill does that by increasing authorization for the Drinking Water  State Revolving Fund. It critically works to modernize our aging water  infrastructure by providing more resources.   Drinking water quality remains high across the country, but  improvements can and must be made now. This bipartisan bill is yet a  very important step forward. I look forward to supporting it and would  urge all of my colleagues on both sides to do the same.   I want to thank Chairman Shuster for getting this bill to the floor,  and I look forward to ultimately getting it to the President for his  signature.
