 Madam President, today I would like to recognize  the career and service of Mr. Alan Gershenhorn, a 38-year veteran of  United Parcel Service. Mr. Gershenhorn started his career as a part- time package handler in Houston, TX, and has since held a number of  positions within the company, including his most recent position as  UPS's executive vice president and chief commercial officer. He has  been a member of the UPS management committee since 2007.   In addition to his corporate responsibilities, Mr. Gershenhorn served  as a delegate to the World Business Council for Sustainable Development  and as a  [[Page S2481]]  trustee of the UPS Foundation. As trustee, he oversaw investments of  more than 2.6 million volunteer hours and $116 million in direct and  in-kind donations to communities in need around the world in 2016.   Mr. Gershenhorn worked to increase diversity at UPS and to create a  welcoming and inclusive environment for all. In addition to supporting  UPS's business resource groups that championed employees from a wide  array of backgrounds, he also served in a leadership role on the Crecer  BRG.   UPS CEO David Abney recognized Mr. Gershenhorn's impact on UPS as  ``tremendous.'' UPS president of global public affairs Laura Lane noted  that he is an ``outstanding leader who encourages and empowers the  people around him.'' There is no doubt that Mr. Gershenhorn's vision  and strategic leadership have played an integral role in UPS's growth  over the last 38 years.   I am proud to recognize Mr. Gershenhorn's true lifetime of  achievement and example of the American dream. Mr. Gershenhorn  contributed to the dreams of others in every position he held. I  congratulate Mr. Gershenhorn on his nearly four decades of service and  wish him the very best in retirement.                            ____________________
