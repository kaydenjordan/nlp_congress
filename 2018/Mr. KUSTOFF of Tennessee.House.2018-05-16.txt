 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor John  Verell, III, of Madison County, Tennessee.   Johnny, as he is better known to his friends, was named Farmer of the  Year by the University of Tennessee.   Johnny is a third generation farmer who began farming in 2005, 40  years after his grandfather started the family business.   Farmers from across the State were nominated for the honor by their  county extension agents. Johnny's commitment to land stewardship,  community service, and savvy business tactics stood out among all other  nominees.   The Verells' farm is over 5,000 acres of wheat, soybean, and corn.  Johnny manages all the land for sustainability, including installing  wildlife food plots, planting buffer strips along streams, and using  best practices that reduce the amount of fertilizer and pesticides  applied to the crops.   He has even planted 20 acres designated as pollinator habitat to help  native bee populations survive and thrive.   With the help of technology and precision agriculture, the Verells  have been known to produce in excess of 300 bushels per acre.   That is the way things are done in west Tennessee.   Congratulations to Johnny, his wife, Crissy, and their daughter,  Emmi.                            ____________________
