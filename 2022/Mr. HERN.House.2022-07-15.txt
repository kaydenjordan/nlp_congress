 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding the time.   Last month, our Constitution was upheld at the Supreme Court, and  States like Oklahoma took immediate action to protect the lives of the  unborn.   This shouldn't be a hard vote. It is the right for children, fully  formed in the womb, to be born.   Our allies and like-minded nations around the world do not allow  abortions up to the moment of birth, as this bill would do. It is  simply barbaric. My colleagues know it is an unpopular position, which  is why they have resorted to lies and deceptions about lifesaving care  for pregnant women.   Madam Speaker, I urge every Member of this Chamber to vote ``no'' on  H.R. 8296 and protect the right of our future generations to be born.  [[Page H6644]]
