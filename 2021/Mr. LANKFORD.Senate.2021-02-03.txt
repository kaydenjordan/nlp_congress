 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, 2 weeks ago, I heard these words:         History, faith, and reason show the way, the way of unity.       We can see each other not as adversaries but as neighbors. We       can treat each other with dignity and respect. We can join       forces, stop the shouting, and lower the temperature. For       without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury.    President Biden's inaugural address had some pretty glowing terms. I  am grateful to hear statements about unity. The challenge now is to  actually live that out and see that actually done, because while those  words are beautiful, over the past 2 weeks, there have been almost two  dozen hyperpartisan Executive orders that have come out of the White  House, and there doesn't seem to be a push toward actual bipartisan  unity here on this floor.   In fact, in the first 10 days of the Biden administration, he has  signed more Executive orders than the last four Presidents combined in  their first 10 days. President Clinton signed 2; President Bush signed  2; Donald Trump signed 7; President Obama signed 9; and Joe Biden, in  the first 10 days, signed 22 Executive orders--22. And some of those  Executive orders seem to be purely spiteful, just to say: President  Trump put this in, so it must be bad.   Let me give you an example. The Trump administration required,  through an Executive order, every Agency to compile all their guidance  documents into one place so that small business owners and people who  work in small businesses could find the Federal requirements from each  Agency in one spot. They didn't have to hunt all over the place to be  able to find their Federal requirements. Now, that doesn't seem like a  partisan statement. That just seems like good government. But in the  first 10 days of President Biden's term, he got rid of that good  guidance piece and said: No, Federal agencies can go back to playing  hide and seek with their rules again, and small business owners will  just have to figure out where it is. There won't be one place in each  agency to find guidance.    Why would you do that, other than just, if Trump did it, it must be  bad?   Listen, we have to find ways to actually live unity and to be able to  do what is best for the American people. We live in a constitutional  system. We have more than 300 million people. We have great  disagreements on policies, but we come together to work them out.   During 2020, in a time of divided government, this body, the House of  Representatives, and the White House passed five different COVID relief  bills, all with strong bipartisan majorities. We passed all 12  appropriation bills with strong bipartisan majorities. I didn't agree  with everything on every one of those bills, but we worked together to  be able to resolve it. And now, suddenly, it has become a ``we don't  want to talk across the aisle anymore,'' literally 2 weeks after  saying: Do you know what we need as a country? Unity.   Two weeks later it is: How do we cram through something on a straight  partisan vote? How do we block out all Republican voices from the  entire country and make sure their voices are not heard?   Does that feel like unity, 2 weeks into a Presidency?   Ten of my Republican colleagues sat down with President Biden. We  appreciate his time, and he gave 2 hours of his time to listen.   He has proposed $1.9 trillion in additional spending the very first  day on COVID--$1.9 trillion. This is only a few weeks after we just  passed almost a trillion-dollar package dealing with COVID. Literally,  two-thirds of that trillion-dollar package has not even gone out the  door yet, has not even been spent, has not even been allocated.   There are billions and billions of dollars still unallocated for  vaccines, for testing, for schools--all kinds of different things that  we allocated in December--and it is already like: That is not enough.  We need more.   Literally, the CDC and the NIH have billions of dollars unallocated  right now from previous bills that have already been sent. And when my  team contacted the White House team and said, ``Hey, we see this big  proposal; can you tell me what these dollars are allocated for?'' their  response was: It is an emergency. We need a big package.   They literally couldn't tell us what the money would be spent for.   Now, I have to tell you, this is not just a partisan issue for me. I  asked the  [[Page S291]]  exact same thing of the Trump administration. When they made a big  proposal, I went back to them with the exact same question: What is  this money to be used for? They couldn't answer it. So I continued to  press for months until we got an answer, until we got a right amount.  That seems like a reasonable thing for us to do, regardless of who is  in the White House, to say: This is the American people's money. And,  in this case, none of it is actually money that is allocated. All of it  is borrowed.   So before we spend a dime of money that we borrow from China, we  should probably know what it is actually for. In the $1.9 trillion  package proposal, there is even a section in it that is a $50 billion  fund to spend for needs, however the administration wanted to fill that  blank in--$50 billion. No, thank you. We have a basic responsibility to  be able to ask questions on this.   If the reports are accurate, when 10 Republican Senators sat down  with the White House to talk about a different proposal to be more  targeted toward the actual needs right now, if the reports are  correct--I wasn't there at the time, but if the reports are correct-- every time a proposal came up, some of the President's team sitting  against the wall facing the President would shake their head to signal  the answer to President Biden: Say no to that one as well.   We have to find a way to be able to actually work things out. Why is  this so difficult when we did it five times with a divided government  last year? And now the focus is that we can no longer talk to  Republicans. Where did the unity go?   Some of these Executive orders require a lot more attention and a lot  more conversation instead of just imposing things on the American  people because that makes a difficult situation worse.   On his first day in office, President Biden dismantled the title IX  protections for women and imposed new gender identity requirements.  Now, I agree with President Biden, every person should be treated with  dignity and respect. But I also believe that extending respect and  dignity mean being honest about scientific and biological realities of  sex and the differences between men and women.    All people--all people--should be afforded equal opportunity, but  that also includes women and girls. Title IX was put into place to make  sure that we had equal opportunity for women and girls in all areas.  And under the guise of ``preventing discrimination,'' suddenly now  women and girls are being discriminated against.   President Biden's Executive order to ``prevent discrimination on the  basis of sexual orientation and gender identity'' is now a mandate to  force school districts to allow biological boys to compete against  biological girls in high school sports. You might think: What is the  big deal about that? Well, in Connecticut, two high school athletes who  were born male, but now identify as female, won 15 women's championship  titles that were once held by girls--in fact, 9 different girls. Those  titles are gone from those girls. Female athletes are losing medals,  podium spots, and chances for scholarships, or chances to play on a  team with their peers.   Every person should be respected in our Nation, but there is a reason  that title IX was created. This should demand more conversation in this  body, not trying to impose it in an Executive order. Americans are not  united in this issue. We are united that people should be respected and  have every opportunity, but don't run over one group to be able to  provide special status to another group.   I was disappointed, but not surprised, when there was an Executive  order that was released on the issue of abortion--in fact, multiple  Executive orders--on the week of the 48th anniversary of Roe v. Wade.   For unity, President Biden gave the ironically titled ``Memorandum on  Protecting Women's Health At Home and Abroad''--once again, message. It  is a good message, but it falls short of a standard about unity.   According to the most recent Marist poll, 77 percent of Americans  oppose using taxpayer dollars to support abortion in other countries.  Yet under the guise of unity, we are now spending money overseas on  promoting and providing abortion. At a time when we have record debts  and deficits, the Biden administration made one of its first priorities  in the very first week to take some of the dollars that we do have and  spend it to promote and provide abortion overseas in other countries.  That is our foreign aid now.   As if funding abortion providers at home and abroad wasn't enough,  the memo also directs the United States to withdraw from the historic  Geneva Consensus Declarations. Thirty-five nations have agreed to four  basic pillars. These are the four pillars that we just withdrew from:  pillar No. 1, better health for women; pillar No. 2, the preservation  of human life; pillar No. 3, strengthening of family as the  foundational unit of society; and, pillar No. 4, protecting every  nation's national sovereignty in global politics. That was so  controversial that the Biden administration withdrew from that with 35  other countries.   Ironically enough, while President Biden pulled out of that treaty  protecting women's health, he actually installed us deeper into a  treaty with Russia. In his first week in office, President Biden agreed  to a straight extension for 5 years of the outdated New START Treaty  with Russia. The treaty was supposed to manage the proliferation of  nuclear weapons between the United States and Russia, the two big  superpowers, but it was written so long ago and is so out of date that  it completely leaves out other superpowers, like China.   So while Russia has to mind an agreement, China continues to  accelerate. The current status is that China will double its nuclear  stockpile in the next decade, but they are not even in this treaty.   In addition to that, multiple areas are not even addressed in this  New Start Treaty. That is why there was such a push in the previous  administration to renegotiate it, because the New Start Treaty doesn't  even include Russian weapons like ``air-delivered ballistic missiles,  nuclear powered underwater drones, hypersonic glide vehicles,'' and  ``Nonstrategic nuclear weapons.'' They were not even included. So even  under this agreement, Russia can accelerate in those areas and say they  are still meeting the agreement. And President Biden just extended it  for 5 more years and said: We are not going to negotiate it for 5 more  years. Let's just keep going.   The shift has moved from stopping nuclear proliferation to dealing  with climate change. Why can't we do both? Why can't we pay attention  to the environmental issues of our globe but also pay attention to the  issue of nuclear proliferation? It is not like this is going away. It  hasn't.   President Biden also took several issues on immigration, specifically  border security. Right after the inauguration, speaking on unity, he  puts out an Executive order with bizarre doublespeak in it that stated  this: ``The United States is a country with borders and with laws that  must be enforced.'' But the order itself after that literally put a  100-day moratorium o all deportations. It is like: We need to enforce  our laws. And then the first step of it was that for 100 days we are  not going to actually enforce our laws.    Now, this is not just some crazy piece here. The 100-day moratorium  for deportations included individuals who are listed as criminal  aliens. It also included people who had what is called a final order of  removal from a court. That means that they have gone through every  appeal in our court system here and a court has said: No, you do not  qualify to be here legally. They have ordered them removed from the  country. President Biden said no, we actually want them to be able to  stay, even after a court order.   There is this great myth that ICE is roaming through cities in  America just rounding people up. The fact is, in 92 percent of ICE  enforcement and removal operations, those individuals have a criminal  conviction or a pending criminal charge--92 percent. But President  Biden immediately put a 100-day moratorium on it and said: Those  individuals don't need to be deported. We will think about it for 100  days.   Now, thankfully, a Federal court has already stepped in and stopped  that. Their statement was that this moratorium has--this is the quote  from the Federal court--``no reasonable justification.'' I agree. That  is not enforcing our laws. That is not engaging in bipartisan unity.  [[Page S292]]    The vast majority of Americans want legal immigration. The vast  majority of Americans also believe that if someone has committed a  crime in our country and they are not legally in our country, they  should be deported. But the message that is being sent out is that  those individuals won't.   As odd as it may seem, on January 26, President Biden instituted a  travel ban from Brazil, the United Kingdom, Ireland, most of the EU,  from South Africa, and said: Those folks can't come because of COVID  threat. But at the same time he said he wants to evaluate title 42,  which may allow people to come into the United States from Mexico, and  do catch-and-release again here in the United States. So at the same  time saying that business travelers from all over the world really  don't need to come because of COVID threat, they are also looking at  our southern border and saying: Yeah, but people coming from South  America, Central America, they may be OK to come into the country and  then be released while there is still a hearing pending.   May I remind this body, in the past year we have lost 21 people from  the Department of Homeland Security along our southern border. Twenty- one agents and officers have died from COVID exposure while interacting  with people coming from South America and Central America.   Why in the world do you close down the borders to business travelers  and then start talking about opening them up to people not legally  crossing the border? This is not the America we are looking for.   I had a lot of people in my State who were shocked, in the first days  of the Biden administration, when he stopped the Keystone Pipeline and  then he stopped all energy exploration on Federal lands. Those are jobs  in my State. As President Biden likes to talk about, those are union  jobs that are all over the country.   Thousands of people lost their jobs on day one of the Biden  administration with a unilateral declaration: We are not going to do  energy exploration, and we are not going to complete this pipeline.   What does that mean? That means to the Federal taxpayer, royalties  are down because they are not gaining royalties off of the use of that  land, so the taxpayer loses. That means jobs are down all over the  country, especially in the west. And that means prices will go up for  the consumer.   We are not running all on electricity right now. We are still running  on oil and gas for the vast majority of our vehicles. And while I am  all for multiple, different types of energy, that is not what is  happening right now.   We should address this. We should work for unity. But right now, we  are not even having dialogue. We are not even included in the  conversation. If we are going to have unity, we have to talk about the  hard issues and actually come to a decision on how we are going to  resolve those.   With that, I yield the floor.
