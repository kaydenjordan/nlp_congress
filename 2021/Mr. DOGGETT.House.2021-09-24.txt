 Madam Speaker, ``Let Freedom Ring'' has been replaced by  Texas Republicans with ``Let vigilantes hunt.''   Neighbors spying on neighbor. Offering $10,000 bounties on a driver,  a physician, anyone who offered counsel. So invasive that an Arkansas  convict has now sued a San Antonio physician. Mandatory motherhood,  even in cases of rape and incest, with Republicans targeting only those  survivors who are seeking healthcare.   Protect the fundamental right of choice. Reject this narrow-minded,  unconstitutional, Republican power-hungry, vigilante injustice. Join us  next Saturday at the Women's March for Freedom at the State Capitol in  Austin.
