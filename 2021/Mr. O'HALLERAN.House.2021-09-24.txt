 Madam Speaker, this week an Arizona legend turned 101  years old. Major Fannie McClendon, known to her friends as Fran,  celebrated her 101st birthday on September 22.   Fran is one of seven known survivors of the 855 all-African American  6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion who served overseas during  World War II.   Known as the Six Triple Eight, the women accomplished the incredible  task of moving a 2-year backlog of undelivered mail to 7 million  servicemembers. Working three shifts per day, they processed  approximately 65,000 pieces of mail per shift.   Embracing their motto, ``no mail, low morale'', the women cleared the  2-year backlog of mail and packages in 3 months for U.S. military,  civilians, and Red Cross workers throughout Europe. Their hard work and  dedication brought hope and comfort to Americans around the world  during some of our darkest times.   Today, join me in wishing Major McClendon a very happy 101st  birthday.                            ____________________
