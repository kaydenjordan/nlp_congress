 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of H.  Res. 178, which preserves the benefits our seniors are entitled to and  ensures these programs are available for future generations.   While House Republicans are focused on embracing extreme fiscal  policies that will defund the critical programs that Americans depend  on, House Democrats are fighting to protect and strengthen them.   In my district alone, we have 90,000 residents who are eligible for  Medicare and Social Security. That is why we must protect these  critical lifelines for our seniors, families, and our most vulnerable  neighbors.   While Republicans may say the right things when they are with their  constituents, their actions speak louder than words. Republicans have  repeatedly tried to cut and modify these programs and take away the  benefits that Americans have paid into and earned. They have proposed  ending Federal programs after 5 years unless reauthorized. They have  proposed eliminating cost-of-living adjustments for some seniors. They  have proposed vouchers. They have proposed increasing the retirement  age.   H. Res. 178 commits the House of Representatives to protecting Social  Security and Medicare and makes clear their status as foundational  promises of our society. This resolution honors the wishes of the  majority of the American people to strengthen and improve Social  Security and Medicare and ensures that these programs will be available  for future generations of Americans.   In short, H. Res. 178 represents what House Democrats stand for:  putting people over politics.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to defeat the previous question so  we can bring up this important legislation.
