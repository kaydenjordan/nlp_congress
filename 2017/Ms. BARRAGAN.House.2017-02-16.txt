 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to echo concerns by my  colleagues. I am concerned, but not surprised, about the growing  revelations from the intelligence community of the Trump campaign's  contact with Russian officials. Russia's involvement in our elections  undermines American democracy.   General Flynn's resignation is no substitute for answers to grave  concerns and questions over President Trump's involvement in secret  communications with the Russians and Vladimir Putin's hand in our  elections.   I believe that this is just the tip of the iceberg. This is not just  about leakers, but this is about the Trump-Russia ties. We need a full,  bipartisan investigation. It is our duty.                            ____________________
