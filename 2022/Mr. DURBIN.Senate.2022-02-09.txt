 I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Lujan)  is necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Lujan)  is necessarily absent.    Madam President, I think Senator Blunt from Missouri is  going to ask for recognition, and I do not object to that. But I was  scheduled for earlier, and I would like to ask unanimous consent that  when the upcoming rollcall is completed, I be the first Senator  recognized.    Sorry, after the second rollcall, that I be the first  Senator.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Lujan)  and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Lujan)  and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) are necessarily absent.    Madam President, our history books are filled with the  names of great men and women who devoted their lives to others. One who  may not be as recognizable as others is Norman Borlaug. He was an  American biologist. He successfully developed a strain of wheat that  grew more quickly and was disease-resistant. His work to feed the  hungry has been credited with saving a billion lives worldwide.   Madame Marie Curie was a Polish chemist who is remembered for her  discovery of radium and polonium and her huge contribution toward  finding a treatment for cancer.   Of course, there are all the scientists throughout history who  developed lifesaving vaccines: Edward Jenner, smallpox vaccine; Louis  Pasteur, rabies; Albert Calmette, TB; Leila Denmark, whooping cough;  Jonas Salk, polio. I might add Albert Sabin, too, because I was a kid  and remember he came up with the oral version, which meant we didn't  have to get a shot. Kids remember that.   These men and women will be remembered for improving and saving lives  with their breakthroughs in medicine, agriculture, and science.   I want to nominate another person to be remembered in that same  light. His name is Anthony Fauci. Born in 1940, Tony Fauci, the  grandson of Italian immigrants, grew up a Yankees fan in Brooklyn. He  was the captain of his high school basketball team. He worked  construction jobs over breaks in the summer from school.   He ultimately decided he wanted to pursue a career in medicine. Thank  goodness he did. In 1972, Anthony Fauci accepted a senior researcher  position at the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  at the National Institutes of Health, and for the past 38 years, Dr.  Fauci has been the leader of that Institute. He has advised seven  Presidents of both political parties. He has guided our Nation and the  world through countless public health crises--SARS, avian influenza,  swine flu, Zika, Ebola.   Aside from his work against COVID-19, he is best known for his work  on HIV/AIDS. Anthony Fauci's tireless efforts on HIV/AIDS, both  domestically and worldwide, through the creation of PEPFAR, the  President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, is the main reason why HIV/ AIDS is no longer a death sentence.   Some of us can remember when HIV/AIDS was first discovered. I can  recall coming to vote in the House and somebody stopping me on the  sidewalk and saying: Did you hear Magic Johnson has AIDS? I can  remember hearings in the House Budget Committee as a young Congressman  when we thought it was a death sentence that we were all going to face  eventually. There was ultimate panic in the air, but thank goodness  there were talented people like Tony Fauci with the nerves of steel  needed to confront that.   Harold Varmus, a former NIH Director, once said:         PEPFAR has turned around declining life expectancies in       many countries and likely saved some countries--even an       entire continent--from economic ruin.    Larry Kramer, a prominent and well-known AIDS activist who recently  passed away, called Dr. Fauci ``the only true and great hero'' among  government officials of the AIDS crisis.   For his work on HIV/AIDS, Dr. Fauci was awarded the Presidential  Medal of Freedom in 2008--our Nation's highest civilian honor--from  then-President George W. Bush, who called Dr. Fauci ``my hero.''   Dr. Fauci has devoted his career and his life to improving public  health. He has saved countless lives here and around the world. These  days, he is working 18 hours a day, 7 days a week, shuttling from the  NIH to the White House and back home.   He is a classic example of American excellence, a brilliant  scientific mind. Yet, despite all this, despite all that I have told  you about this man, some Members of today's Republican Party have  chosen to make him a political target. They think attacking Dr. Fauci  will cause us to forget the real history of COVID-19.    You see, the Republican Party has consistently failed the American  people when it has come to COVID--from President Trump's refusing to  take it seriously, to the discouragement of mask-wearing and vaccines,  to promoting horse tranquilizers and bleach and bizarre theories as a  cure. They have too little courage to face their communities and to do  the hard work of governing during this public health crisis, so they  have invented a political target, a convenient target, on which to  focus their blame.   Instead of addressing this public health crisis head on, they are  trying to deflect and distract from it in attacking Dr. Tony Fauci.  They are, without evidence, suggesting the false narrative that Dr.  Fauci secretly and purposely funded illicit research that caused this  virus. They are even criticizing his government salary, for goodness'  sakes.   He accrued that salary, I might remind them, over four decades of  public service, as though he wouldn't make twice or three times that  amount in the private sector today. They are questioning his financials  and ties to the drug industry, even though he has made every requested  document available, and no malfeasance or conflicts have been found.   So why do they do this? Why are they determined to run this man down?  Why would they attack this public servant who is working around the  clock to keep us safe?  [[Page S600]]    It is because it is much easier to malign a person than it is to do  the hard work of enacting policies to tackle this virus and keep  America healthy. Their distractions have sunk so low that they are  using these attacks to raise money for their political campaigns.   We have Republican candidates, from Ohio to Florida, who are running  ads entitled, ``Fire Fauci,'' who are promising to subpoena him and  reduce his salary to zero if it is within their power, who are selling  ``Freedom over Fauci Flip-Flops,'' which comes from none other than the  Governor of Florida. A few of my Senate Republican colleagues have  loaded up their websites with anti-Fauci fervor, conveniently located  next to a ``donate here'' option.   We have FOX News' anchors and podcast comedians giving air time to  anti-vaxxers who are hoping to get their 15 minutes of fame by leveling  baseless claims against Dr. Fauci, baseless claims that have resulted  in death threats and harassment against Dr. Fauci, his wife, and his  children.   Let me ask you this: What have Dr. Fauci's most vocal critics done to  advance the cause of public health?   Nothing. They have done nothing. Worse than that, their lies about  Dr. Fauci and about COVID are creating a toxic political environment  that is literally killing people, as 900,000 Americans have now died  from COVID. Some of these deaths could have been prevented with  vaccinations.   Americans who are unvaccinated--listen to this; the Presiding Officer  knows it--are 97 times more likely to die from COVID than their  vaccinated and boosted counterparts--97 times more likely to die. Yet,  instead of spending their time encouraging vaccinations and promoting  other proven, legitimate public health measures that would end this  pandemic, many in the Republican Party want to get their 5 or 10  minutes of Sun on FOX TV, and they spend their time attacking Dr.  Fauci.   These attacks are a shameful fraud, and for what--to fundraise? to  win another guest appearance on FOX?   Working in politics, you get used to a lot of things--grandstanding,  demagoguery, hypocrisy--but what some of my Republican colleagues are  doing to Dr. Fauci is the lowest form of political life. They are lying  about someone who has devoted his life to saving people--saving AIDS  patients, containing and eradicating Ebola, preventing the spread of  Zika and the avian flu. He is someone who has worked harder than anyone  to end this COVID pandemic.   David Relman, a microbiologist who has advised the U.S. Government  for years on biological threats, said this of Dr. Fauci:         Nobody is a more tireless champion of the truth and the       facts . . . I am not entirely sure what we would do without       him.    Dr. Fauci's name is--and deserves to be--listed alongside our world's  greatest scientific minds. History will reserve another place for those  who lied about him for their own gain--inciting hatred, prolonging this  pandemic, and contributing to needless pain and suffering.   America is blessed to have the talent, dedication, and compassion of  Anthony Fauci in the midst of this deadly pandemic.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article from  The Washington Post, entitled, ``Anthony Fauci is up against more than  a virus,'' after these remarks.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                              [Jan. 27, 2022]               Anthony Fauci Is Up Against More Than a Virus                      (By Dan Zak and Roxanne Roberts)         Two years into the pandemic, the threats and vitriol have       not stopped. And the many Americans who still trust him are       exhausted.        The doctor opens the front door. Never mind introductions.       ``I know who you are. Do you think these guys would let you       get this close to me, if we didn't know who you are?'' Across       the street is a security agent in Nikes, a badge on his belt.       He's not the only one watching.        ``I mean, isn't it amazing?'' the doctor says. ``Here I am,       with cameras around my house.''        The house is modest for Washington: stucco and brick, cozy       and cramped. No obvious tokens of celebrity or esteem.       Icicles on the dormant hot tub out back. Bottles of red wine       and olive oil on the kitchen counter.        ``It's messy because, as you know, in covid times, nobody       comes over. So nobody cares.''        People are coming by outside, though. They are snapping       photos. Two years into the pandemic Anthony Fauci remains the       face of America's covid response, and on this cold Saturday       in January thousands of marchers are descending on the       capital to rally against vaccine mandates. Are some of them       staking out his home?        The security agents ``usually leave at a certain time,''       the doctor says. ``But tonight they're going to sleep in our       guest room.''        Year 3 of covid times. Nearly 900,000 Americans are dead.       An average of 2,000 (mostly unvaccinated) Americans are dying       every day now, even though there is a simple measure to limit       such suffering--made possible in large part by the Vaccine       Research Center founded under Fauci. And yet many Americans       would rather take their chances with a virus than a vaccine,       because there's more than just a virus going around. There's       something else in the air. Symptoms include rage, delusion,       opportunism and extreme behavior--like comparing Fauci to       Nazi doctor Josef Mengele (as Lara Logan did on Fox News in       November), or setting out for Washington with an AR-15 and a       kill list of ``evil'' targets that included Fauci (as a       California man did last month).        ``Surrealistic,'' the doctor says.        He has not had a day off since the beginning. ``I would say       I'm in a state of chronic exhaustion.'' He quickly adds:       ``But it's not exhaustion that's interfering with my       function.'' He is a precise man whose tour in the information       war has made him extra-vigilant about his words. ``I can just       see, you know, Laura Ingraham: `He's exhausted! Get rid of       him!' ''        Fauci has been a doctor and public servant for more than 50       years. He's been the country's top expert on infectious       diseases under seven U.S. presidents. George H.W. Bush once       called him his personal hero. Under George W. Bush, Fauci       became an architect of an AIDS-relief program that has,       according to the U.S. government, saved 21 million lives       around the world.        He knows how a virus works. He knows how Washington works.       He thought he knew how people worked, too--even ones who       called him a murderer, as AIDS activists did decades ago       because they felt left for dead by a neglectful government.       Back then the angry people were motivated by truth and       science. Fauci had something to learn from them, and they had       something to learn from him. The shared mission was pursuing       facts and saving lives. Fear and uncertainty could be eased       by data and collaboration. Combatants, however scared or       passionate, shared a reality.        Now?        ``There is no truth,'' Fauci says, for effect. ``There is       no fact.'' People believe hydroxychloroquine works because an       Internet charlatan claims it does. People believe the 2020       election was stolen because a former president says so.       People believe that Fauci killed millions of people for the       good of his stock portfolio because it's implied by TV       pundits, Internet trolls and even elected leaders. Fauci is       unnerved by ``the almost incomprehensible culture of lies''       that has spread among the populace, infected major organs of       the government, manifested as ghastly threats against him and       his family. His office staff, normally focused on       communicating science to the public, has been conscripted       into skirmishes over conspiracy theories and misinformation.        ``It is very, very upending to live through this,'' Fauci       says, seated at his kitchen table in the midwinter light. He       pauses. ``I'm trying to get the right word for it.'' He is       examining himself now, at 81, in the shadow of the past two       years. ``It has shaken me a bit.''        The way he can comprehend the situation is in the context       of the Jan. 6, 2021, siege of the Capitol. There it was, on       live TV, an experiment as clear as day: The abandonment of       truth has seismic consequences.        Something has been replicating in the American mind. It is       not microbial. It cannot be detected by nasal swab. To treat       an affliction, you must first identify it. But you can't       slide a whole country into an MRI machine.        ``There's no diagnosis for this,'' Fauci says. ``I don't       know what is going on.''        A virus is a terrifying force that hijacks civilization. A       bureaucracy, intricate yet imperfect, is what we have to take       back control. For better and worse, Fauci became the       personification of both. He has been sainted and satanized       over the past two years, since he first fact-checked       President Donald Trump. His inbox is a cascade of hosannas       and go-to-hells. His days often start at 5 a.m. His nights       are fitful. What more could he have done today? What fresh       horror awaits tomorrow? He is fighting for a best-case       scenario, urging preparation for the worst, and fretting that       nothing will ever be good enough.        ``I do worry about him,'' says Francis Collins, until       recently the director of the National Institutes of Health.       ``He's incredibly frustrated'' by the attacks ``because it's       a distraction. But there is no part of Tony Fauci that's       ready to give up on a problem just because it's hard.''        ``Being two years into this, and being at the tip of the       spear--it takes a certain person to be able to persevere       through that,'' says Michael T. Osterholm, director of the       Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the       University of Minnesota. ``It's almost like asking someone to       run a marathon every day of their life.''        ``He's always had complete bipartisan support, up until       covid,'' says AIDS activist  [[Page S601]]       Peter Staley, who once picketed NIH and is now a dear friend       of Fauci's. ``It's flat-Earth time. Nothing makes sense. This       is a guy who tries to let science dictate what he says and       does. Now they're turning what is a pristine record into       something evil. They lie, and repeat the lie 100 times until       people think it's true.''        Staley calls Fauci multiple times a week to check in, ask       him how he's doing, discuss the covid response and the       resistance to it.        ``What do I tell him?'' Staley says. ``What kind of advice       do I give him to win that war? It's very frustrating. It's       almost unwinnable.''        Look at Fauci's Jan. 11 appearance before the Senate Health       Committee. Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) chided Fauci and other       officials for spreading ``skepticism and mass confusion''       with mixed messaging on covid guidelines. A harsh but fair       criticism. Then two senators--who each happen to have medical       degrees--got personal.        ``You are the lead architect for the response from the       government, and now 800,000 people have died,'' said Sen.       Rand Paul (R-Ky.).        Fauci scolded Paul that such an ``irresponsible'' statement       ``kindles the crazies.'' ``I have threats upon my life,       harassments of my family,'' Fauci said, suggesting that the       California man targeted him because he ``thinks that maybe       I'm killing people.''        For years, Fauci had joked that his personal philosophy       comes from ``The Godfather'': ``It's not personal; it's       strictly business.'' The business is science. Science helped       him cure vasculitis. Science helped him and others transform       HIV from a death sentence to a condition managed by a pill.        What he was facing now felt like it had nothing to do with       science.        Later in the hearing, Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.)       displayed a giant prop paycheck depicting Fauci's $400,000-      plus salary. Marshall accused Fauci and ``Big Tech'' of       hiding his financial investments, which created an       ``appearance that maybe some shenanigans are going on.''        Fauci, bewildered and incensed, replied that his assets,       which he had disclosed for decades, were available to the       public. (While this statement was technically true, his       disclosures were not just a Google search away; after the       hearing, Marshall's office requested and received the       documents from NIH, then declared that Fauci ``lied'' about       the ease of their availability.)        When Marshall finished his questioning, Fauci let his       frustration get the better of him. ``What a moron,'' he       muttered to himself, not intending it for the microphone.        What was going on here? Senators were ``trying to troll       Fauci, and they're trying to bring him down to their level,''       says Matthew Sheffield, a former conservative activist who       now runs a political commentary website called       Flux.community. ``They know if they can get him to call       people a moron, or engage in pettiness the way that they       engage in pettiness constantly--if he does it even once, then       it's a victory for them.''        Paul disputes this characterization and claims that Fauci       deserves ``some culpability'' for the pandemic because a       grant from his agency funded research in a lab in Wuhan, the       Chinese city where the novel coronavirus was first detected.       (The exact origins of the virus remain unknown. Scientific       consensus points to an animal-to-human transfer, but the       debate is ongoing.)        Marshall's office did not have comment on Sheffield's       theory. After the hearing, the senator's campaign website did       start selling $29 T-shirts, featuring the doctor's likeness,       to commemorate the moment: ``Send Fauci a message by getting       your own `MORON' t-shirt!''        The way in which the United States funds and manages       science provides a solid foundation for skepticism and       conspiracy, says University of Pennsylvania professor       Kathleen Hall Jamieson, who studies science communication and       misinformation.        Yes, scientific recommendations change based on available       data, a truth that can be exploited to make responsible       leaders appear inconsistent or incompetent.        Yes, Fauci has a high salary by government standards, has       been in the same unelected position for 38 years and oversees       a budget of $6 billion that flows into grants; those are       truths on which a distrusting person could build a theory       about corruption, unaccountable elites and a nefarious flow       of money from this or that institution to this or that lab.        Yes, the virus seems unaccountable to our best efforts and       fueled by our worst instincts. Yes, the ways it has ended and       upended people's lives have been undeserved, tragic, crazy-      making. These are scary truths that you can neutralize with a       fantasy about how a single human villain is to blame.        The attacks and misinformation seem to be having an effect.       Confidence in Fauci is softening, according to polling       conducted since April by the Annenberg Public Policy Center.       After holding steady last summer and autumn, the percentage       of Americans who are confident that Fauci provides       trustworthy information about COVID-19 is down six points       since April, from 71 to 65 percent.        ``For the first time in my lifetime--and I am an elderly       woman--the voice that speaks on behalf of the best available       knowledge in science has weathered sustained attack,'' says       Jamieson, director of the policy center. ``Confidence [in       Fauci] remains high despite that attack, but the erosion is       worrisome.''        With Trump long gone from the White House and public       exhaustion with precautions surging alongside the omicron       variant, Fauci may now be more useful to the pundits who need       a villain than those who need a hero. ``Fauci must go,'' the       editors of the conservative National Review demanded this       month. ``I'm over COVID,'' talk-show host Bill Maher told       Deadline before his show last week. His guest, author Bari       Weiss, echoed the frustration of millions: We were told ``you       get the vaccine and you get back to normal. And we haven't       gotten back to normal.''        ``The stalwart Fauci was the wise Oracle of Delphi to then-      President Donald Trump's babbling brook about household       bleach as an injectable, anti-viral agent,'' Washington Post       columnist Kathleen Parker wrote this week.        ``Maybe it's my imagination,'' she continued, ``but Fauci       appears less confident of late, perhaps weary of his own       voice and exhausted by two years of on-camera appearances.''        Sen. Marshall exaggerated this erosion during the Jan. 11       hearing. ``You've lost your reputation,'' he told Fauci,       adding: ``The American people don't trust the words coming       out of your mouth.''        ``That's a real distortion of the reality,'' Fauci       answered.        Marshall replied with a truth from the world outside of       medical science: ``Perception is reality.''        Fauci is not naive. He gets that a third of the country       won't hear him. He still understands Washington enough to see       how it is deteriorating in new and disturbing ways, as fringe       thinking spreads to the central organs. As Peter Staley puts       it: ``Because one party has turned so anti-science, Tony's       power is no longer stable.''        Yet Fauci still thinks he is an effective messenger. And he       still hasn't totally given up on the people who are making       his life miserable. After the exchange with Marshall, and a       news cycle dominated by ``moron'' instead of ``omicron,''       Fauci told his own incredulous staff: Maybe the senator has a       point. Maybe my financial investments, though disclosed and       available, should be much easier to see.        As for the citizens who wish him harm, he can't help but       search for some signal, some symptom, that could help him       understand.        ``I'm always looking for the good in people, that kernel of       something that's positive,'' Fauci says. ``And it's tough to       imagine that that many people are bad people. And, I mean,       it's just--has something been smoldering in their lives?       Something that's sociologically evasive to me?''        He wonders: Does their resentment indicate an underlying       issue that needs--for lack of a better term--healing?        ``Maybe it's pain that they're feeling, that's driving       it?'' he says, as if bedside with a patient. ``And we're       focusing on the aberrancy of their actions, but we really are       not fully appreciating that maybe they're suffering. And       they're rebelling against a failing of society, maybe, to       address some of their needs. Maybe we need, as a nation, to       address the fundamental issues that are getting, you know,       tens of millions of people to feel a certain way.''        On Sunday, in front of the Lincoln Memorial, thousands of       people rallied against vaccine mandates. Fauci's name was       scrawled on many signs. The rhetoric was familiar. ``Dr.       Fauci is the new Jeff Mengele from World War II,'' said a       Long Island construction worker named Gio Nicolson, who       described Fauci as both ``puppet'' and ``dictator.'' A 57-      year-old woman named Robin Field drove three hours from       Yorktown, Va., to hold up a homemade sign that depicted       Fauci's decapitated head in a noose, under the words ``HANG       EM HIGH.''        Fauci is guilty of treason, according to Field. She's done       her own research, she says, and it's clear that his       recommendations have both ``killed people'' and made him       money.        The violence of her sign, though--where is that coming       from? At a primal level, it seems to convey pain or fear.        ``Of co--'' Field starts, then stops. ``Well . . .''        How would she put it?        ``I feel so bad that so many people have lost their lives.       That hurts, because we all have loved ones that have touched       our hearts and passed away.''        Almost no one alive has experienced this kind of sudden       mass death, this level of widespread illness, this freezing       and fracturing of all life. It hurts. For much of the 1980s,       every single one of Fauci's AIDS patients died. Ugly deaths       that he was powerless to prevent. He had to suppress the pain       and bury the emotion to get through each day. When he recalls       that era, his eyes water and his throat constricts. His self-      diagnosis is a quick aside (``post-traumatic stress'') as he       bridges the past and the present. In the middle of a       cataclysm, it's hard to see the end. But it does end.        ``As a society, when we get out of this, you know, we're       going to look up and say, `Oh, my goodness, what we've been       through,' '' he says. ``We've had an outbreak where we've       lost close to 900,000 people in the last two years. That's       going to have a long-lasting effect.''        In the early '70s, when he was chief resident in a       Manhattan hospital, Fauci remembers glancing out over the       East River in the middle of the night, ``Saying, you know,       I'm tired, but I can't stop until at least this patient is       stabilized.'' When he was the main attending physician at NIH       during the AIDS crisis, he wouldn't leave the ward until he       addressed every patient need. Now he views  [[Page S602]]       the entire country as his patient--a patient afflicted by       both a virus and an undiagnosed condition that hampers its       ability to fight it.        He could spare himself further pain and exhaustion and       allow America to see another doctor. He could tag out.        ``That's not my character,'' he says. ``I don't do that.''        The patient, you see, is not stabilized yet.        Fauci stares out the kitchen window into his small       backyard. Right now he sees a crossroads for America. The       best-case scenario: increased vaccination, more immunity,       antiviral drugs, a virus under control. If we work together.       The worst: a new variant, as transmissible as omicron but       more deadly, exacerbated by that comorbidity--the       deterioration of our minds and politics.        ``It's like it's 2 o'clock in the morning, and I'm looking       out the window at the East River,'' Fauci says, ``and I got a       patient who's bleeding, and another patient has a myocardial       infarction, and another patient who has septicemia--''        The sense memory prompts a sort of pep talk for the       present.        ``There's no time to be exhausted, folks. You got a job to       do.''     Madam President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, this week, the Senate will vote to confirm  Judge Leonard Stark to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the  Federal Circuit.   Judge Stark is an exceptional and experienced jurist. For the past 14  years, he has served the District of Delaware--first, as a magistrate  judge and, since 2010, as a district court judge.   He has presided over 6,000 civil and criminal cases, including 2,400  patent matters and 63 patent trials.   This experience will be of particular importance on the Federal  Circuit for two reasons. First, unlike the 12 other courts of appeals,  the Federal Circuit has a specialized jurisdiction; it hears all of the  Nation's patent appeals. Second, Judge Stark would replace the only  active judge on the court who has previously served as a trial judge.  This makes his extensive background as a trial judge especially  valuable.   Judge Stark brings with him considerable experience serving on  Federal appeals panels. He has sat, by designation, on the Third and  Federal Circuits, where he heard 54 appeals and authored 11 unanimous  opinions. Before joining the bench, Judge Stark served as an Assistant  U.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware for 4 years. He worked as a  litigation associate at an international law firm. And he clerked on  the Third Circuit.   Judge Stark earned his bachelor of arts, bachelor of science, and  master of arts simultaneously at the University of Delaware. He was  awarded the prestigious Rhodes Scholarship and received a doctorate in  philosophy from the University of Oxford. He also holds a J.D. from  Yale Law School. With such impressive credentials, it is clear why the  American Bar Association rated Judge Stark unanimously as ``Well  Qualified'' to sit on the Federal Circuit.   His expertise in adjudicating patents combined with his experience  hearing appeals will be an asset to the Federal Circuit and to our  industrious, inventive Nation. I will be voting for Judge Stark's  confirmation, and I urge my colleagues to join me.
