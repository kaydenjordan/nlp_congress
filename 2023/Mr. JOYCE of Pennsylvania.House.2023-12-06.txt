 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, once again, we are seeing President Biden put Green New  Deal priorities ahead of Pennsylvania families. By proposing to  eliminate gas-powered cars from our roads, the Biden administration is  attempting to fundamentally change how Americans drive.   The proposed rule from the EPA assumes that battery electric vehicles  will make up 60 percent of new cars in 2030 and almost two-thirds by  2032. The basic facts show us that this assumption is simply wrong and  that attempting to ban the sale of internal combustion engine cars,  internal combustion engine trucks, and internal combustion engine SUVs  that families in Pennsylvania rely on is dangerous.   This legislation is a vital part of stopping the Biden  administration's far-left, Green New Deal agenda from being  implemented.   In tandem with my legislation, the Preserving Choice in Vehicle  Purchases Act, the CARS Act would help to ensure that the Clean Air  Act, which is a 51-year-old piece of legislation, is not manipulated to  ban the sale of gas-powered vehicles.   In the Energy and Commerce Committee, we have heard testimony from  experts across the political spectrum, including members of the Biden  administration, who say that transitioning to EVs would be costly and  ineffective. Just this month, we heard from more than 4,000 car  dealers, including 70 from Pennsylvania, who say that transitioning to  battery vehicles would be a disaster for drivers across our country.   More than 95 percent of Americans use gas-powered vehicles. Demanding  that they transition to battery electric vehicles in the next decade  would be disastrous for our economy, unsustainable for our electric  grid, and devastating to American families.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation  and put a stop to President Biden's reckless use of agency rulemaking.
