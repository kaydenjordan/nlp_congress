 Madam Speaker, I very much appreciate the time tonight  to honor one of Georgia's favorite sons.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms.  Schakowsky).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois  (Mr. Schneider).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Brady), the former chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, the  committee on which John Lewis did so much of his important work for the  great State of Georgia.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan  (Mr. Levin).    Madam Speaker, at this time, I yield to the gentleman  from Tennessee (Mr. Cooper).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Oregon  (Ms. Bonamici).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Barragan).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Washington  State (Mr. Heck).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Oklahoma  (Ms. Kendra S. Horn).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), a cardinal on the Appropriations Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton).    Madam Speaker, I would inquire how much time remains.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean).    Madam Speaker, I didn't have the 52-year relationship  with Mr. Lewis that Sanford Bishop talked about earlier. I wasn't even  born when that relationship started. This very powerful and imposing  face beside me, I have very little association with.   If Mike Collins goes back and looks in the files, I believe he will  find that they turned down a young man named Rob Woodall for a job back  in 1994. It wasn't that I didn't try to get a good mentorship from John  Lewis, I just didn't meet the John Lewis bar at that time.   But my experience with him has been Biblically based, as so many  have. But mine has been: Let the children come to me. Do not hinder  them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God.   If I could arrange it, I would walk down the steps behind John as he  was going down the Capitol steps after a vote, because children from  all over the country would come running up, ``Mr. Lewis, Mr. Lewis,''  just wanting to say hello.   Whether it was the steps of the Capitol, the busiest airport in the  world at Hartsfield International, or anywhere in between, I never once  saw John in too much of a hurry with too much on his mind to take the  time to make sure the next generation understood what happened in the  last generation and the difference they could make for yet another  generation.   The story has already been told that staff members would say the only  thing they want to do on Capitol Hill is meet Mr. Lewis before they  leave.   Time and time again, that is the story of any Georgia Member because,  growing up, Mr. Lewis was Mr. Lewis. He always says, ``Call me John,''  but he is always Mr. Lewis and always will be.   So much of the story that we have heard told about John tonight,  Madam Speaker, has been about John the fighter. It is so meaningful to  me that the other half of the stories we have heard tonight are about  John the embracer.   We have plenty of fighters in this institution, and we have our fair  share of embracers in this institution. We don't have as many folks who  are every bit as good at embracing as they are at fighting.   We will miss John's leadership in that respect in the great State of  Georgia, Madam Speaker, and we will miss him here in this institution.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues for coming out tonight, I know,  to honor their friend and their colleague, but certainly to honor our  great son from Georgia.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
