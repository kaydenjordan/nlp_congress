 Mr. Speaker, I rise on this day, the first  day of Black History Month, unfortunately during a moment of  unprecedented assaults on truth by those desperate to rewrite America's  history.   In this troubling time of banned books and canceled curriculums, it  is with great urgency that I stand before you, Mr. Speaker, to  celebrate the profound history of our Nation that far too many far- right zealots are fighting to conceal.   This is a special month, defined in equal parts triumph and tragedy,  and centered in pride and appreciation because our African-American  forebears rose above oppression and helped create the greatest nation  the modern world has ever seen.   Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, only the ashamed and the afraid hide  from history. Black Americans never have and never will, for ours is a  story of victory over adversity, determination in the face of  uncertainty, and the courage of our convictions.   Our story is America's story. Let us never forget, let us never  concede, and let us never be silent when we say that Black history is  American history.                            ____________________
