 Mr. Speaker, this week, Republicans are continuing to work  behind closed doors to put finishing touches on their disastrous tax  bill that will hurt countless families in Nevada and across this  country.   Let's be clear: This monstrosity of a bill would eventually slam many  of Nevada's hardworking families with a tax increase, while adding more  than $1 trillion to our national debt. To make matters worse, the  Senate version of this bill would spike healthcare premiums and cause  millions to lose their healthcare coverage. Also, billionaires and  giant corporations can receive an unnecessary tax cut.   Mr. Speaker, Americans can clearly see that this is a bill that is  just a giveaway to wealthy campaign donors and giant corporations at  the expense of hardworking families. We need a Tax Code that is focused  on putting money back in the pockets of all families, not one that  creates even worse wealth and income inequality--and certainly not one  that puts profits before people.                            ____________________
