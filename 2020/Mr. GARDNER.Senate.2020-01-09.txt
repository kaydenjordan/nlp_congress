 Madam President, I come to the floor to speak about the  policy of the United States toward the Islamic Republic of Iran. I  commend the administration for taking decisive action last week in  Baghdad against Tehran-backed terrorists planning an imminent attack on  American targets.   The administration's action with Qasem Soleimani was not only  decisive but necessary and legal under longstanding Presidential  authority to protect American lives from imminent attack. It is our  obligation, it is our duty to protect American lives, especially when  our national security agencies and personnel know the imminent danger  of attack.   The President made the right call at the right time to neutralize the  threat  [[Page S111]]  and to save American lives. Imagine having done nothing--having done  nothing--and allowing the attacks to proceed. That is exactly what  happened. At yesterday's classified briefing, General Milley and our  national security personnel made it clear: The death of General  Soleimani saved lives.   Our duty in Congress is to protect the United States, its people and  interests, diplomats, and our men and women in uniform around the  globe. The actions taken by our military in Iraq undoubtedly saved  American lives and addressed a clear, compelling, and unambiguous  threat.   The world should not mourn Qasem Soleimani--a man whose name is  synonymous with murder in the Middle East as the head of the Islamic  Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force, which is designated as a  terrorist organization under U.S. law; a man who was personally  designated as a terrorist battlefield commander by President Obama. The  Quds Force was the tip of the spear for the regime in its terrorist  activities abroad and is responsible for thousands of deaths across the  region.   Most importantly, according to the Pentagon, Soleimani was  responsible for the deaths of over 600 American servicemembers in Iraq.  GEN David Petraeus, who commanded our forces in Iraq, stated last week  that in his opinion, taking out Soleimani was bigger than bin Laden,  bigger than Baghdadi.   In other words, President Trump rid the world of an extreme and  lethal enemy of the American people--someone who was actively pursuing  and had killed and taken American lives. I fail to understand how  anyone can question this decision or its rationale. I know they  certainly did not--and rightfully so--when President Obama took out bin  Laden.   We expected an Iranian response, and on Tuesday, Iran launched a  ballistic missile attack against bases in Iraq hosting U.S. troops. I  condemn these attacks in the strongest terms, and we are fortunate that  they did not result in any casualties.   I do not want war with Iran, but the President did not take this  action in a vacuum. Contrary to claims by some of my colleagues in this  very Chamber, it is Iran that has escalated tensions, not the United  States. Over the last several months and years, Iran has sharply  escalated its malign behavior against the United States and our allies.   On June 13, the IRGC attacked two oil tankers in the Strait of  Hormuz, a critical global shipping lane. On June 20, the IRGC shot down  a U.S. unmanned aerial vehicle in international space. September 14,  Iran sponsored an attack on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities, temporarily  cutting off half of the oil supply of the world's largest producer.  December 27, Iranian proxy group Kataib Hezbollah carried out a deadly  attack against a base in northern Iraq, killing an American civilian-- killing an American. The administration appropriately retaliated  against this group on December 29. Then, on New Year's Eve, Iran-backed  militias besieged and damaged the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad for 2 days,  forcing the administration to take prudent measures to prevent further  violence.   When Soleimani was caught plotting additional attacks against  American targets, the administration took lawful and appropriate  action. I now urge Tehran to take the opportunity to deescalate  tensions immediately. The administration must also continue taking all  necessary steps to keep our troops, diplomats, and countries safe, and  to regularly consult with Congress on next steps.   It is my hope that diplomacy ultimately prevails, but we must not  repeat the mistakes of the past. Iran's enmity toward the United States  stretches over decades, not just months or weeks. Following the Islamic  Revolution in Iran in 1979, the ruling mullahs held 52 American  diplomats hostage for 444 days, releasing them only on January 20,  1981, the day President Ronald Reagan was sworn into office. Two years  later, on April 18, 1983, a truck laden with explosives rammed into the  U.S. Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, killing 17 Americans. On October 23,  1983, a similar attack on the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut killed 241  American servicemen. Overwhelmingly, the evidence led to Iran and its  wholly owned subsidiary, Hezbollah, as the perpetrator of these  attacks.   The Iranian regime has not changed in 40 years. It targeted and  killed Americans during the Iraq war, supported Shiite militias, and  supplied deadly explosives used to target our troops. Iran continues to  prop up the regime of the murderous Bashar al-Assad in Syria. The  Iranian regime regularly refers to the United States as the Great Satan  and threatens our ally, Israel, which they call Little Satan--threatens  to wipe them off the face of the Earth. The mullahs continue to grossly  abuse the human rights of their own people, as demonstrated by recent  bloody crackdowns on protesters in Iran that have claimed hundreds and  hundreds of innocent lives.   Despite all of this, in 2015, the Obama administration rewarded  Tehran with a sweetheart deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of  Action, or JCPOA, which paved a patient pathway to a nuclear weapon for  Iran, lifted all meaningful sanctions against the regime, and did  nothing to constrain Iran's malign behavior in the region. Iran used  the billions of dollars that were provided in the JCPOA to dramatically  increase its terror funding and its military funding.   The Trump administration rightly exited the JCPOA in May 2018 and  reimposed crippling economic sanctions against the regime. They have  been clear with Iran that the door to diplomacy remains open if Iran  changes its behavior and complies with international norms.   On May 21, 2018, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo delivered a speech at  the Heritage Foundation, which clearly stated the administration's  objectives: Iran must forgo its nuclear aspirations, cease its support  for terrorism, and respect the human rights of its people. Secretary  Pompeo said:         Any new agreement will make sure Iran never acquires a       nuclear weapon, and will deter the regime's malign behavior       in a way the JCPOA never could.        We will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations,       and we will not renegotiate the JCPOA itself. The Iranian       wave of destruction in the region in just the last few years       is proof that Iran's nuclear aspirations cannot be separated       from the overall security picture.    Secretary Pompeo was clear that once Iran changes its behavior, it  will reap the benefits, stating:         [The United States is] prepared to end the principal       components of every one of our sanctions against the regime.       We're happy at that point to re-establish full diplomatic and       commercial relationships with Iran.        And we're prepared to admit Iran to have advanced       technology. If Iran makes this fundamental strategic shift,       we, too, are prepared to support the modernization and       reintegration of the Iranian economy into the international       economic system.    I hope the latest events have made it clear to Tehran that the United  States will never back down from protecting our people, our interests,  and our allies. Now the ball is in Tehran's court to choose the path of  peace or the path of confrontation. It is my sincere hope that they  choose the path of peace.   I yield the floor.
