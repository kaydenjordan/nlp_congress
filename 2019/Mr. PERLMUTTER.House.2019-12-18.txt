 Madam Speaker, the President should be impeached. His  actions were an abuse of power that jeopardizes America's national  security and compromises our elections. No one is above the law, and  that includes the President. By withholding $400 million Ukraine  desperately needed to defend itself against Russia until Ukraine did  the President's political bidding, the President committed High Crimes  and Misdemeanors for which he should be impeached under Article I,  Section 2, Clause 5 and Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution.   This abuse of power is compounded by the President's refusal to  cooperate with Congress' impeachment investigation and his stonewalling  of witnesses from testifying or turning over documents to Congress.   Almost 14,000 people have been killed since Russia invaded Ukraine.  Withholding $400 million Congress appropriated to help Ukraine defend  herself unless Ukraine helped the President dig up dirt on his  political rival Joe Biden was the last straw for me. People's lives and  our national security were placed at risk. This was more than paying  hush money for strippers, profiting from foreign governments staying at  resort properties, or even obstructing justice as laid out in the  Mueller Report.   The Founders fought and died for freedom and independence from a  tyrannical ruler and foreign government. Impeachment and removal from  office was the remedy they included in the Constitution to act as a  check on a President who placed himself above the law, abused his power  for his own personal benefit, and invited foreign governments to get  involved in our domestic affairs, especially our elections. A President  who flaunts the separation of powers and checks and balances in our  Constitution and who refuses to allow witnesses to appear before  Congress would receive our Founders' universal condemnation.   Treating taxpayer money as his own to extort a ``favor'' from a  foreign government to aid him in his re-election goes to the very heart  of concerns raised by our Nation's Founders when they drafted and  advocated for impeachment to act as a check on the awesome powers of  the chief executive. For instance, Madison said in Federalist No. 47,  ``the accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive and judiciary,  in the same hands . . . may justly be pronounced the very definition of  tyranny.'' He went on to say during the Constitutional Convention,  ``the Executive will have great opportunities of abusing his power,''  and further that a President ``might betray his trust to foreign  powers.'' George Washington's Farewell Address warned of ``foreign  influence and corruption'' which leads to the ``policy and will'' of  America being ``subjected to the policy and will of another.''  Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist No. 65 that impeachment  ``proceeds from the misconduct of public men . . . from the abuse or  violation of a public trust.''   The USA Today editorial board stated it perfectly when they wrote in  their December 12, 2019 editorial:         In his thuggish effort to trade American arms for foreign       dirt on former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter,       Trump resembles not so much Clinton as he does Richard Nixon,       another corrupt president who tried to cheat his way to re-      election . . . This isn't party politics as usual. It is       precisely the misconduct the Framers had in mind when they       wrote impeachment into the Constitution.    Impeachment is the remedy the Founders placed in the Constitution to  remove a President during his or her term of office. This is especially  true when the misconduct involves an upcoming election. The President  invited foreign participation in our elections at least three times.  First with, ``Russia, if you're listening . . .,'' second with his  demands on Ukraine to ``do us a favor, though,'' and third with his  request for China to get involved in the 2020 election by starting ``an  investigation into the Bidens.'' Any further delay or simply allowing  the election cycle to run its course results in the harm and abuse  impeachment was designed to prevent.   For the sake of the Constitution, fair elections free of foreign  interference, and our national security, President Trump should be  impeached.
