 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak on a crisis that  affects communities across our Nation. That crisis is that of missing  and murdered indigenous women.   Native American and Alaska Native women throughout the country face a  murder rate 10 times that of the national average, with 84 percent  experiencing some kind of violence in their lifetime.   In my home State of Washington, Native Americans make up about 2  percent of the population, but a recent report by the Washington State  Patrol shows that indigenous women account for 7 percent of the State's  reported missing women.   My congressional district in Central Washington sits at the epicenter  of this crisis. In the past 5 years alone, seven women have been  murdered or have gone missing on or near the Yakama Nation reservation.   These women are not just statistics in a database. They are mothers,  daughters, sisters, neighbors, and friends. There are those who are  missing, like 25-year-old Alillia Minthorn, or Lala as her friends  called her, who was last seen in Toppenish and has been missing since  May 5; 31-year-old Rosenda Strong, who was last seen in Wapato on  October 2 of last year;  34-year-old Freda Gun, who went missing in Kennewick in 2016; and 18- year-old Rosalita Longee, who was last seen in Wapato in 2015.   Then there are the unsolved murders, including 23-year-old Linda  Dave, whose remains were found in Toppenish in February of 2017; 31- year-old Minnie Andy, who was assaulted by an unknown assailant in  Wapato, and later died of her injuries in July of 2017; and 23-year-old  Destiny Lloyd, who was reported missing on Christmas Day 2017, only to  be found days later, murdered, on the side of the road.   To reiterate, Madam Speaker, these are just seven cases from the last  5 years. There are currently 71 open cases like this in Washington  State; 31 of them occurring on or near the Yakama Nation reservation.   The local community has been working to tackle this crisis. Tribal  and community leaders have held multiple rallies and community forums  to raise awareness and demand action.   The diligent reporting of the Yakima Herald-Republic has highlighted  the community response and activism on the ground, creating an online  hub to list open cases involving missing and murdered Yakama Nation  women and providing resources for the community to report  disappearances.   Recently passed State laws, spearheaded by State Representative Gina  Mosbrucker in Olympia, have enhanced data collection and improved  communication between Tribal leaders and various State agencies.   I absolutely applaud these efforts, and I am inspired by the progress  being made at the local and State level; however, this is a national  problem that requires a national response. That is why I, along with my  colleagues, Representatives Torres and Haaland, introduced Savanna's  Act.   Our legislation aims to address and bring awareness to the crisis of  missing and murdered indigenous women at the Federal level by improving  coordination between Federal, State, local, and Tribal law enforcement  agencies. The bill would develop guidelines and best practices for  Tribes and law enforcement agencies across the country to enhance the  reporting and recordkeeping of crimes against indigenous women and  improve communication between law enforcement and families of victims.   Now, this bill may sound familiar. Last Congress, the Senate  unanimously passed a version of Savanna's Act that stalled in the  House. Representatives Torres, Haaland, and I worked with Tribes,  advocacy groups, law enforcement, and Senators Murkowski and Cortez  Masto to improve the legislation and introduce a bill that can--and  should--be signed into law.   The bill is named in honor of Savanna LaFontaine-Greywind, a 22-year- old member of the Spirit Lake Tribe, pregnant with her first child, who  was murdered in August of 2017. Her murder  [[Page H4922]]  brought long-overdue national attention to missing and murdered  indigenous women.   After meeting with local families of victims, State and local law  enforcement, and regional Tribes, it has become clear to me that  central Washington has a unique perspective on this crisis.   The stories about these women are heartbreaking. It is with these  stories and mine that I have urged both House Judiciary and Natural  Resources Committees to hold a field hearing on the Yakama Nation  reservation to learn firsthand how this crisis is plaguing our  communities.   I am pleased to have gained the support of local Tribes and the YWCA  in Yakima in calling for a field hearing, and I am eager to have  committee members hear their stories as well.   Thankfully, justice was served upon Savanna's murderers. We owe the  same justice for the many murdered, missing, indigenous women.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak on my bipartisan  amendment to prevent any funding in this Interior appropriations bill  from being used to close or transfer the operation of U.S. Forest  Service Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers.   Fortunately, Mr. Chairman, after overwhelming concern expressed by a  broad coalition of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and on both  sides of the Capitol, I am pleased to report that the Secretary of  Agriculture, Sonny Perdue, has listened to our concerns and informed us  that the proposal to end the CCC program will be withdrawn.   Over the past several weeks, I have helped lead this coalition to  tell the important story of our Civilian Conservation Centers and the  value they provide in supporting rural communities and maintaining our  public lands, actively managing our Nation's forests, and helping  restore communities harmed by catastrophic wildfires.   I would like to thank Secretary Perdue for listening to the concerns  of central Washington communities and for preserving the unique and  important role these centers play in rural communities.   I look forward to working in partnership with the CCCs; the U.S.  Forest Service; and our many local, regional, and Federal partners in  strengthening  [[Page H4968]]  these programs so they can continue to efficiently and effectively  support the U.S. Forest Service motto of: Caring for the Land and  Serving People.   Mr. Chairman, I intend to withdraw my amendment, but I will continue  to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank my good friend and colleague from  Maine, Ms. Pingree, as well as my good friend and colleague from  Oregon, Mr. Schrader, for their comments.   In the weeks since this proposal had been announced to close the  Forest Service Job Corps CCCs, I know my colleagues have, and I also  have, received dozens of personal accounts and testimonials from men  and women across my district whose lives were profoundly impacted for  the better by the CCC program. I will quote a couple of those comments,  Mr. Chair.   The first one: ``Job Corps saved my life.''   ``The 10 months I spent at Fort Simcoe were the most beneficial  months of my life.''   Another person said of the program: The CCC ``didn't just change my  life but saved my life.''   ``I am so grateful for Columbia Basin Job Corps Civilian Conservation  Center. . . . If they hadn't accepted me, I would be in a different,  much worse phase of my life.''   Mr. Chair, I would, again, like to thank the Secretary of  Agriculture, Mr. Perdue, for hearing the strong support expressed by my  colleagues and myself on behalf of the U.S. Forest Service Job Corps  CCC program.   Mr. Chair, I respectfully withdraw the amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
