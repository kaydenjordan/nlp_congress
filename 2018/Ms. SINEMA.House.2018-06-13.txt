 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2147, the  Veterans Treatment Court Improvement Act of 2018.   Madam Speaker, it is our responsibility as Americans to help our  bravest men and women heal from both the physical and mental wounds of  war.   Veteran treatment courts are important, effective tools to help heal  the invisible injuries many of our veterans sustained defending our  country.   Retired Brigadier General Gregg Maxon, an Arizona veterans court  advocate, told me these courts and their employees ``make all the  difference in how these veterans engage in their treatment programs.''   We worked across the aisle on this bill to ensure that lifesaving  courts have the resources to serve any Arizona veteran who needs  support.   Madam Speaker, too many Arizona families continue to struggle with  addiction. In the past year alone, more than 8,000 Arizonans overdosed  on opioids. Over 1,200 of those lives couldn't be saved.   Leaders in Congress have attempted to cut programs like Medicaid,  known as AHCCCS in Arizona, which ensures treatment and recovery  services for many hardworking Arizonans struggling with addiction. But  instead of attacking this program that works for everyday people across  our State, we should reach across the aisle and work together to find  solutions that help families get ahead and build better lives.   This week, we are working across the aisle and I am proud to see our  progress. We are passing bills to help reduce foreign shipments of  illegal synthetic opioids from places like China that enter our country  through the mail system; passing bills to provide additional targeted  services for individuals and families struggling with addiction; and  passing bills to give law enforcement additional tools to keep  synthetic drugs off the streets and out of our communities.   More work remains, and I look forward to working across the aisle to  deliver results for everyday Arizonans.
