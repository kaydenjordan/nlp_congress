 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the rule and  to the underlying bill. But as my colleague from Massachusetts said,  this isn't really a bill. It is a press release. It is a love note to  the fossil fuel industry.   We should have an open rule on the floor for this resolution so that  we can talk about the real issues around climate change, so that we can  talk about the effects of a changing growing season and the effects of  extreme weather on our farms and fishing communities, so that we can  talk about sea level rise and ocean acidification on our coastal  communities, so that we can talk about the impacts of changing climates  on health and healthcare costs.   We are seeing these problems in my home State and in the Gulf of  Maine, in particular, where the water is warming at a rate 90 percent  faster than the rest of the world. We don't know what impact that will  have on the lobsters, groundfish, and future fisheries, but the  fishermen are worried, and we are already starting to see the changes.   We are putting our heads in the sand if we just do nothing, if we  keep supporting fossil fuels, and if we keep preventing even a simple  debate on the costs of carbon and possible climate solutions.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the rule and oppose this  bill.
