 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Ranking Member Waters for her  tireless leadership for a strong, affordable National Flood Insurance  Program.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this bill. More than 5  million middle class and working Americans rely on the National Flood  Insurance Program for economic security and peace of mind.   Congress cannot allow this program to expire. A lapse would leave  countless families unable to renew their policies, putting them in  financial peril if disaster were to strike. It would also upend the  housing market, with closings coming to a full stop due to the  inability to secure required coverage.   While I wish this bill included a much longer term extension,  providing American families with another week of coverage is far  preferable to a damaging lapse.   But, my colleagues, we must do better than 1 week. The people have  endured seven stopgap extensions, including two brief lapses, since  September 2017--7 extensions, 14 months. The bill before us is number  eight.   While almost everyone can agree that flood insurance is long overdue  for reform, particularly to address the affordability challenges that  plague policyholders, we should not allow that goal to threaten the  program's very existence.   I urge my colleagues to not only support today's bill but to work  together in the coming days to reach agreement on a longer term  extension.
