 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma.   Madam Speaker, I rise to say that we had this great speech by the  leader of the Democrat Party about debates and about what we should do  in debating on this floor. When will we debate? That is the question.  When will we actually debate?   The leader made good points about previous rules, about closed  debate. We haven't had an open debate on an amendment on this floor  since May 2016, where I can come down as a Republican Member or as a  Democratic Member and offer an amendment.   We have no debates on amendments anymore, Mr. Leader. You know this  is true. You have been here. You have seen the change in this body. And  I would just suggest--that I address my remarks to the Chair--I would  just suggest that we should have debate. That is what we are here to  do.   Madam Speaker, I reject this rules package. I have problems with it  for the reasons my colleagues already articulated, but I think we  should engage in colloquy. Let's actually have a debate about setting  up rules so this body is filled with Members offering amendments and  doing what the people want us to do. This rules package, respectfully,  does not do that.                                time  1400
