 Madam Speaker, this morning, a resident of the State  of Florida was interviewed, and he said that with Ian, his whole house  was gone. Everything in his house was gone.   The people of South Carolina are facing Ian now. The people of the  areas of Alaska and the people in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico have  all faced an enormous surge and impact of hurricanes--lives lost,  people still being rescued.   That is why the leadership of this Congress and the Members will join  together, I hope in a unified manner, to recognize what our job is. Our  job is to be the umbrella on a rainy day.   In this, those who will suffer in the coldness of the winter, I am  reminded of the freeze in Texas. Of course, we had no electricity, but  thank God for $1 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance  Program. Some people are saying how grateful they are. Helping FEMA to  be able to be on the ground, $2 billion for helping people recover  their housing and infrastructure. They are obliterated in Florida, 1  million people without lights. Of course, we know about Jackson,  Mississippi, and Flint, Michigan, $20 million for water and wastewater  and other crises that we have had.   I want this Congress to stand up for not shutting the government down  but taking its rightful responsibility and dealing with the crises of  America.   We have done it with the Inflation Reduction Act. We want to take  people over politics. We want to make sure that we have jobs, good  healthcare, low cost. We want to do something.   My friend on the Committee on the Judiciary, I am always eager to  work with you. We all are facing the crises that come about after the  pandemic.    But thank God we have legislation that deals with safer communities  and restricting gun trafficking. We have one that provides us with the  opportunity for those cases that have been backlogged.   We have done the work as Democrats. We ask you to join us in this  effort. The CR must pass. Ukraine is fighting for democracy. We are  helping them. We must make a difference by keeping the government open.   Madam Speaker, I ask for support for the underlying rule.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her  leadership.    I am very glad to say that there is something that responsibility  calls you to do: save lives. This CR indicates that we will not shut  the government down in the face of disasters around the world. We will  not freeze out low-income families by not providing them with the home  energy assistance program. And, yes, we will ensure that agencies like  housing and health and public safety, to reduce the crime across  America, to respond to the needs of our police officers and victims of  crime, will not shut down.   But, yes, we will also recognize that we are good neighbors. In  Pakistan, 33 million people have been dislocated because of  catastrophic floods of Biblical proportions. Mothers are about to  deliver babies, 70,000 of them, and we can help them as USAID goes and  does its work internationally.   I am glad that we are putting a stop sign on closing the government  down. I wish our friends on the other side would join us.   Finally, I want us to give more money to the hostage section of the  Department of State because people like Brittney Griner are in cages in  Russia, and we have to get our hostages out. Americans are looking for  America to stand by their side.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman very much and  again applaud her persistence in helping the American people.   As I finish, on the issue of Brittney Griner, introducing this to  many of our colleagues that don't know, she is a hostage in Putin's  Russia. Playing basketball there was her only crime, if you will. There  she is, in a cage in Russia, a hostage since February.   We have a department that works on this issue inside the Department  of State. I want to implore them and make sure they have the resources  for the many Americans who are innocently held by countries around the  world. It is a tragedy and a shame that we have a circumstance where  Americans cannot travel. I am grateful for that support.   I am also grateful to acknowledge, if you will, the Disaster Relief  Fund for our domestic crises. As I said earlier, a man was interviewed  in Florida and said: I have lost everything, my house and everything in  it.   There are a million people with no access to power, so this is a  crucial and important CR. Puerto Rico is in need. It is a crucial and  important CR. We always stand to hand out to our friends around the  Nation and around the world. That is the United States of America. That  is why we are passing the CR.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Senate amendment to H.R. 6833:  the Continuing Resolution to fund the federal government through  December 16, 2022.   I commend our colleagues in the Senate and the House for crafting  this bipartisan, bicameral agreement that keeps the federal government  fully operational without any interruption.   The agreement that led to this Continuing Resolution reflects our  commitment to the policies on which Americans rely.   It reassures the American people that our government will continue to  deliver all services while negotiations continue on funding federal  agencies, programs, activities, and services for the remainder of  Fiscal Year 2023.   Passing this continuing resolution might appear to be a basic  ministerial act; but it is actually much more than that and highly  consequential.   Throughout my 27 years of service in Congress, I have never lost  sight of my principal responsibilities to my constituents and to the  American people.   Paramount among them are two priorities: to do everything we can to  keep our country and our people safe, and to provide the vitally  necessary services and activities that preserve and enhance quality-of- life standards for all Americans.   Keeping our country safe includes protecting Americans from:   domestic terrorism and violent extremism,   public health pandemics,   aggression from adversarial countries and non-country actors,   environmental hazards to our air and water,   food and drug contamination,   racially based hate crimes, and   gun violence, which we advanced this summer by enacting the  Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.   Maintaining vital services includes providing:   health care and public health programs,   food stamps and SNAP funding,   clean air and water standards,   weather forecasting to enable resilience against natural disasters  and FEMA funding to help rebuild lives and communities after they  strike,   child nutrition and immunizations,   education programs and funding,   economic and business support programs that help create jobs and  entrepreneurial opportunities,   workplace safety protections and safeguards for employee rights,   prosecution of crimes and protections of civil rights,   housing assistance and homelessness prevention assistance,   broadband and other communication services,   medical research and healthcare innovation,   American leadership in the world community, and   myriad other services and programs that are synonymous with service  to all Americans, especially those who are most in need of a helping  hand to uplift themselves and thrive.   Both of these goals--keeping Americans safe and providing vital  services--require that the federal government and all of its programs  remain fully operational at all times without any interruption,  especially a disruption due to political discord.  [[Page H8350]]    It is incumbent upon Congress to pass appropriations bills that  enable the federal government to fulfill its diverse mandates.   With 535 members of the House and Senate, is essential that we  negotiate, compromise, and reach agreements to ensure that the  government will deliver for the American people on all activities that  we are entrusted to perform.   Failure is not an option because the consequences on peoples' lives  and livelihoods would be far too great to bear.   Failure would debilitate our economy, eliminate jobs, and devastate  family finances.   Failure would mean that:   the health of Americans would suffer,   more people would become homeless,   production of food would be limited and its safety put at risk,   public safety would be impaired,   rebuilding from natural disasters would grind to a halt,   veterans and Social Security recipients would not receive their  checks, and   the global stature of the United States would be diminished, among  many other unacceptable outcomes.   These are just some of the reasons why I support passage of this  Continuing Resolution.   It is imperative that we keep the federal government open and fully  functional over the next few months as we continue to craft  appropriations legislation that will fuel the federal government for  the remainder of this fiscal year.   During this time, we will be able to craft language to improve  government operations, address urgent needs, and accelerate forward- looking initiatives that will strengthen our country, ensure equity,  and enhance opportunity for all Americans.   Yet, some needs are already well recognized. That is why I am  particularly pleased that this bill not only continues funding for  government programs and services at their current rate, but also  includes funding for critically necessary activities, and extends  programs that would have expired.   Some of the many provisions in the bill that would achieve these aims  and which I fully support are the:   $1 billion in aid to Jackson Mississippi to help them resolve their  water crisis,   $1 billion in Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program support to  help low income families afford heat during the upcoming cold weather  months,   funding for victims of natural disasters that is needed to help them  restore their homes and rebuild their lives,   maintenance of social security customer service systems,   $2 billion for the Community Development Block Grant Disaster  Recovery program,   extension of child and family services programs,   extension of veterans' health care and housing supports,   fortification of cybersecurity by funding the newly created Office of  the National Cyber Director,   enhancement of the Judiciary's court security program,   extension of the national flood insurance program,   funding of the FDA to continue its activities, and   $12.35 billion in aid to Ukraine that will enable them to combat  Russia's hegemony.   Mr. Speaker, this continuing resolution is crucial for the sustenance  and resilience of the American people.   I urge all my colleagues to support the Continuing Resolution so that  we can keep the government operating while we negotiate a comprehensive  bill to maintain programs, services, and activities through the  remainder of this fiscal year.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York  (Mr. Nadler) for work that is long overdue, and the Senators in the  other body, as well.   I lived through 9/11, as many of us who have served in this Congress  did. I lived through the terror, the horror, the horrific scenes that  were unspeakable and unbelievable. I lived through them with the same  sense of this could not be America.    I was in this building as the planes hit the Pentagon. We did not get  the direct information about the World Trade Center, but as we were  screamed at to get out and flee, as we ran without knowledge, I could  see the billowing smoke, as the plane had already hit the Pentagon.   Never in our lives since World War II and Pearl Harbor had I seen or  heard about, if you will, such atrocities and  [[Page H8352]]  violence. Imagine those families, never being able to bury their loved  ones.   I went to Ground Zero by train because at that time planes were not  in the air. I was insistent, as a member of the beginning of the  Homeland Security Committee, to go there with a former Senator. We went  to the very site.   No, there was no rescuing at that time; it was recovering.   We saw those fire department personnel, firemen, and law enforcement  guarding this sacred place. Those firepersons would get a whistle blown  when someone who had been digging found the remnants of a body, pieces  of bones, and because they wanted to honor those families, they would  blow the whistle and a gurney would come, and they would put what they  found on the gurney.   That is what this bill is all about. It is to be able to say that  families have suffered unconscionably, and that due to their own  government withholding payments due to them and only incrementally  dribbling them out in small amounts over the years, the families have  faced financial hardship.    Mr. Speaker, this would provide financial relief for  the families of those murdered by the terrorists by helping to put more  dollars in this victims' fund, more so than the Victim Compensation  Fund, to provide them with catch-up payments that they did not get.  That is important to do.   Mr. Speaker, might I say that I visited with the Uvalde families this  past Monday. Their pain is deep, and it is the same. They don't have a  handle on these compensation funds. They are suffering. And as this has  evidenced, that you must always ease the suffering of those who you  cannot replace their loved ones, I look forward to working with the  chairman on helping these Uvalde families in their suffering.   I support this legislation. I thank the chairman, and I urge my  colleagues to support H.R. 8987.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to wholeheartedly and enthusiastically support  H.R. 8987, the ``Fairness for 9/11 Families Act''.   I commend my colleague and friend, Chairman Jerry Nadler, for  introducing this bill and bringing it before the House today.   This legislation provides us the opportunity to ``do right'' for the  families who suffered directly from the heinous acts and carnage  perpetrated on our nation on September 11th, 2001.   H.R. 8987 would provide financial relief to the families of those  murdered by terrorists on September 11th by providing lump sum catch-up  payments to them of the funds to which they are entitled from the  United States Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund.   When the Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund was created, it  did not allow for payments to families who already received some  payments from the Victims Compensation Fund, even though they were  clearly within the scope of the new fund.   This error was corrected later, but the families still have not  received the catch-up payments to which they were entitled to provide  them the financial assistance that they would have received if the  initial error had not been made.   This legislation would provide them with lump-sum payments to  immediately correct that injustice.   Needless to say, these families have suffered enough, and it  unconscionable that they should be subjected to further suffering due  to their own government withholding payments due to them, and only  incrementally dribbling them out in small amounts over many years.   The families have faced financial hardship since that day, partly due  to the loss of their loved one's income, and just as directly, by the  inability to focus on employment while coping with their loss of a  loved one through that unspeakable national tragedy.   The events of September 11th were among the most horrifying,  frightening, and shocking that I have ever endured. That day, I was at  the Capitol and experienced the frantic panic of being rushed off of  the Capitol grounds when we feared that Flight 93 was aiming toward us.   And yet, my experience that day was incidental and transitory  compared to the life-altering devastation that was felt that day and  every day since then by the families of those who were killed in the  airplanes and in the buildings that were struck.   Any time a loved one is abruptly and unforeseeably killed by violence  or an accident, their surviving family members are devastated and  debilitated, with a lengthy adjustment period that sometimes is never  resolved.   In the case of the 9/11 victims and families, the aftermath of grief,  mourning, and incapacity was protracted and compounded.   This was initially due to the uniquely heinous and horrible  circumstances of 9/11, and thereafter due to the annual national  memorials and the ubiquitous reminders of the tragedy that is embedded  in the national consciousness.   These families are forever intertwined with the grief, sadness, and  despondency associated with those acts of warfare against the United  States. Thus, it is our responsibility, as the Congress of their United  States, to prioritize their needs, revitalization, and compensation  since, in effect, their loved ones were lost in an act of war by enemy  combatants.   Although we can never sufficiently compensate the families for the  loss of their loved ones, we must do all we can to support them and  help them reclaim their productive lives.   It is not too much to ask--indeed, it is the least we can do--to  ensure that the funds allocated to them be transmitted to them  immediately to ease their financial burdens and support their pursuit  of fulfilling lives.   The catch-up payments that were allocated to the families must be  distributed to them promptly in lump sum payments for the dual sakes of  fairness and solidarity with those whose sacrifice is enshrined in our  national fabric.    Mr. Speaker, as we begin to take our work recess and  engage with constituents, families, young people--in Texas sports are  sort of the heart of our State, we love our Friday night football--I  want us to think of a young woman who did everything right.   Brittney Griner, her father was a Vietnam vet, grew up in Houston,  Texas, went to high school in my district, was quiet but an outstanding  athlete. Athletes are holistic persons with many talents. She even did  better than that, graduating from Baylor University and becoming a two- time Olympian.   I guess the Russians realized how important a person she is. She is  now in a cage in Russia, as many of our hostages are in Iran and  Russia. Putin, I believe, thinks that this is his own special pawn, a  6-foot-9-inch young woman in a cage.   I ask my colleagues as they go home to their families to remember to  tweet out to bring Brittney Griner home and direct it to Putin to stop  the cruelty.   Bring Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan and all of our hostages home.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for giving me the  opportunity to be able to speak this afternoon from the heart.   Democrats have done great things. We have certainly appreciated the  Members of the other side of the aisle who have joined us on some of  those. Those things include passing a very effective CHIPS bill that I  hope to bring thousands of jobs to my congressional district through  the production and manufacturing, using precious metals, in particular,  coming from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.   We now have families who suffer from diabetes who, shockingly, for  the first time in their lives, can have insulin capped at $35. I am  glad to have been a part of that.   I seek, as I did before, that Medicaid recipients can also have their  insulin capped.   I am glad that working families, in this storm of inflation, can,  through the Biden administration and Congress, have subsidies for  healthcare and get cheaper healthcare.   I am glad that the flooding that is so intensive in places like  Houston, can, in fact, now have the bipartisan infrastructure bill; and  isolated communities without transportation or transit can, in fact,  now have the potential of billions of dollars coming to those rural and  urban centers, inner-city centers that need an infrastructure rebuild.   We need clean water, and Flint and Jackson, Mississippi, should not  be the norm in the United States of America; and lead in pipes that  helped destroy the cognitive genius of our children should not exist.   We have done great things. And as we go to work in our districts,  listen to our constituents even more than we do when we have a moment  over the weekends that we go home, we go home to hold in our hands the  destiny of democracy when we fight for re-election for the purpose of  ensuring the value of this Nation, as I look, In God We Trust.   We have done great things. Families of America should know that this  leadership, under Nancy Pelosi, and Steny Hoyer, and  Jim Clyburn, and  the chair, Mr. Jeffries, and the vice chair of the Democratic Caucus,  we should all know that there have been good things that were done.   So, when I go home, I have no hesitancy to be able to go and to  champion the lives we have saved; the veterans who will get answers to  their questions and their health conditions; the people who suffered  under the burn pit, now relief, they celebrated because of this  Congress, this Democratic Congress, with our friends who wanted to do  what is right.   We have given hope to those burn pit victims. They can't breathe, and  we have finally given relief.   This body has determined that the electoral count should be accurate,  with no false electors showing up, giving false representation that  they represent the States. No Vice President can do anything but  ministerial.   There will be no doubt that if you vote in a Presidential election  fairly and electors are selected to cast their vote for you--something,  of course, that I think is a figment of our past and should not be in  place, but let's make it perfect--you can now trust that the electors  will do right, as they did in 2020; and they provided the final vote  under the Vice Presidency of Mr. Pence that elected Joe Biden and  Kamala Harris.   We pray to God that we will never see January 6 again; never again;  never the violence and brutality, the bloodshed of our police officers,  the deaths that occurred, the innocent lives lost. We hope never again.   We have done some good things. There is such a litany of them, I  cannot list them all.  [[Page H8365]]    I am delighted to have passed the Stop Human Trafficking in School  Zones, the legislation that I authored; that we have fixed the Terry  fix, to ensure justice for those who were not able to come  appropriately under the reduction of sentencing dealing with crack and  cocaine.   I am glad to have been able to push the Victims of Crime Act to  ensure better handling of victims of crime.   At the same time, I believe that it is important to assure that the  American people know that we are, in fact, working hard for them. So  the many amendments to help HBCUs that I have offered; the many  important elements of the appropriations, including more dollars for  post-traumatic stress under the NDAA and some aspects of the  appropriations, as I do every year; the helping of those suffering from  triple negative breast cancer; and working to ensure that the lives of  our children are better by helping to create resources for safer  schools; work still unfinished to get our storage laws in place; to ban  assault weapons.    But we have done a great thing in passing legislation to break the  cycle of violence led by Mr. Horsford; and to utilize the tools that  have been given through this Congress, under the Democratic leadership,  to make lives better for all Americans.   We have done some good things. As we have done some good things,  there is more work to be done. I want to make sure that we see the  passage of the voting rights, so that oppression of voting can cease  and desist.   It is appalling that we go into this election, but we fought, as  Democrats, to make it happen. I am so sorry the noes came from the  other side of the aisle.   I thank my colleagues, 217-plus, who have, in fact, supported the  idea of a commission to study slavery and to look seriously and  thoroughly at the question of reparation proposals. I know that we will  work together going forward. It is the heart of America to cure both  racism and to heal and to bring people together. I have confidence. I  feel well about our opportunities.   I thank the Speaker that is in the chair, to have joined me in the  midst of the crisis of reproductive freedom being taken away, to  support medical personnel who, right now, under the laws of the Dobbs  case in America, are being arrested, could be, nurses, nurse  practitioners, doctors, who are simply trying to help a desperate woman  that has been raped, or a child that has been raped. I hope to pass  that Protecting the Medical Personnel of America bill.   I hope to pass the legislation that I introduced to stop the stalkers  who would get a bounty on women by watching what they do, calling up  and saying, I think she is getting an abortion. She is over at this  address; and receiving $10,000.   Can you believe it? The law of the land in the State of Texas.   We have done some good things and we are doing good things. But if  this Special Order is about one issue or item, this is what I want it  to be about. I want it to be about something that our psyche is just  not used to.   I don't know how many times we have thought of the tens upon tens of  Americans that are held hostage around the world. We learned a little  bit about MIAs, people missing in action, soldiers missing in action,  really, through the Vietnam War. I know they were missing in action in  World War II and other wars, but in this recent generation, we learned  about it because the late heroic John McCain would always remind us of  the MIAs.   I joined with my colleague, Ben Reyes, and put a flag out in front of  the City Hall in Houston, Texas, when I was a member of the City  Council; the first MIA flag, I believe, maybe, in city councils across  America.   I came here to the United States Congress, and outside my door is the  flag of MIAs. We understand that.   But do we understand about Americans who have done little, have been  plucked off the streets of places that are despotic, and joined the  thousands of their own citizens thrown in jail with no real justice  system?   So if I come to you today, I want the title of this Special Order to  focus us on where we need to go.                        The Plight of Brittney Griner     Mr. Speaker, when I mention Brittney Griner, I want  everybody to know I am thinking of Paul Whelan, and I am thinking of  the journalist in Iran, and hostages around the world, U.S. citizens.   Does anybody know that we work hard on this? When I say we, the  administration works hard on this every day. On the floor today, I  asked for more resources for the hostage finding team--I will just call  them that.   But I want to take a moment to just show you Brittney Griner's life.  She is a Houstonian; went to the schools, the public schools in the  area; went to Nimitz High School in my congressional district. I met  some of her classmates. Even the students there today want to do  something to show their care and outrage about where she is today.   Brittney Griner, no, she was not in the United States military. I  honor them. But she wore the uniform. She was an Olympian; brought a  gold medal home to the United States, I believe, two Olympics, back to  back. That is USA Number 42 and Number 15, numbers worn in the  Olympics.                                time  1500    That is Brittney Griner sharing some good news, a good dunk maybe,  with her teammates, and Brittney Griner, an Olympian, wearing that  good-looking Gold Medal. We like that because everybody watches the  Olympics.   What an unbelievable basketball player--that is a shot; I could only  dream about that shot--Brittney Griner, an American, African-American  young woman.   I know the Baylorites love the championships and the hard playing  that she did for them at Baylor University. That is Brittney Griner.  She had a life in front of her.   Because of the very poor compensation, of sorts, compared to the NBA,  many women WNBA players go off to foreign countries to play. She got  drafted by Phoenix and played stupendously, so many world records in  basketball as a professional.   Big heart, Brittney Griner, her teammates loved her.   I visited the Phoenix arena where her team plays. Of course, Brittney  Griner's locker was there waiting for her to come back.   This looks like an exciting time, some good-looking pictures of our  fellow American.   Paul Whelan, a marine, had some good days serving his country.   It is just an innocent civilian, who the infractions of what she is  charged with wind up suggesting and threatening and charging her as a  drug trafficker, a big-time drug trafficker--no sense but nonsense.   She could have been released and directed back to the United States.  But no, this is what Mr. Putin wanted to do. He felt, after the  Olympics of 2022, the Winter Olympics, where his teams were embarrassed  because of drugs, that he would show the United States.   Here she is. They put her in a cage, 6 feet 9 inches in a cage. The  beauty of her size was to recognize such a talented person playing the  sport, doing well, giving joy to the fans and getting Americans to  cheer her on during the Olympics.   This is what they wanted to show Americans: We got you now. In your  eye.   A young woman longs to be home, deserves to be home, with other  hostages who have been brutally treated.   President Biden has indicated, as Commander in Chief, that he wants  all the hostages home, and he is ready to speak to Mr. Putin if he  would only have a heart, if he would only recognize that there is no  justice in his injustice.   Ninety-nine percent of those who go to trial in Russia are convicted.  They are, in fact, held hostage. This is a direct result of Putin's  interest in saying to the United States, I guess: We got you.   Not respecting she has family, not respecting that she has done  nothing wrong.   Brittney is an extension of us in Houston. She represents the  quintessential American stories and qualities. She is suffering after  going through a trial, the process of appeal, doing everything,  offering doctors' statements as to why certain items were with her,  indicating a mistake, doing everything told by her lawyers. Nothing.  Denial of basic rights to Brittney Griner, because they are the  [[Page H8366]]  rights to which we believe all people are entitled, a trial by jury of  your peers and the right to be able to be proven innocent.   We do not accept the dehumanization that is commonplace in Russia,  and our values compel us to seek justice for Brittney's immediate  release and return to her family and friends.   She spoke eloquently by saying: I am sorry. It was a mistake.   It seems to have fallen on deaf ears. Can it be nothing more than an  attempt to humiliate her, her family, her loved ones, who cry out for  the potential of what may happen?   She cried out to the President of the United States: I fear that I  may be here for the rest of my life.   She is a young woman who gives away shoes and items to children  without.   Her basic rights--we as Americans cannot just go quietly. We have a  lot on our plate, but the only lifeline they have is the United States  of America.   As a mother who has watched my children grow up, proud to see them  excel, I can only imagine the gut-wrenching pain of her mother and  father and her wife, and how hopeless they feel. There is no worse  feeling than when someone in your family is in imminent danger and  beyond your reach to help.   As a Black woman, I can say there is no greater fear through the  history of our time, through slavery, through discrimination, through  unequal treatment that we face in a justice system, even here, to think  that there is nothing we can grab at to be able to give the defense,  the explanation.   I want Americans to think of the pain of losing their children to  something that is so foreign to us. They are alive, but they are held  hostage.   There is much pain in this country. I have seen it through gun  violence, so I don't speak to the pain of those mothers and fathers.  What I speak to is that we need to do something about it.   I have gone to the Russian consulate in Houston. I have gone to the  Russian Embassy. I have looked the Ambassador in the eye, at a huge,  gigantic complex, and I said: Send this message to Mr. Putin. Let  Brittney go. Let Paul Whelan go. Let the people of Russia, the good  people who are out fighting against this vile and vicious war against  Ukraine, let them go, too.   But I can't leave silently to go back to Houston without coming to  this floor and saying, since February, about 2 weeks after the  Olympics, she has been held.   She is not a soldier. She had nothing to do with any government  activities. The only reason I say that is because her training does not  lend her to these dastardly conditions, a cage, inhumane cage,  ultimately to go to a labor camp where Trevor Reed suffered and Paul  Whelan suffered.   She has been denied access to consular officials, and she was  dependent upon Russian lawyers who mean well but simply go into the  court and watch their client be convicted.   As they faked elections just the last couple of days, Brittney Griner  is suffering from Putin's demonstration of power and control that stems  from centuries of bigotry and hatred embodied in an autocratic leader  who is the very antithesis of everything Ms. Griner represents.    If you want to know why she is incarcerated and not released, it is  based upon her country of origin, something she cannot help.   Americans who are blessed to be born under this flag cannot help the  values upon which we stand. We cannot help our Pledge of Allegiance to  the flag of the United States of America. We cannot help our national  anthem that calls for victory, ``The Star-Spangled Banner.''   We cannot help that we are called by nations to defend them. We  cannot help that we have the freedom to travel and that we welcome  people to this country, Russian students, Russian players, even on the  space station. That is America.   But now we find the dastardly acts of stealing land, calling it an  election, fighting people who want to be free, Ukrainians. In the midst  of this turmoil is a young woman who graduated in my district from  Nimitz High School, a Baylor University graduate, a two-time Olympian,  and, of course, with all her friends in Phoenix, and just a basic human  being.   I hope I made it clear. There are two teams in Phoenix. She is with  the Phoenix Mercury, the WNBA team.   I couldn't leave this day without reminding America that if in God we  trust, give some hope to these people, lonely, all over the world,  shocked that they were snatched off the streets or snatched from an  airport, gave every explanation. They created no outrageous, vile,  terroristic act. They did nothing with guns, drugs of any amount. They  were no detriment to anybody in that land, and here they are.   My colleagues, Congressmen Stanton and Allred, supported H. Res.  1132, led by Congressman Stanton out of Phoenix, calling for the  immediate release of Brittney Griner.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article from Sports  Illustrated: ``Brittney Griner's Wife Has Troubling Update On How She's  Doing.''           [From the Spun, by Sports Illustrated, Sept. 17, 2022]       Brittney Griner's Wife Has Troubling Update On How She's Doing                            (By Andrew McCarty)         Earlier this week, President Joe Biden met with Cherelle       Griner, the wife of imprisoned WNBA star Brittney Griner.        Griner has been in a Russian prison since February, when       she was arrested for having cannabis oil in her bag at a       Russian airport. Ever since then, the United States has been       trying to get her home.        A meeting between Biden and Cherelle is a big step towards       that, but it also came with some troubling news. According to       Cherelle, Brittney's letters to her have taken an       increasingly dark tone.        Cherelle offered a larger statement following her meeting       with Biden.        ``I've felt every minute of the grueling seven months       without her,'' she said. ``I look forward to the day my wife       is back home. As my family and I continue on this journey,       I'd like to thank the broad coalition of friends, leaders and       supporters who continue to stand with us and advocate for       Brittney's swift and safe return. Let's share a unified       commitment to bringing all Americans home to their families       and loved ones. Together We Are BG.''        Hopefully the United States and Russia can work together to       bring Griner home in the near future.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record two articles  from CNN, one titled ``Biden set to meet with families of Brittney  Griner and Paul Whelan at the White House'' and an article written most  recently about Brittney Griner's conditions that she is facing and what  she thinks is going to happen to her life.                         [From CNN, Sept. 16, 2022]   Biden Set To Meet With Families of Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan at                              the White House         President Joe Biden is scheduled to meet with the families       of Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan at the White House on       Friday, marking his first time personally meeting with them       since their loved ones were detained in Russia.        White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said       Thursday that Biden will meet with Griner's wife, Cherelle       Griner, and Whelan's sister, Elizabeth Whelan, to assure them       his administration is committed to securing the release of       their loved ones and that they remain ``front of mind.''       Biden will meet with them separately, an official said.        ``One of the things that the President wanted to make clear       is, and one of the reasons he's meeting with the families, is       that he wanted to let them know that they remain front of       mind and that his team is working on this every day, on       making sure that Brittney and Paul return home safely,''       Jean-Pierre said.        The Biden administration has repeatedly said that working       to secure Griner and Whelan's release, as well as that of       Americans wrongfully detained abroad, is a top priority. In       late July, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced       that the US had put forward a ``substantial proposal'' to try       to secure the release of Griner and Whelan. Sources told CNN       that proposal included a swap for convicted arms dealer       Viktor Bout.        Griner was detained in February for carrying vape       cartridges containing cannabis oil in her luggage. The two-      time US Olympic basketball gold medalist pleaded guilty to       drug charges and said she accidentally packed the drugs while       in a hurry. She has been sentenced to nine years, along with       a fine of about $16,400. Her legal team in Russia has       appealed the sentence.        Whelan has been imprisoned in Russia for more than three       years after being convicted on espionage charges that he       vehemently denies. He was sentenced in June 2020 to 16 years       in prison in a trial US officials denounced as unfair.        A senior administration official told CNN Thursday that       there has been ``movement but not breakthrough'' on the       efforts to secure the releases of Griner and Whelan. The       official said that the US has urged Russia to put forward ``a       serious counteroffer'' to the proposal on the table to secure       the release of the two, but ``we've not gotten a serious       response back.''  [[Page H8367]]         State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Thursday that       ``there have been discussions with the Russian government,''       but acknowledged the negotiations process ``certainly hasn't       moved with the speed we would like.'' He said he wouldn't       call the process ``stalled.''        The White House meetings come after CNN first reported       earlier this week that former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson       and his team were in Moscow and held meetings with Russian       leadership.        The details around those meetings were not immediately       clear. Richardson and his namesake center privately work on       behalf of families of hostages and detainees.        Biden administration officials have repeatedly expressed       concerns that private citizens' attempts to broker deals to       repatriate wrongfully detained Americans may end up hindering       ongoing efforts by the US government to bring them home.        Since taking office, Biden has met with the families of       other Americans who have been detained abroad.        The President in May met with the family of Austin Tice, an       American journalist detained at a checkpoint near Damascus in       August 2012. The Biden administration relayed in August that       it has engaged directly with the Syrian government to try and       bring Tice home.        Biden also met with the family of Trevor Reed in March.       Reed, an American citizen and former Marine who had been       detained in Russia since 2019, was freed and repatriated to       the US in April as part of a prisoner swap.                                   ____                          [From CNN, March 17, 2022]   What We Know (and Dont Know) About the Arrest of US Olympic Champion                         Brittney Griner in Russia                               (By Holly Yan)         A month after US basketball star Brittney Griner was       arrested in Russia, it's still not clear exactly where she's       being held.        But a Moscow court has ordered the 31-year-old to stay in       custody until at least May 19, the Russian state news agency       TASS reported March 17.         ``The court granted the request of the investigation and       extended the period of detention of the US citizen Griner       until May 19,'' the court said, according to TASS.         Griner is a championship-winning player with the WNBA's       Phoenix Mercury who has spent her past several offseasons       playing for the Russian team UMMC Ekaterinburg.         But last month, Russian authorities accused Griner of       smuggling significant amounts of a narcotic substance after       flying from New York to a Moscow airport.        Now, the mystery surrounding her detainment in a country       she's worked in for years has come to symbolize the growing       tensions between the US and Russia during Russia's continued       invasion of Ukraine.      Why was Griner detained?        The Russian Federal Customs Service said an American' was       detained at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport after being found       with hash oil.        ``As a US citizen was passing through the green channel at       Sheremetyevo Airport upon arriving from New York, a working       dog from the Sheremetyevo customs canine department detected       the possible presence of narcotic substances in the       accompanying luggage,'' a statement from the customs service       said.        ``The customs inspection of the hand luggage being carried       by the US citizen confirmed the presence of vapes with       specifically smelling liquid, and an expert determined that       the liquid was cannabis oil (hash oil), which is a narcotic       substance.''        The Russian statement did not identify Griner by name, but       said the detainee is an American professional basketball       player and two-time US Olympian.        The customs agency said the US citizen was placed in       pretrial detention. It said a criminal case was underway for       smuggling significant amounts of narcotic substances--an       offense carries a potential punishment of five to 10 years in       prison.        Griner's wife, Cherelle Griner, has publicly called for the       release of her wife. USA Basketball, the Women's National       Basketball Association, the Phoenix Mercury and the WNBA       players' union have all publicly shared their concerns for       Griner.      When was Griner arrested?        The Russian customs agency said in a statement a US citizen       was detained ``in February of 2022,'' after flying to Moscow       from New York, but did not say what day.        US Rep. Colin Allred, whose office has been in touch with       the US State Department, said Griner was arrested in Russia       on February 17.        A State Department spokesperson said the department is       ``aware of and closely engaged on this case.''      Where is Griner now?        As of March 17, Griner's exact whereabouts were not clear.        Ekaterina Kalugina, a representative of Moscow's Public       Monitoring Commission--which observes the treatment of       prisoners--visited Griner at her pre-trial detention center,       TASS reported.        A court advocate said Griner should be kept under house       arrest because their jail beds are a foot too short for       Griner, who is 6 feet 9 inches tall, according to the Russian       news service RIA Novosti.      Can Griner communicate with anyone in the US?        Allred said Griner has been in contact with her Russian       lawyer, who is in touch with her agent and her family in the       US. But Griner's consular service has been blocked, which is       ``extremely concerning,'' Allred said.        TASS quoted Kalugina as saying the US consul had not yet       visited Griner, despite Russian authorities' willingness to       ``create all conditions'' for their visit.        CNN has reached out to Russian officials and the US Embassy       in Moscow for comment on Griner's consular access but has not       heard back.        Although a State Department official told CNN the US has       been denied consular access to Griner, a source close to the       situation told CNN Griner's Russian legal team has seen her       several times a week throughout her detention, and she is       well.        The source added that the Russian investigation is ongoing,       and a trial date has not been set.        Her high school basketball coach, Debbie Jackson, said she       worries Griner's case will be used for political purposes.        ``My biggest fear is that . . . she will become a political       pawn,'' Jackson told CNN.      What was Griner doing in Russia?        ``Griner was in Russia for work: playing for UMMC       Ekaterinburg, where in 2021 she helped the team win its fifth       EuroLeague Women championship,'' wrote Tamryn Spruill, a       journalist who covers women's basketball.        Spruill started the ``Secure Brittney Griner's Swift and       Safe Return to the U.S.'' petition on Change.org.        ``Like many athletes competing in the WNBA, Griner plays       abroad during the WNBA offseason because her salary is       exponentially higher in other countries,'' Spruill wrote on       the petition's page.        ``For WNBA players, that means playing abroad, while NBA       rookies who haven't played a professional game yet are handed       salaries many-times higher than what title-winning, All-Star       designated WNBA veterans could ever hope for,'' Spruill said.        ``These realities are not the fault of the players. They       simply want to be paid their worth like their male       counterparts, and they do not deserve to be entangled in       geopolitical turmoil for doing so.''      Are there any other WNBA players in Russia?        In early March, the WNBA confirmed to CNN that no other       players were in Russia nor Ukraine.      What are the odds of getting Griner out of Russia?        A member of the US House Armed Services Committee said       ``it's going to be very difficult'' to get Griner out of       Russia.        ``Our diplomatic relationships with Russia are nonexistent       at the moment,'' Democratic Rep. John Garamendi of California       told CNN on March 7.        ``Perhaps during the various negotiations that may take       place, she might be able to be one of the solutions. I don't       know.''        He also noted ``Russia has some very, very strict LGBT       rules and laws''--though it's not clear whether those rules       and laws might impact Griner's case.        Russia has passed LGBTQ-related legislation and outlawed       the ``propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations around       minors.''        But the Biden administration is working on trying to get       Griner out of Russia, members of the Congressional Black       Caucus said after meeting with President Joe Biden on March       7.        ``The best news we got today was that they know about it       and that she's on the agenda,'' Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, who       represents Griner's hometown of Houston, Texas, told       reporters.        Noting a potential 10-year sentence for Griner, Jackson Lee       added: ``We know about Britney Griner, and we know that we       have to move on her situation.''     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a press  statement from my office.   [Press Statement from Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, Aug. 4, 2022]         Washington, DC.--Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee condemns       the Russian Court System for their egregious sentencing of       Brittney Griner. Today Griner was sentenced to nine years in       prison by a Russian Court. This decision comes after the       House passage of H. Res. 1132 ``Calling for the immediate       release of Brittney Griner, a citizen of the United States,       who was wrongfully detained by the Government of the Russian       Federation in February 2022.''        ``If I have to beg for mercy for the release of Brittney       Griner and Paul Whelan myself, I am prepared to do so,''       explained Rep. Jackson Lee. Brittney Griner grew up in       Houston, Texas, was a collegiate All American star basketball       player at Baylor University where she won a national       championship, won two Olympic gold medals as the leader of       the U.S. national basketball team, and is a WNBA superstar       playing for the Phoenix Mercury based in Arizona. Prior to       being held captive by the Russian government for several       months before having charges brought against her Griner       played in the Russian leagues in the United States' WNBA off       season.        On May 3, 2022, the United States Government declared       Brittney Griner unlawfully detained and immediately moved her       case to the Department of State under hostage negotiation.       The U.S. Department of state is a leading Government agency       which serves an  [[Page H8368]]       integral role in foreign policy and the advancement of the       American people. ``We thought there might be a glimmer of       hope, but we were obviously wrong,'' Congresswoman Jackson       Lee explained.        While on trial Alexander Boikov, a member of Griner's legal       team, requested Griner's acquittal stating that the       prosecution failed to prove criminal intent. Charges brought       against Griner are drug smuggling and cannabis possession,       which the prosecution has categorized as a significant       amount. Griner was in possession of less than one ounce of       cannabis oil, which demonstrates how corrupt Russia's court       system is. By padding smuggling charges, Russian courts were       able to lengthen Griner's sentence when evidence only       substantiated drug possession charges.        While playing for the Phoenix Mercury in Arizona, Griner       legally obtained and frequently used cannabis to treat       chronic pain from an injury. Griner took her career in the       Russian basketball league seriously and decided to travel to       Russia, even amidst the political unrest, so she would not       let her teammates or Russian fanbase down.        The Biden administration has offered the trade of Russian       illegal arms dealer Viktor Bout for the trade of both Griner       and Whelan. Congresswoman Jackson Lee urges Russia to act on       this deal and reassures the American people ``We are not       violating our integrity as Viktor Bout has served majority of       his sentence.'' Bout, nicknamed ``the merchant of death,''       was convicted on November 2, 2011, and sentenced, to twenty-      five years in prison on charges of conspiracy to kill U.S.       citizens and officials, and conspiring to provide aid to a       terrorist organization. Inversely, Griner is currently       imprisoned on charges for 0.702 ounces of cannabis oil and       serving a nine-year sentence. ``The American people must come       together, and ensure our citizens are brought home,''       explained Rep. Jackson Lee.                                time  1515    And so, Mr. Speaker, let me express my appreciation to my colleagues.  I hope they see the pain that her family is feeling. None of us can  stand in their shoes.   Because none of us can stand in their shoes, we have to plead to  Vladimir Putin. Let our important and crucial leaders listen to this  plea. Listen to our anguish. Listen and see this picture versus the  ones that I have shown, this picture. Just look at them. From Olympian  to a cage. The Olympian to a cage.   I am going to do everything I can.   I have asked the Embassy, and I want to know what kind of shame they  are experiencing, not giving Americans visas for us to go to our  embassy in Moscow?   What are they thinking that they can live in a world like this,  locking people up so they can play gotcha and be inhumane and stick it  in the eye of the American people?   Well, I will tell you, as I stand here today, let me take this fist,  this fist, to make the promise that all of our hostages should be free.  I hope the State Department's team of hostage negotiators gets the  additional funding to grow the team.   But to the families of hostages who are in pain, some who don't know  whether their loved one is alive, and they live with the pain every day  that they have not been able to honor them if they are not.   Mr. Speaker, I hope that I have said something to ignite the  conscience of the American people and to ignite the conscience, if you  will, of all of my colleagues.   Free Brittney Griner now.   Free Paul Whelan.   Free Brittney Griner now.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule by which the House has  passed H. Res. 1132, ``Calling for the immediate release of Brittney  Griner''.   A very important component of the rule currently before the House is  that it: ``Provides that House Resolution 1132 is hereby adopted.''   I fought hard for passage of H. Res. 1132, introduced by Congressman  Stanton, myself, and Congressman Allred, because, by raising our voices  for Brittney Griner, we raise our voices for bedrock American values  and priorities that are intrinsic to our national character.   H. Res. 1132 calls for the release of Brittney Griner and, in so  doing, puts Congress on record emphatically defending true American  values such as our devotion to human rights, respect and dignity for  each person, the right to due process, and justice based on truth.   Each of these have been offended by Russia unjustifiably holding  Griner, and by the Russian distortion of a judicial system that extends  her detention, preventing her release to return home, without a factual  or legal basis for doing so.   Brittney Griner, who grew up in Houston, Texas, is an extension of  all of us. She represents quintessential American stories and  qualities. The injustices inflicted upon her by Putin and his acolytes  in Russia could have been imposed on any Americans within their reach.   The denial of basic rights from Brittney offends all Americans  because they are rights to which we believe all people are entitled. We  do not accept the dehumanization that is commonplace in Russia, and our  values compel us to seek justice for Brittney, her immediate release,  and her return home to her family and friends.   As a mother who has raised a family, I can only imagine the gut- wrenching pain that her parents, family, and friends must be feeling  right now. There is no worse feeling than when someone in your family  is in imminent danger and they are beyond your reach to help them.   As a Black woman, I can say there's no greater fear than having a  loved one being wrongfully placed in a situation or environment over  which there is no control.   For any of us, if we had a loved one placed in this situation, we  would be doing everything in our power to ensure their prompt and safe  return.   We would be calling and seeking the help of everyone possible-- including the media, the US State Department, and even allies in  Russia.   We would press every politician and public figure to fight against  the corrupt government of Russia to ensure that our family member is  guaranteed their natural born rights to due process, a fair trial, and  a prompt release from detention.   No American citizen should be detained in a foreign country for  months, denied access to American consular officials, and, dependent  upon the performance of a Russian lawyer, especially in absence of  substantial evidence of a crime.   Ms. Griner is suffering from Russia's heinous demonstration of power  and control that stems from centuries of bigotry and hatred embodied in  an autocratic leader who is the very antithesis of everything Ms.  Griner represents.   Ms. Griner's detention is primarily based on the country of her  citizenship, in a game of political leverage. Since she was targeted  because of being an American, every American should take this  personally. Her detention is an offense against our country, and  against our people.   Griner was detained on February 17, 2022, her initial release date  was set to be May 19th, it was then shifted to June 19th, and when that  date approached, it was delayed to July 2nd.   That is not justice--it's oppression. We call on Putin and the  Russian government to comply with their international treaty  obligations.   By passing the rule and adopting H. Res. 1132, the House insists,  alongside the Griner family, that Brittney Griner must be immediately  and safely released and returned home to the US.   We are unified in demanding respectful treatment and justice for her,  in accordance with American values.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
