 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of  prioritizing veterans in our Federal budget by fully funding VA  programs, fully funding healthcare for veterans, and fully funding  veterans benefits. The veterans funding bill before us this week  accomplishes each of these three objectives.   First, the bill fully funds VA programs. It actually increases the VA  budget by $18 billion over last year's funding level. In concrete  terms, this means more tax dollars spent on critical care for veterans,  including fully funding care for vets exposed to Agent Orange, burn  pits, and other environmental toxins while serving our Nation.   The bill also provides the necessary funds to revamp and enhance the  effectiveness of the suicide hotline for veterans and provides funds  for the electronic health modernization initiative, which will ensure a  seamless transition between receiving care at a DOD facility while on  Active Duty and receiving care at a VA facility after discharge from  the military.   Second, the bill fully funds healthcare for veterans, and $138  billion is allocated to address the healthcare needs of our retired  servicemen and -women, including over $20 billion for veterans to  receive quality care at non-VA facilities.   Finally, the bill fully funds veterans benefits. Mr. Speaker, $181  billion is allocated to ensure that every benefit that was promised,  every commitment that was made, is fulfilled by the Federal Government.   Mr. Speaker, we have an obligation to ensure our veterans receive the  care they need and the benefits they have earned. Today's bill achieves  exactly that by prioritizing veterans in the budget, and as a result,  it has my support.                           Plumas Broadband Project     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4368, which  directly benefits my constituents in Plumas County by funding a  critical high-speed broadband project in the A-15 corridor and Valley  Ranch communities in eastern Plumas County.   In the 21st century, access to the internet is essential. It is  essential for students to participate in online learning and access  educational resources, for patients to receive needed telemedicine  services, for workers to find job opportunities and engage in remote  work, and for citizens to engage in open dialogue and participate in  our representative democracy.   Too often, our rural communities are neglected and lack the basic  telecom services necessary in today's economy and society.   That is why I prioritized funding rural broadband for my constituents  in the Federal budget, and I am proud to report that a project I  submitted to provide $4.2 million in funding to the Plumas-Sierra Rural  Electric Cooperative is included in the funding bill that will be voted  on by the House this week.   This funding will enable the Plumas-Sierra Rural Electric Cooperative  to construct middle- and last-mile fiber-optic networks to provide  high-speed internet to rural residents in the Valley Ranch and A-15  corridor communities in eastern Plumas County.   Rural households will finally be able to participate in online  education, telemedicine, and remote employment opportunities that are  out of reach for too many today.   Emergency personnel who are dependent upon internet-based  communications will be able to communicate with one another to  strengthen emergency response services.   Perhaps most importantly, high-speed broadband service will attract  new residents, homeowners, and businesses to the region to continue to  ensure the vitality of Plumas County for many years to come.   Ensuring our households are equipped with high-speed internet is  imperative for an increasingly technological society. Leaving behind  those in rural communities is a detriment not just to our local  economies but it is also a disservice to our youth and the vitality of  their education.   Today's bill is an important step forward in addressing the existing  gap in broadband services for my Plumas County constituents, and it  will have direct, tangible benefits on their lives. For that reason, I  support H.R. 4368.
