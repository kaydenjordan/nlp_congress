 Mr. Speaker, today we will vote on a bill that  rebuilds our military. It supports our troops and protects the American  people.   Major credit for this great achievement goes to the man that I am so  proud to call my chairman, Rodney Frelinghuysen. Chairman Frelinghuysen  has been a public servant since the days that he served in Vietnam as  an enlisted soldier, and that service continues to this day with this  bill, which includes the most significant support for our women and men  in uniform since the beginning of the war on terrorism.   Let me tell you two other things that are in this bill for the  American people due to the chairman's leadership.   The bill includes over $10 billion in new transportation and housing  infrastructure, without adding to the Federal bureaucracy. The chairman  fought for major funding for key areas of our economy, yes, including  the Northeast. This is a major investment in our Nation's  infrastructure.   Both Congress and the administration, as you know, have been talking  about this for such a long time. Well, here you have it in this bill.  This bill delivers on that promise of infrastructure.   Finally, the chairman has been a tireless advocate for two decades  for  [[Page H2024]]  housing for the disabled in our country. This bill delivers a major  humanitarian victory for the disabled community, with 40,000 new  vouchers for the disabled. These Frelinghuysen vouchers will change the  lives of countless families across our entire Nation, and I am  particularly proud of this achievement by our chairman and his  committee.   Finally, I would like to thank the Speaker of the House for standing  up and winning on some huge priorities for the House.   And I would be remiss if I did not mention the staff of the  Appropriations Committee, who worked long and hard--yes, very long and  hard--on this bill.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this fine bill. I thank the  chairman for the time.
