 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4681,  the No Assistance for Assad Act, introduced by my good friend Rep.  Engel, the Ranking Member of our committee. I commend Rep. Engel and  Rep. Kinzinger for advancing this important measure in a bipartisan  manner to demonstrate the broad agreement in this House that Syrian  President Bashar al-Assad has no future as the legitimate leader of the  Syrian people.   Mr. Speaker, this bill would effectively block most categories of  U.S. assistance to areas of Syria controlled by the Assad regime unless  it is delivered through trusted local partners or serves basic  humanitarian needs. In creating strict conditions for the provisions of  U.S. assistance to regime-controlled areas, this bill ensures that the  United States will not help those responsible for destroying Syria to  profit from rebuilding it.   Mr. Speaker, the Syrian regime, Russia, and Iran have played both  arsonist and firefighter in Syria's devastating civil war--and now they  want to play the role of predatory developer, sopping up reconstruction  contracts to pad their pockets and further determine Syria's future in  line with their narrow political agendas.   Mr. Speaker, Assad long ago surrendered his last shred of legitimacy  as president of Syria. His regime's horrific chemical attack this month  in Douma placed this fact once again in high relief. The Trump  Administration was right to respond decisively to this barbaric attack  with targeted strikes to punish and deter such atrocities perpetrated  with chemical weapons.   Mr. Speaker, I have long advocated concrete steps that would ensure  the Assad regime, jihadi groups, and others responsible for mass  atrocities in Syria face justice for their crimes. This bill rightly  insists on the removal of war criminals from the Syrian government as  one condition among many for releasing U.S. aid to the regime.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this timely and  important measure.
