 Madam Speaker, as the Members know and as the country  knows, we have failed to reach an agreement on moving ahead on COVID-19  legislation. Therefore, Members are advised that no additional votes  are expected in the House this week after we complete the next two  votes.   Members are further advised, Madam Speaker, that as conversations  surrounding additional coronavirus relief legislation continues, it is  expected that the House will meet during the month of August.   I have told my Members, and I have told the minority leader and whip,  that no one should schedule themselves for next week or until such time  as we adopt COVID-19 legislation.   Members will be given at least 24 hours' notice before the House will  be called back into session.   We will not start the August district work period until we pass  appropriate COVID-19 relief to meet the current health and economic  crisis confronting our people and our country.   Further information will be provided as soon as it becomes available.   And, Madam Speaker, at the end of the day, I will make further  observations with reference to where we stand, but Members are advised  that this is the schedule. It obviously is designed to ensure that we  act as quickly as humanly and legislatively possible to give the relief  the country needs.    Mr. Speaker, last week, I shared with the House that my  office has launched a website where Americans could learn about the  George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, weigh in with their opinion on  the bill, and list themselves as citizen cosponsors if they support it.   Thousands of Americans, Mr. Speaker, have become citizen cosponsors.  Many have also shared their own stories and called for Senate action on  this bill.   Sadly, Senate Republicans refuse to do anything to address the crisis  of systemic racism in our country. More than a month has passed, and  they have taken no action--nor on their own bills--on the George Floyd  Justice in Policing Act. That is an irresponsible abdication of its  duty to address the challenges facing our country.   Today, Mr. Speaker, I will begin submitting the names of more than  7,000 George Floyd Justice in Policing Act citizen cosponsors in the  Congressional Record. There are so many of those, it may take several  days.   As more add their names at justiceinpolicing.us, we will continue to  submit them into the Record, because the Senate needs to see how  important this issue is to so many of our fellow Americans. They need  to see how many of our people are urging them to act.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a list of citizen cosponsors to  the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.

Mr. Speaker, I also want to urge the Senate to stop  ignoring this issue and listen to the voices of thousands who have  taken the time to add their names here and share their stories. We must  take action to make it clear that Black lives matter.   Mr. Speaker, we passed a bill just a few days ago to remove the  statues of Roger Brooke Taney and other people. In the opinion, the  Dred Scott decision, what Roger Brooke Taney of the State of Maryland  said was Black lives do not matter. They are not citizens. They are not  worthy, he pointed out, to be with those of us who are White.   We need to make sure that those citizens of our country understand  that, yes, Black lives matter.   Mr. Speaker, I also have the sad obligation to say that yesterday,  Mr. Donnald Anderson passed away. He was a page at the age of 13 on  this floor. We don't have pages anymore, but it was a wonderful  experience for those young people.   He stayed. He stayed in the Cloakroom. He became the director of the  Cloakroom, and then he became the Clerk of the House.   He had a distinguished career serving in this institution, which he  loved. It began as a teenager, as I said.   When I came to the House, he was the assistant manager of the  Democratic Cloakroom. He served as Clerk of the House for the 100th  through the 103rd Congresses.   Donn was also a U.S. Army Reservist. His life was filled with service  to his country.   Mr. Speaker, I hope all of the Members of this House will join me in  expressing gratitude for his life and service and condolences to Donn's  family. I will be taking time when we return.   Mr. Speaker, I want to announce our schedule. I did it before when  not everybody was on the floor, but hopefully most. We are sending it  out.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to thank the House for  their hard work and perseverance as we engaged in one of the most  productive periods in the modern history of the House.   In 20 days, 4 weeks--1\1/2\ weeks in June, 2\1/2\ weeks in July--the  number of major bills we passed in June and July is literally  staggering.   We passed the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. We passed the  Defense authorization bill. We passed D.C. statehood. We passed  legislation to strengthen and expand the Affordable Care Act; a bill to  protect renters and mortgage holders; a No Ban to reverse the Muslim  ban, which was inconsistent with America's Constitution and principles;  and we provided for access to counsel.   We passed the Great American Outdoors Act in a bipartisan fashion; a  major, major infrastructure bill; Water Resources Development Act; a  bill to remove Confederate statues, which I have already talked about;  childcare bills, two major childcare bills; 10--listen to me--10  appropriations bills.   The Senate has not passed a single appropriations bill, not one.   When we came here to the last Congress, to this Congress, the  government was shut down. Why? Because the majority party had not  passed the funding of government.   None of you, in my view, nor I, have served in a 20-day period where  so much consequential legislation was passed. Sadly, Mr. Speaker, much  of that legislation is now and may well be sitting in the Senate for  some period of time.   This came, Mr. Speaker, after we passed the HEROES Act 80-some days  ago.   We now, Mr. Speaker, face a crisis, our people face a crisis, our  country faces a crisis, because for 80 days that legislation sat  untended in the United States Senate, and the relief that the American  people needed then and now--and now has become a crisis--were not  tended to by the United States Senate.   The leader of the United States Senate said: Let the States go  bankrupt. Thankfully, the leader of this party said: Let's wait and see  what happens.   Well, we have seen what happened. I hope everybody, lamentably, saw  the front page of The Washington Post: the deepest decline in the GDP,  even beyond the Great Depression--think of that--because we twiddled  our thumbs.   On May 15, we passed an act to react robustly and effectively in  meeting the crisis caused by this pandemic. How sad that the Senate, if  it didn't agree with our bill, didn't send us another bill. But they  did nothing, and now we see an economy at extraordinary risk and  individuals and families and children and those who are hungry.   We included food assistance in the bill that we passed in the HEROES  Act. We included legislation to make sure that we could go back to  school safely and the schools would have the resources to make that  happen. We included additional medical assistance for this onslaught  that our hospitals are confronted with. That is in the HEROES Act.   But what do our Republican friends offer us?   By the way, I don't know that our Republican friends offered us  anything, Mr. McConnell, because they can't agree in the Senate. As  Senator Graham said, they are deeply divided.   Indeed, Mr. Speaker, they are a deeply divided and dysfunctional  party, because they cannot come up with an alternative.   Meanwhile, other than the defense authorization bill--that is the  only bill they passed--the Senate did not pass a single piece of major  legislation during that same period, 80 days.   We have passed major legislation over and over and over again, and we  did it in 20 days.   So, Mr. Speaker, we are not announcing the August work period. We  will be ready to act as soon as we can on a COVID-19 relief act. We  believe the HEROES Act does that.   The only thing that they propose, or come back with, is extending  unemployment and cutting it 66 percent so that an American family  relying on that money is going to go cold turkey under their plan.   Now, I have said we can discuss the level, but we cannot discuss it  so that we say, 24 hours from now, they are on their own, Mr. and Mrs.  America.                                time  1230    So I have put everybody on notice on both sides of the aisle that I  will call this House back into session. The Speaker will technically  call it out, but I will recommend that the Speaker call this House back  into session at the  [[Page H4204]]  very minute that we have an agreement, that we know we can pass  something through the United States Senate. We can pass it here. We  have passed it.   The people need the assistance we give them. The economy needs the  assistance. And I would think my Republican friends who see the economy  in absolute free fall would be demanding that we get to an agreement,  not just demanding you do this and only this.   We are a democracy. The American people have elected us to be the  leadership in this House. And they have elected a lot of Democrats in  the Senate and the Republicans to be in charge of the Senate. They  expect us to come to an agreement.   Do you know who said that, Mr. Speaker? Newt Gingrich, Newt Gingrich  when he made a deal with Bill Clinton on the budget. The conservatives  in his party said: No, we are not going to make any deal. And Newt  Gingrich's reply was: Look, we are in a democracy, and we have to heed  the views of both sides of the aisle.   Newt Gingrich said that, and he was savaged by his conservatives who  simply wanted to say no.   The American people need a yes. The American people need help.  Families need help. People who are not able to buy food need help, and  hospitals that are stretched, and States and local governments.   I urge all of my Republican colleagues and Democratic colleagues to  talk to your local mayor, your local county commissioner, your local  city council person. They will tell you they are hemorrhaging revenues.  Why? Because the economy has fallen so swiftly.   They are on the front lines. They hire teachers. They hire sanitation  workers. They hire police. They hire fire protection. They hire  emergency medical response teams. They are on the front lines, all of  those levels of government.   We must come together, Mr. Speaker, and get to an agreement. If we do  not, we will fail the American people.   On May 15, we passed a bill, and for 80 days, the Republican  leadership did nothing. And now, they say: Take this or nothing.   We are going to be on the side of the people, and we are going to get  a bill that is for the people. At that point in time, I will  immediately give 24 hours' notice minimum so that people can get back  here and do their duty.   Mr. Speaker, last week, I shared with the House that my office had  launched a website where Americans could learn about the George Floyd  Justice in Policing Act, weigh in with their opinion on the bill, and  list themselves as a ``citizen cosponsor'' if they support it.  Thousands of Americans have become ``citizen cosponsors.''   Many have also shared their own stories and called for Senate action  on this bill.   Sadly, Senate Republicans refuse to do anything to address the crisis  of systemic racism and police brutality.   More than a month has passed, and they have taken no action on the  George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.   That's an irresponsible abdication of its duty to address the  challenges facing our country.   Today, I will begin submitting the names of the more than 7,000  ``citizen cosponsors'' of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act into  the Congressional Record.   There are so many, that it may take several days to do so. And as  more add their names at justiceinpolicing.us, we will continue to  submit them into the Record.   Because the Senate needs to see how important this issue is to so  many of our fellow Americans.   They need to see how many of our people are urging them to act.   So, Madam Speaker, include in the Record this list of ``citizen  cosponsors.'' And I ask that the Senate stop ignoring this issue and  listen to the voices of thousands who have taken the time to add their  names here and share their stories.   We must take action to make it clear that Black Lives Matter.   In addition, I want to share the sad news that former Clerk of the  House Donnald Anderson passed away yesterday.   He had a distinguished career serving this institution, which he  loved.   It began as a teenager, when Donn served as a House page.   When I came to the House, he was the assistant manager of the  Democratic cloakroom.   He then served as the Clerk for the 100th through 103rd Congresses.   Donn was also a U.S. Army reservist. His life was filled with service  to his country.   I hope all of the members of this House will join me in expressing  gratitude for his life and service and condolences to Donn's family.   I would like to take a moment to thank the members of this House for  their hard work and perseverance as we engaged in one of the most  productive periods in the modern history of the House.   The number of major bills we passed in June and July is staggering:   George Floyd Justice in Policing Act;   Defense authorization;   D.C. statehood;   Legislation to strengthen & expand the Affordable Care Act;   A bill to protect renters & homeowners from eviction;   No ban & access to counsel;   Great American Outdoors Act;   A major infrastructure package;   Water Resources Development Act;   A bill to remove Confederate statues and other reminders of slavery  from the Capitol;   Child care bills; and   Ten appropriations bills, funding the vast majority of the government  ahead of the fiscal year.   These came on the heels of May's HEROES Act, major relief to the  American people during this present crisis.   Meanwhile, other than the Defense authorization bill that the House  sent over, the Senate did not pass a single piece of major legislation  during that same period.   So, I want to thank you all for bearing with the very busy schedule  so that we could make sure the people's house continues to govern for  the people.                            ____________________
