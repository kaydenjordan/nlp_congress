 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding  the time.   Madam Speaker, on this Constitution Day we will do well to heed the  words of Dr. King when he reminded us that the ultimate measure of the  person is not where the person stands in times of comfort and  convenience, but where do you stand in times of challenge and  controversy?   Where do you stand when racism and anti-Semitism and anti-Asian  sentiments are emanating from the highest office in the land?   Where do you stand?                                time  1000    I stand with the business owner who is losing business, and some have  gone out of business because of this kind of hateful violence emanating  from words.   I stand with the mother who has to console her child who comes home  from school and who has been bullied. I stand with the child who has  been bullied who comes home crying.   I stand with the people of my congressional district and across this  land who happen to be of Asian ancestry.   I stand against racism.   It is easy to say: ``I am against racism. I condemn racism.'' But  when will you condemn the racist? When will you condemn the racist when  it is emanating from the highest office in the land?   This is Constitution Day.   I close with these words from Emily Dickinson. The truest measure of  the person, I have reminded you, but Dickinson reminded us that: ``A  word is dead when it is said, some say. I say it just begins to live  that day.''   These words live; they take on meanings; they impact people; and they  cause harms.   It is time for us to take a stand.
