 Madam Speaker, today, I am proud to rise in support  of USMCA.   As the Representative of South Carolina's Lowcountry, which is home  to the Port of Charleston, Volvo, Bosch, JW Aluminum, Becton Dickinson,  and countless other manufacturers, I know just how important market  stability and trade certainty is to my constituents.   I promised the people of the Lowcountry I would come to Washington to  work with Democrats and Republicans in Congress, the White House, and  anyone else necessary to find bipartisan, commonsense solutions to  issues impacting our district. Passage of USMCA is a major step in that  direction.                                time  1300    Nearly 30,000 jobs in our district are supported by trade with Mexico  and Canada. This agreement is absolutely critical to maintaining good- paying jobs and economic growth in the Lowcountry.   I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support  passage of the USMCA to bolster America's economy, support workers, and  protect the environment.
