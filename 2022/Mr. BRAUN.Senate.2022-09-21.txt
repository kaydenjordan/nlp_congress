 Mr. President, reserving the right object, I am glad the  Supreme Court has returned the issue of life back to the people's  elected representatives, where it should have stayed 49 years ago.   This legislation denies State representatives the right to make laws  protecting life. This bill is an attempt to undermine State laws that  protect life by allowing abortions for anyone who crosses State lines  and is not a resident of the State.   Moreover, it gives the Department of Justice $40 million in grant  funding to help people sue States--to help people sue States--that  enact policies to protect life. The Department of Health and Human  Services is given another $40 million in funding for any eligible  center at Secretary Becerra's discretion. This funding is not protected  by the Hyde amendment, and most likely, we are going to borrow every  penny of it, like we do for most things in this place. We should not  spend $80 million to undermine State laws on life or impose a  legislative backdoor for abortion-on-demand across our Nation.   For these reasons, I oppose this bill, and I do object.
