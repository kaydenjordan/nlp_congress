 Madam President, there are a lot of things going on in  the world right now--a lot. What is happening in Ukraine; Russian  aggression; continuing talk about the continual challenges of communist  China; dealing with COVID-19 and its effects still worldwide, still  here in the United States; still lots of people very frustrated on  transportation mandates--on the masks, I should say; other vaccine  mandates that are still out there; we have a 7--almost 8--percent now  inflation rate that is in the country; cost of living is going up; all  the energy issues--there are so many things that we are dealing with  around this body of late.   I want to bring something to the middle of this conversation that I  don't want us to forget about because the media seemed to have pushed  it all to the back burner. And I have even had people recently catch me  and say, Apparently, things are going much better on our southern  border because I don't hear about it anymore. Well, it has not gotten  better. And I want to bring a couple of issues and one in particular  that I am very concerned about of where things are going right now, on  our enforcement on the southern border.   This chart walks through the last 10 years of illegal crossings that  had been actually apprehended, engaged--the new term is ``encountered''  that the Biden administration is using. This is over the last 10 years,  and this is quarter by quarter of what has actually occurred.   You will see the rise and fall over multiple times. You will see  spikes that have happened. But right there, that spot, is when  President Biden was elected. That is that date. His election is there,  and this is what has occurred since that time period.   Instead of seeing a big dropoff just in the last couple of months, we  have only seen it go down, but not even close to the highest peaks in  the past.   To give you a point of reference on that, since January of 2021, we  have had 2,355,000 people whom we have ``encountered'' on the southwest  border--folks who have illegally crossed our border. These are not just  record numbers; these are alltime high numbers--nothing even close to  the number of people who are illegally crossing the border.   Now, this is on the southern border. And there are two facts I want  to be able to add to this, the first of which is what is happening  inside the country: That would be ICE removals.   This is since 2015, the ICE removals that have been done every year  during the Obama administration, during the Trump administration, and  then during the first year of the Biden administration. So not only do  we have 2.3 million people who have illegally come to our border and  crossed it that we have encountered, but it is an alltime low of actual  deportations that are happening right now as well.   So not only on our southern border are we seeing record numbers of  high coming in inside the country, it is record-low numbers actually  being deported out.   This is by design. This is not accidental. The policies that have  been put in place on our southern border were put in place to encourage  people, quite frankly, to be able to cross the border, knowing full  well that when you get inside, you won't actually be deported.   There is only one policy that is set out there that has been in the  middle of this that has changed the dynamic at all, and it is a policy  most Americans never even heard of. It is called title 42 expulsions.  Quite frankly, probably most of the folks in this room have never heard  of title 42 expulsions. It is a new term, so I want to be able to walk  through it a little bit.   Starting in March of 2020--just 2 years ago--when COVID started to  accelerate worldwide, the Surgeon General made a recommendation through  the CDC, through HHS, to the President to be able to say we have a  worldwide pandemic that is occurring. Here is title 42 of the Public  Health Service Act. It says:         Whenever the Surgeon General determines that by reason of       the existence of any communicable disease in a foreign       country, there is serious danger of the introduction of such       disease into the United States, and that . . . danger is so       increased by the introduction of persons or property from       [that] country that a suspension of the right to introduce       such persons and property is required in the interest of the       public health, the Surgeon General, in accordance with       regulations approved by the President, shall have the power       to prohibit . . . the introduction of persons and property       from such countries or places [that they] shall designate . .       . to [avoid] such danger.    In March of 2020, the Trump administration said: We have got a  concern dealing with individuals crossing our border illegally. They  are coming from all over the world. There is COVID all over the world.  There are some authorities that you go through that you can actually  say some of these folks can be turned around immediately.   The Surgeon General, HHS, and the President agreed that we are going  to turn people around at the border immediately. So the Trump  administration did that.   And, by the way, right there is President Biden's inauguration. His  HHS also agreed with this same policy of title 42 to say: We have a  serious risk from COVID, so we should also turn people around in  numbers at the border and send them back home.   This is the number under the Biden administration of individuals who  have been turned around.   Let me give you a perspective. Of the 2.3 million people who have  been encountered at our border since the beginning of the Biden  administration, 56 percent of those folks have been literally turned  around at the border and told, You cannot enter under title 42  authority--56 percent of the people. So 44 percent of the people have  been allowed to be able to come into our country.   Let me set this in context because I am throwing a lot of numbers out  at everybody. I want you to remember all the news reports from last  year, all of the overcrowding in the Donna, TX, facility that we saw,  all of the people crammed underneath the bridge in the Rio Grande  Valley, all of those folks who piled across the border in massive  numbers that we saw coming into the United States--that represented  only 44 percent of the people illegally crossing our border because  they were allowed in.   I bring this up because as of right now, we have heard that DHS, the  President, and HHS are considering canceling title 42. If that occurs,  we won't have 1 million people illegally crossing our border and  released into the United States; within months, we will have 2 million.  And all that you saw last summer of the flood of people--that 44  percent--imagine what that looks like more than doubled this summer.   The conversation is we are getting toward the backside of COVID.  Ironically enough, while the President just extended the transportation  requirement for masks--again--while the President just asked for  billions of dollars of additional money because we need vaccines  worldwide to be able to distribute more vaccines worldwide to be able  to fight COVID, while we are still dealing with all the additional  surge rise and falls in other countries--in fact, just within the last  couple of days, China has gone back into lockdown based on new COVID  cases in China--while all of that is occurring worldwide, apparently,  the President is looking to cancel title 42.   And when I have asked what will replace that policy, the answer has  come back to me: We are not sure yet. That tells me nothing is actually  the plan to replace this. That is a problem.  [[Page S1203]]    What happens when title 42 goes away? An extra million people come  into the country illegally, remembering that when all of those folks  come into the country, apparently, the Biden administration also has no  plan to deport them.   Where are we right now with the number of people that have illegally  crossed our border, and where are they from? Let me give you a quick  map.   This is a map of all the countries in the past year--just in the past  year--who have illegally crossed our border. In the white there is the  United States. In the red are the countries that we have seen people  illegally cross our border. If you want to squint at that map, let me  just give you shorthand for it. It is every country in the world.   Last year, we had individuals from literally every country in the  world illegally cross our southern border. Yes, that includes China;  that includes North Korea; that includes Iran. It includes them all.   Interestingly enough, just in the last--well, not the last 3 months  but the last 4 months that we have had records on it--that would be  October, November, December, and January--just in those last 4 months  that we have those records, we have 6,400 Russian citizens who  illegally crossed our southern border. Just in the last 4 months we  have records, there were 6,400 Russian citizens.   We have people from all over the world who are illegally crossing our  southern border because people know, if you get across the border, you  are in. When title 42 goes away, this accelerates even more. It is an  open invitation because 56 percent of the people were turned around, 44  percent of the people were released into the country--by the way, that  is over a million so far--that goes away. Then they all get in.   What happens at that point? Those individuals are told that they can  make a request for asylum, even though our statistics show 91 percent  of the people who request asylum are actually coming for economic  reasons, not actually true asylum--91 percent.   Those individuals are released into the country. They are told to be  able to sign up for a hearing date, and they can do their hearing  anywhere they want in the United States. They are given a hearing date,  currently, 6 years in the future--6 years. So they will be traveling in  our country anywhere they want to go for the next 6 years waiting on  their hearing.   By the way, if they don't show up for their hearing, apparently there  is no plan to be able to actually go get them, if they don't show up  for their hearing, because, right now, ICE is not removing people. So  they are just released, and when they are released into the country,  they can immediately text friends back home and say: I am in. Here is  what I said. Here is where I crossed. Here is the cartel member whom I  paid on the southern border to be able to get me through. I am in.  Follow my same path; you will have the same result.   What can be done about this? Well, let me just highlight a couple of  things, and then I want to talk about this more.   First things first--don't end title 42. We still have a worldwide  pandemic. Until there is a plan of what is actually going to occur next  on our southern border, don't end title 42.   This is the time for the President and Ali Mayorkas and all the  leadership to put up a pause and to say: The chaos that happened last  year was only 44 percent of the people crossing our southern border. We  do not have, physically, the capability to be able to handle that many  people. Do not cancel title 42.   The second thing is the ``Remain in Mexico'' policy. The ``Remain in  Mexico'' policy that actually started under President Trump, President  Biden set aside, and Federal courts stepped back in and told this  administration: You have to put back in place the ``Remain in Mexico''  policy. So they chose to do it.   I have talked to this body before about what they did. The Biden  administration said: OK. We will follow the court order. We will  reinstate the ``Remain in Mexico'' policy.   They have reinstated that policy the last 3 months. They have put up  three different facilities. Actually, now there are four total  facilities. I visited one of them in Brownsville, TX. That facility has  six courtrooms. Each courtroom is set up to handle 22 people at a time,  plus their attorneys, plus all the ancillary services. Six of those  they have got set up. They have individual meeting spaces set up for  120 people to meet individually with their attorney. So 120 rooms, 6  courtrooms that are all set up, and all the ancillary everything around  it as well, and we have now got 4 different locations for that.   Of the half a million people who have illegally crossed our border in  the time that they have set up the new MPP courtrooms--of the half a  million people who have crossed illegally during that time period, so  far, the Biden administration has pulled out 1,569 of them to evaluate  if they would go into the ``Remain in Mexico'' policy. Of those, 893  they actually put in the system. Of those, they have actually had 494  of those who at some point came back and said: We have changed our  mind. We talked to attorneys. We have a new way to be able to get out  of it.   We are trying to get the actual number of people who have actually  gone through the ``Remain in Mexico'' policy and who have actually  qualified for it, while we have 4 different locations, each of them  with 6 courtrooms, 120 meeting spaces. But what we are finding is,  really, a handful of people actually have ``qualified'' for the  ``Remain in Mexico'' policy out of half a million people during that  time period.   The simple answer is that the Biden administration is spending  millions and millions of taxpayer dollars setting up the MPP Program  that the court has required them to do, but they have made so many  exceptions to it, no one actually qualifies. So they are trying to  please the court by saying ``We are following your order,'' waste  American tax dollars, while we continue to see record numbers of people  crossing the border. That is a waste.   If we are going to stop this, keep title 42 in place until you have a  response to what you are going to do instead. Actually run the MPP  Program as the court has instructed you to do rather than playing games  with American tax dollars and with the system here.   I would also encourage you to put the ``Safe Third Country'' policy  back in place. The previous administration had actually created a  relationship with multiple other countries so that as individuals  traveled through other countries to get to the United States, they  could make asylum requests in those locations, because we understand-- because we know the law in this body--the law is very clear on the  international standards on this.   If you are going to request asylum, you go to the next safe country,  and you request asylum. If they are traveling through five countries or  they are traveling literally across the globe to get to the United  States from everywhere else so they can request asylum, that is not  asylum; that is economic opportunity.   By the way, don't blame them for coming to the greatest country in  the world to get economic opportunity--except that is not asylum, and  we all know it. So why don't we actually treat it exactly as we all see  it?   If you would like to come to the greatest country in the world,  wonderful. Go through the legal process of that. We allow a million  people a year to legally become citizens of the United States, going  through the legal process. Do that. But for the billions of people who  wake up every day wishing they were in the United States, I don't blame  you. But we welcome people when they come through legally in this  process, and we do with open arms welcome people who come through  legally.   There are ways to be able to address this, but my first concern today  is to be able to speak to this administration and to be able to say:  The title 42 piece is essential to maintain. Do not let go of this  until you have a solution to what is happening at the border, or the  chaos at the border will be even worse this summer than it was last  summer, and it is on you for not enforcing the border.   I want to keep this conversation going in the days ahead, but as of  now, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I come today to the floor with a very  simple unanimous consent request.   This is a resolution. It doesn't allocate any dollars, doesn't change  any policy. It is just a statement of belief from the U.S. Senate. It  is a statement to be able to say we hold certain things very important.   I will talk through some of the resolution part of it--the resolve at  the beginning of it--but it ends with a very simple statement. It ends  with:         Resolved, That the Senate--(1) recognizes and promotes the       importance of parental involvement in their child's       education; and (2) recognizes the necessity of school choices       as a tool to empower all parents with the freedom to choose       the best educational environment for their children and to       reject destructive ideologies promoted by many public       schools, such as Critical Race Theory.    This comes from a basic conversation that happens in my State and,  quite frankly, in States all around the country. Parents should be the  primary decision-makers for their children--not only where they are  educated so that they don't live in a certain neighborhood and they  say, I am sorry, you live there so you have to go here.   This is so the parents have the maximum amount of flexibility knowing  one child may be a great fit for one school, and the younger child may  be a better fit for a different school, whether that be a public school  that allows flexibility within a district to be able to move place to  place or, as it happens in my State, where you can even change district  to district within public schools.   If a parent maybe works in one area--one school district--but lives  in another, that parent can choose to be able to have their child go  into a different district. Though it is a public school setting, it  gives them the flexibility and the choice to do that. Why? Because not  every kid is the same and not every educational environment is the  same.   I would say in my State--and I would assume in other States as well-- not every school district is the same. It is important to us in our  State that every school district is successful. There is no place that  we don't want any child to be able to be successful.   But we should all admit the facts: Not every school district is  thriving. As we invest dollars and time and encourage great teaching in  that district, that child who is in that district that is not being  successful is trapped in a location that is currently not successful.  Maybe they can be successful in 5 years from now when they work through  the different issues they have, but that child doesn't have a second  shot.   If that child has no other opportunity to be able to choose and their  parents are locked into that spot, we basically say, We will fix  everything in this district in a few years, and that child is just not  allowed to get an option out. I don't think that is helpful for that  child and that parent at that time.   Giving parents the ability to be able to make choices--whether public  schools, charter schools, private schools--whatever may work best for  their school and for their State and the policies their State has  created seems like a smart thing to be able to do.   Any kind of teaching that is within a school that actually promotes  one kid as the oppressor and the other kid as the oppressed simply  because of the color of their skin should not be taught in our schools.  Why don't we teach every child is equal? Why don't we teach every child  should have opportunity? Why don't we teach every family has the  opportunity in this great country of ours; and where we have  weaknesses, we work on our weaknesses? But we don't label a child as an  oppressor or as oppressed based on the color of their skin--at least we  used to not in America.   But that is what is rising up with this critical race theory as it  rises up from place to place. I have had many of my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle saying: That is not true. That is not being taught.   Great. Let's make the resolution. Let's say that we as a Senate don't  believe that this should be taught. Let's teach every child. Let's love  every child.   This resolution also affirms the rights of parents to be able to  speak out--not in a violent way, not in a destructive way, but for  parents to be able to speak out.   Why is it that several months ago, the Department of Justice in our  Nation starts a whole investigation on parents to be able to say: Are  there parents who are actually maybe closet terrorists who are showing  up at school board meetings, complaining about what is being taught,  complaining about a mask mandate in their school, complaining about a  vaccine mandate, complaining about critical race theory, or just saying  ``I don't like this particular curriculum''?   That used to be the rights of parents, to engage, and now we hear:  Really, parents don't know enough about these difficult things. Parents  need to just sit down over there. We will take care of this as  professionals.   So, again, this resolution doesn't add additional funding. It doesn't  change the structure of our schools. But it does say: We as the Senate  believe in the power of the parent to be able to make the right choice  for their children.   So, with that, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions be  discharged from further consideration and the Senate now proceed to my  resolution, S. Res. 493. I further ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I  appreciate the dialogue on education. A degree is an education. My mom  is a lifelong educator. I spent my summers growing up in the school  library, putting books in the Dewey Decimal System, putting the new  piece of tape on the outside of it, and actually, back in the old days,  filing a new card in the card catalog, which half the people listening  to me right now have no idea what that is.   I am passionate about education. I have two daughters, and I stay  very engaged in the issue of education. So it is always interesting to  me when my Democratic colleagues say: When Republicans get serious  about education.   It is always interesting. We will pass a bill, like what happened in  the omnibus or what happened in any Education bill before, and there  will be billions and billions of dollars in education, but the comment  will always be ``Well, if you really loved kids, you would do just $1  billion more, but because you don't love kids, you did $1 billion  less.'' It is never enough on it.   This resolution that I brought today was not about an extra $1.3  billion in education to be able to hire more people; it was just about  empowering parents.    It is an interesting side by side to say what families need more is  more employees at school, and what I am seeing is that we need more  empowerment of parents.   One costs $1.3 billion; the other one is just free. One says: Let's  have folks at school know how to be able to take care of your kids  best. The other one says: Well, let's make sure there are certain  things, like critical race theory, that we don't teach at school to  make sure every child is taught the same. And if that parent wants to  teach that at home, they are welcome to teach that at home, but let's  not impose that on every child. Let's not call some children oppressors  because of the color of their skin.   Why don't we do that?  [[Page S1216]]    So the resolution I brought is not about a billion dollars; it is  just a statement of support of parents, a statement of support of what  parents want to be able to teach. It is not about more school  employees; it is about stronger parents. That is what I think that we  ought to continue to be able to address.   This is not about who loves education more. Quite frankly, I know my  colleague from Washington is passionate about kids and about education.  She has lived it as a mom, as a leader in the Senate, and as someone I  watched negotiate with Lamar Alexander some of the toughest education  policy conversations. She is a remarkable legislator and is passionate  about this.   We have some disagreements on some of these issues. I am just  passionate about doing whatever we can to be able to honor parents as  often as we can and to tell them: No, you are not going to be  investigated.   She mentioned parents in Texas being worried about being  investigated. I will tell you, parents in Oklahoma have said to me: I  no longer go to school board meetings because I am afraid the FBI is  going to be there and they are going to open a case on me. I have heard  that the Attorney General is looking for parents who are problems  across the country, and so I don't feel comfortable going to a school  board meeting anymore because the U.S. Attorney General may open a file  on me.   Now, that is a real conversation with a parent at home.   So let's find a way to be able to empower parents and do whatever we  can. So I object.
