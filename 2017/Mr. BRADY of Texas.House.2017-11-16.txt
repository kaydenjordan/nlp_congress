Mr. Speaker, the American Dream is what  separates us from the rest of the world. It promises that, with hard  work and determination, you can improve your station in life and that  your children have an opportunity for a better life than yours. But for  many in the generation coming of age in the last decade, the American  Dream has been a little tarnished and just out of reach.   The last time we did tax reform was 30 years ago. At that time, we  were the world's uncontested economic leader. Our economic system and  Tax Code were competitive. But for decades, we have sat by as the world  passed us by.   In 1990, the middle class was about 50 percent of American families;  today, only 40 percent. Today, the middle class makes just about the  same take-home pay as it did in 1990.   When we all worry about income disparity and the gulf between the  rich and the poor in this country, this is the source of the problem.  The American middle class is smaller and has not had a raise in 30  years.   How could this happen? It has everything to do with a bloated,  overregulating, and overtaxing Federal Government, a government that  sucks the life out of the economy and forces our companies, our  innovators, and our job creators out of our country to survive.   Some folks say it doesn't matter that we have the highest business  tax rate in the world. That is not why our companies left. They say  those jobs aren't coming back.   Well, I say the outdated Tax Code is an anchor around the neck of our  businesses, our innovators, and the American middle class. I say the  American worker can compete with anyone on a level playing field if we  just get government off their back.   Since January, we have been working to correct that. We have made  dramatic steps in reducing regulation. You can already see the economic  lift.   Today, we undertake a tax cut, which will restore economic growth,  put more take-home pay into the pockets of hardworking Americans, and  restore opportunity for a generation of Americans. It will bring  American jobs back to America, which will grow our middle class and,  finally, after 30 years, our middle class will get the pay raise it  deserves.   If you really wish to grow our economy, you should vote for this  bill.   If you really wish to give the middle class a pay raise, you should  vote for this bill.   If you really wish to reduce income disparity, you should vote for  this bill.   If you really wish to give hope to Americans who have given up and  left the workforce and wish to reduce crime and addiction in this  country, you should vote for this bill.   If you want America to have the economic strength to remain a force  of peace and stability in the world, you should vote for this bill.   And, finally, if you truly believe what Thomas Jefferson said 240  years ago, that all men are created equal and that they are entitled to  pursue their own happiness, you should vote for this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Marchant), a key leader on the Tax Policy Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Marchant), a key leader on the Tax Policy Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry), our chief deputy whip.   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Ways and Means  Committee for his hard work and effort, his staff's effort, and his  committee members' effort to put this great bill on the floor today.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is a vitally important bill. This will help  all Americans' lives for the better. The name fits for this bill as  well. It truly is a tax cut for American working families, and it  creates good-paying jobs.   The bill is the result of over 3 years of hard work here in the House  of Representatives. It has been clear for years that our Tax Code is  broken. We all agree on that. Simply put, it does not work for the vast  majority of the American people.   What we do is simplify the Tax Code. More Americans will be able to  take a standard deduction, file on a postcard their tax return,  simplifying the process. Importantly, it makes us more competitive  internationally so we don't lose jobs to overseas companies. That makes  us stronger as a nation.   At the same time, it helps small businesses compete with those large  businesses, with those global businesses, and makes sure that our Main  Streets are strong in America.   This is a very good bill. It is a very good bill, well contemplated,  and will have a great impact on working families.   The bill helps families in my district in particular. The Tax  Foundation says that average middle class families in my district in  western North Carolina are going to see a $2,400 increase in their  take-home pay. That is real money for working Americans. It is real  money for North Carolinians as well.   The bill also helps small businesses by reducing their tax rates and  allowing them to create more good-paying jobs. We need that. Small  businesses are the lifeblood of western North Carolina's communities.  We need them strengthened.   The same Tax Foundation study estimates that this bill will create  nearly a million new jobs nationwide, including more than 30,000 in  North Carolina alone.   Now, there is a great debate in this body about the approach we took  on this bill. There is a fundamental disagreement between the two  parties here.   My colleagues on the left want more power, more expenditures from  government, and want to take more from the American people in order to  pay for that.   We believe, on the Republican side of the aisle, that American  families should be able to keep more of what they earn, make more  decisions for themselves, empower communities, empower small  businesses, make us more competitive and make us stronger.   I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill, to send a strong message  that we in the House of Representatives have a strong tax package for  the American people. I look forward to getting this bill signed into  law before Christmas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Kansas (Mr. Estes).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Kansas (Mr. Estes).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Maryland (Mr. Harris).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Maryland (Mr. Harris).    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland  for yielding.   The intent of our tax reform bill is to achieve tax relief for  individuals at every income level in every State.   I agree with the gentleman, there are still some areas where we will  and can  [[Page H9403]]  make improvements. If the gentleman is willing to help us continue to  move this process forward today, I am happy to commit to working with  him to ensure we reach a positive outcome for his constituents to  reconcile our differences with the Senate.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   So I note that constituents in the 18th District of Texas, the past  speaker's district, that average families will see a tax cut of nearly  $1,000, and Texas will grow 81,000 new jobs and see higher paychecks as  a result of this tax reform bill.   We are proposing a Tax Code so fair and simple, 9 out of 10 Americans  will be able to file using a simple postcard system. There is a  fairness and equality for each American--knowing what each others'  deductions are because we have exactly the same ones.   This simplicity, this fairness, these larger paychecks, this is what  the Tax Cut and Jobs Act is all about.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Alaska (Mr. Young).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Alaska (Mr. Young).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Alaska (Mr. Young).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Alaska (Mr. Young).

Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Alaska (Mr. Young).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Alaska (Mr. Young).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Alaska (Mr. Young).    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to work with the  gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young) on this important issue for the  Alaska Native community. Under the tax bill, Alaska Native Settlement  Trusts would be unintentionally subject to a higher tax rate.   I thank him for bringing this to my intention. I assure him that I  will focus on this in conference as we finalize individual rate  structures between the House and the Senate. I also look forward to  working with him to advance the provisions of his bill in this  important area.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this historic legislation before us today represents a  crucial step to fulfilling our tax reform promise to the American  people, but it is not the final step. We are Republicans. We believe  the Tax Code doesn't belong to Washington. It belongs to the American  people. We will continue to work to make it better and improve at every  step of the way.   Before I make final remarks, I want to thank all of our Ways and  Means Committee members who have done so much and worked so hard, as  well as every Member of this House who helped make this opportunity  real for the American people.   I also want to say how grateful I am to everyone at the nonpartisan  Joint Committee on Taxation and the House Office of the Legislative  Counsel. Their careful analysis contributed so much to this bill.   Finally, I want to give special recognition to Barbara Angus, the  chief tax counsel on the Ways and Means Committee, and all of our staff  on the committee, who put their hearts and their souls and many  sleepiness nights in the development of this bill. I can't thank them  enough for their hard work and dedication.   Mr. Speaker, the House of Representatives is, by its very design, the  Chamber of Congress closest to the American people. Today, this House-- the people's House--will pass historic legislation to improve the lives  of Americans nationwide.   For too long, this broken Tax Code has put the needs of the people  second, propping up Washington's special interests at the expense of  hardworking Americans.   For too long, this broken Tax Code has rewarded companies for  outsourcing American jobs instead of encouraging them to create jobs  here at home.   For too long, this broken Tax Code has eroded America's economic  leadership around the world.   This country used to be the standard-bearer worldwide for competitive  tax systems. Not anymore. Now the United States is barely a spec in the  rearview mirrors of so many of our international competitors.   In our businesses, our workers, our Made in America products, which  are the best in the world, are bearing the consequences of Washington's  failure to act. That stops now, and it stops with the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act.   With this historic bill, we will provide real simplicity for every  taxpayer, we will deliver real fairness to every hardworking American,  we will be more competitive than ever, we will win worldwide and here  at home, and we will see better jobs and bigger paychecks in every  community of this great Nation so people can keep more of their hard- earned dollars.   With this bill, we will deliver a new Tax Code built for a new era of  American prosperity.   So to Washington's special interests, who are now being propped up by  absurd carve-outs and loopholes, get ready to stand on your own. To our  international competitors, who are now leading the pack, get ready to  have some company. To the American people, who have waited years for  tax reform, get ready for the tax relief you deserve.   Today, this House--the people's House--is taking action on the most  transformational tax overhaul in a generation, and we are taking action  today. It is time for this old, broken Tax Code to go. It is time to  put the American people first.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), our majority whip and a tremendous leader  on tax reform.                                time  1245     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from California (Mr. McCarthy), our majority leader and a champion for  tax reform.   Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I want to thank the gentleman. I want to  thank him for all those Americans out there who have waited decades for  this, for the hours that he has listened, for the numerous hearings he  has gone through to get us to this day.   Mr. Speaker, I stand before this body, but I want to speak to the  people watching us at home right now and who will hear us in the hours  and days to come. I want to speak to the people who stretch their  budgets to get to the next paycheck. I want to speak to the people who  are starting to wonder if the American promise no longer applies to  them.   You need a comeback. America needs a comeback.   If we are successful today and in the weeks to come, you will keep  more of the money that you earned. You will have more in your paycheck.  Your life will improve. If we succeed, you will succeed, but if the  leaders and obstructionists on the other side of the aisle win, you  will lose. You see, they want Washington insiders and bureaucrats to  keep more of your hard-earned income. They think it is theirs to spend.  We think it is yours.   Now, I have tried my best to understand their opposition, and I have  listened to the pessimistic leaders of a party that once upon a time  claimed they stood for the common man.   Without a shred of evidence, they are certain our plan won't work.  They drum up a stale argument from 30 years ago, saying all this bill  does is help the rich. They call it a middle class tax hike.   That same paper our colleague just held also has fact checkers, but  the fact checkers gave them not one, not two, not even three, but the  most Pinocchios you can give, four, for that lie.   Every honest person sees this as a tax cut for hardworking Americans.  This bill increases the child tax credit, increases the standard  deduction, increases wages, and is already bringing back jobs to  America.   The fact is the first $55,000 an average family of four earns will  not face a single penny of income tax, not a single penny.   So what are these party leaders defending by their opposition?   It is not the people. After all, there is not a single person I have  ever met in this Nation who wants higher rates, lower wages, fewer  jobs, and a more complicated Tax Code. No, they aren't defending the  people.   They are defending loopholes for the special interests, corporate  welfare, and carve-outs for lobbyists. They are defending the abusive  tactics of the status quo at the IRS.   You know what I find most absurd? They are defending the reckless  tax-and-spend policies of broken States across this country. They have  made it their mission to increase taxes on our fellow citizens. My  friends on the other side of the aisle have the audacity to call this a  tax increase. In the end, they are defending a broken status quo.   You know what I think, Mr. Speaker? I think that voting ``no'' on a  plan with lower taxes, higher wages, more jobs, and a simpler system,  that isn't about Republicans and Democrats. Voting ``no'' is telling  the American people you do not have faith in them to rise if they are  given a fair shot.   Mr. Speaker, I have a simple question for this House and for everyone  who is watching at home: Do you want higher taxes and less money in  your pockets or do you want lower taxes and more money?   I think we have sent a message to the doubters and the critics. The  American people do not want hard work to be punished. We do not accept  decline. We do not accept that Washington knows how to spend our money  better than we do.   I have a different message for the American people: To those trying  to find a job, that long search is coming to an end. This is your  comeback.   To those sick of just getting by and fighting for a raise, this is  your comeback.   To those struggling to keep your small business afloat, to pay your  employees, to help your neighborhood, this is your comeback.                                time  1300    To every American who ever dreamed of being an entrepreneur and  owning a small business, this is your comeback.   To every mother and father starting a family, raising your kids, and  trying to give them more of an opportunity than you ever had, this is  your comeback.   Now, I put hope in the American people. This bill puts hope in our  American people because we trust the people. That is the start of  America's comeback.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair reminds all Members to address  their remarks to the Chair and not to a perceived viewing audience.    Mr. Speaker, no one man has plowed the field for  tax reform for more years, more boldly, or more effectively than the  Speaker of the House.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Ryan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
