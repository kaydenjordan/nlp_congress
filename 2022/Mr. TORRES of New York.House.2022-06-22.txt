 Madam Speaker, I am proud to be a gay man in  Congress. I stand here as living proof that the long arc of history  bends toward LGBTQ equality.   I am the first Latino and Black LGBTQ Member of Congress, and I  proudly serve as vice chair of the Homeland Security Committee.   Back in the 1950s, President Eisenhower issued an executive order  declaring people like me to be a threat to homeland security. Out of  his executive order came the ``lavender scare,'' the systematic purge  of gay people from the ranks of Federal employment.   So the LGBTQ experience in America is as much about pain as it is  about pride. We have seen the lives and livelihoods of untold numbers  of people ravaged by homophobia.   I wish to speak about one of those people, Walter Jenkins, who served  honorably during the Johnson administration, in a time of national  turmoil, only to have his brilliant career cut short by homophobia.   On October 15, 1964, a columnist named William White wrote a tribute  to Mr. Jenkins. It was so poignantly and eloquently written that it  bears reading on the House floor, and so read it, I will.                                time  1930    The title is, ``A Graveyard Marked Despair.''         A human tragedy of measureless pathos, a tragedy to tear       the heart as few things have ever done in my 50-odd years of       rather urgent living is the story of Walter Jenkins.        It is too early to say what effects there may be from       Jenkins' resignation, as one of the special White House       assistants, in dreadful circumstances involving his arrest on       disorderly conduct charges. Nor does this columnist now       concern himself in the slightest way with this question. When       one sees a friend bury a lost career, common humanity       requires at least a brief wait at a graveside marked despair       before reckoning up who else has gained or lost what.        The present purpose has nothing to do with partisanship or       even with politics in general. It is simply to stand as a       human being with Walter Jenkins, to make one man's testimony       to Walter Jenkins, in an hour for him and his wife and his       six children of a sorrow and horror that has come to few even       in the harsh profession to which he has given his life.        I have just come from the hospital room of Walter Jenkins.       It is a scene that will burn forever in the memory of one       whose own profession as a correspondent has caused him to see       much of human suffering--the death of so many in battle, the       death of hope for so many others.        Walter Jenkins I have known for 20 years. Walter Jenkins I       saluted in print when he became President Johnson's assistant       upon Mr. Johnson's accession to the White House after another       tragedy just short of 12 months ago. I said then of Walter       Jenkins that he was one of the most honorable, most       conscientious, and most truly moral men I ever knew. I repeat       the statement today--every word of it.        For the Walter Jenkins I now see in this time of trouble is       a Walter Jenkins broken at last under the terrible pressures       it has been my sad lot to observe in life. I do not know       precisely what in this shattered state he may have done or       not done. I have not asked him; and I do not intend to ask       him.        But this I do know if I have any human judgment at all:       Here is a man long suffering from combat fatigue as surely as       any man ever suffered in battle; and of that kind of combat       fatigue I have seen plenty, too. At the hospital I told this       to his doctor. The doctor replied softly, ``Yes, you are       right. Except that for this kind of combat fatigue, they give       no medals.''        When President Johnson came to power, in a frightened and       divided Nation, suffering the shock of the assassination of       John F. Kennedy, he put all his enormous heart and energies       into reuniting the Nation and keeping its ancient institution       going on, levelly and unafraid. So did Walter Jenkins to the       last extent of his own talents and his own strength.        It was not easy for any of the Johnson people. They had       their sophisticated sniping detractors--behind their backs       within the Democratic Party as well as in front of them among       their natural and proper Republican opposition. Jenkins       became, next to the  [[Page H5815]]       President himself, the chief whipping boy. Totally dedicated,       tolerant and forgiving beyond ready belief, he patiently       worked his 15-hour day, his 7-day week, while the biters       bit--and bit and bit--at him.        As month after month wore on, Jenkins developed a red and       frightening flush that told even a layman of a dangerously       high blood pressure. But, like the President, he never called       for either the medic or the chaplain, as they used to say in       the Army. There was work to be done--and for at least 15       years--long before the White House days--he had worked far       too hard.        Finally, he reached that point of utter physical and       nervous and emotional exhaustion which will at the end, break       any man of any size. So now he is broken. So now they say       this and that of him. But the actions--actual or only       alleged, true or trumped up--of men broken in battle are not       held against them by civilized men.        So, there is, at last, this to say. For 46 years Walter       Jenkins has lived a life of decency, of high public service,       of courage, of honor and devotion. If there has in fact been       a slip, it has not been from the real, the true, Walter       Jenkins. It has been from the shattered man--the man who has       known no rest but now must have rest to regain his true self.        Let he who wishes cast the first stone. But any man who       tries to make capital of this man's tragedy will forever       lessen himself in the eyes of a judgment that is infinitely       more important than a mere political judgment--the judgment       of decent humankind.
