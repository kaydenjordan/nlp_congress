 Mr. Speaker, the other side, respectfully, Republicans,  created a once-in-a-century crisis, once in a century. They are holding  this sham debate to distract us.   In 2021, Democrats passed the American Rescue Plan. It had a very  strong fraud protection section. I hope you read it. Our unemployment  aid was a gigantic success, by the way. It kept families together and  it saved lives.   Republicans claim to care about misuse, but when we passed real fraud  protections, every single one of you voted ``no.'' That is the record.  It is clear.   House Republicans are harboring a disgraced fraudster who was just  arrested on unemployment fraud. You cannot make this up.   We are prosecuting fraud. States recovered over $100 million.  Enforcement is working. This is not about fraud or about saving money.    Mr. Speaker, you took the rest of my time.    Sir, you took the rest of my time.
