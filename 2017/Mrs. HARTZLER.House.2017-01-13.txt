 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as an advocate for the  United States military and the selfless men and women who fill its  ranks.   While I fully appreciate the points that my colleagues are making,  this is an extraordinary time as we consider this legislation and an  extraordinary man about whom we are talking.   In just 1 week, our Nation will have its new President. Precedent  tells us  [[Page H525]]  that we should also have the President's Secretary of Defense to step  in and assume control of the Department of Defense that day, as well.  Our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines must have their  organization's leader in position. That clear and steady leadership is  crucial when lives are on the line.   The state of our military's readiness, under the current  administration, also merits mentioning within this discussion. Troop  OPTEMPO rates are dangerously high and retention rate is low. Our  aircraft are unreliably old and many maintainers are inexperienced and  new. Never before have there been such extraordinary challenges to the  manning, training, and equipping of our forces with limited resources.   We ask our troops to stand ready to and actively fight against a  resurgent Russia, emergent China, unstable North Korea, unpredictable  Iran, and widespread violent terrorism. Never before has there been  such an extraordinary demand on our men and women in uniform.   These are extraordinary times with extraordinary circumstances.  General Mattis is the extraordinary man who will lead the Department of  Defense in the direction it so desperately needs.   For this reason, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this  measure.
