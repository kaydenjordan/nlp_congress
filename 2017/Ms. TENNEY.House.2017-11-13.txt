 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Winfield Scott  Jones, affectionately known as Bud, a respected constituent of the 22nd  Congressional District, who dedicated his life to improving our  community.   After graduating from Syracuse University in 1963, Bud Jones worked  as a physical education teacher at Pulaski High School for 33 years.  During his tenure, Bud also served as the track and field coach and the  basketball coach. Bud was named New York State Coach of the Year and  was inducted into the Central New York High School Basketball Hall of  Fame.   Bud Jones was a shining example of the tremendous impact that one  individual can have on an entire community. He was a gracious leader  and a positive influence on the young men and women he taught and  coached, always motivating them to strive for excellence.   Winfield Scott Jones, affectionately known by all of us as Bud,  passed away peacefully on November 4, 2017. It is with sadness that we  mourn his passing, and we extend our condolences to his beloved family.   We know that his spirit will live on in all those who had the  privilege of knowing him. Our community is forever grateful for his  service and profound impact on all of us.                            ____________________
