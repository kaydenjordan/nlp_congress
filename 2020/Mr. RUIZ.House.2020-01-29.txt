 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address one of the most  pressing health threats facing veterans across this Nation: exposure to  burn pits.   Burn pits are literal pits, sometimes 10 acres large, used by the  military to burn trash, medical waste, jet fuel, batteries, even human  waste. As you might imagine, this creates large plumes of toxic black  smoke, which can have terrible health effects for anyone exposed.   Our servicemembers and veterans who were exposed to burn pits are  developing severe, debilitating pulmonary diseases like pulmonary  fibrosis and constricted bronchiolitis, leaving them oxygen dependent.  And young veterans are dying from rare cancers of the brain, pancreas,  blood cells, and other organs.   This means that many of our servicemembers survived the battlefield  but only become delayed casualties of war at home, dying due to lung  and pulmonary illnesses, from cancers, from autoimmune diseases from  their burn pit exposures.   If we don't act now, they will be resigned to the same fate as our  Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange, who waited up to 30 years to  get the help they needed. For many, it was too late.   Our veterans cannot wait. It is my objective to end the use of toxic  military burn pits once and for all and give servicemembers and  veterans the care they need. That is why, today, I urge a vote on two  bills that would go a long way to address this critically important  issue:   H.R. 4574, the Veterans' Right to Breathe Act, which would establish  presumption of service-connected exposure to burn pits for nine  evidence-based pulmonary diseases, including chronic bronchiolitis and  others; and   H.R. 4137, the Jennifer Kepner HOPE Act, which would make veterans  exposed to burn pits eligible for low-cost healthcare through the  Priority Group 6 under the Veterans Health Administration.                                time  1015    These bills are part of the comprehensive plan to end the use of burn  pits, educate physicians and veterans on their health effects, get  veterans and servicemembers exposed to burn pits the healthcare and  benefits they need, and continue research to fully understand the  health impacts posed by burn pits.   We cannot let burn pit exposure become this generation's Agent  Orange. We must act now for veterans and for their families.                          CBP Directive Falls Short     Mr. Speaker, I rise today because children and families in  CBP custody continue to be without basic humanitarian standards of  care.   Late last year, Customs and Border Protection put out a directive  outlining its ``enhanced medical support efforts,'' with the objective  of mitigating risks for people in CPB custody along the southwest  border. But their directive for addressing medical needs falls short of  even basic humane treatment to prevent the heartbreaking conditions I  saw when I visited the southern border: people piled on top of each  other in cold, windowless, concrete rooms, crowded with so many bodies  you couldn't even see the floor; open toilets in crowded cells; and  visibly sick children coughing on one another.   The conditions I witnessed were inhumane and inconsistent with our  American values and our moral conscience, and the CBP directive does  nothing to address them.   The directive does not include, for example, pregnant women, the  elderly, or disabled individuals as vulnerable populations who need  priority screening. The CBP medical directive does not address  humanitarian standards for water, sanitation, hygiene, shelter, or food  and nutrition, nor does it even set standards for private, safe, clean,  and reliable toilets with proper waste disposal.   Last year, I wrote the House-passed H.R. 3239, the Humanitarian  Standards for Individuals in CBP Custody Act. This bill sets basic  public health standards for people in CBP's care, such as health  screening priorities, nutrition, food standards, water, sanitation,  hygiene, and reporting requirements. It makes sure individuals have  essentials, such as toothbrushes, diapers, and baby formula.   Because this bipartisan bill was blocked from consideration in the  Senate, these standards of care for children and families are not  currently law, and the recent CBP medical directive falls short. It  fails to outline proper humanitarian standards of care.   This is why the Senate must take up and pass the bipartisan bill, the  Humanitarian Standards for Individuals in CBP Custody Act, to ensure  CBP's treatment of children and families is consistent with our  American values and the principles of basic human dignity and prevent  children from dying under the custody and responsibility of CBP.                            ____________________
