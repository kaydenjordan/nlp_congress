 Mr. President, today, I wish to recognize and honor the  extraordinary service and sacrifice of Fort Wayne Police officer David  Tinsley. His life was characterized by humility, selflessness, and  commitment to his community.   Born in Bloomington, IN, David graduated from Owen Valley High School  in Spencer in 1986 before going on to earn a bachelor's degree from  Ball State University. In 2002, David began his work as a police  officer in Fort Wayne, receiving his southeast division second shift  assignment shortly thereafter. In 2005, David switched to the overnight  shift, continuing his law enforcement service. For 16 years, David  valiantly put his life on the line as a member of the Fort Wayne Police  Department to protect those in the Fort Wayne community.   David is remembered fondly by his fellow officers. Fort Wayne Police  Chief Steve Reed called him a ``cop's cop'' and, at David's funeral,  told the many people gathered that David was looked up to by those in  the department. Pastor Thomas Eggold recognized David's selflessness,  his willingness to sacrifice his time and be of assistance. Pastor  Eggold also called David quiet and soft-spoken, a sincere and humble  man of God. David's friends knew him as caring and compassionate, a  loyal and genuine friend, but also as a tough and courageous man. He  enjoyed music and was taking lessons to learn to play the bagpipes.   On Monday, September 10, 2018, David and an officer in training began  pursuing what appeared to be a stolen vehicle. Eventually, the pair got  out of the car and, with a police canine, searched the area on foot  before arresting the suspect. On the way back to the squad car, David  collapsed, suffering a heart attack, and died shortly thereafter.   Known to be a loyal and loving father and husband who cared immensely  for his family and beloved by many, David is survived by his wife  Kristina Tinsley; his children, Tyler, Ian, and Lexie; parents Albert  and Bonnie Tinsley; siblings, Albert, Lane, and Scott; and many other  relatives and friends.   Through his work as a Fort Wayne Police Department officer, David put  the safety and well-being of his fellow Hoosiers above his own every  day. He exemplified the very best of Hoosier values, and the Fort Wayne  community is eternally grateful for his years of service keeping it  safe. Let us honor the legacy he left for us and strive to emulate his  commitment to serving his fellow citizens.                            ____________________
