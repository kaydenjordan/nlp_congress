 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   As the Representative of Hampton Roads, Virginia, I support the  significant increase in Navy shipbuilding in the NDAA. But while we  consider national defense, we must also consider school construction.   Yesterday, U.S. banks reported $56 billion in first quarter profits.  At the same time, our teachers are being forced to go on strike for a  living wage and adequate funding for our public schools. But when the  majority pushed its tax bill through Congress, it was the banks, not  teachers and not the schools, that received the biggest benefit.   H.R. 2475, the Rebuild America's Schools Act, would be a step forward  in correcting our priorities by investing desperately needed funding  into our public school infrastructure. This $100 billion proposal,  which is barely 5 percent of what was spent on the tax cut for  corporations and the wealthiest Americans, would go towards repairing  crumbling public school buildings to ensure that every student has  access to safe, healthy, and high-quality learning facilities.   Not only would this proposal improve school conditions and student  academic outcomes, it would create jobs. Research from the Economic  Policy Institute shows that for every $1 billion invested in school  construction, 18,000 jobs are created. Therefore, a $100 billion  Federal investment translates into about 1.8 million new jobs over the  next decade. That is many times more than are projected from the $1.5  trillion tax cut.   Last week, we honored the 64th anniversary of the Supreme Court  landmark ruling in Brown v. Board of Education that found separate is  inherently unequal and ordered public education to integrate to provide  equitable learning opportunities for all.   Now, how can we now say that we followed the order in Brown when,  just this winter, public schools in Baltimore were forced to close  because they didn't have heat? And how could we justify handing a  massive tax cut to the wealthy and corporations while abandoning  students and educators in public schools across the country? The answer  is we can't.   The Rebuild America's Schools Act would put us on a path to give  students the safe and high-quality education they deserve, and I  strongly urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                                time  1300
