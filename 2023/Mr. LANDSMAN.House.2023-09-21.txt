 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor our guest chaplain,  Bishop Michael E. Dantley of Christ Emmanuel Christian Fellowship in  the neighborhood of Walnut Hills in the city of Cincinnati.   Bishop Dantley has been the senior pastor of Christ Emmanuel for over  40 years, almost 50 years. He has worked to establish a grade school  and built a program for the homeless, formerly incarcerated, and men  battling addiction.   He has been honored by numerous community groups, including the Urban  League of Greater Southwestern Ohio, and uplifts his congregation with  messages of hope and healing every week.   As you heard today, he invokes action--to act for the good of our  neighbors, especially the least of these.   Bishop Dantley has been a guide and source of strength for me,  inspiring me to act even when I wasn't sure I could and to act in  service of those I represent, especially those most marginalized.   I thank Bishop Dantley not just for joining me today but for his  decades of service to our community and our country.                            ____________________
