 Madam Speaker, it is very interesting to hear the  socialistic left Democrats that have a newfound appreciation for the  Constitution and our Founders' principles. Would that those same  socialists, Madam Speaker, afford unborn babies the right to life,  liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, as well.   Madam Speaker, history tells us, in the first three impeachments in  this country, crimes were involved. Johnson violated a law that  Congress had just passed, over his veto. Nixon was involved in a  coverup in Watergate. Clinton lied to a Federal grand jury and expected  Monica Lewinsky to falsify an affidavit. Crimes, all instances of  crimes.   Now come the socialistic-leaning D's, in my opinion, Madam Speaker,  ostensibly reading the President's mind, knowing what his intent was,  and dictating to us and the witnesses that were in the hearings what  his mindset was. Quite frankly, they didn't believe that he had the  right to be in charge of foreign policy.   We heard Ambassadors, and, yes, we heard career bureaucrats, career  diplomats, whatever you want to call them. They get to ride the bus;  they don't get to drive the bus. The President is in charge of foreign  policy.    They said that the President had the audacity to use his judgment on  foreign policy instead of theirs. Opinions. Opinions. Suppositions,  indeed. The very swamp he is draining is objecting. Who knew?   Today, now, during the earlier rule debate, comes the floor manager  of the other side from Massachusetts citing not facts, nor fact  witnesses, but newspaper articles from CNN and USA Today, opinions and  editorials.   Unbelievable, Madam Speaker. Americans are watching. The D's are  delusional, deleterious, delirious, and in deep yogurt.  [[Page H12167]]
