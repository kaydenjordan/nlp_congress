 Madam Speaker, this week marks the ninth annual National  Apprenticeship Week, a time when we can give our Nation's workforce  development programs their annual physical.   Right now, there are more than 6 million Americans who are unemployed  and more than 9 million job openings in our country. That is a real  problem, Madam Speaker, and it is because the education-to-work  pipeline is clearly fractured.   I have said time and time again that we need to promote workforce  development programs that actually work. Let employers be the ones to  lead the way on this front. Let free market solutions lead the way, as  well.   Madam Speaker, earn-and-learn programs offer workers a viable path to  pursue the American Dream on their own terms. We should do everything  we can to support them.                            ____________________
