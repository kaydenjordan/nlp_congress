 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Inventor  Diversity for Economic Advancement Act of 2021. I thank my colleague  from North Carolina, Senator Tillis, for working with me on this  important piece of legislation, which serves as a first step to closing  the diversity gap in our patent system by collecting demographic data  on patent applicants.   Women and racial minorities have made some of the most significant  inventions in this Nation's history. The $75 billion home security  industry grew from an initial home security system invented by Marie  Van Brittan Brown. The computer would never have become the multimedia  device it is today without the microcomputer system invented by Mark  Dean. The genetic revolution would still be science fiction if not for  the CRISPR gene-editing tool discovered by Jennifer Doudna--raised on  Hawaii's Big Island.   We should celebrate these inventors and the many others like them who  have contributed to innovation in this Nation. But we must also  recognize the hard truth that women, racial minorities, and many other  groups are greatly underrepresented in the U.S. patent system.   The Patent and Trademark Office's recent report on women inventors  shines a spotlight on one part of this problem. The PTO found that only  22 percent of U.S. patents list a woman as an inventor and that women  make up only 13 percent of all inventors. This is true even though  women held 43 percent of all full-time jobs in 2016 and 28 percent of  STEM jobs in 2015.   Other reports highlight racial patent gaps. For example, a report by  the Institute for Women's Policy Research found that the percentage of  African American and Hispanic college graduates who hold patents is  approximately half that of their white counterparts.   Closing these gaps would turbocharge our economy. According to a  study by Michigan State University Professor Lisa Cook, including more  women and African Americans in the ``initial stage of the process of  innovation'' could increase GDP by as much as $640 billion.  [[Page S1426]]  Another study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that  eliminating the patent gap for women with science and engineering  degrees alone would increase GDP by over $500 billion.   It's simply good policy and good business to want to fully integrate  people of all types into our innovation economy. But if we have any  hope of closing the various patent gaps, we must first get a firm grasp  on the scope of the problem.   Studies of the demographic makeup of patentees, like the ones I  described, are few and far between. The reason is a simple one. A lack  of data. The PTO does not collect any data on applicants beyond their  first and last names and city, State, and country of residence. As a  result, those wishing to study patent gaps between different  demographic groups are forced to guess the gender of an applicant based  on his or her name, determine the race of an applicant by cross- referencing census data, or explore a number of other options that are  time-consuming, unreliable, or both.   The IDEA Act solves this problem. It would require the PTO to collect  demographic data--including gender, race, and military or veteran  status--from patent applicants on a voluntary basis. It would further  require the PTO to issue reports on the data collected and, perhaps  more importantly, make the data available to the public with  appropriate protections for personally identifiable information.  Outside researchers could therefore conduct their own analyses and  offer insights into the various patent gaps in our society.   Let me be clear. Closing the information gap facing researchers alone  will not solve the patent gap facing women, racial minorities, and so  many others. But it is a critical first step. I therefore encourage my  colleagues to support the IDEA Act.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Lankford):   S. 644. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to  restore State authority to waive for certain facilities the 35-mile  rule for designating critical access hospitals under the Medicare  program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.
