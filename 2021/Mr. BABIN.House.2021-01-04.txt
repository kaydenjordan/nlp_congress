 Madam Speaker, I rise today in my opposition to the  Democrats' Rules Package for the 117th Congress.   In the November 2020 House elections, many of the moderate voices in  the Democratic Caucus were ousted in favor of Conservative values.   Now free of moderate or reasonable voices, the shrill progressives  seized the opportunity to make their party even more radical--this  Rules package is proof.   They're attacking the First Amendment by changing our use of gender  specific pronouns--even ending prayers with ``Amen and Awomen''.   They're eliminating the minority's ability to amend legislation-- something Congress has allowed for more than 100 years--because they're  embarrassed when their own members publicly join Republicans to rein in  their laughable, tone-deaf policies.   These changes are not about fairness or good governance. They're  about saving their own members from tough votes and accountability.   I urge my colleagues to reject this.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Cole is as follows:      Amendment to House Resolution 8 Offered By Mr. Cole of Oklahoma         Strike Section 2(s).
