 Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute  to Sergeant Joseph Richard III, a Louisiana native who gave his life  fighting for our country during a third tour in Iraq in his 5 years of  U.S. military service.   Sergeant Richard was deeply devoted to his family and his country. He  was a loving husband, son, brother, and uncle who dedicated much of his  life to ensuring his loved ones--and every single one of us--were able  to enjoy the many freedoms we too often take for granted.   Sergeant Richard was the recipient of 12 distinguished service  medals, including the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart.   He made the ultimate sacrifice on the battlefield fighting against  one of our Nation's fiercest enemies, and, for that, he will never be  forgotten.   In fact, his parents, Joe and Elaine Richard, were both here in D.C.  with us last week to memorialize forever their son's sacrifice in the  Library of Congress' Veterans History Project.   I take this moment to extend my sincerest and deepest appreciation to  them and the countless others whose lives were blessed by Sergeant  Richard. No one understands the true life of freedom more deeply.   I pray that God's grace continues to comfort them, and I thank them  for their service and sacrifices over the many years. We know our  soldiers don't serve alone.   Mr. and Mrs. Richard, thank you for raising a hero. We will also work  hard here in Congress to honor your sacrifice and the sacrifices all of  our soldiers make.                            ____________________
