 Madam Speaker, I thank my most capable and socially aware  counsel to my subcommittee, the Subcommittee on Constitution, Civil  Rights, and Civil Liberties, who brought this issue to my attention  long before the tragedy in Atlanta, the attacks that have been launched  upon people of Asian-American descent in New York, California, and  other places in this Nation.   We held a hearing after the awful attacks in Atlanta, but it was  because of the earlier attacks and the fact that attacks on any  Americans because of their racial or national background is totally  improper and wrong. Religion, race, national origin should not be a  basis for any discrimination.   I am pleased that these bills are being offered, that they are going  to pass this House, and that, hopefully, they will pass the Senate. The  reportage will be better, enforcement will be better, and maybe we will  see an end to this intolerance.
