 Mr. President, when a police officer is shot in the line of  duty and survives, every fellow officer breathes a sigh of relief and  offers a silent prayer of thanks because they know that such a risk  exists each time they put on their uniform and begin another day on the  job.   Today, I want to recognize a member of the Lexington Police  Department, Officer Junior Pauleus, who was shot in the back at close  range on February 5, 2022, as he was conducting a routine investigation  with other members of the Lexington police force.   Officer Pauleus, only 28 years old, has an interesting and compelling  life story. He is a proud American, but not by birth. Originally from  Haiti, Officer Pauleus met his future wife, Audrey, while she was on a  mission trip. He eventually immigrated to the U.S. and became a  citizen. Now, settled and thriving with his young family in Kentucky,  he very recently joined the Lexington Police Department and was still  on field training officer status on that fateful Saturday in February  when he said his normal goodbyes to his wife and three children-- including his 5-day-old son--and started another shift.   Thankfully, this is a story with a happy ending, and we are grateful  for many things: for the fact that he and the officers with whom he was  working with are all safe following the shooting; for the discipline  and training on which they all rely; for the body armor that protected  him; and for all the men and women of his department who willingly  serve the Lexington community, even with the knowledge that, in an  instant, their own lives can be taken.   I am privileged to meet young men and women like Officer Pauleus each  time I travel to events throughout Kentucky. I am personally indebted  to them for their service, and I am honored to recognize one example  from among their ranks today.                            ____________________     Mr. President, too often, we hear an account of another  police officer in our Nation coming under attack while carrying out  their daily duties, protecting the citizens of their community. It is  important that we remember these sacrifices and the many dangers these  brave men and women face each day. The daily walk of an American law  enforcement officer is truly a walk of faith each day: faith in their  abilities obtained from countless hours of training, faith to face the  many dangers presented to them during their daily activities, faith in  the many friends and family members behind the scenes offering  supporting prayer and strength, and faith in knowing their job is a  calling to assist the many in their community seeking help in time of  need.   Today, I want to recognize a member of the Kentucky State Police,  Trooper Michael Sanguini, who was shot multiple times on January 28,  2022, while conducting a traffic stop in Harrison County. According to  the preliminary investigation, he was struck six times, of which three  shots were stopped by his ballistic vest. One shot struck his portable  radio, and another struck his issued taser, with one shot striking his  body. Thankfully, Trooper Sanguini suffered non-life-threatening  injuries. God clearly protected this young trooper.   Trooper Sanguini is a native of Bourbon County, KY, and a graduate of  Bourbon County High School. He then went on to Eastern Kentucky  University, graduating in 2019. Following his graduation from the  Kentucky State Police Academy in 2019, Trooper Sanguini was assigned to  the Dry Ridge Post. I am pleased to say that Trooper Sanguini remains a  viable part of the Kentucky State Police following this incident. I  wish Trooper Sanguini a full and speedy recovery from his injuries and  personally thank him for the dedication to his profession and his  willingness to risk everything for the protection of others.                            ____________________
