 Mr. Speaker, you can look back at history at  highway bills and infrastructure bills, and all of these bills passed  this House with strong bipartisan support. Seventy-five, 80 percent, 90  percent of the Members of Congress have supported these bills. You can  look back, Mr. Speaker. For decades this has happened.   Why is this bill moving in an entirely partisan manner? Why is there  not bipartisan support?   And the answer is really simple: Because this bill is not  infrastructure. It  [[Page H3510]]  is not solving road problems and traffic problems that are plaguing  this country.   What this bill does is it puts billions of dollars into things like  EV charging stations. So if you are an American that owns the 0.6  percent of vehicles out there that are electric vehicles--the majority  of which make over $160,000--the great news for you is you are going to  get billions of dollars in federally paid-for subsidized charging  stations.   The process needs to be fixed for delivering projects. This bill  doesn't do it.   Why is it we are building projects around the country that have been  around for decades?   It is because the process is flawed. It takes decades just to get a  project approved, but don't worry, Mr. Speaker, because this bill fixes  it for bus shelters.   This bill should be bipartisan, as has been done for decades. We need  real traffic solutions, real investments in infrastructure, and  unfortunately, this bill doesn't do it.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I actually want to repeat what the gentleman from  Pennsylvania just said: This bloc of amendments consists of 42  amendments.   All you Americans that are at home right now, your Member of Congress  that you elected to come up here to debate, to influence, to fix the  crisis we have in transportation and traffic right now, you get the  choice to either support or oppose 42 different amendments, some of  which may be good, some of which may be awful.   This is what democracy looks like right now under this Democrat  majority, where the individual Members of Congress aren't even allowed  to effectively represent their constituents.   This bill, including this amendment, simply adds more money to a bad  system. The average American, Mr. Speaker, all they need to do is think  about that road project, that traffic jam, they have in their  community. All this bill does is puts more money in that very system  that resulted in those problems in their community. It doesn't fix it.   In fact, it even diverts money from what should be infrastructure  into things that have absolutely nothing to do with infrastructure,  which, just to give an example of that, includes art. That is where  your transportation dollars are going, art infrastructure.   Mr. Speaker, this amendment is so fundamentally flawed, this process  is so fundamentally flawed, I urge rejection of this entire bloc.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.    Mr. Speaker, we have heard people talk about how this bill is going  to help address climate change, and we have heard people try to suggest  that our side doesn't care about it. The facts actually paint a very  different story.   My friends on the other side of the aisle came in and tried very hard  to force legislation that would mandate reductions in emissions in the  power sector. That was going to significantly drive up energy costs.  Thankfully, Congress didn't enact it.   But do you know what actually happened? By letting innovators  innovate, by Congress not coming in and forcing regulatory mandates and  forcing and choosing different types of energy technologies, the United  States has reduced emissions more than the next 12 emissions-reducing  countries combined.   Is it because of Congress' actions? No. It is because Americans are  innovative, and Americans innovated their way out of this. We have been  leading the world.   What this legislation does is it goes back, and it fails to learn  from the lessons of the past. It tries to force technologies.   Right now, electric vehicle sales represent 2 percent of sales.  Consumers don't want them.   In my home State, we drive pickup trucks and put our boats behind  them. But don't worry, because according to Car and Driver, you are  going to get to pull your boat 100 miles, and then you get to stop at a  charging station, paid for by this bill. You will then get to sit there  for 45 minutes, potentially get your truck up to 80 percent, and you  can maybe then drive another, I don't know, 70 miles or so. It is going  to be great.   This is crazy. This is absolutely crazy. Americans need traffic  solutions. We need traffic solutions. We had 325 amendments submitted  to this bill to try to improve it. Mr. Speaker, 149 of those were  accepted, and 105 of those were Democrat amendments, not even giving  Republican constituents across America the opportunity to be able to be  represented.   Mr. Speaker, I urge rejection of this partisan, failed process that,  for the first time in decades, has failed to yield a bipartisan bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I heard my friends talk about how it has been innovation  that has led us to emissions reductions. I find it fascinating and  certainly look forward to that discussion.   But, Mr. Speaker, right now, just a few months ago, the United States  was entirely energy independent. We produced all the resources that we  needed to power our economy and to power our transportation sector.   What this bill does is begins forcing everything, manipulating  markets in a direction that doesn't work.   Don't take my word for it. Let me give you examples about the State  of  [[Page H3531]]  California that has tried to do the very thing that this bill does. The  State of California currently has electricity prices that are twice  those of my home State.   I ask the American citizens, Mr. Speaker, which American is asking to  have their electricity bills doubled?   By the way, when you increase demand for electricity, the price goes  up even higher. When you try to electrify the entire vehicle fleet,  then prices go up.   Do you think they got a plan for this?   There is a study in this very amendment that tries to study how you  are going to incorporate vehicles into the energy and transportation  sector. They don't even know how they are going to do it, yet they are  charging ahead boldly under this en bloc amendment.   Another great one in here: During the committee process on this, I  offered an amendment, Mr. Speaker, to establish national centers of  resilience. I got a commitment from the chairman saying: Yes, we are  going to work with you on this.   They didn't work with us. But all of a sudden, when we filed our  amendment, that one is discarded, and one pops up from a Democrat  Member with our idea. It is now going to be in this en bloc for  consideration.   This whole process just doesn't reflect democracy. I can't say it  enough, Mr. Speaker: Decades and decades of bipartisan support, strong  support, representing the leadership on how you negotiate legislation  and bringing traffic solutions and transportation solutions to America.   In this case, there is no bipartisan support. This is a failed effort  that fails to address the needs of the American public. It diverts  funds that need to go to traffic solutions to things that, quite  frankly, are going to play into China's hands and cause the loss of  jobs. We need to be exporting American innovation, not exporting jobs  to China, as this bill does.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, but  being in opposition, I reserve the right to close.    Madam Speaker, recognizing that I have the  right to close, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I would like to start a  colloquy with the gentleman from Pennsylvania, who made a statement  about how our national labs innovated us into this emissions reduction  leadership role we play in the United States.   I ask the gentleman from Pennsylvania to explain to us about those  innovations and how that contributed to emissions reductions.   I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Lamb) for  the purpose of a colloquy.    Madam Speaker, reclaiming my time, I  couldn't have asked the gentleman to make my point any more than he  just did.   This bill attempts to force or manipulate markets in a direction that  is simply not consistent with the resources, the workforce of America.   The gentleman is exactly right. He is exactly right. It is our  natural gas revolution that has resulted in the United States leading  the world in reducing emissions. It is not a result of someone coming  in and forcing people to drive electric vehicles. It is not a result of  forcing people to put solar panels on their homes. That is not it. It  is the transition to natural gas.   As a matter of fact, the natural gas from the gentleman's home State,  according to the National Energy Technology Lab in the gentleman's home  State, has a 42 to 47 percent lower emissions profile than Russian gas,  which is effectively what this bill forces to happen, more dependence  on Russian gas.   A year ago, we imported zero barrels of Russian oil--zero--into the  United States. This month, we are on a trajectory to import 7 million  barrels, 7 million barrels of oil from Vladimir Putin. Thanks. This is  crazy.   This bill just continues building on that. I really don't understand,  Madam Speaker, what the gentleman is going to tell his own constituents  when they are no longer employed. Folks say: Hey, don't you worry. We  are going to get new clean energy jobs.   Madam Speaker, what has happened every single time we have developed  new technology that wasn't tied back to America's resources? China  steals the property. They steal the intellectual property. They steal  the inventions and sell it back to us at a cheaper price--by the way,  at the same time, causing greater environmental consequences using  child enslaved labor.   Madam Speaker, what I urge is, let's apply cancel culture to the  countries that my friends across the aisle are actually promoting right  now, to China and Russia.   Let me say this again. This bill attempts to take California's model  and apply it nationally, doubling the electricity prices in my home  State.   Guess which State had the eighth worst emissions growth in America?  Is it the State that carried all this out? No. It is California. Guess  which State is the most dependent State on foreign energy? It is  California.   I can't say it enough. We need to be exporting our innovation, not  exporting our jobs. This is a flawed bill. It is an entirely flawed  strategy that is being forced on American citizens under this  legislation. People have the option right now to buy electric vehicles,  and they are not doing it. It is 0.6 percent of the vehicles today.   Madam Speaker, I urge rejection of this amendment. I yield back the  balance of my time.                                time  1915     Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, traditionally what would happen in an amendment  grouping like this is that Republicans and Democrats would sit down and  decide which group of amendments everybody agrees on. There are  actually some really good amendments that are included in this en bloc,  some of which address some fundamental problems in our transportation  system.   For example, there is an amendment in here by Congresswoman Mace.  What that amendment does is after much research, the Department of  Transportation couldn't even tell us how much money is being invested  in roads and bridges. Couldn't even answer the question. Congressional  Research Service couldn't. Government Accountability Office couldn't.  We have tried for months to get an answer.   So this commission is a study to look at that, to give us feedback to  understand where the dollars are going to help inform us on how to do a  better job governing.   There is an amendment here that I want to say thanks to my friends  across the aisle for that has to do with the resilience of materials of  roads.   And again, there are good amendments, but, Madam Speaker, this is how  the process is supposed to work. We are supposed to sit down and try to  come to common ground and decide which amendments make sense and we all  agree on and help to expedite this entire process to go from 325  amendments, hopefully, to a much shorter number, not by having  unilateral control and someone unilaterally deciding they are going to  let these amendments go and these not and design a group of amendments  to intentionally fail, despite the fact that there is good policy.   So I will say it again, I think there are some good amendments in  here. I look forward to hearing from my colleagues about their  particular amendments and why they are good policy, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Pence), a leading member of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman an  additional 30 seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick), one of the hardest  working members on the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady), the leader of the Committee on Ways  and Means.    Madam Speaker, I have the right to close so  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I believe we have the right  to close, so I am going to reserve.    I am opposed to the amendment.    Madam Speaker, as I mentioned, there are a  number of amendments in here that I fully support. This whole process  is a flawed process.   I have heard the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) bring up the  coastal Louisiana and the loss of land. The ranking member of the  committee talked about the loss in coastal Louisiana, and it is  extraordinary.   We have lost 2,000 square miles of our coast. It is like taking the  State of Rhode Island and wiping it off the map, which is why I care so  much about this issue; and it is why I care that we actually provide  solutions, not rhetoric. And let me explain.   Madam Speaker, the dirty little secret that my friends across the  aisle will tell you is that the highly celebrated Paris accords that  they are all out there advocating for and saying this bill is going to  advance this Green New Deal and Paris accord commitments, the Paris  accord results in an increase in global emissions. that doesn't fix  what is going on in my home State. It doesn't do anything. It makes it  worse.    As a matter of fact, in negotiations, Secretary Kerry conducted-- allows China to increase emissions another 50 percent between now and  2030. China today emits more than every developed country combined.   So these are the people who we are being asked to trust what happens  to the people that I represent in coastal Louisiana?   Absolutely not.   Let me say it again. It is as a result of what we have done, as a  result of what innovators have done that have resulted in the greatest  reduction in emissions in world history. And don't take my word for it.  That is a quote from the IEA's executive director--International Energy  Agency's executive director.   Madam Speaker, these are flawed strategies. It is proven.   Who has cornered the market on rare earth and strategic minerals?   China has.   So who is going to be responsible for manufacturing the batteries?   China.   Who has made 80 percent of the global investment in battery  technology and in manufacturing?   China.   Madam Speaker, I represent people from America, and that is who I am  going to fight for. That is who I am going to defend. I am going to  defend our land and prevent it from eroding and disappearing because of  flawed policies. I am going to defend their tax dollars to prevent them  being wasted on things that clearly play into China's hands.   Madam Speaker, I can't say this enough. I want to export American  innovation or ingenuity, not our jobs, not our economy. This bill is  fundamentally flawed. And representing the greatest loss of coastal  wetlands in the United States, I won't stand for this type of behavior  that squanders dollars and actually exacerbates the problem of coastal  land lost and sustainability, and ecological productivity in my home  State.   Madam Speaker, I urge that we stop this; that we start this bill over  again; and as we have done for decades, that we come together in a  bipartisan process, just like I know my friend from Oregon would be  saying right now if roles were reversed.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
