 Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Iowa.    I send a question to the desk on behalf of myself,  Senators McConnell, Hoeven, and Wicker.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senator Grassley and the other Senators is  addressed to counsel for the President:         During President Clinton's impeachment trial, he argued       that ``no civil officer--no President, no judge, no cabinet       member--has ever been impeached by so narrow a margin . . .       [and] that the closeness and partisan division of the vote       reflected the constitutionally dubious nature of the charges       against him.'' President Trump has raised similar concerns       during these proceedings and argues that the lack of       bipartisan consensus highlights the partisan nature of the       charges. Are the President's concerns well-founded?     =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S722, January 30, 2020, third column, the following  appears: During President Clinton's impeachment trial, he argued  that ``no civil officer--no President, no judge, no cabinet  member--has ever been impeached by so narrow a margin . . . [and]  that the closeness and partisan division of the vote reflected the  constitutionally dubious nature of the charges'' against him.      The online Record has been corrected to read: During President  Clinton's impeachment trial, he argued that ``no civil officer--no  President, no judge, no cabinet member--has ever been impeached by  so narrow a margin . . . [and] that the closeness and partisan  division of the vote reflected the constitutionally dubious nature  of the charges against him.''    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, thank you for that  question.   I think the concerns are very well-founded. I think that they are  concerns that echo back to our founding, when Alexander Hamilton warned  in Federalist No. 65 precisely against partisan impeachments. A  partisan impeachment is one of the greatest dangers that the Framers  saw in the impeachment power. And in Federalist No. 65, Hamilton  specifically said that impeachments could become ``persecution of an  intemperate or designing majority in the House of Representatives,''  and that is what we have in this case.   In fact, there was bipartisan opposition to the Articles of  Impeachment here in the House. So this is one of the--it is the most  divisive sort of impeachment that could be brought here, and it  reflects very poorly on the process that was run in the House, which  had not had bipartisan support, and the charges that were ultimately  adopted in the House, because it is a purely partisan impeachment.   And I think that that is important to bear in mind also, that the  House managers themselves and some of the Members of this Chamber, at  the time of the Clinton impeachment, warned very eloquently against  partisan impeachments. They recognized that a partisan impeachment  would not be valid, that it would do grave damage to our political  community, to our polity, to the country. It would create deep  divisions  [[Page S723]]  that would last for years. And in the Clinton impeachment, they made  those warnings when it was not even arising in the context of an  election year.   Now we have a partisan impeachment--as we have pointed out--when  there is an election only 9 months away, and it will be perceived, and  is perceived by many in the country, as simply an attempt to interfere  with the election and to prevent the voters from having their choice of  who they want to be President for the next 4 years.   And the House managers have said: We can't allow the voters to decide  because we can't be sure it will be a fair election. That can't be the  way we approach democracy in the United States. We have to respect the  ability of the voters to take in information, because all the  information is out now. They have had plenty of opportunity, with the  process that they ran in the House, to make all the information public  that they want and to be able to make their accusations against the  President. We think they have been disapproved, and the voters should  be able to decide.   And the most important thing, the greatest danger from this partisan  impeachment, I believe, is the one that Minority Leader Schumer warned  about back in 1998, which is that, once we start down the road of  purely partisan impeachments, once we start to normalize that process  and make it all right to have a purely partisan impeachment, especially  in an election year, then we have just turned impeachment into a  partisan political tool, and it will be used again and again and again  and more frequently and more frequently. And that is not a process-- that is not a future--for the country that this Chamber should accept.   Instead, this Chamber should put an end to the growing pattern  towards partisan impeachments in this country, put an end to that  practice and definitively make clear that a purely partisan impeachment  not based on adequate charges, not based on charges that meet the  constitutional standard will not get any consideration in this Chamber  and will be rejected.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.
