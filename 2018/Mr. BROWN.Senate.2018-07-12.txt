 Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate Miss  Elsie Steward Young of Highland County, OH, on her 102nd birthday and  her recent induction into the Ohio Civil Rights Hall of Fame.   Miss Elsie is a legend in southwest Ohio and a lifelong fighter for  justice and opportunity for all Ohio children.   In 1954, after the Supreme Court issued its landmark Brown v. Board  of Education decision and ordered an end to segregation in America's  schools, the two all-White primary schools in Hillsboro, OH, refused to  integrate. The district continued to send Black students to the one  all-Black school, which was in shambles.   Miss Elsie and a group of mothers took matters into their own hands.  For 2-years, the ``Marching Mothers of Hillsboro'' walked to the town's  all-White primary schools every single day, just to be sent home, but  they continued to march and to show that they would not rest until  their children were given the quality education they were guaranteed  under the law. They joined with the NAACP to file a lawsuit against the  Hillsboro Board of Education, which made it all the way to the Supreme  Court--and they won.   Because of Miss Elsie and her fellow mothers' advocacy, the Court  ordered the schools to integrate, and paved the way for integration in  other Northern cities. Their activism is a reminder of what ordinary  citizens can achieve when they band together to fight for justice.   I am sure that my Senate colleagues join me in Honoring Miss Elsie  Steward Young for her service to justice and equality.                            ____________________
