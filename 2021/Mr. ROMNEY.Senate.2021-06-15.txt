 Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to the  esteemed legacy of Katherine and Bob Garff, two maveriks whose towering  achievements in business, politics, religion, and education will  continue to benefit Utahns for generations. The Salt Lake Chamber of  Commerce has recognized them with the presitigious and well-earned 42nd  Giant in our City award.  [[Page S4543]]    Bob and Kathi's lifetime commitment to service is aspirational for  all and worthy of the highest praise. Their community engagement  efforts over many decades have transformed the automobile industry,  expanded educational opportunities for young people with the Keys to  Success and Road to Success programs, and their support to the  University of Utah gave rise to new buildings for business education  and athletics. Bob and Kathi's legacy is deeply woven into Utah's  fabric of cherished values--prioritizing family, service, education,  and the welfare of our future generations.   The Garff family's vast impact on our State is, in part, due to their  willingness to serve in positions of leadership and public trust. Kathi  served as chair of the Utah State Board of Education and was a board  member for the Utah Board of Regents. She also guided education policy  on the University of Utah's National Advisory Council, served on the  board of the Crimson Club, and was chair of their President's Club.   Bob, too, donated his time to elevating health initiatives as a  member of the American Cancer Society and Intermountain Healthcare and  boosted Utah's athletic profile on the world stage as chairman of the  Board of Trustees of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the 2002  Olympic Winter Games. There, I witnessed firsthand Bob's talent for  complex problem solving and his compassionate and ethical leadership.  His accomplishments also include serving as chairman of the Salt Lake  Chamber of Commerce and the Deseret Book Company, a board member of  First Security Bank, a member of the Salt Lake Convention and Visitors  Bureau, and the Utah Commission on Volunteers. As the former speaker of  the House of Representatives for the State of Utah, Bob has cemented  his legacy of consequential public service for all time.   A celebration of Bob and Kathi Garff would be incomplete without  highlighting the significant role of faith in their lives, including  their shared commitment to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints. Over the years, Bob was called to serve as bishop, president of  the England Coventry Mission, stake president at the Univeristy of  Utah, and president of the Bountiful Temple. May his strong faith guide  Bob as we remember and cherish his time with us.   Kathi and Bob's selfless contributions to the welfare of our State  will endure through the ages, and Utahns will remember them for their  lifetime commitment to public service. Their 5 children, 21  grandchildren, and 4 great-grandchildren carry on the honorable  tradition of their beloved Bob and Kathi Garff.                            ____________________
