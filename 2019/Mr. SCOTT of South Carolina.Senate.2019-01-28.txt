 Mr. President, today I want to  recognize school bus driver Ms. Bernadine Reed, whose heroic actions  ensured the safety of 40 schoolchildren last week in Darlington County,  SC.   When a car ran into her stopped school bus on Tuesday, January 22 and  caused the bus to catch on fire, Ms. Reed took action to make sure each  and every child got off the bus safely and quickly. Because of her  leadership and quick action, no one on the bus was injured, although  the bus itself was consumed by flames minutes after the crash.   Although Ms. Reed had spent only 45 days on the job, the actions she  took in this scary situation ensured the complete safety of all 40 of  her schoolchildren. While she insists she is ``just a mother,'' Ms.  Reed certainly deserves the title of hero.   I would like to join in the rest of the Darlington community and the  State in recognizing her act of heroism and thanking her for assuring  the safety of her schoolchildren.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today it is my  pleasure to honor the Greenwood Index-Journal, a newspaper that is  celebrating 100 years in the Greenwood, SC, community.   Founded in February 1919, the Index-Journal started as an office  above a movie theatre and a printing press on a dirt floor. Although  much has changed 100 years later, the Index-Journal's commitment to  keeping the residents of Greenwood informed has not.   The Greenwood Index-Journal remains owned and operated by local  residents themselves, with family members of the original co-owners  still running the paper today. It is truly a paper run by the people,  for the people. The Index-Journal has remained vigilant in its coverage  of the Lakelands area, and continues to be a vital part of the  Greenwood community.   I congratulate all of the Index-Journal leadership and staff for 100  years of committed and meaningful journalism and look forward to their  presence in our State for years to come.                            ____________________
