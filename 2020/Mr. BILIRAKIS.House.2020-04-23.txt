 Madam Speaker, I appreciate the ranking member  yielding me the time.   Madam Speaker, since the establishment of the PPP, I have heard from  countless local, small businesses that the application process was  difficult to navigate. In response to these revelations, I submitted to  leadership a letter asking that any future funding for PPP loans  contain a set-aside for the truly small businesses, like the mom and  pops.   I was pleased to see this take its form in today's funding package  that sets aside funds for small community banks and credit unions,  which have a good track record working with our small businesses.   Madam Speaker, it would be a tragedy if we lost these mom-and-pop  businesses. I have a business in my district. It is Faklis' Department  Store and Shoe Repair. They have been around since 1912, Madam Speaker.  I don't want to see them go. The store was established by Greek  immigrants and passed on from generation to generation. It would be a  great tragedy if we lost them. They survived World War II, of course,  World War I, and the Great Depression. Let's save our small businesses.  They are the backbone of America.
