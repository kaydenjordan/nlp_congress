 Mr. President, I first would like to say I appreciate  the words of our leader, Senator Schumer, as well as Senator  McConnell's call for a higher calling.   January 6 is not typically a day of historical significance for our  country. For centuries, this day is simply the day that we receive each  State's certified electoral votes, and it has come and gone without  much fanfare.   In fact, this is only the third time in 120 years that the Senate has  gathered to debate an objection, and as Senator Cruz well knows, both  times these objections were resoundingly defeated. The last time the  vote was 74 to 1.   Why? Because Senators have long believed that they should not mess  around with the will of the people. They have understood the words of  our great former colleague John McCain from the State of Arizona, who  once said that nothing in life is more liberating than to fight for a  cause larger than yourself.   In this case, my colleagues, our cause, despite our political  differences, is to preserve our American democracy, to preserve our  Republic because, as someone once said long ago, it is a republic if  you can keep it.   Now, I appreciate all my Democratic and Republican colleagues who  have joined our ranks of coup fighters, who have stood up for our  democracy, who stand tall for our Republic, and who believe in an ideal  greater than ourselves, larger than our political parties. That ideal  is America.   And Senator Cruz, he knows this: On January 20, Joe Biden and Kamala  Harris will be sworn in as President and Vice President of the United  States. He knows that President-Elect Biden won more votes than any  President in history and more than 7 million more votes than President  Trump.   Despite the unfounded conspiracy theories Senator Cruz tells, he  knows that high-ranking officials in President Trump's own Homeland  Security Department have concluded that the 2020 election was ``the  most secure in American history.''   If he wants to improve the numbers in his own party that he just  mentioned of people believing in our elections, maybe he should start  consulting with them or maybe he should start consulting with former  Attorney General Barr, who said that he has found no evidence of  widespread fraud in the 2020 election.   We don't have to go back to 1877, my colleagues. Senator Cruz knows  that 80 judges, including conservative judges, including judges  confirmed in this Chamber, nominated by President Trump, have thrown  out these lawsuits, calling them baseless, inadequate, and contrary  both to the plain meaning of the constitutional text and common sense.   And he knows that all 10 living Defense Secretaries, including both  of Trump's Defense Secretaries--Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, William  Cohen--he knows that all of these leaders have come together to say  that these scurrilous attacks on our democracy must stop and we must  allow for a peaceful transition of power.   Senator Sinema will fill you in on the specific facts as to why this  election was sound and true in Arizona, but a summary: President Trump  received 1,661,686 votes in the State; President-Elect Biden won  1,672,143 votes, meaning that he won the State by 10,457 votes.   On November 30, after Arizona's Republican Governor, the secretary of  state, the attorney general, and the conservative chief justice of the  Arizona Supreme Court certified the results of the election, the  Governor actually said:         We do elections well here in Arizona. The system is strong.    Eight postelection lawsuits brought in Arizona to challenge the  results were dismissed by judges. Nine Members of the House from  Arizona were elected in the same election, including four Republicans.  Colleagues, I did not see Senator Cruz over at the swearing-in at the  House of Representatives last Sunday asking for an audit. He did not  stop their swearing-in because there was no fraud, and he did not ask  for an audit because we had a fair election.   I will end with this. My friend Roy Blunt, my fellow Rules Committee  leader, many years ago found a statue, a bust of a man at the top of a  bookcase. He did research. He went to the historians. All he could find  out was that no one knew who this guy was except that he was a cleric.  Hence, the statue is called ``The Unknown Cleric.''   Now, at the time, our leaders thought this man important enough that  they would warrant a statue for him, but today no one knows who he is.  Senator Blunt's message to schoolkids and Senators alike that visit his  office, when he shows them the statue: What we do here is more  important than who we are.   Senators, what matters is not our futures, not our own short-term  destinies.   What matters is our democracy's destiny because I think many of us  know people will not know who we are 100 years from now or 200 years  from now, but what they will know is this: They will know what we did  today, how we voted today. That is more important than who we are. It  is a Republic, if we can keep it.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.   The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority leader.
