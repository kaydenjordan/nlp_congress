 Mr. Chair, I thank Madam Chair for her exceptional work  on the SHIELD Act, which is long overdue.   For 2 years, our colleagues across the aisle had control over the  Judiciary Committee, the Rules Committee, and the House Administration  Committee. They had no hearings about the sweeping and systematic  campaign by the Russians to subvert and undermine our election.   The Democrats have brought forth the SHIELD Act. There is not a  single partisan word in this act. We hear our colleagues declaring it  is partisan. Name me one provision in this act that is partisan. There  is nothing partisan about it, except that their response to it is  partisan.   Now, some of our colleagues said that this is unconstitutional. A  takeover, a Federal takeover, I think we just heard the words uttered  by our distinguished colleague from Georgia.   Do you know who engineered the Federal takeover of the American  elections? The Founders of America did, the Framers of our  Constitution. In Article IV, they were the ones who said  [[Page H8413]]  that Congress may make or alter regulations governing the time, place,  and manner of elections for the House of Representatives and the U.S.  Senate.   It was the Framers of the Constitution who put in Article IV that  Congress must guarantee to the people of every State a republican form  of government.   So, this is in the Constitution. We are doing our job to protect our  elections, the sovereignty of our country, and the integrity of the  democracy against foreign attack.   We should all be together on it, and I deplore the partisan response  to this excellent legislation.
