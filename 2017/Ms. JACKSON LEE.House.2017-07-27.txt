 Mr. Speaker, one of my predecessors set the standard  for service to this Nation, among many, certainly--the Honorable Mickey  Leland and Craig Washington--but the Honorable Barbara Jordan served on  the Judiciary Committee. It was her standard during the Watergate  impeachment hearings that set the Nation afire about the relevancy of  the people's right to justice.   That is why I hold this Constitution in hand and rise to the floor  today to express my concern of the issues surrounding the Attorney  General and the potential firing of the special counsel, Mr. Mueller.   This book that has the Constitution in it guarantees three equal  branches of government. There is an orderliness to the responsibilities  of the Executive and of the United States Congress. We have oversight.   The people want answers regarding Russian collusion and the steering  of the election to one person over the other. Yes, they want jobs and  opportunities, but we have the opportunity--or the responsibility--to  clean our kitchen up.   I am very concerned about any executive, any Commander in Chief, who  would suggest, in violation of the Constitution, that they would fire  the Attorney General and then have the opportunity to ensure that the  special counsel was fired in contravention of the American people's  desires.   That is why I have introduced H. Res. 474, to cause this Congress to  disapprove of any firing of the special counsel and reckless pardons of  those who are under investigation.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me thank the  gentlewoman from New York for her consistent leadership. Being a  frequent visitor to the Rules Committee as a Member, I want to thank  the manager for the courtesies extended to all of us.   Let me say that I am a member of the Budget Committee, and I want to  associate my stance with the gentlewoman from New York. We do not have  a budget, but, in fact, the budget is not a roadmap that we are even  attempting to do. The budget was a slash and burn  [[Page H6484]]  of Medicare, Medicaid, only to give tax cuts, and it had no vision but  to plus-up the Defense Appropriations.   So now we come with a minibus that wants to do more damage. I have no  quarrel with my friend from Texas, but it is very clear that this  budget is based upon this wall, and this rule is based upon this wall.  It is important for the American people to know that, while we are  fighting for Medicaid and Meals on Wheels, better policing, and better  education for our children, the wall that was supposed to be paid for  by Mexico--let me say it again, the wall that was supposed to be paid  by Mexico, as evidenced by the Commander in Chief--is now, in this  rule, not for $100 million, not for $200 million, not for $50 million,  but for $1,571,239,000. That is what this rule is all about.   Frankly, I believe that this is a shame. Frankly, I oppose it because  the Commander in Chief swore that Mexico would pay for the wall. Now we  are paying for the wall, and, as indicated, a Member of Congress from  Texas who represents the area is adamantly against it. I would only  argue to say that there are other needs in this minibus that the  American people desire.   I also rise to express strong opposition to the fact that the Lee  amendments were not put in. Congresswoman Lee had an amendment for us  to debate the AUMF, two amendments, and those amendments were rejected.  Let us go back to regular order and pass appropriations for the  American people and debate whether we go to war. Going to war is a  point for the American people to hear and discuss.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to register my opposition to the exclusion from  H. Res. 478 of the amendments offered by colleague, Congresswoman  Barbara Lee of California.   This rule makes in order 54 amendments to Division A of H.R. 3219,  the Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2018 and an amendment by  Congressman Carter, the chairman of the Homeland Security  Appropriations Subcommittee, providing $1.57 billion in funding to  begin construction of the infamous ``Trump Border Wall'' that the  presidential candidate Trump promises, assured, and guaranteed American  and the would be paid for by Mexico.   Mr. Speaker, it is passing strange indeed that the Lee Amendments,  which were offered, debated, and approved in the regular order were  excluded from the rule while the Carter Amendment, which was introduced  at the 11th hour, was included.   Lee Amendment No. 95 would repeal the 2001 AUMF after 240 days of  enactment of this Act.   Lee Amendment No. 96 does not repeal the 2001 AUMF but would prohibit  the expenditure of any funds to implement, administer, or enforce the  2001 AUMF beginning 240 days of enactment of this Act.   They knew that the decision to go to war was too important to be left  to the whim of a single person, no matter how wise or well-informed he  or she might be.   Over the last 16 years, we have seen 3 Presidents use the 2001  Afghanistan AUMF as a blank check to engage in serious military action.   In 2016, the Congressional Research Service issued a report detailing  37 unclassified uses of this authorization in 14 countries, including  for operations at Guantanamo Bay, warrantless wiretapping, and recent  military action in Libya, Syria, Somalia, and Yemen.   The overly broad 2001 AUMF represents a critical deterioration of  Congressional oversight, which should be repealed, rather than repeated  with respect to North Korea.   As our brave service members are deployed around the world in combat  zones, Congress is missing in action.   As provided under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, absent a  Congressional declaration of war or authorization for the use of  military force, the President as Commander-in-Chief has constitutional  power to engage the U.S. armed forces in hostilities only in the case  of a national emergency created by an attack upon the United States,  its territories or possessions, or its armed forces.   As a co-equal branch of government, it is Congress's right and  responsibility to be fully consulted regarding any potential plans to  conduct military operations in foreign lands and to assess whether such  action is in the national security interest of the United States and  its allies, and to withhold or grant authorization for the use of  military force based on this assessment.   As we have learned from the painful and bitter experience of the past  16 years, at the initiation of hostilities, the costs in terms of blood  and treasure of U.S. military interventions abroad are often  underestimated and the benefits overstated.   For example, more than 6,800 American service members gave the last  full measure of devotion to their country on battlefields in  Afghanistan and Iraq, with hundreds of thousands more returning with  physical, emotional, or psychological wounds that may never heal.   The direct economic cost of the war in Afghanistan exceeds $1.07  trillion, including $773 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations  funds, an increase of $243 billion to the Department of Defense base  budget, and an increase of $54.2 billion to the Veterans Administration  budget to address the human costs of the military involvement in  Afghanistan.   I am confident that affording Members the opportunity to debate and  vote on the Lee Amendments would strengthen our democracy and help  restore Congress's preeminent constitutional role in the decision to  take the nation to war.   Mr. Speaker, I also rise in strong opposition to the Carter Amendment  to H.R. 3219, Department of Defense Appropriations Act for FY2018.   I oppose the amendment because it is ineffective, costly, and  wasteful legislation for three reasons: it is costly and ineffective;  President Trump broke his promise that Mexico would fund the wall; and  a policy shift of this magnitude requires regular order with the  Committees of Jurisdiction weighing in on the real cost to the American  people should a wall be built.   First, I oppose the Carter Amendment because it is costly and  ineffective.   It wastes $1.6 billion to build an unnecessary wall with our already  peaceful neighbors to the south.   Only $32 million dollars of that $1.6 billion would actually go  towards the wall.   That leaves over $1.5 billion simply wasted.   The wall throws away American taxpayers' money when it could and  should be spent on a number of necessary initiatives like education,  healthcare, transportation, infrastructure, or even military  preparedness.   Second, I oppose H.R. 3219 because Trump swore Mexico would pay for  the wall.   The President has broken his promise to the American people and is  asking American taxpayers to foot a $1.6 billion bill for a useless,  expensive wall.   No wonder the wall is strongly opposed by Democrats and many  Republicans.   There is no assurance that Americans would ever be reimbursed by  Mexico.   Trump's cost estimations do not include the cost of building in more  treacherous terrain, access roads, maintenance, or acquiring land in  Texas, where almost all border landholdings are privately held.   Building this wall would require stripping landholders in my very own  home state of Texas of their private land.   Instead of wasting $1.6 billion on building a wall, that money could  be appropriated to maintaining our effective border security and  immigration practices, like those currently in place for asylum  seekers.   The United States already enforces the most extensive immigration and  border security practices in the world. We have   This is a bad business deal for the American people.   Third, I oppose the Carter Amendment because it is represents a  policy shift that will have dire consequences for our economy that far  exceed the $50 billion estimated cost of this wall.   A policy shift of this magnitude requires regular order with the  committees of jurisdiction weighing in on the real cost to the American  people should a wall be built.   Mexico happens to be one of the United States' strongest trading  partners.   U.S. goods and services trade with Mexico totaled an estimated $579.7  billion in 2016.   Exports were $262.0 billion; imports were $317.6 billion.   The U.S. goods and services trade deficit with Mexico was $55.6  billion in 2016.   Mexico is currently our 3rd largest goods trading partner with $525.1  billion in total (two way) goods trade during 2016.   Goods exports totaled $231.0 billion; goods imports totaled $294.2  billion.   The U.S. goods trade deficit with Mexico was $63.2 billion in 2016.   Trade in services with Mexico (exports and imports) totaled an  estimated $54.5 billion in 2016.   Services exports were $31.1 billion; services imports were $23.5  billion.   The U.S. services trade surplus with Mexico was $7.6 billion in 2016.   According to the Department of Commerce, U.S. exports of Goods and  Services to Mexico supported an estimated 1.2 million jobs in 2015.   Mexico was the United States' 2nd largest goods export market in  2016.   U.S. exports to Mexico in 2016 were $231.0 billion, down 2.0 percent  ($4.8 billion) from 2015 but up 72.7 percent from 2006. U.S. exports to  Mexico are up 455 percent from 1993 (pre-NAFTA).  [[Page H6485]]    U.S. exports to Mexico account for 15.9 percent of overall U.S.  exports in 2015.   The top export categories in 2016 were: machinery ($42 billion),  electrical machinery ($41 billion), vehicles ($21 billion), mineral  fuels ($20 billion), and plastics ($16 billion).   U.S. total exports of agricultural products to Mexico totaled $18  billion in 2016, our 3rd largest agricultural export market.   Leading domestic export categories include: corn ($2.6 billion),  soybeans ($1.5 billion), pork & pork products ($1.4 billion), dairy  products ($1.2 billion), and beef & beef products ($975 million).   U.S. exports of services to Mexico were an estimated $31.1 billion in  2016, 1.4 percent (441 million) less than 2015, but 30.5 percent  greater than 2006 levels. It was up roughly 199 percent from 1993 (pre- NAFTA).   Leading services exports from the U.S. to Mexico, in 2015, were in  the travel, transport, and intellectual property (computer software,  industrial processes) sectors.   Mexico was the United States' 2nd largest supplier of goods imports  in 2016.   U.S. goods imports from Mexico totaled $294.2 billion in 2016, down  0.8 percent ($2.3 billion) from 2015, but up 48.4 percent from 2006.   U.S. imports from Mexico are up 637 percent from 1993 (pre-NAFTA).  U.S. imports from Mexico account for 13.4 percent of overall U.S.  imports in 2015.   The top import categories (2-digit HS) in 2016 were: vehicles ($75  billion), electrical machinery ($62 billion), machinery ($51 billion),  optical and medical instruments ($13 billion), and furniture and  bedding ($11 billion).   U.S. total imports of agricultural products from Mexico totaled $23  billion in 2016, our 1st largest supplier of agricultural imports.   Leading categories include: fresh vegetables ($5.6 billion), other  fresh fruit ($4.9 billion), wine and beer ($3.1 billion), snack foods  ($2.0 billion), and processed fruit & vegetables ($1.5 billion).   U.S. imports of services from Mexico were an estimated $23.5 billion  in 2016, 7.0 percent ($1.5 billion) more than 2015, and 57.9 percent  greater than 2006 levels. It was up roughly 216 percent from 1993 (pre- NAFTA). Leading services imports from Mexico to the U.S., in 2015, were  in the travel, transport, and technical and other services sectors.   The U.S. goods trade deficit with Mexico was $63.2 billion in 2016, a  4.2 percent increase ($2.5 billion) over 2015.   The United States has a services trade surplus of an estimated $7.6  billion with Mexico in 2016, down 20.7 percent from 2015.   U.S. foreign direct investment (FDI) in Mexico (stock) was $92.8  billion in 2015 (latest data available), a 3.5 percent increase from  2014. U.S. direct investment in Mexico is led by manufacturing, nonbank  holding companies, and mining.   Mexico's FDI in the United States (stock) was $16.6 billion in 2015  (latest data available), up 0.2 percent from 2014. Mexico's direct  investment in the U.S. is led by manufacturing, wholesale trade, and  depository institutions.   Sales of services in Mexico by majority U.S.-owned affiliates were  $45.9 billion in 2014 (latest data available), while sales of services  in the United States by majority Mexico-owned firms were $8.5 billion.   We share one of the longest peaceful borders in the world with our  neighbors to the north and to the south. We are not at war with our  peaceful neighbors; we do not need to build an almost 2,000 mile wall  to divide us from our neighbor.   This tragic initiative is inconsistent with the American character of  building bridges not walls.   These are just some of the facts that Committees of Jurisdiction  would have to weigh before we make any decision.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in opposing this Rule so  that this bill can return to the Rules Committee to have Division E  removed from this appropriations package.    Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairwoman Granger and  Ranking Member Visclosky for shepherding this legislation to the floor  and for their devotion to the men and women of the Armed Forces who  risk their lives to keep our nation safe and for their work in ensuring  that they have resources needed to keep our Armed Forces the greatest  fighting force for peace on earth.   Mr. Chair, thank you for the opportunity to explain my amendment,  which is simple and straightforward and affirms an example of the  national goodness that makes America the most exceptional nation on  earth.   The purpose of Jackson Lee Amendment No. 1 is to provide the  Secretary of Defense flexibility to allocate resources needed to  provide technical assistance by U.S. military women to military women  in other countries combating violence as a weapon of war, terrorism,  human trafficking, narcotics trafficking.   Mr. Chair, the United States is committed to combating violent  extremism, protecting our borders and the globe from the scourge of  terrorism.   The United States Armed Forces possess an unparalleled expertise and  technological capability that will aid not only in combating and  defeating terrorists who hate our country and prey upon innocent  persons, especially women, girls, and the elderly.   But we must recognize that notwithstanding our extraordinary  technical military capabilities, we face adversaries who adapt very  quickly because they are not constrained by geographic limitations or  norms of morality and decency.   Al Qaeda, Boko Haram, Al Shabaab, ISIS/ISIL and other militant  terrorists, including the Sinai's Ansar Beit al-Maqdis in the Sinai  Peninsula which poses a threat to Egypt.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 1 helps provide the Department of Defense  with the resources needed to provide technical assistance to countries  on innovative strategies to provide defense technologies and resources  that promote the security of the American people and allied nation  states.   Terrorism, human trafficking, narcotics trafficking and their impact  on women and girls across the globe has had a great adverse impact on  us all.   According to a UNICEF report, rape, torture and human trafficking by  terrorist and militant groups have been employed as weapons of war,  affecting over twenty thousand women and girls.   Looking at the history of terrorism highlights the importance of  providing technical assistance through our military might, as this  enables us to combat terrorism which now can plague us here in the  United States.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 1 will help curb terrorism abroad by making  available American technical military expertise to military in other  countries, like Nigeria, who are combating violent jihadists in their  country and to keep those terrorists out of our country.   Time and again American lives have been lost at the hands of  terrorists.   These victims include Christians, Muslims, journalists, health care  providers, relief workers, schoolchildren, and members of the  diplomatic corps and the Armed Services.   This is why the technical assistance offered by our military  personnel is integral to promoting security operation of intelligence,  surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft for missions to empower local  forces to combat terrorism.  [[Page H6496]]    Terrorists across the globe have wreaked havoc on our society and  cannot be tolerated or ignored, for their actions pose a threat to our  national security and the security of the world.   Mr. Chair, from the United States to Africa to Europe to Asia and the  Middle East, it is clear that combating terrorism remains one of our  highest national priorities.   Collectively, helping our neighbors and their military build capacity  to combat terrorism, eradicate human trafficking, stop narcotics  trafficking and negate their impact on women and girls across the globe  serves our national interest.   I urge my colleagues to support Jackson Lee Amendment No. 1.   Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairwoman Granger and Ranking Member  Visclosky for shepherding this legislation to the floor and for their  devotion to the men and women of the Armed Forces who risk their lives  to keep our nation safe.   Mr. Chair, thank you for the opportunity to explain my amendment,  which is identical to an amendment that I offered and was adopted last  year to the Defense Appropriations Act for FY2017 (H.R. 5293).   My amendment increases funding for the Defense Health Program's  research and development by $10 million.   These funds will address the question of breast cancer in the United  States military.   The American Cancer Society calls several strains of breast cancer as  a particularly aggressive subtype associated with lower survival rates;  in this instance, it is a triple negative.   But I raise an article: ``Fighting a Different Battle; Breast Cancer  and the Military.''   Breast cancer can affect both men and women.   The bad news is breast cancer has been just about as brutal on women  in the military as combat.   Let me say that sentence again.   Breast cancer has been just about as brutal on women in the military  as combat.   More than 800 women have been wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan,  according to the Army Times; 874 military women were diagnosed with  breast cancer just between 2000 and 2011.   And according to that same study, more are suspected. It grows.   The good news is that we have been working on it, and I want to add  my appreciation to the military.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 25, however, will allow for the additional  research.   That research is particularly needed since women are joining the  Armed Services in increasing numbers and serving longer, ascending to  leadership.   Within increased age comes increased risk and incidence of breast  cancer.   Not only is breast cancer striking relatively young military women at  an alarming rate, but male service members, veterans and their  dependents are at risk as well.   With a younger and generally healthier population, those in military  tend to have a lower risk for most cancers than civilians--including  significantly lower colorectal, lung and cervical--but breast cancer is  a different story.   Military people in general, and in some cases very specifically, are  at a significantly greater risk for contracting breast cancer,  according to Dr. Richard Clapp, a top cancer expert at Boston  University who works at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  on military breast cancer issues.   Dr. Clapp notes that life in the military can mean exposure to a  witch's brew of risk factors directly linked to greater chances of  getting breast cancer.   So, I am asking that we do the right thing.   We are on the right track, we're on the right road.   But with the expansion of women in the military, it is extremely  important to move forward with this amendment to help ensure that the  men and women who risk their lives to protect our freedom can live  longer, healthier lives.   I urge my colleagues to support Jackson Lee Amendment No. 25.   Mr. Chair, I am pleased that the En Bloc Amendment also includes  Jackson Lee Amendment No. 50 that was made in order under the Rule.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 50 increases funding for the PTSD by $5  million.   These funds should be used toward outreach activities targeting hard  to reach veterans, especially those who are homeless or reside in  underserved urban and rural areas, who suffer from Post-Traumatic  Stress Disorder (PTSD).   Mr. Chair, along with traumatic brain injury, PTSD is the signature  wound suffered by the brave men and women fighting in Afghanistan,  Iraq, and far off lands to defend the values and freedom we hold dear.   For those of us whose daily existence is not lived in harm's way, it  is difficult to imagine the horrific images that American servicemen  and women deployed in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other theaters of war see  on a daily basis.   In an instant a suicide bomber, an IED, or an insurgent can  obliterate your best friend and right in front of your face.   Yet, you are trained and expected to continue on with the mission,  and you do, even though you may not even have reached your 20th  birthday.   But there always comes a reckoning. And it usually comes after the  stress and trauma of battle is over and you are alone with your  thoughts and memories.   And the horror of those desperate and dangerous encounters with the  enemy and your own mortality come flooding back.   PTSD was first brought to public attention in relation to war  veterans, but it can result from a variety of traumatic incidents, such  as torture, being kidnapped or held captive, bombings, or natural  disasters such as floods or earthquakes.   People with PTSD may startle easily, become emotionally numb  (especially in relation to people with whom they used to be close),  lose interest in things they used to enjoy, have trouble feeling  affectionate, be irritable, become more aggressive, or even become  violent.   They avoid situations that remind them of the original incident, and  anniversaries of the incident are often very difficult.   Most people with PTSD repeatedly relive the trauma in their thoughts  during the day and in nightmares when they sleep.   These are called flashbacks; a person having a flashback may lose  touch with reality and believe that the traumatic incident is happening  all over again.   Mr. Chair, the fact of the matter is that most veterans with PTSD  also have other psychiatric disorders, which are a consequence of PTSD.   These veterans have co-occurring disorders, which include depression,  alcohol and/or drug abuse problems, panic, and/or other anxiety  disorders.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 50 recognizes that these soldiers are first  and foremost, human, who live their experiences.   Ask a veteran of Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan about the frequency of  nightmares they experience, and one will realize that serving in the  Armed Forces leaves a lasting impression, whether good or bad.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 50 will help ensure that ``no soldier is  left behind'' by addressing the urgent need for more outreach toward  hard to reach veterans suffering from PTSD, especially those who are  homeless or reside in underserved urban and rural areas of our country.   I thank the Chair and Ranking Member for including Jackson Lee  Amendment No. 50 in the En Bloc Amendment and urge my colleagues to  support the En Bloc Amendment.
