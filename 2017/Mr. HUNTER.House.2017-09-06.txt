 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment transfers $5 million from  [[Page H7081]]  the Coast Guard's Operating Expenses account to its Research,  Development, Test, and Evaluation account. The intent is to support sea  trials for a Jones Act compliant icebreaker so the Coast Guard can  determine whether a leased vessel can meet its immediate needs in  fulfilling its 11 statutory missions around the globe.   I am going to stop my diatribe here. Steve Scalise has a statement.  He is in his rehabilitation center, but he actually cared enough to  write this. I am going to speak here, and these are his words, not  mine:   ``I support this amendment that will improve America's strategic,  economic, and national security interests in the Arctic. As other  countries are advancing their interests in the Arctic, the U.S.  continues to lag behind. This amendment makes clear that Congress  supports moving forward in identifying options for icebreaking  capabilities in the Arctic.   ``The Coast Guard has repeatedly stated we need a fleet of  icebreakers to maintain the presence necessary in the Arctic and  Antarctic to meet and protect U.S. sovereign interests and protect life  and property at sea. Currently, the U.S. has two icebreakers--one of  which is our Nation's only heavy icebreaker and is over 40 years old.  Russia has more than 40 icebreakers, with more under construction.   ``As the Arctic becomes increasingly accessible to maritime traffic,  tourism, and energy exploration, we cannot continue to defer this much- needed capability--especially at a time when China and Russia are  increasing their presence in the Arctic, expanding their icebreaker  fleets, and encroaching over the extended U.S. continental shelf.   ``I urge support for this amendment that will address this immediate  and necessary investment and protect U.S. national security  interests.''   That is from Steve Scalise. Now back to my words.   To help narrow this capability gap between America and our peer  competitors, the Coast Guard should examine the lease of icebreakers  that could be deployed in the near term.   My subcommittee has held countless hearings on this issue, and I am  convinced that a short-term lease of an existing icebreaker is one of  the best chances to ensure the Coast Guard can meet its near-term and  urgent mission objectives in the Arctic.   Mr. Chair, I urge all Members to support my amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                time  0040     Mr. Chair, how much time is remaining?    Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Carter), the chairman.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Texas. The  gentlewoman brought up some points about a ship, which I didn't name.   The Coast Guard hasn't built an icebreaker in almost 50 years. We  only have one. There is only one Jones Act ship in the entire country.  It is the Aiviq, but there is only one. All we say here is that it has  to got to be an American-made ship. That is what the Jones Act is.   If we are going to build an icebreaker with U.S. taxpayer dollars, we  are going to use an American-made, and American-crewed, and American- steel ship.   Mr. Garamendi, the ranking member on my subcommittee, has voted for  amendments like this in the past, and he supports amendments like this  going forward. Anything that puts Americans to work, that gives us more  than the one icebreaker that works for 6 months out of the year, this  is a step in that direction.   This is simply for sea trials. This is so that the Coast Guard,  because they haven't made an icebreaker in 50 years, they can take one  out besides the Healy, which is a medium icebreaker that they operate  and ask: Hey, what do we need here? Do we need to expand the bow,  expand the stern? How could we make this what we want?   That is all we are doing here, and it is $5 million.   This is a step in the right direction. Otherwise, we are never going  to have an icebreaker. We are not going to be able to compete in the  Arctic. It will be energy exploration for Russia and China, and not us  because we are not going to be there unless we start right now in this  appropriations bill.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
