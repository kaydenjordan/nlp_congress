 Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Trump  administration's decision to suspend compliance with the Intermediate- Range Nuclear Forces--or, the INF--Treaty and begin the process of  withdrawing from this accord.   Signed in 1987, the INF Treaty banned all ground-launched cruise and  ballistic missile systems with intermediate ranges between 300 and  3,400 miles. This landmark agreement led to the destruction of  approximately 800 U.S. and 1,800 Soviet ground-launched missiles, along  with their supporting equipment.   This is an issue I have been following closely since I joined the  U.S. Senate in 2013. While concerns about Russia's compliance with the  INF Treaty began long before then, 2013 was the first year U.S.  officials formally raised the issue with their Russian counterparts.  The following year, the Obama administration declared Russia to be in  violation of the treaty and accused Russia of possessing an  intermediate-range, ground-launched cruise missile.   After affirming Russia's violation of its INF obligations, the Obama  administration continued to raise Russia's noncompliance at numerous  bilateral and multilateral diplomatic engagements. In 2016, the Obama  administration also resurrected the Special Verification Commission, a  mechanism set up under the treaty to resolve compliance issues, which  had not held a meeting since the year 2000. The Trump administration  continued to exert diplomatic pressure on Russia, raising this issue at  all levels of the Russian Government. Additionally, this administration  began treaty-compliant research and development work on conventional,  ground-launched missile systems to demonstrate to Russia that the  United States would pursue additional military capabilities if Russia  persisted in producing these illegal systems.   To further impose costs on Russia for its behavior, the  administration sanctioned Russian companies involved in the development  of the illegal missile system in December of 2017. Diplomatic  engagement continued in 2018, and, despite multiple ultimatums, Russia  continues to deny its violation of the treaty.   The United States has led a sustained, deliberate effort to  methodically increase pressure on Russia, which has had every  opportunity to return to compliance, but instead it continues to  produce and deploy illegal systems in greater and greater numbers. Just  last week, reports surfaced, alleging Russia has deployed another  battalion equipped with the banned missile system. Instead of moving to  correct its violation, Russia is going in the opposite direction. The  evidence is clear, Russia has no intention of returning to compliance,  and the United States cannot remain party to an agreement that amounts  to a unilateral limitation on our Nation. It would certainly have been  easier to ignore this issue and let another year pass with U.S.  diplomats renewing their appeals while Russia builds more illegal  weapons. However, this administration understood that maintaining U.S.  compliance in order to prop up the illusion of an effective arms  control agreement does not make our Nation safer. I applaud the Trump  administration for making the tough but correct decision to withdraw.   The administration also deserves credit for its coordination with our  NATO allies on this topic. A statement released by NATO last Friday  expressed solidarity with the U.S. position, and NATO Secretary General  Jens Stoltenberg stated:         All allies agree with the United States, because Russia has       violated the treaty for several years. They are deploying       more and more of the new nuclear capable missiles in Europe.    Let me repeat this point. As NATO has expressed solidarity with the  U.S. position to withdraw from the INF treaty, our allies support us.  Our NATO allies understand the Russian threat increase due to their  treaty violation because they are at the most risk.   Some want to use this issue as an opportunity to debate the  temperament of this administration and paint its decision to withdraw  as a symptom of its contempt for arms control treaties. Others say the  decision is motivated by China, as though Russia's violation and the  deployment of a new nuclear-capable weapons system designed to hold our  allies and our forces in Europe at risk is not relevant or is a  secondary consideration, at best. Others have even gone so far as to  argue that the decision to withdraw benefits Russia by liberating them  from the limitations of the treaty. This is a deeply misguided view  that overlooks the fact that Russia is already ignoring the treaty's  limitations.   Let's be absolutely clear about what Russia wants. Russia wants the  United States to stay in the treaty and maintain the status quo because  it benefits them. They are building banned weapons systems while we are  not. Their diplomats have sustained a campaign of denial and deception  in order to put pressure on the United States to remain in this treaty.  The notion that leaving the treaty is a windfall for Russia is a  mistaken one.   Those who oppose the administration's decision must answer one basic  question: How does remaining part of an agreement that Russia has  already walked away from enhance U.S. security?   The answer is simple. It doesn't. The administration is right to  leave the agreement, and responsibility for the failure of the INF  Treaty lies squarely with Russia. The United States must now take  additional steps to ensure that Russia derives no military advantage  from its blatant violation of this accord.   Last year, the administration proposed developing a sea-launched  cruise missile to ensure that our Nation has credible options to deter  Russia's expanding arsenal of nonstrategic nuclear weapons. This effort  must go forward, but it is years away from delivering such capability.  Existing research and development efforts into ground-launched systems  should be accelerated as part of a near-term response to Russia's  actions.   Some will surely criticize these steps as an arms race and ridicule  them as a symptom of outmoded ``Cold War'' thinking. Indeed, there are  people who would prefer that we do nothing. I think that is dangerous.  We must impose costs on Russia for its violation and create incentives  for Russia to halt its destabilizing behavior. Again, they are building  banned weapons systems. We are not. For years, we have used diplomatic  appeals and sanctions to encourage Russia to stop production of these  systems and to return to compliance. Yet they continue to blatantly  violate the accord. Clearly, a firmer approach is needed.   Developing additional military capabilities in response to Russia's  actions demonstrates to Russia that its pursuit of illegal systems will  only result in a more lethal and a more capable U.S. military. In this  way, we clearly indicate to Russia that violating treaties and building  illegal weapons will ultimately harm its own national security  interests. If we fail to respond sufficiently, Russia is likely to  conclude  [[Page S821]]  that it can break treaties and favorably affect the balance of military  power in the European theater at a modest cost. This will only  encourage additional misbehavior, which could put the broader  nonproliferation regime at risk.   The Trump administration's decision to withdraw is not the end of  this process. The more important question is what comes next. Congress  and the administration must ensure that the consequences of Russia's  cheating outweigh any benefits it has obtained by violating this  treaty.   Thank you, Madam President.   I yield the floor.
