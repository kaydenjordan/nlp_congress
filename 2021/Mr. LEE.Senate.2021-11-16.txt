 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, last week, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the  Fifth Circuit issued an emergency stay on President Biden's sweeping  vaccine mandate. The court granted the stay, citing ``grave statutory  and constitutional issues'' with the mandate. The 22-page order is  persuasive and compelling in explaining the grave effects the mandate  will have on businesses and individuals alike throughout the United  States.   The order also explains that the limited nature of the Federal  Government under the Constitution simply doesn't allow for sweeping  mandates of this nature, generally, but it certainly doesn't allow for  sweeping mandates like this one without an act of Congress. You see,  our powers within the Federal Government are carefully circumscribed;  they are carefully constrained. The Constitution brings about a  balancing, a limitation on powers that operate along two axes. The  vertical constraint is called federalism, and the horizontal constraint  is something we refer to as the separation of powers.   The Federal Government's powers are, as James Madison described them  in Federalist No. 45, ``few and defined,'' while those reserved to the  States are ``numerous and indefinite.'' Likewise, within the three  branches, we have these protections in place to make sure that no one  person can exercise what power the Federal Government does have  exclusively; you can't accumulate too much power. So the President of  the United States, under our constitutional system, isn't a King and  may not rule by decree. He is not free to just do things because he  thinks they are a good idea.   The judges also, refreshingly, asserted the commerce clause of the  Constitution and brought up the commerce clause as the source of the  claimed authority for Federal action under this circumstance, noting  that, even under broad interpretations of the commerce clause that we  have seen from the Federal court system since 1937, the commerce clause  is not unlimited in the scope of the authority that it provides to the  Federal Government, and in this case, it certainly doesn't authorize  the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to issue a sweeping  vaccine mandate on all companies with more than 99 employees nor does  the commerce clause even authorize Congress to undertake such an  action, which, of course, Congress has not undertaken.   We have erred dangerously, over many decades, from the true  application of the Constitution's limits. In many respects, we have  lost sight even of the fact that this is a government of limited  powers, and now that lack of those limits--the lack of respect for  those limits within those who operate the Federal Government--is  placing millions of Americans at risk of not only becoming unemployed  but, in many cases, unemployable. Some in Congress are, today, taking  it even further in asking the President of the United States to impose  a vaccine or a test mandate as a condition precedent for interstate  travel.   Now, I have heard from hundreds of Utahns who are at risk of losing  their jobs because of this now, thankfully, halted mandate. These are  not bad people. To the contrary, they are good people. They are our  neighbors and our friends. They are everyday Americans who are all too  often just trying to get by to provide for their families. They are not  our enemies, and it is troubling to think that the President of the  United States said--on national television no less--that he is ``losing  [his] patience'' with them. What does that even mean? In fact, recent  polling numbers show that, if anything, it appears to be the other way  around. We are losing patience with him and with his broad assertions  of authority that he doesn't even have.   I have come to the Senate floor about 15 times now to oppose this  vaccine mandate. I have offered a dozen bills to limit, clarify, or  otherwise counteract the vaccine mandate. Each time, one or another of  my colleagues from the other side of the aisle has objected to what  should be uncontroversial bills. Let's review each of these that we  have gone through so far.   Now, this started back on September 28 with S. 2850. This bill, S.  2850, would have provided exemptions for those with religious or moral  objections to the vaccine mandate. President Biden, significantly, had  promised these exemptions would be in the mandate, but for some  reason--for some reason that I struggle to understand--Senate  Democrats, nonetheless, objected to the passage of that bill.   So then I came back, and I offered up S. 2840, the Don't Jab Me Act,  a bill that would require that the Federal Government make those who  suffer from the vaccine mandate financially whole. The Democrats  rejected that bill too.   Next, I offered S. 2843, the No Taxation Without Congressional  Consent Act, a bill that would require congressional authorization  before the fines associated with the mandate could be charged  to businesses. Notwithstanding the fact that the Constitution is very  clear about where taxes need to originate within our system of  government, the Democrats objected to that bill as well.    So then I came back with another bill. This time it was S. 2848, the  Your Health Comes First Act. This is a bill that would offer exemptions  from the mandate to those who have preexisting medical or other health  concerns about the vaccine. This is also another exemption that  President Biden himself promised in his speech when first announcing  the vaccine mandate, but it is an exemption that the Senate Democrats,  apparently, didn't feel worthy of codifying with legislation, and so  they objected to that one too. This one was particularly surprising  because if, in fact, President Biden himself felt comfortable with  those exemptions, one would think that there wouldn't be discomfort  with codifying what he himself said should be the law.   So then, in response to that, I returned to this Chamber on another  day, and I offered up S. 2846, the Natural Immunity is Real Act. This  bill would require that the Federal vaccine mandate recognize natural  immunity. Countries across the world recognize this immunity for the  powerful protection that it, in fact, provides, a protection that,  according to some studies, may be as much as 27 times stronger than  that offered by the vaccine alone. Unfortunately, President Biden's  mandate wasn't so generous on that point.  [[Page S8230]]  This bill, too, was rejected by the Democrats, disregarding science's  showing the very real impact of natural immunity.   So I came back, and I offered up S. 2847, the Let Me Travel America  Act. Now, this bill would prohibit the requirement of vaccination  before citizens could travel between the States. Apparently, the  Democrats want to leave that option open because they objected to that  one too. Well, that one is not in the vaccine mandate. It is feared, as  I mentioned a few minutes ago, that that might be on the table.  Apparently, it still is because people were unwilling to codify what  should be a natural conclusion for most Americans to reach, which is  that our right to travel from one State to another without permission  from the Federal Government ought not be interfered with and that it is  fundamental that we shouldn't mess with it. That is why it was  unfortunate that this one, too, drew an objection.   So I returned. I hoped that this body could give some assurance and  some respect to the brave men and women of our military who are at risk  of losing benefits and losing the right to serve over this vaccine  mandate. So my bill that I offered that day, S. 2842, the Respecting  Our Servicemembers Act, would protect servicemembers from losing their  livelihoods and their benefits--that they have accrued and earned  through their valiant service--as a result of the mandate. The  Democrats objected to this one too. That is particularly sad. These are  heroes. These are people on whom we rely to keep us safe. We ought to  give them more trust than that. We ought to not put them in a position  in which many of them are facing a difficult decision.   So I offered another bill. I returned to this body, and I offered a  bill that should be one of the least controversial measures that we  have ever considered, not just about the vaccine mandate but about  anything. That bill, the Parental Consent for Vaccination Act, would  have simply required that parental consent be provided before COVID-19  vaccines were given to children. The Democrats objected to that as  well.   So I came back, and I offered the Transparency in COVID-19  Vaccination Act. This bill would have provided information regarding  vaccine side effects to the public. It would have just made sure that  the American people had access to that information. I thought  information would build confidence in the vaccines. The Democrats  disagreed, and they objected. Apparently, that was too much. I don't  know why people wouldn't want more information. I actually think that  would have built confidence in the vaccine, but, apparently, they  didn't see it that way or maybe they just didn't want people to have  access to the information. I don't know. I can't speak for them. I just  know they objected.   So I came back for the 10th time. I offered up the Transparency in  COVID-19 Research Act. This bill would have provided research and  information drawn from that research--that the American taxpayers are  paying for--to the public, that should be available to the public. We  pay for that research. We ought to know what the findings are. The  government shouldn't have anything to hide and wouldn't have anything  to hide here, but the Democrats disagreed, and they objected to that  one as well.   So I tried again. I came back, and I offered up S. 2851, the  Transparency in COVID-19 Expenditures Act. This bill is just a good  housekeeping measure. It is a commonsense measure. It is not something  that should have been either liberal or conservative or thought of as  Republican or Democratic. It is just a good housekeeping matter. You  know, I think it is strange that it would be controversial, given the  simplicity of what it would do. It would simply call for an audit  regarding how our COVID-19 funds have been spent. I thought the  information would be helpful to us as we make policy moving forward,  and yet the Democrats objected to that one.   So I tried again. I offered a 12th bill that would simply end the  mandate. The No Forced Vaccination for COVID-19 Act would clarify that  Federal law does not authorize OSHA or any other Federal Agency to  implement a general vaccine mandate, but the Democrats objected to that  one too.   Twelve times--twelve bills. Some were simpler than others. Some  should have involved no controversy whatsoever. Some just inserted good  principles of lawmaking or constitutionalism generally or federalism in  particular. Each one was rejected, one right after the other after the  other, repeated 12 times.   Thankfully, while some in this body have floundered, judges on the  Fifth Circuit fulfilled their duty to the American people and their  oaths to the Constitution. That does not mean, however, that this fight  is anywhere near over. It will continue in the courts, where the States  and the Biden administration will each be able to make their case. But  I am also going to continue this fight here. I will stand for those  Utahns and those Americans who are at risk specifically because of this  mandate.   It is also important for us to remember that separate and apart from  what the courts might do, we have an independent obligation, having  each taken an oath to uphold and protect and defend the Constitution of  the United States in the fulfillment of our duties. We need to make  sure that before authority is exercised--especially authority operating  in such a personal manner on such a personal issue as this--that power  isn't being taken from those to whom it belongs. The power in our  system of government belongs to the people, and in the absence of a  delegation of power to the Federal Government, that power is retained  by the States respectively or by the people.   So we ought to be looking at this carefully and closely, analyzing it  on our own. We can't assume that the Federal courts will save us from  our own unconstitutional actions.   I have been critical of Presidents of both political parties when  they have taken actions that exceed the scope of their authority as  President of the United States or of actions enacted by the legislative  branch under the direction of either political party that exceed the  power of the Federal Government. This is an issue that is not  Republican or Democratic. It is not liberal. It is not conservative. It  is simply an American issue. It is a constitutional issue. We ought to  be debating it, discussing these things here, and not waiting for the  courts to act.   One of the profound frustrations that I have encountered over the  years is that sometimes people will conflate the issue of  constitutionality with litigation. They will assume that constitutional  issues are those that have to be addressed in the courts and only in  the courts.   Fortunately, we have the courts to adjudicate disputes and the  meaning of statutes and provisions of the Constitution, but that  doesn't excuse us of our responsibility to provide an independent check  and balance to make sure that authority isn't being exercised where it  should not. It is especially important where, as here, we are dealing  with a fundamentally misguided and, I believe, immoral proposition;  that is, that individual Americans, hard-working moms and dads  throughout this country, ought ever to be put into a position by their  government to choose between, on the one hand, receiving a medical  procedure that they may not want or to which they may have religious or  other moral objections or which they might have a specific health  concern, for example--they ought not ever be put in a position where  they have to choose between that unwanted medical procedure on the one  hand and on the other hand, the ability to put bread on the table for  their children. That is not right. The American people know it, and  deep down, they know something is terribly wrong whenever one person  can, with the stroke of the Executive pen, issue so broad, so deep, and  so immoral a mandate.   I am not going to stand for this. I will be back. I will be back  tomorrow. I will be back the next day. I will be back as often as it  takes, as long as it takes. I am not going to stop until we win this  fight.   Thank you.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, months ago, as Americans watched harrowing  video footage of the Afghanistan evacuation efforts, service men and  women from around the world rose to the challenge of a complex mission.  As the chaos persisted, the 82nd Airborne Division of the U.S. Army was  called on to support noncombatant evacuation operations--NEO--at Hamid  Karzai International Airport in Afghanistan. They completed their  mission honorably.   One member of the 82nd Airborne Division, Sgt. Breanna J. Jessop, a  chaplain assistant, assumed the role as the noncommissioned officer-- NCO--in charge of the airport chapel. Sergeant Jessop, despite  tremendous obstacles of ongoing and imminent threats, conducted herself  with courage, discipline, and attention to detail. Her work saved many.   Always putting the well-being of her fellow soldiers first, Sergeant  Jessop used her ingenuity to ensure 4,000 U.S. military personnel and  coalition forces had access to basic hygiene items at a time when  resources were, at best, limited. Further, she made time to assist  soldiers with religious support, help care for those who had suffered  casualties, and ensure the well-being of the soldiers with whom she  served.   At the height of the NEO mission, Sergeant Jessop showed outstanding  leadership. She oversaw the operation of an entire orphanage that had  been formed as a result of the increase in unaccompanied minors at the  airport. She led the mission to assist in caring for children and  offered assistance for children ranging from newborn babies to 17 years  old. As a result of her untiring humanitarian efforts, over 400  displaced children were kept safe during the NEO mission.   Outside of her assigned duties and responsibilities, Sergeant Jessop,  has helped pioneer the Under the Canopy Program which serves as a  touchpoint forum for lower enlisted paratroopers. There, she provides  vital leadership to assist with planning, preparing, and overseeing the  execution of each event. Her work helps hundreds of paratroopers each  month to identify issues and discuss new and ongoing initiatives.   Sgt. Breanna J. Jessop, a native of Myton, UT, truly represents the  U.S. Army values and what it means to be a paratrooper and Sky Dragon  soldier.   About Sergeant Jessop, Maj. Gen. Chris Donahue once said, ``There are  so many different words that you could use to describe her: strength,  resilience, willingness to share what others would never be willing to  . . . that's the type of remarkable person and paratrooper that she  is.'' I could not agree more.   Sergeant Jessop was recently recognized by the United Service  Organizations as the 2021 Service Member of the Year. This award is  fitting and well-deserved. Yet no award will ever fully honor the  service of Sergeant Jessop. Her dedicated service to the children  orphaned at Hamid Karzai International Airport and her fellow  servicemembers is commendable and will be remembered and revered in the  hearts of many for years to come.                            ____________________
