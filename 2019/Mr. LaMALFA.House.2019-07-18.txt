 Mr. Speaker, in Matthew in the New Testament, it talks  about: ``You will recognize them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered  from thornbushes or figs from thistles? So, every healthy tree bears  good fruit, but the diseased tree bears bad fruit.''   Mr. Speaker, the tree of the House of Representatives hasn't borne  much fruit this week. At a time of hurricane and floods, the continued  border crisis exacerbated by inaction on properly defining ``asylum''  or ``legal immigration,'' instead of the kitchen-table issues families  sent us to work on, we get impeachment questions that, for all the  hype, barely mustered one-fifth of House votes to not table that  discussion. Next week is another round of Robert Mueller, after 2 years  and tens of millions of dollars of drilling a dry well.   Mr. Speaker, for those who watch this House, our constituents, to  actually feel embarrassed by its governing, even causing our Speaker  pro tempore to abandon the Chair--out of privilege, I believe--over  this infighting, we have some serious self-contemplation and soul- searching to do as a body to uphold the dignity of this institution,  not just change the rules to support the inappropriate language of its  leaders of this House or attack our close ally Israel with a BDS  resolution.   Mr. Speaker, we will be recognized by the fruits we produce in this  body.                            ____________________
