 Madam Speaker, I rise today to share one of Fort Wayne's  great American success stories, Sweetwater Sound.   Founder and CEO Chuck Surack's dream started over 40 years ago with a  recording studio housed in a Volkswagen van. It has since evolved into  one of the Nation's leading retailers of professional recording and  music equipment.   Madam Speaker, Sweetwater's total sales in 2018 were record breaking  at $725 million. And just recently we found out that in 2019 it was  another record year with sales of $805 million, up 11 percent from  2018.   The total sales only tell part of the success story, though.  Sweetwater has recently hired 159 new employees and has given back to  Hoosiers by providing middle school students with free instruments.   Hoosiers are thankful for Sweetwater Sound's big contributions to  northeast Indiana, and I look forward to watching them continue to  succeed moving forward. In this record-setting economy, I look forward  to seeing more American success stories just like this one.                            ____________________
