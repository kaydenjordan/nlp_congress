 Mr. Speaker, I rise to voice my strong  support for H. Res. 1149 and the alliance between the United States and  the Republic of Korea.   Our two nations have forged an important military alliance and strong  economic and diplomatic friendship built on shared support for  democracy, free markets and human rights. I have long advocated for  increasing the American commitment to the Indo-Asia-Pacific region,  with the important U.S.-Korean relationship central to that strategy.   Both of our nations are threatened by North Korea's nuclear program.  With nuclear talks at an apparent standstill, the current reduction in  bilateral military exercises may be harming joint readiness with little  to show for it. I will continue to urge the administration to conduct  exercises when militarily necessary and separate our military  cooperation with South Korea from ongoing negotiations about North  Korea's nuclear program.   The United States and the Republic of Korea share a desire to  eliminate the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear and missile  [[Page H10068]]  programs and secure a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula. By working  together as allies and friends we increase the likelihood of making  these aspirations into reality.
