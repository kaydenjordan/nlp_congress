 Madam President, it is my honor to pay tribute today  to a fellow Tennessean who made the ultimate sacrifice for his country.   On August 26, 2021, at approximately 9:30 am Eastern Standard Time,  an ISIS-K terrorist murdered 13 American servicemembers in a suicide  attack on the Abbey Gate leading into Hamid Karzai International  Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan.   Among the fallen was Corryton native SSG Ryan Knauss. Ryan served  with the Army's 9th Battalion, 8th Psychological Operations Group  (Airborne), which put him directly in the heart of Afghan communities.  His job was to build relationships with the people he met there, and by  all accounts, he succeeded with uncommon skill, empathy, and  compassion. It was dangerous work, but Ryan understood its importance.  As his widow Alena recently told a Knoxville newspaper, ``When he spoke  of the people of Afghanistan, all he saw were people that needed help.  They were below no one in his eyes, not even Americans. He told me that  all he saw were people of a different culture who deserved to be OK.''   When the time came for the Army to support evacuations at the  airport, Ryan volunteered for the mission. He knew that, by doing this,  he would be putting himself in danger; but when he looked at the chaos  unfolding there, all he saw were the thousands of women and children  forced into the line of fire by the persistent, terrifying evil that  was seizing control of Kabul.   And so he went and faithfully executed his duty. He was born to be a  soldier and died as the finest example of American heroism anyone could  ask for. He was a loving husband, a loyal friend, and a light in the  darkness. Ryan's unit, Detachment 10, offered a statement following his  death that I believe deserves a place in the Record. They said, ``Ryan  knew the dangerous situation he was going to, but protecting innocent  civilians is one of the values that drove him. It has been said that  life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives, and  Ryan had an incredible impact on his family and friends. And thanks to  his actions, thousands of children will have the joy of knowing a  childhood free from danger and oppression.''   Ryan, we are in awe of you. Thank you for your service to this  country and for your sacrifice on behalf of all those who seek refuge  within the common cause of freedom.   (At the request of Mr. Inhofe, the following statement was ordered to  be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
