 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  women of the Divine Nine, the historically Black sororities of the  National Pan-Hellenic Council.   I am proud to honor the organizations that have produced some of our  Nation's best and brightest leaders. For over 100 years, these  organizations have fostered and empowered generations of Black women to  become leaders in government, business, academia, and so much more.   I am not exaggerating when I say these historically Black sororities  have shaped the course of history.   I want to take a moment to salute each sorority.   Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority--their colors are salmon pink and apple  green--was founded in 1908 at Howard University. Their mission: Service  to all mankind. Their sisterhood proudly boasts Vice President Kamala  Harris; also my colleagues, Congresswomen Sheila Jackson Lee, Terri  Sewell, Frederica Wilson, Alma Adams, Bonnie Watson Coleman, Lauren  Underwood, Emilia Sykes, and Lisa Blunt Rochester.                                time  1015    I salute former Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson and also members  of their membership, civil rights leaders Rosa Parks and Coretta Scott  King, and their honorable president, Danette Anthony Reed.   Next, we have Delta Sigma Theta. Their colors are crimson and cream,  founded in 1913 at Howard University. Delta's motto is ``intelligence  is the torch of wisdom.''   Delta counts as sisters, my esteemed colleagues Yvette Clarke, Joyce  Beatty, Stacey Plaskett, Lucy McBath, Summer Lee, Jasmine Crockett,  Valerie Foushee, and our newest Member, Jennifer McClellan. I also  salute former Congresswoman Val Demings and our HUD Secretary, Marsha  Fudge.   Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm was the first African-American woman  elected to Congress, and she also was a member of Delta Sigma Theta.  Their honorable president is Elsie Cooke-Holmes.   Next, we have Zeta Phi Beta Sorority. Their colors are blue and  white. It was founded in 1920 at Howard University. Zeta's founding  principles are scholarship, service, sisterhood, and finer womanhood.   My colleague Congresswoman Sydney Kamlager-Dove is a member of Zeta  Phi Beta, as well as former Congresswoman Donna Edwards and the late  Congresswoman Julia Carson. They boast as members Anita Hill and author  Zora Neale Hurston. Their honorable president is Stacie NC Grant.   Last but not least, my sorority, Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority. We wear  the colors of royal blue and gold. We were founded in 1922 at Butler  University, just celebrating our 100th year.   My sisters in Sigma are Congresswoman Barbara Lee, as well as the  late Congresswoman Lindy Boggs, and former Congresswoman Corrine Brown.  In our membership is the first African-American winner of an Academy  Award, Hattie McDaniel, and the first African-American woman journalist  to cover the White House, Alice Allison Dunnigan. Our esteemed grand  basileus is Rasheeda S. Liberty.   The women of the Divine Nine have driven progress on everything from  women's suffrage to civil rights. These organizations were instrumental  to the end of the brutal regime of Jim Crow. Alumnae have also made  advancements in industry, medicine, entertainment, and more.   In short, the historically Black sororities have been critical to the  advancement of Black women in America and have changed history for the  better.   Our work is far from done. The strength and solidarity of these  organizations is needed now more than ever.   In just the first months of 2023, our country continues to see  efforts to turn back the clock on fundamental civil rights. Black  people are still not safe in their own communities. Black people have  less say in their government, and voting rights are being chipped away.  The threat of racist violence is still painfully present in too many  communities.   I have so much hope in the new generation of leaders that begin their  journey as college students with Alpha Kappa Alpha, Delta Sigma Theta,  Zeta Phi Beta, or Sigma Gamma Rho. Each year, more young people go out  into the world to make our country a better place.   The road ahead is long, but I am confident that our coalitions for  justice and equality will only grow because of the continued strength  of the women of the Divine Nine along with our five historically Black  fraternities.                            ____________________
