 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the service of U.S.  Mint Director David J. Ryder as he prepares to depart the Mint.   As a Boise State Broncos alum, Director Ryder has served with  distinction in both the government and corporate worlds.   In 1991, President George H.W. Bush nominated him to serve as the  34th Director of the U.S. Mint. He served until 1993. In 2017, he was  nominated by President Trump for a second tenure as Mint director.   Madam Speaker, that was something the Bushes and the Trumps agreed  upon.   Under Director Ryder's leadership, the Mint has introduced more new  products than ever before. The Mint's bullion and numismatic programs  reached their highest levels of revenue in over 10 years. The Mint's  customer base grew to more than a half a million people--530,000, an  increase of over 100,000 in 2 short years.   I was particularly impressed by Director Ryder's leadership when we  worked together on the 2021 Morgan and Peace Commemorative Silver  Dollars program, which produced 875,000 Morgan silver dollars and  200,000 Peace silver dollars, all under the 2021 date.   Carson City and New Orleans mintmarks were resurrected for the first  time in years, even though those Mints had been closed by using them in  a privy mark. Collectors went nuts, and rightfully so. The program  netted over $30 million for the U.S. Treasury and profits from this  program when they all sold out in less than 20 minutes.  [[Page H5562]]    As he moves on to greener pastures, I wish Director Ryder success in  all future endeavors he takes on. I thank Director Ryder for his all- American performance as the 39th Director of the United States Mint.   Madam Speaker, although it pains me to do this as a proud University  of Nevada Wolf Pack alum, Director Ryder, thank you for your service  again, and go Boise State Broncos.                            ____________________
