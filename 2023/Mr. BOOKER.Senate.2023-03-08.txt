 Madam President, I want to just say that I respect and am  grateful for the generosity of the chairman, the Senator from Oregon,  for allowing me to slip in and say some remarks.   I want to thank Senator Van Hollen for his incredible leadership on  this issue.   I have the distinction of being the only one of the 100 Senators who  was actually born in Washington, DC. This is the city my parents met  in. This is the city they married in. My mom worked for the DC Public  Schools. My father was one of the first Black salesmen hired in the  entire DC region by the company IBM. I owe this city so much, and I am  disappointed that there is nobody in this body who was officially  elected to speak for this city.   Washington, DC, is suffering, as it has, from a violation of one of  our most sacrosanct principles of the country, which is this idea that  this democracy is rooted in the ideal of representative democracy, the  separation of powers, and most certainly the idea that you can't have  taxation without representation. In fact, DC residents pay more  [[Page S692]]  per capita in Federal taxes than any other State, but yet they have no  say in the Federal Government.   Madam President, 700,000 Americans, in one of the only expressions of  representative democracy available to them, have 13 council people who  were part of a process. As was said already by my colleague, the  council members completed the monumental task of modernizing the 120- year-old DC Criminal Code to make it more consistent, clarifying  conflicting provisions, and bringing it in line not just with current  best practices reflected in the majority of States' criminal codes but  in trying to address the urgencies of the moment wherein you have a  city that is deeply concerned about the crime in its community.   DC's efforts are not unique. There are 37 States that have gone  through similar processes--so-called red States, so-called blue States,  and purple States.   The process was spearheaded, as my colleague said, by the independent  DC Criminal Code Reform Commission, which was a nonpartisan agency that  was very representative of prosecutors and victims' rights advocates.  All of these nonpolitical people came and unanimously endorsed what we  have before us today.   Now, the first time any partisan politician got involved was with the  City Council just voting to confirm this nonpartisan body's unanimous  recommendations. It was to that process that the Republican leader  said: Oh, it looks like, with what they did, they are in need of adult  supervision.   Think of how patronizing and paternalistic that is for this body, not  being any part of this process, now suddenly saying they need adult  supervision as if they are children.   The DC Criminal Code was about keeping DC safe. It is what the  prosecutors involved said and what the U.S. Attorney's Office said: We  need to do this to create a safer city because of the confusion in the  code and the lack of having criminal penalties at all for certain  crimes. All of these things opened up opportunities for DC not to have  the security they wanted. So this was about DC's safety.   Unfortunately, it is now embroiled in scare tactics, where political,  opportunistic actions are taking place to try to use this as a way to  win political points. Even the media, for whom I have tremendous  respect for its role, has been more keen on asking questions about the  political analysis than actually the facts of what DC has done.   What DC has done in this bill is to actually create a tougher element  on crime, tougher laws on crime. In looking at the totality of this  bill, it is impossible to say that it isn't about making DC safer and  having tougher penalties on crime.   My colleague went through some of this. It actually quadruples the  maximum penalty for attempted murder, and it triples the maximum  penalty for sexual assault because people in DC see those as serious  crimes, and they want to seriously increase the consequences for them.   DC is pro-police officer, so what did they do? They doubled the  maximum penalty for misdemeanor assaults on police officers, and they  increased by 40 percent the maximum penalty for a felony assault on a  police officer.   Washington, DC, knows that there is too much gun violence and that  they need to take action against it, so it quadruples the maximum  penalty for the possession of assault rifles, for ghost guns, for  restricted explosive devices. I know the NRA doesn't want laws like  this, but DC residents do. It doubles the maximum penalties for  possession of a firearm or a bump stock--tougher laws on guns, more  serious penalties.   DC's Criminal Code actually modernizes and creates new categories of  offenses that aren't currently crimes. It creates new offenses for  negligent homicide. It creates new offenses for reckless endangerment  with a firearm. It creates new offenses by expanding liability for  sexual assault, including for the sexual abuse of a minor. It expands  liability for the possession of sexual images of children.   This is a city that came together and said: We want to protect our  children. We want to protect sexual assault victims. We want to better  protect our police officers. We want to better protect people from  murder. But no. This body now, in a rush of politics, is going to  prevent a city from protecting itself.   It actually increases the protections for domestic violence victims.  It criminalizes strangulation as a felony, which is currently very  difficult to even prosecute. In fact, every State but South Carolina  has closed this loophole, but this body is going to stop them from  doing it today. It criminalizes nonconsensual conduct as a felony and  quadruples the maximum penalty. It helps the victims of domestic  violence better obtain civil protection orders because the current law  lacks clarity and makes it very hard to do this.   Let me say this again. By rejecting this law today, by voting against  this, people, in the name of being tough on crime, are actually the  people who are preventing a city from better protecting itself--from  better protecting its children, its sexual assault victims, its police  officers. I mean, think about that.   I have not, in my 10 years in the Senate, seen such a distortion of  facts, such a misrepresentation of what something is. The RCCA sets new  maximum penalties for armed carjackings--my friend talked about that-- and their carjacking laws now have a maximum penalty higher than  Georgia, Kansas, North Dakota, and Kentucky. Maybe we should do a  unanimous consent request right now saying that Kentucky is too soft on  crime because DC wants higher maximum penalties.    It sets new maximum penalties for unarmed carjackings higher than  Georgia, higher than Iowa, higher than North Dakota, higher than  Tennessee and Kentucky. The very Senators coming down here to criticize  laws--Senators from Tennessee I have seen today, from Kentucky, from  Iowa--actually, their States have lower maximum penalties than what DC  is trying to do, but they are going to stop DC from doing it.   Armed robbery, the same thing--higher maximum penalties than North  Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio.   The same thing for unarmed robbery--higher than Kansas, higher than  South Dakota, higher than Tennessee, the sponsor of this bill, and  Kentucky.   Yes, they may be lowering the maximum penalty, but it is still higher  than so many States of the Republicans pushing this bill and not  speaking to the facts of it.   I am a former big-city mayor, and there are communities like  Washington, DC, all over this country that are trying to fight crime.  Many of them have significant numbers of African Americans as a  percentage of their population who have higher rates of victimization.  Those cities are grappling with this. They feel a sense of urgency.   That is why this bill actually is raising penalties, putting in new  criminal statutes, and making sure that so many of their laws are  tougher than even many of the red States, like Kentucky and Tennessee  here.   That is what happens in a city that has elected representatives that  know that their No. 1 job is to protect the community because those  communities often are being more victimized than Senators and their  families are in their States.   Give DC what we believe was a revolutionary idea then but not a  revolutionary idea now, which is to let them protect themselves. Don't  strip them of their ability to protect themselves. Don't take away  their ability to protect their children. Don't take away their ability  to create laws that protect their police officers. Don't take away  their ability in this law to protect their citizens--700,000 residents  who do not have a voice in this body, 700,000 residents who are about  to have a law that will better protect them overturned because of  politics, because of opportunism, because of the big divisions in our  country that tear our Nation apart.   But DC is united in its fight for self-determination, for  representation, for safety, and security. Those are the ideals that  started America, and this body shouldn't interrupt a city trying to  live its American ideals that we take for granted but they, obviously,  today, are still fighting for.   I yield the floor, and I give my apologies to the great Senator from  Oregon.    Madam President, I have 17 requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate.
