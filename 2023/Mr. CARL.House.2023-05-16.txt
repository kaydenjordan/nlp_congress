 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the U.S. Fish  and Wildlife proposal regulating and banning lead ammo and fishing  tackle from our public lands across this country.   So many of us grew up hunting and fishing with our parents, our  grandparents, and our friends. Some of my best memories are with my  kids and grandkids when I have taken them hunting and fishing in those  quiet moments that we have together when we can talk about life lessons  and about the things that, as families, we need to pass on.   These traditions will cease to exist if we allow this proposal to  come into effect by U.S. Fish and Wildlife.   In my opinion, enjoying the great outdoors with our friends and  families is one of the most important and special parts of the American  Dream. Unfortunately, the Biden administration is planning to impose  more rules and regulations even on our most basic rights.   I have huge concerns over these actions. Low-cost lead for ammunition  and fishing gear made of lead is commonly used by all of us. Banning  them will essentially be the same as putting a ``no hunting'' sign on  millions of acres of land and kicking people off waterways across this  Nation.   Access to hunting and fishing on public land is important in this  country, and we cannot allow the Biden administration to take away  these rights because they would rather listen to the far-left  environmentalist groups than trust the science and leave law-abiding  Americans alone.   Whether they are attempting to ban gas stoves, force expensive  electric vehicles on everyone, or tell us what kind of ammunition we  can hunt with or what type of fishing lures we can use, this  administration seems determined to chip away at our constitutional  rights.   Many years ago, I took a hunter safety course from a blind gentleman  who could no longer see to hunt and fish, but his way of reliving all  of those memories was teaching a hunter safety course. He taught me  that you will never control guns because you can make a gun out of  virtually anything.   The way to control guns, by an old gunsmith who is living his dreams  through his blind eyes, is ammunition. Don't think for a second this  lead bill is about wildlife. This bill is about controlling the lead  that we use in our guns and not controlling the guns themselves. This  man had wisdom. This was 30 years ago. It has just taken them a little  while to get to it.   What is the next step? Will the next step be banning all lead from  being used in hunting? How is that going to limit our hunting? Who is  that going to limit that can afford to hunt?  [[Page H2358]]    This is a slippery slope we don't have to go down. We have to stop it  now. We cannot give them the first bite of the apple by saying that we  cannot use lead on government property.   I can promise you that I will do all I can to stop this from  happening and ensure that this administration can try to do nothing  similar to this.   I encourage all American hunting and fishing clubs, whether you are a  shooter, a hunter, a fisherman of any type, to do something. Speak out.  Talk to your legislators. Reach out to the President. Make some phone  calls. Let your voice be heard today.   Don't wait until after something gets passed because this proposal  will kill our sport as we know it, and we have to fight back.                            ____________________
