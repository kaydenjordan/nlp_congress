 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  the SELF DRIVE Act. With over 127,000 vehicle crashes in Pennsylvania  in 2015, advances in deploying self-driving technology are critical to  helping make our roads safer.   Importantly, self-driving cars can also increase mobility for seniors  and individuals with disabilities and can reduce carbon emissions.   As with many innovations, we must recognize the importance of safety,  including cybersecurity vulnerabilities, when it comes to self-driving  cars.   Provisions of my cybersecurity legislation, which were included as  part of the bill we are voting on today, directs the Secretary of  Transportation to create a Federal advisory council on cybersecurity.  The council will be responsible for gathering information and providing  advice related to the cybersecurity of self-driving vehicles, and it  will ensure both public and private sector stakeholders are  communicating about cybersecurity concerns before they become a crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Walden, Chairman Latta, and staff for  their work to bring this bill to the floor.
