 Mr. Chair, should parents have the right to be  involved in their child's education?   That is the question before us. Seventy-two percent of Americans have  answered ``yes'' to that question. Parents should be and want to be  involved in their child's education.   According to numerous studies, students who have involved parents  have better behavior, better grades, better attendance, and develop a  lifelong love of learning, which is the key to long-term success.   Today, American parents are fed up, largely because they have  experienced 2 years of school closures, misguided COVID policies,  disastrous remote learning, and a curriculum focused on what is woke  rather than what is essential academic instruction. They have been  branded ``domestic terrorists'' for speaking out at school boards. Some  were even arrested for having the nerve to plead with school boards  about the safety of their child at school.   Mr. Chair, it is time to re-welcome parents back into education. It  is time for parents to have the right to know what is going on in  American education today. That is why I--and I encourage everybody--to  support H.R. 5, the Parents Bill of Rights Act, critical legislation  that empowers parents and prioritizes the needs of students over  entrenched special interest groups.   Today, this body has an extraordinary opportunity to reclaim the  moral high ground in America and usher in a newer era of K-12 education  that empowers parents, protects kids, and expands educational freedom.   American parents have said they want to be a part of their children's  education. It is time for this body to say ``yes'' and support parents.
