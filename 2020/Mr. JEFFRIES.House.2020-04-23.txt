 Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished chair for his  tremendous leadership.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this emergency spending  legislation. More must be done, but it is a strong step in the right  direction.   The COVID-19 pandemic is ravaging America. Small businesses are  shuttered. Thousands have died. Millions of Americans are unemployed.   Rome is burning.   We can either put out the fire or watch our great Nation go down in  flames.   This bill will help family-owned businesses, help women-owned  businesses, help minority-owned businesses, help small family farmers,  and help our hospitals and our nursing homes.   Yes, it is not perfect, but we cannot allow the perfect to be the  enemy of the good.   We are here to legislate, not just pontificate.   Vote ``yes'' and live to fight another day.
