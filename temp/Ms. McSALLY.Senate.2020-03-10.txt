 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, last week, I cosponsored a bipartisan  resolution honoring the three American firefighters who lost their  lives fighting Australia's bush fires this year, including First  Officer Paul Hudson, from Buckeye, AZ. Each of these men gave the  ultimate sacrifice in service to others.   Paul dedicated his life to protecting others, first as a marine and  then as a firefighter. He served in the Marine Corps for 20 years,  including as a C-130 pilot, before retiring as a lieutenant colonel.  Paul graduated from the Naval Academy in 1999 and later went on to earn  a master's degree in business administration and information technology  management from the Naval Postgraduate School.   When aid was needed in Australia to combat the devastating wildfires,  Paul jumped into action and put his life on the line to help others. He  was only 42 years old when he was killed in a plane crash while  fighting to extinguish these awful fires. My heart and my prayers, and  Arizona's heart and Arizona's prayers, go out to his wife, Noreen, and  her loss. Arizona will not forget Paul's immense selflessness and his  sacrifice.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
