 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 511, the  ``Power and Security Systems Act of 2017, which will revise energy  conservation standards for devices operating in standby mode.   In the early 1970s, I recall, as many of my colleagues do, the impact  to our nation's economy when OPEC nations withheld oil from the United  States causing one of the greatest peace-time energy shortages in  United States history.   One of the remedial steps taken by the Carter Administration was the  promulgation of regulations that required large appliances and  equipment that used electricity to default to a power down mode when  not in use.   Today, we take for granted that machines power down when not in use,  but this one change in energy policy over the last 4o years has saved  taxpayers, which includes businesses and private homes, billions of  dollars in energy costs.  [[Page H568]]    This was only one policy solution that was used to reduce our  nation's dependence on foreign oil so that energy could go to vital  services like fuel for electricity generation, gasoline, heating fuels,  and diesel oil.   H.R. 511, the bill before us would extend energy conservation to  digital technology that can operate in standby mode.   Most digital device technology manufactures already provide sleep  mode on their devices to assist their users in conserving power on  cellphones, smartphones, MP3 players, e-book readers, as well as  desktop and laptop computers.   Today, 68 percent of U.S. adults own a smartphone, up from 35 percent  in 2011, and tablet computer ownership has edged up to 45 percent among  adults, according to newly released survey data from the Pew Research  Center.   Considering not just smartphones, but all types of mobile phones, Pew  notes that cellphones continue to top of the list.   Roughly nine-in-ten American adults or 92 percent own a mobile phone  of some kind.   Although these mobile devices are ubiquitous today, the share of  adults who own one has risen substantially since 2004.   Smartphone ownership is nearing the saturation point with some  groups: 1. 86 percent of those ages 18-29; 2. 83 percent of those ages  30-49; and 3. 87 percent of those living in households earning $75,000  and up annually own smartphones.   These facts highlight the importance of energy conservation for  mobile communication users.   The battery life for these devices is limited and without power they  are of no use to the user.   This bill will help users remain connected as long as possible  because the energy consumption on their cellphones and other digital  devices will be minimized when they are not in use.   Energy conservation will also assist consumers during times when  power outages may occur due to weather or other electricity disruption.   The longer power life for cellphones will benefit consumers by  reducing the amount of electricity needed to recharge their personal  devices.   This bill will also benefit businesses that often have many computers  that when in use can consume electricity if left on after business  hours--especially over weekends.   For these reasons, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R.  511.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 587, the  ``Fair Ratepayer Accountability, Transparency, and Efficiency Standards  Act'' (Fair RATES Act), which amends the Federal Power Act to permit  administrative and judicial review of any rate change filed by a public  utility that takes effect without the approval of the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission (FERC).   The need for this change became evident in the wake of a New England  Forward Capacity Market Auction in 2014, which occurred at a time when  FERC only had 4 Commissioners.   When the New England Forward Capacity Market Auction issue was  addressed by FERC, the Commissioners split evenly over the question of  whether the auction results were just and reasonable.   Since FERC did not disapprove the auction results, wholesale  electricity prices in New England increased dramatically; and   So, while rates went up, none of the affected parties could challenge  the decision or resulting rate increase, and, therefore, no rehearing  or judicial review was possible.   H.R. 587 provides those who want to challenge similar rulings or non- decisions by FERC the ability to challenge the decision  administratively or in the courts.   The bill ensures that stakeholders have recourse when a non-decision  by FERC has very real consequences for consumers, producers and others.   This bill would also improve the process by which FERC votes are  reconsidered.   I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 587.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 423, the  ``Anti-Spoofing Act of 2017,'' which amends the Communications Act of  1934, to make it unlawful to cause a caller identification service to  knowingly transmit inaccurate caller identification information with  the intent to: defraud, cause harm, or wrongfully obtain anything of  value.   Spoofing is a practice in which a phone number shown on a phone or  caller identification device deliberately is falsified.   Spoofing is a commonly used tool for a number of illegal practices,  including ``phishing'' for personal information and ``swatting''-- calling in a fictitious crime in progress in order to generate-a-police  response.   The Truth in Caller ID Act of 2009 prohibits spoofing of voice caller  identification information; however, as communications methods and  consumer habits continue to evolve, so do the attempts by third parties  to gain personal information for criminal use.   Many Americans now rely on text messaging to stay connected.   According to CTIA, in 2015, Americans sent over 156 billion text  messages per month.   H.R. 423, the Anti-Spoofing Act, will extend the provisions of the  Truth in Caller ID Act to include text messaging and text messaging  services.   The legislation adds a definition of ``spoofing service'' to the  statute, addressing the growth of services that allows a user to  knowingly transmit misleading or inaccurate caller identification  information.   In addition, it extends the prohibitions to any person or service  placing an international call to a recipient within the United States.   Additionally, H.R. 423 will revise the definitions of ``caller  identification information'' and  [[Page H579]]  ``caller identification service'' to include text messages sent using a  text messaging service.   It defines ``text message'' as real-time messages consisting of text,  images, sounds, or other information transmitted from or received by a  device identified by a telephone number.   It also includes in the definition both, real-time and two-way voice  or video communications, addressing the emerging law enforcement issue  of ``swatting'' by which people can purposefully misdirect valuable,  police efforts and resources.   This bill takes the right approach targeting behavior, while  protecting innovations that are important to the digital economy.   As the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, I  understand the vital need to safeguard against caller identification  spoofing.   For example, women's abuse shelters and law enforcement officers  working undercover have a need to protect their clients' identities.   This bill seeks to target those who have the intent to cause harm or  commit a crime.   I support this legislation because it protects the consumer from  criminal behavior, while protecting our fundamental right to privacy.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 588,  ``Securing Access to Networks in Disaster Act'', which requires the  Federal Communications Commission to submit to Congress and publish on  the FCC website a study on the: public safety benefits, technical  feasibility, and cost of providing the public with access to 9-1-1  services during times of emergency when mobile service is unavailable.   As a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee, I am well  aware of the importance of telephone service during disasters.   The Securing Access to Networks in Disasters (SANDy) Act seeks to  ensure the resiliency of the nation's communications networks during  emergencies.   Acquiring cellphone service during a massive natural or manmade  disaster is often difficult, if not impossible, and this is why this  piece of legislation is so essential.   During the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks that destroyed the  World Trade Center in New York City, cellphone service was severely  disrupted, forcing many callers to repeatedly dial to get through to 9- 1-1 emergency services.   On that day, some of the most tragic, heart wrenching calls came from  those trapped in the Twin Towers.   It is not only during terrorist attacks that cellphone services are  severely disrupted, but also natural disasters such as Hurricane  Katrina, which claimed the lives of over 1,800 people.   The SANDy Act would ensure that during an emergency, consumers' cell  phones work on other carriers' networks if a consumer's own network  goes down.   H.R. 588 would give priority to calls to 9-1-1 services and emergency  alerts.   It also would increase coordination between wireless carriers,  utilities, and public safety officials by creating a directory of the  contact information for relevant disaster response officials.   The bill would require the FCC to report to Congress regarding  whether additional outage data should be provided in times of  emergency.   In addition, the bill requires the FCC to report to Congress on the  viability of providing 9-1-1 services over Wi-Fi hotspots during  emergencies.   H.R. 588 would be of immense benefit to the 18th Congressional  District and the greater Houston area.   On April 17-18, 2016, Houston experienced a historic flood event that  claimed the lives of eight people; damaged over 1,150 households;  disrupted hundreds of businesses; closed community centers, schools,  and places of worship due to flood waters.   On April 25, President Obama granted the request for federal  Individual Assistance for Harris County residences and business owners  who were affected by severe weather and flooding.   Unfortunately, that was not the end of the story of flooding in  Houston for 2016--in early June another record setting rainfall led to  catastrophic flooding throughout the Houston area.   I am grateful to President Obama and the great work of those at the  Department of Homeland Security who worked tirelessly to help people  after both 2016 flood events.   I spoke on the House Floor several times about the floods and the  suffering caused by the waters that came through our communities-- damaging homes, our schools, places of business, and our places of  worship.   The flooding problems in the Houston area are frequent, widespread,  and severe, with projects to reduce flood risks in place that are  valued at several billion dollars   In 2015, the Houston and surrounding area experienced widespread  historic flooding.   The importance of being able to contact emergency responders in the  case of natural disasters is critical in order to save the lives of  those directly affected by such events.   The SANDy Act would provide telecommunication access to victims of  natural and man-made disasters.   The SANDy Act amends the Stafford Act to ensure that all  communications providers:   1. Have the ability to access relevant disaster stricken areas during  emergencies to restore service; and   2. Are included in the universal credentialing program for essential  service providers   The SANDy Act would recognize the critical role that all  communications providers--broadcasters, cable, and telecommunications-- serve in emergencies, but most notably, the bill would ensure consumers  have access to wireless service even if their cellphone service  provider's wireless network goes down.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 588, the  ``Securing Access to Networks in Disaster Act.''    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 460, the  ``Improving Rural Call Quality and Reliability Act of 2017'', which  amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require voice communications  that charge users to register with the FCC, and comply with service  quality standards to be established by the FCC.   The bill, should it become law, prohibits long-distance providers  from using an internet provider to transmit voice communications and  signals unless the intermediate provider is registered.   H.R. 460 would require the FCC to:   1. Ensure the integrity of voice communications to all customers in  the United States,   2. Prevent unjust or unreasonable discrimination across areas of the  United States in the delivery of voice communications; and  [[Page H586]]    3. Make a registry of intermediate providers publicly available on  the FCC website.   H.R. 460, the Improving Rural Call Quality and Reliability Act of  2016, would seek to ensure that calls to Americans living in the rural  areas of our country actually make it through to the intended receiver.   Making sure a call goes through, regardless of where it is being  made, is fundamental to our communications system.   H.R. 460 would require the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to  establish basic quality standards for providers that transmit voice  calls to consumers, among other things.   The Senate Commerce Committee adopted an amendment in the nature of a  substitute (AINS) that made the following changes:   1. Extends deadlines for service quality standards for intermediate  providers from 180 days to one year,   2. Exempts intermediate providers that have been certified as a safe  harbor provider; and   3. Amends the definition of intermediate provider.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 460, the  ``Improving Rural Call Quality and Reliability Act of 2017.''    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 582, the  Kari's Law Act of 2017, which amends the Communications Act of 1934 to  require multi-line telephone systems to have a configuration that  permits users to directly initiate a call 9-1-1 without dialing any  additional digit, code, prefix, or post-fix.   As a senior member of the House Committees on Homeland Security and  Judiciary, I am well aware of the importance of 9-1-1 services and some  of the challenges of E-9-1-1 to ensure that those seeking emergency  assistance receive the help they need.   H.R. 582 would create parity for landline ``9-1-1 services'' and  smartphone E-9-1-1 services'' so that emergency assistance request from  either is treated the same.   The bill requires that those engaged in the manufacturing,  importation, sale, and lease of telecommunication service or devices  pre-configured technology to dial 9-1-1.   The goal of H.R. 582 is to ensure that all emergency calls regardless  of the source are routed properly to emergency services.   Kari's Law is not intended to alter the authority of State  commissions or other State or local agencies with jurisdiction over  emergency communications.   The establishment of the Kari's Law Act acknowledges the importance  of the configuration of multi-line telephones systems for direct  dialing for 9-1-1.   Over the past two decades, the personal communications of Americans  have changed.   The Wireless Association reported that the penetration of cellular  devices surpassed 100 percent in 2012, and as of the latest 2014  report, penetration is now at 110 percent.   According to the Pew Research Center, 68 percent of U.S. adults have  a smartphone, up from 35 percent in 2011, and tablet computer ownership  has edged up to 45 percent among adults, according to newly released  survey data from the Pew Research Center.   Smartphone ownership is nearing the saturation point with some  groups: 86 percent of those ages 18 through 29 have a smartphone, as do  83 percent of those ages 30 through 49 and 87 percent of those living  in households earning $75,000 and up annually.   With so many mobile devices deployed the majority of calls to 911  emergency public safety answering points (PSAP) originate from them.   U.S. emergency dispatch agencies report that wireless callers are  responsible for at least 80 percent of their emergency call volume.   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to Support H.R. 582, Kari's  Law Act of 2017.    Mr. Speaker, having worked for the Southern  Christian Leadership Conference and been engaged with many of the foot  soldiers that studied under Dr. Martin Luther King, I love and cherish  nonviolent protests and the rights for people to petition.   I hold up a beautiful and powerful statement by way of a picture,  powerful together, as thousands marched across the Nation, upwards of 1  million and maybe even more. I am particularly proud of those in  Houston, Texas, and particularly ``Across Texas, marchers `just can't  be silent anymore.' ''   Congratulations to those who marched safely, securely, and  nonviolently. Congratulations to the Houston organizers. Yes, it is  your right to fight against the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, the  ignoring of the funding of access to women's health care. It is your  right to fight for educational opportunity. It is your right to  recognize that we have rights as women, but we have rights as  Americans; and it is your right to seek a nation that will be  representative of all of the people, no matter where they come from,  what their religious background is, what regions they live for.   It is beyond the wonderful Midwest that the Nation needs to be  represented. It is in the far corners of the east and the north, yes,  down in Houston, Texas, far to the west. We cannot isolate and say we  won with few votes from this region. America is a country for all  people, and I look forward to this Congress and this White House  representing all of us.                            ____________________     I thank the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands and  the gentleman from Texas for their service to the Nation and for  leading the Congressional Black Caucus Special Order. It is always  important for the voices of the Congressional Black Caucus and the  chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Mr. Richmond of Louisiana,  to be heard. Both Ms. Plaskett and Mr. Veasey have accepted the  challenge and the call. I want to express to them my greatest  appreciation for the leadership that they are showing.                                time  2045    I want to start my remarks again by saying that it may be hometown  pride, but I like the headline of the Houston Chronicle that says  ``Powerful Together.'' The numbers have not yet been fully calculated,  but we know upwards of a million and maybe over a million persons  around the Nation, and then they added individuals from foreign  countries far and wide. I would take by this title that represents, Mr.  Speaker, the peaceful protests--I want to say that again; in fact, I  might want to say it two times: peaceful, peaceful protests, nonviolent  protests--that occurred on Saturday, expressing the view of what  America is really about.   I say that to my colleagues, they are about what the Congressional  Black Caucus is about, and I believe our chairman made the point that  we come from very diverse districts, representing people of many racial  backgrounds, religious backgrounds, as well as economic backgrounds,  that we are the voice of reason and the conscience of this Congress. We  fight against poverty, but we have Ph.D.'s, lawyers, judges, and we  have businesspersons. They, by and large, Mr. Speaker, are charitable  individuals who believe in social justice.   That is why we come with a sense of privilege, if you will, to be  able to speak about what America truly is. Yesterday at the Community  of Faith, under the leadership of Bishop James Dixon, I gathered for a  prayer for the Nation. Mr. Speaker, I did not dissect it. I did not  eliminate the White House. I did not point out Members of Congress,  call them by name. I said a prayer for the Nation, and that included  the White House and individuals in the Congress and the Senate. We had  international representation. We had the Consulate General of Pakistan.  We had imams. We had individuals who worship on Saturday Sabbath. We  had people who spoke Spanish, people who spoke, obviously, English. And  we gathered to pray for the nation. That is what I think is represented  in the message or the title of the ``New Deal for Black America,'' it  needs prayer because it is not reflective. Although well-intentioned, I  am not sure who may have advised the administration, but it does not  speak to the wideness of diversity of the African American population,  African American communities in this Nation.   So I want to speak very briefly on questions of health care and  justice. I would like to say that in the safe communities of which the  administration or the President has offered his new deal, he says: ``We  will make our communities safe again. Every poor African-American child  must be able to walk down the street in peace. Safety is a civil right.  We will invest in training and funding both local and federal law  enforcement operations to remove the gang members, drug dealers, and  criminal cartels from our neighborhoods. The reduction of crime is not  merely a goal--but a necessity.''   In that there is no mention of ending gun violence or looking at  sensible gun safety regulations or laws, of which we have asked. I  introduced Gun Violence Reduction Resources Act, which really answered  Republicans' cry for enforcing the law, to add to the ATF, to enforce  the penalties against those who use guns wrong. In particular, the  perpetrator in Mother Emanuel should not have been able to get the gun,  but he was because the gun dealer was so easy and quick to sell it,  even though he had not gotten an affirmation by ATF, that is the one. I  would argue it was because they did not have enough personnel.   He also seems to categorize that every poor child has to walk down  the streets. We want every child to walk down--as I said, our community  is very diverse. He then says: ``Equal Justice Under the Law. We will  apply the law fairly, equally and without prejudice. There will be only  one set of rules--not a two-tiered system of justice. Equal justice  also means the same rules for Wall Street.''   So I quickly want to offer these points before I yield the floor.  Number one, we are not all impoverished, but I join my colleagues in  ending poverty. African Americans want the same thing as Barbara Jordan  said when asked, ``What do your people want?''   ``It is the same thing that all America wants.''   Yes, we do want opportunities, but we do have to be more forceful for  issues that are relevant.   We have seen nothing in Mr. Trump's statement of a new deal for Black  America to deal with sentencing reduction and ending mandatory  minimums. We see nothing about working with police departments that  have found themselves falling upon bad times and having a plague of bad  actors, even though we respect and honor police. And so the Law  Enforcement Trust and Integrity Act that John Conyers and myself  introduced has to do with correcting the issue of training and the  improper inaction of police and community.   I would offer to say that the nominee for the Attorney General is  completely opposed to addressing any questions of bad behavior on  behalf of bad actors and bad officers. In fact, he opposed consent  decrees like the one in Ferguson and Baltimore that were only positive,  welcomed by the police departments to help them do a better job at  policing the community.   Prison reform to change the matrix of prison, gun violence prevention  that I have already mentioned, and healthcare access that are truly  crucial to all of us.   Let me also indicate a changing of the matrix of juvenile justice. We  want to reauthorize the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant Program  Reauthorization Act, but, more importantly, we want to change how we  are dealing with juveniles. We want to change from the idea of them  being, if you will, punished versus incentivized.   Finally, let me offer to say that two Senators in the other body have  offered a new matrix on health care. I understand there are some  proposals here. I would say that we see that we can't have unity. We  don't have any replacement. What is being offered by the Senators is  health savings accounts, which we know are not realistic. So I would  offer to the President that there are many ways of looking at serving  all of America, including African Americans. It is not listening to  your own voice. It is helping us change the matrix for  juveniles, changing the matrix for those who are incarcerated,  mandatory minimums, the way police and community work, at the same time  respecting them, but, more importantly, it is listening and working  with Members who have real life experiences in some of the issues that  will make this country continue to be the greatest country in the  world.    I thank the gentlewoman for her courtesies.    I thank the gentlewoman.   Mr. Speaker, I was struck by some information that I just received.  This is a summary of the new deal for Black America. Nowhere in the new  deal for Black America is a commitment to protecting voting rights. One  of the Achilles heels of the nominee for the Attorney General is he  does not have a history of protecting voting rights.   Particularly, I want to acknowledge President George W. Bush because  the Congress--both the House and the Senate--worked extensively with  him in the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, including  section 5, which is preclearance. Lo and behold, the Shelby case  imploded section 5. We no longer have it in a potpourri--a flourishing,  a garden of weeds--of voter ID laws, one by which my colleague Mr.  Veasey, who was a plaintiff, was promoted.   The last point that I want to make is, in addition to not having  anything on voting rights, we just had breaking news that the White  House has indicated that the President would have had the popular vote  if he had not had happen to him 3 to 5 million illegal votes cast. This  is being reported. Likewise, what is being reported is there is  absolutely no evidence that there were 3 to 5 million illegal votes  cast in the 2016 election. I think we need to have focus on voting  rights and on the protection of those who vote.
