 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this  motion.   The underlying bill raises taxes on millions of middle class working  Americans; it adds over $2.3 trillion to our national debt; and if the  Senate has its way, 13 million people will lose their healthcare.   This bill was written behind closed doors by a handful of Republicans  to give massive permanent tax breaks to corporations at the cost of our  middle class working Americans. Not one legislative hearing was held in  the House on this bill. The Senate bill was passed in the dark hours of  the night with scribbles in the margins.   Every single person in our country should know how their Member of  Congress voted on this, because you and your children will be paying  for it for decades to come.   This is a bad bill. I hope this will be a serious conference to  improve this reckless piece of legislation.
