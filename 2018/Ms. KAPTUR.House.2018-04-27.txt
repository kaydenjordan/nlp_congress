 Mr. Speaker, the majority in this House has just exacted  a great injustice. The unwarranted, unjust, forced resignation of a  sworn officer of this United States House, the House Chaplain, Patrick  Conroy, is a complete, complete violation of justice. It is also a  complete violation of the rules of this House and the 229-year  precedents of this House.   As well, Speaker Paul Ryan's unilateral decision to remove the House  Chaplain, who is elected by the entire membership of this House, is  simply wrong. The Chaplain deserves just and fair treatment by every  Member of this body that would attend to any Member who is subjected to  such treatment or any citizen in our country who appears before the  law. Every life in our Nation should matter.    And the lives and reputations of the officers of this  House should matter. Our heads should hang low today----    * * *    Mr. Speaker, Father Conroy has served this institute  honorably for the past seven years. He is only one of two Roman  Catholic clerics ever to have served as pastor for the U.S. House of  Representatives since the founding of our Republic 229 years ago, of 60  who have served. As an elected officer of this House, the Chaplain  serves as its spiritual leader, abiding the heavy weight that the  Chaplain bears for hundreds of Members, their families, hundreds more  staff members, visitors and others who seek guidance and help. From  what is trickling out in the media, this political crucifixion of  Father Conway was executed following a visit from Speaker Paul Ryan's  Chief of Staff in which Fr. Conway's resignation was demanded. Fr.  Conroy complied. He transmitted a letter of resignation under coercion  on April 15. On April 16, under cover of convoluted parliamentary  procedure, with the vast membership of this institution unnoticed and  unaware, Speaker Ryan requested ascension from the entire body. But who  in this House even knew procedurally what was occurring? There was no  notice. There was no prior House official proceeding to hear this  matter. There was no one to object as no Member other than the Speaker  and his inner circle knew what the Speaker was demanding.   In such an important matter of a human being's life and reputation,  what happened to our House Rules? What happened to regular order? This  forced resignation is without cause. It is unprecedented. It is wrong.  It is simply a unilateral decision and abuse of power by the Speaker  who himself will soon leave Congress. He should hang his head. The  Speaker solely delivered an honorable man up for political crucifixion  without hearing or trial.   Justice in such a consequential action demands the full attention and  engagement of this entire House. It is not the prerogative of a single  individual, no matter how powerful that individual may feel he is. The  Speaker's action is a violation of the fundamental Rules of this House.  It cannot stand the light of scrutiny. This consequential decision  about a human being's life was summarily imposed with no justice, no  consultation, and importantly a complete abdication of our House Rules  and Constitutional precedents. It must be overturned. Justice and  regular order must return to this House.

Rep. Marcy Kaptur told Roll Call that she believes a House       vote is necessary to remove a chaplain, as the position is       considered an ``officer of the House.''        Conroy submitted a letter of resignation on Thursday at       Ryan's request, and a bipartisan group of lawmakers told The       Hill that Conroy was forced out by the speaker.        ``[His departure was] more than a little suspicious,''       Kaptur told Roll Call.        The reason behind Conroy's ouster is unclear, though       Democratic sources told The Hill it was because Conroy       offered a prayer on the House floor that could have been       interpreted as critical of the GOP tax law, legislation       strongly championed by Ryan.        Kaptur said she wants to find a bipartisan solution, which       could include a privileged resolution to reinstate Conroy.        ``I don't want to make it a partisan thing,'' she said.       ``This is about a person and justice has to prevail.''        ``For me as a Catholic, with everything else that has gone       in my church with cover-ups and all the rest, I feel a       special responsibility to not have someone's reputation       damaged,'' she said, adding that she thinks the chaplain was       ``deeply hurt'' by the situation.                                   ____                       [From Roll Call, Apr. 26, 2018]      Kaptur Exploring Legislative Reprieve for Ousted House Chaplain         Ohio Democrat said any legislation she proposes would be       bipartisan.                           (By Lindsey McPherson)         Rep. Marcy Kaptur does not believe Speaker Paul D. Ryan has       authority to remove House Chaplain Patrick J. Conroy without       a vote of the House. And she's exploring legislation to       prevent his ouster.        Conroy submitted a letter of resignation April 15 at the       speaker's request that was read on the House floor the       following day. Ryan's spokeswoman AshLee Strong confirmed       that Ryan sought the Jesuit priest's resignation but did not       provide a reason why.        Rep. Walter B. Jones, R-N.C., and Joe Crowley, D-N.Y., both       pointed to a prayer that Conroy delivered on the tax overhaul       as the reason he was asked to leave. Jones said he spoke with       Conroy and he confirmed that, saying the only intended       meaning of the prayer was that the tax bill should help       everyone.        ``As legislation on taxes continues to be debated this week       and next, may all Members be mindful that the institutions       and structures of our great Nation guarantee the       opportunities that have allowed some to achieve great       success, while others continue to struggle,'' Conroy said his       Nov. 6 prayer on the House floor. ``May their efforts these       days guarantee that there are not winners and losers under       new tax laws, but benefits balanced and shared by all       Americans.''        A senior GOP aide said there was not a specific prayer that       led to Ryan's decision. Conroy's resignation comes more than       five months after he delivered the prayer on the tax debate       but just days after Ryan announced his plans to retire from       Congress at the end of his term.        ``If we cannot protect freedom of prayer on the floor of       the House, there is no hope for America. None,'' Jones said.       ``This chaplain is elected by all the members we vote on. And       this should be a vote by all the members for him not to be       here.''                             No rule for removal?         Like Jones, Kaptur also spoke with Conroy, who was       reluctant to talk about his resignation but upon her pressing       revealed it was a request from the speaker.        ``I said, `But why?' and he didn't say anything,'' she       said. ``So I went back to my staff and . . . looked at the       rules of procedure for the House under the section dealing       with the chaplain. . . . As an officer of the House, this       should have consideration if there's no cause. I mean what's       the cause?''        Indeed the Jefferson's Manual and Rules of the House of       Representatives identifies the chaplain as an officer of the       House, along with the speaker, clerk, sergeant-at-arms and       chief administrative officer. The manual says the officers       shall be elected at the commencement of each Congress.        While the speaker's term expires with the conclusion of       each Congress, the other officers ``continue in office until       their successors are chosen and qualified,'' the manual says.        ``The clerk, sergeant-at-arms, and chief administrative       officer may be removed by the House or by the speaker,'' the       manual says, while making no mention of the procedure for       removing the chaplain.        If the matter should be subject to a vote it's unclear       whether Conroy waived that by submitting his resignation.                             Legislative remedy?         Kaptur is continuing to dig into the matter. The longest-      serving woman in the House said she has not seen anything       like this in her nearly three dozen years serving in this       institution.        ``I don't think it's fair,'' she said, calling the Conroy's       ouster ``more than a little suspicious.''        Asked if there's a procedural action members could take,       like filing a privileged resolution reinstate Conroy, Kaptur       said, ``I am certainly of that mind. But I want to work on a       bipartisan basis. I don't want to make it a partisan thing.       This is about a person and justice has to prevail.''        Kaptur said any procedural action would be about treating       Conroy, with the respect he deserves as an officer of the       House.        ``For me as a Catholic with everything else that has gone       in my church with cover-ups and all the rest, I feel a       special responsibility to not have someone's reputation       damaged,'' she said.        Kaptur said she was surprised that Ryan, who is also       Catholic, would make this decision. She said Conroy didn't       say much when she spoke with him, but noted, ``I think he's       deeply hurt.''                        Group formed to vet successors         While Kaptur and others look for ways to keep Conroy in his       position--Crowley, for example, is calling on Ryan to       reconsider his decision--conversations about the next House       chaplain have begun.        Ryan has asked Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., to lead a       bipartisan group of members in looking at potential       replacements for Conroy. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., will       serve as the lead member of the group for the Democrats.        Collins, a military chaplain for 17 years, said there's no       set number of members for the group yet or timeline for the       group to submit recommendations. He predicted it could take a       few months and a replacement would likely not be ready before       Conroy's May 24 resignation date.        ``This decision will be on the speaker ultimately,''       Collins said.        Collins said he is not looking for candidates of a specific       faith, just ones who have  [[Page H3731]]       ``a heart for people,'' relate well to others and can listen.        Rep. Mark Walker, chairman of the Congressional Prayer       Caucus, is also serving on the group that will recommend the       next chaplain. Both he and Collins said they had no issues       with Conroy and were not familiar with Ryan's reason for       asking him to resign.        As for successors, Walker, who served as a pastor for       nearly 20 years before running for Congress, said he's       looking for someone with a nondenominational background that       has a multicultural congregation or an otherwise diverse       background.        The North Carolina Republican also said he'd prefer       ``somebody who has a little age, that has adult children,       that kind of can connect with the bulk of the body here,       Republicans or Democrats as far as what we're going through       back home--you've got the wife, the family, things you       encounter--that has some counseling experience or has managed       or worked with people, maybe a larger church size, being able       to have that understanding or that experience.''        While Walker had initially specified someone with children       and said ``having somebody who's walked in those shoes I       think allows you to immediately relate a little bit more than       others.''        Catholic priests take a vow of celibacy. Walker followed up       with the reporters he made his comments to clarify he was not       disqualifying Catholic priests because of that vow.        ``When I say family experience I mean that you've been a       priest or pastor over a parishioner with families who have       situations, adult children, those kinds of things.''                                   ____________________
