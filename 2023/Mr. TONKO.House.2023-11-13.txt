 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark Transgender Awareness  Week. This is an important time to celebrate, honor, and uplift trans  people--their history, their stories, and their culture.   It is also a time to stand up against ongoing hate and  discrimination. Extremist politicians around our country and in this  Chamber continue to work to strip away the rights and liberties of the  trans community.   In ongoing appropriations debates, House Republicans have brought  forward unserious proposals with riders targeting and demonizing the  trans and broader LGBTQ+ communities. These riders include limiting  access to essential and safe gender-affirming healthcare; bans on art  forms, including drag; and allowing broad licenses to discriminate.   The trans community deserves so much better. They deserve the  ability, like all of us, to live fully and authentically without facing  violence, discrimination, or harassment.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the trans  community and oppose these cruel and relentless attacks. As a member of  the Congressional Equality Caucus, I vow to continue to fight for the  cause.                            ____________________
