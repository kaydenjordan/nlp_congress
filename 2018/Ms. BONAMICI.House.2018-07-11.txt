 Mr. Speaker, yesterday was the court-ordered deadline  for the Trump administration to reunite more than 100 children under 5  years old with their families.   The administration has failed to meet this deadline, and that is  shameful. Dozens of babies and toddlers remain in government custody  with no idea of when they will see their parents again.   As a mom, I am outraged. This administration is failing to comply  with a court-ordered deadline.   But what is this really about, babies, toddlers, and young children?  Ask any pediatrician. This is harmful, and every day creates more harm  to these innocent children.   This administration is saying they were forced to separate families  when, in fact, it was their deliberate zero-tolerance policy, their  strategy that forcibly took children out of their parents' arms, and it  has always been within their power to stop this coldhearted and  inhumane madness.   On Monday, I met with Latino and immigrant community leaders in  Oregon to hear from them firsthand about how this administration's  actions are harming families and communities. They spoke of  unprecedented fear, of families torn apart, and of children afraid to  go to school. They spoke about why people come to the United States in  the first place: to make a better life for themselves and for their  children.   Miriam Corona from Yamhill County said that there is no greater gift  of love than to leave everything you know for your children's future.  That is why my grandparents got on a boat in 1921 and crossed the ocean  from Italy for the American Dream. It is why many people are now  fleeing terrible violence in Central America and in Mexico to make a  better life for themselves and their children and, oftentimes, to save  their children's lives.   That is what we stand for in this country of the United States of  America: a better life, a peaceful life free from violence, and a  better future for the next generation. As a parent, that is what I want  for my children, and as a Member of Congress, it is what I want for  everyone in our community.   The Trump administration's actions contradict these fundamental  values. We are better than this. I continue to demand that the  administration reunite all separated children with their parents--not  later, now. This is a court order, not a suggestion.   If the problem is that these agencies are understaffed, I will come  over to the agency. I will go over to Health and Human Services to  help. I am sure many of my colleagues will join me.   Mr. Speaker, when the families are reunited, our work is not done. We  must fix our broken immigration system. It is long past time to vote on  a comprehensive, humane, and compassionate immigration reform bill.  That is what Oregonians want, and it is what the majority of people in  this country want.                            ____________________
