 Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life of a  man I was proud to call a constituent and a friend, the great author  Winston Groom.   Winston passed away recently in Fairhope, Alabama, after a long and  vibrant life whose words touched untold millions around the globe. Most  of America knows Winston is the author of ``Forrest Gump,'' the  timeless American novel adapted into the classic film of the same name.   Winston and I share a hometown, Mobile, and, as adults, lived near  each other in Fairhope. I was blessed to be able to develop a  friendship with Winston over the past several decades.   Our State of Alabama, particularly southwest Alabama, is renowned for  the quality of writers we have produced. We are also renowned for the  colorful qualities of many of those writers.   Winston was not only an incredible talent who will leave a lasting  impact on the literary world, but one of the most colorful characters  to ever call Alabama home. As Forrest Gump would say: ``That's all I  have to say about that.''   I wish Winston's family all the best, and I thank them for sharing  Winston with the world.                            ____________________
