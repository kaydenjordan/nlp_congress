 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for  yielding, and I thank the chairman for bringing this resolution to the  floor.   Mr. Speaker, as I was sitting here listening to Congressman Johnson,  I got so inspired that I just want to go out and jump in a soapbox or  jump on a soapbox to give my talk.   I have been at this for a very long period of time. The soapbox derby  has been going on for 76 years; 36 of those years, I had the great  privilege of serving in this body. I rise each year to sponsor the  resolution allowing the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby Association  to hold its annual race on the Capitol Grounds. It is appropriate, I  think, that it is here at the Capitol. The inspiration of the Capitol,  the inspiration of the dome, the inspiration and excitement of which  Congressman Johnson just spoke, I think, captures the sense of what  ``soapbox derby'' means.    This year marks, as I said, the 76th year of the derby, Mr. Speaker,  at which young people from around the region, from age 8 all the way to  age 17, compete in three divisions. Those divisions are stock, super  stock, and masters. So you are talking about these sophisticated  soapboxes. They are not your father's soapbox, that is for sure.   It is not only a fun and exciting event, it is also educational and  brings children together, young people together, young adults together  with their parents, grandparents, siblings, and neighbors to plan and  build their soapbox racers.   You know, one of the things we need in America is more engineers. I  am a lawyer. I don't know that we need more lawyers. And we need  doctors, of course, but people tell me, if we are going to make things  in America, we need more engineers, people who work with their hands,  people who create, people who design, and that is what this soapbox  derby is about.   Doing so, participating in this contest helps connect these young  people with hands-on engineering and manufacturing lessons which  promote greater interest in the STEM fields which we all talk about:  science, technology, engineering, and math. This has been the case, Mr.  Speaker, since the first soapbox derby in 1938, and this long tradition  now continues in the 21st century.   The winner in each division will then qualify to race against the  regional champions from across the Nation later this year, at Derby  Downs, at the All-American Soap Box Derby in Akron, Ohio.   This year, the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby will be held on June  17, Mr. Speaker. The derby has been called ``the greatest amateur  racing event in the world.'' I don't know whether it is the greatest,  but it is certainly one of the great contests in the world and teaches  participating youth about fortitude, about leadership, about  engineering, sportsmanship, and pride of achievement.                                time  1645    In addition to bringing families together, the Soap Box Derby brings  communities closer together, Mr. Speaker. Many of the races are  sponsored and cheered by their local civic groups, police, fire  departments, and service organizations.   I have been proud, as I said, Mr. Speaker, to sponsor this resolution  for 26 years, and I believe strongly in the importance of this  tradition and am convinced of the very positive impact the Derby has on  young people from my district who participate, around this region, and  around the country.   Maryland's Fifth District, my district, has been home to a number of  Greater Washington Soap Box Derby winners, including the winners from  2007, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2013, and 2014.   The Washington region is millions of people. My young people and  their advisers, otherwise may be called parents, are doing pretty well  in this, and we are proud of that. Our racers even won the national  championship in 2007 and 2008.   I hope my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, will join me in supporting this  resolution and thanking the organizers of the Greater Washington Soap  Box Derby. I hope they will also join me in congratulating, in advance,  all of the young people from the region who will be participating on  June 17.   I also want to thank my cosponsors: Gerry Connolly, Don Beyer, John  Delaney, Jamie Raskin, Anthony Brown, Eleanor Holmes Norton, and  Barbara Comstock. This is a bipartisan resolution. I am sure everybody  will support it, and I am sure that the excitement of which Congressman  Johnson spoke will be experienced by those young people as they race  towards victory. Whether they win the number one spot, they will be  winners for having participated in this creative contest that makes  them better people.
