 Mr. Speaker, in the morning of October 22, 1983, a  suicide bomber drove a truck full of explosives into a Marine compound  in Beirut, Lebanon, killing 241 U.S. service members. This was the  deadliest attack against our U.S. Marines since Iwo Jima.   These Marines were stationed in Beirut to assist with the Palestinian  withdrawal during the Lebanese civil war--they were protecting those  who were being persecuted and fought to keep peace in the area.   There is a memorial at Camp Lejeune for those who lost their lives  that day and it reads, ``They came in Peace.'' I do not think I could  say it any better. Our service men and women go overseas to ensure war  does not reach our shores. They selflessly put aside their fears, and  without hesitation say bravely, ``I will serve, send me.''   Some may know that my dear friend, Congressman Greg Pence, was  serving that day in Beirut. I am thankful that my friend's life was  spared on that day.   For those who perished that day we will never forget your ultimate  sacrifice to your country. Of those who passed away, eight were from  Texas:   Leland E. Gann, Matilde Hernandez Jr. and Timothy R McMahon from  Austin; Rodolfo  [[Page H8452]]  Hernandez from El Paso; Michael S. Fulton from Ft. Worth; Marcus E.  Coleman from Dallas; Johnnie D. Caesar from El Campo; and David W.  Brown from Conroe.   We must never forget this day and those who were murdered because of  what the freedoms they believed in so fiercely they were willing to put  their life on line.                            ____________________
