 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, we are still uncovering more troubling  evidence on the extent of Russia's interference in our most recent  election. These Russian actions were an attack on our democracy, and we  need to respond both to hold them to account for past actions and to  protect against future aggressions. With our next national election  less than 4 months away, we must act now.   So I am pleased this bill takes steps to require a publicly available  advisory report on foreign counterintelligence and cybersecurity  threats facing our Federal elections. This joint report from the  Director of National Intelligence, the Department of Homeland Security,  and the FBI will help campaigns identify and counter these threats.   My amendment strengthens the reporting requirements to ensure we are  publicly identifying the foreign state or nonstate actors that our  intelligence officials identify as responsible for these threats.   The American people deserve to know who is trying to interfere in our  democratic process, and they deserve a government that will hold these  countries and these groups to account.   Protecting the integrity of our elections from outside influence by  malign foreign actors is of paramount importance. I urge my colleagues  to support this amendment to help ensure that we treat the threat of  foreign election interference with the seriousness it demands.   Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Schiff), who is the ranking member.                                time  1415     Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my bipartisan  amendment to require the Director of National Intelligence to report on  Iran's support for proxy forces in Syria and Lebanon.   I thank my colleague from North Carolina, Mark Meadows, for his  partnership in this endeavor, as well as Kyrsten Sinema and Norma  Torres for cosponsoring this amendment.   Mr. Chair, Iran's destabilizing activities in the Middle East are no  secret, and, of late, their malign influence has grown dramatically  across the region, including in Yemen, Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria.   Specifically with respect to Syria, Iran is menacingly working to  develop a permanent foothold in the country, increasing the threat to  our key allies Jordan and, in particular, Israel. They are also  assisting terrorist groups such as Hezbollah in supporting Assad.  Battle-tested Hezbollah fighters are subsequently returning to Lebanon  more capable and more dangerous than ever before.   Additionally, with assistance from Iran, Lebanese Hezbollah has been  able to amass nearly 150,000 rockets and missiles on the border with  Israel. This figure is a staggering increase from the, roughly, 15,000  rockets they had in 2006.   Iran has exploited several means of transferring weapons to  Hezbollah, including by land and by air. Israel has often targeted  these transfers to stop the weapons from reaching Lebanon. To eliminate  the susceptibility of these transfers to interdiction, Iran is  reportedly building missile production facilities in Lebanon to enable  indigenous rocket-producing capability for Hezbollah.   A domestic missile production capability in Lebanon would enable  Hezbollah to more easily continue to build its rocket arsenal not only  with more weapons, but more sophisticated, more deadly weapons, and  with less reliance on risky transits.   That is why I am offering my amendment today, to focus our  intelligence community on this urgent threat. A DNI report would help  us better understand the extent of Iran's support for terrorist proxies  such as Hezbollah and the threat this support poses to Israel and other  U.S. regional allies.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Schiff), the ranking member.    Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
