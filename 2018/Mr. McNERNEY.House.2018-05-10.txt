 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor and thank Federal  Communications Commissioner Mignon Clyburn for her 9 years of service  at the Federal Communications Commission. During her tenure, she fought  tirelessly for consumers. She has been a staunch defender of the public  interest and a critical voice in the fight for a free and open  Internet.   Over the last year, thousands of constituents reached out to me  expressing their concerns about rolling back net neutrality provisions.  When Chairman Pai denied my request to appear at the Commission's open  meeting during which they would be voting to eliminate net neutrality,  Commissioner Clyburn offered to submit my written statement for the  record so my constituents' voices would be heard. Additionally, she  came to my district to hear firsthand from my constituents about net  neutrality.   I am also grateful for her work to protect the Lifeline program. Over  56,000 households in my district rely on this crucial program.  Connectivity is a gateway for economic opportunity. It is an equalizer.  And Commissioner Clyburn's leadership has been vital.   Thank you, Commissioner Clyburn, for your incredible work and public  service.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 3053. I  thank Ranking Member Tonko and Chairman Shimkus for their hard work on  this very difficult subject.   This is a bipartisan bill that seeks a solution on how to remove and  dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. This  bill recognizes the need to consolidate interim storage in an integral  waste management program.                                time  0930    H.R. 3053 authorizes the Department of Energy to either develop its  own consolidated interim storage facility or contract with private  entities for such development. The bill also authorizes the development  of one pilot CIS facility that is not linked to the Nuclear Regulatory  Commission's decision on the Yucca Mountain license application, and  provides a solution for nuclear waste stranded at sites without an  operating reactor.   This bill will help us create a path toward permanent storage, while  also being inclusive and transparent about the process. One of the key  additions to this bill is that it will reestablish the Office of  Civilian Radioactive Waste Management. It also increases assistance to  States and tribes for transportation safety, which is important when  transporting radioactive materials.   Mr. Chairman, we cannot continue to put our heads in the sand about  nuclear waste. There are about 120 sites across the country that store  nuclear waste on a so-called temporary basis. With this situation, a  serious accident is virtually inevitable. Nuclear waste can be  transported and stored safely for the generations needed. This is  really an engineering problem, and America has some of the best  engineers in the world. We can do this.   H.R. 3053 is an important step toward safe storage, and I urge my  colleagues to support this well-crafted legislation.
