 Madam Speaker, history is watching and saving the  receipts. Today, my colleagues across the aisle must choose which side  of a very bright line they want to be recorded on for all time.   On one side: Lies, sedition, inciting and supporting insurrection and  domestic terrorism.   The other side: Your oath of office, the Constitution, democracy,  decency.   There is no middle ground. Today, we make history forever. So choose  well.   A vote to impeach Donald Trump means, years from now, you can look  your grandchildren in the eye and say, ``I did the right thing.''
