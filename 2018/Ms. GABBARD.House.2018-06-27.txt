 Mr. Speaker, this weekend I visited Flint, Michigan,  where I met with neighbors and residents, one of whom was named Joyce.   Joyce is one of the more than 100,000 residents in Flint who have and  continue to endure a life-threatening water crisis in their city which  has gone on for years. Like too many families in Flint, Joyce's family  has suffered incredible loss due to the criminal contamination of  Flint's water.   Joyce's son's name is Joseph. He was a father of three, and as any of  us would, he believed that the water that he drank, bathed, and cooked  with--the water that he gave to his children--was clean. He had no  reason to believe otherwise.   But after the city of Flint changed its water source from Detroit's  water system to Flint River in 2014 to cut costs, Joseph began to  develop rashes and bacteria that ate away at his flesh forcing him to  tape his skin together on his face and on his back with band-aids.   It was so bad that his doctors kept asking him if he had traveled to  a Third World country recently. Where in the world had he been that had  caused his organs to deteriorate as rapidly as they were?   Joseph died leaving behind his three children; his family; and his  mother, Joyce, who continues to keep his memory alive.   Joseph's story is tragic and heart-wrenching, and the sad part is  that this is not a one-off case. Samples of drinking water from Flint  found 13,000 parts per billion of lead in the community's water, which  is nearly 900 times higher than the EPA's maximum limit of 15 parts per  billion.   Scientific evidence shows that this lead contamination has killed at  least a dozen people in Flint from Legionnaires' disease. It has  deteriorated the short- and long-term health of tens of thousands of  people in the community, including at least 9,000 children under the  age of 6.   It has created ripple effects causing fetal death and lower fertility  rates that continue to have an impact on those who are affected and  will continue to have an impact on this community for generations to  come.   Now, there are other cases of other illnesses such as cancers and  things that are not even being tracked but are likely related to this  contaminated water, and that will continue.    It has been over 1,500 days since this crisis began and the people of  Flint today still do not have clean water. Understandably, they don't  trust their government to tell them the truth after they have been told  the water is clean and safe time and again, only to show that it is not  and people continue to get sick.   These are the same officials who decided to put cost savings over  human lives who later reassured the community that the water was safe  when they knew that it wasn't. Now, despite this heartache, death, and  destruction, those responsible in local, State, and Federal Government  have not been held accountable for creating and perpetuating this  horrifying crisis.   Poisoning over 100,000 people through their water is criminal, yet  not a single person has been charged. Not only that, but the State has  declared the water in Flint to be lead-free and has shut down the only  bottled distribution facility in the city. The need is still there, so  we have churches and volunteers in the city who are coming together and  cobbling together a means to distribute bottled water in whatever way  that they can, taking care of each other, and demanding accountability  for those responsible for this devastation.   Understandably, they feel they have been forgotten, that their voices  are not being heard, and that they have been left behind. All they are  asking is that this country--our country--hear their personal stories  and shine a light on the problems that still continue.   We understand that this is not a problem isolated to Flint, Michigan,  but is a problem that faces communities all across the country. We know  that Flint is not alone. With the aging and crumbling infrastructure in  this country, we know that too many of our communities don't have safe  water to drink. We need Federal investment in our country's dangerously  dilapidated water infrastructure now.   In my home State of Hawaii alone, it is estimated that we will need  over $1 billion in drinking water investment over the next 20 years  just to ensure that our people have safe water to drink.   I am a co-sponsor of the WATER Act which will make these critical  improvements to our drinking water and wastewater services, replace  old, lead-ridden pipes, and stop sewage overflows and other problems  that are contaminating our national water infrastructure.   We must hold those responsible for the poisoning of Flint accountable  for the lives that they have ruined. Along with passing the WATER Act  into law, we need to expand water testing in high-risk areas. We need  to send a message to this country that we stand together. Water is  life. We cannot survive without it.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment on the table.    Mr. Chair, since 9/11, an estimated 3.7 million veterans  and servicemembers may have been exposed to burn pits, a common method  of disposing of waste during war.   Now, these burn pits include things like human waste, batteries,  plastic, damaged equipment all being dumped into a giant pit, doused  with jet fuel, and torched.   Much of the waste burned in these pits is toxic and it gets into our  troops' eyes, mouth, throat, and lungs. I know this is true, because I  was there and I breathed these toxins in every day.   These burn pits aren't put somewhere very far away from where our  troops spend their time. They are usually right next to where they  live, work, eat, and sleep. Many burn day and night, some burning  around the clock, 7 days a week.   Exposure to burn pits can produce serious and potentially life- threatening health effects, including neurological disorders, rare  forms of cancer, lung diseases, and more.   Recently, a widow named Jill Wilkins reached out to my office to  share her story.   She told me about her husband, United States Air Force Reserves Major  Kevin Wilkins, who was an RN and who deployed to Iraq in the summer of  2006.   After prolonged exposure to the toxic chemicals from burn pits, when  he came home, he died from a brain tumor in April of 2008. He was only  51 years old, leaving behind his wife, Jill, to take care of their two  children by herself.   Now, despite the millions of brave young men and women who have been  exposed to burn pits, people like Major Wilkins, they are continuing to  be denied their claims and healthcare through the VA.   The DOD and VA have been hesitant to admit that there is sufficient  data to quantify this link and to prove the connection between service- related burn pits exposure and the resulting illnesses that some of our  troops and veterans are dying from.   What is most troubling about this is that these burn pits are still  being used today.   We cannot continue to repeat the dark stains of our past that we have  seen in abandoning our Vietnam veterans who have suffered illnesses due  to their exposure to Agent Orange.   Even now, I and many other Members of Congress continue to hear from  Vietnam veterans about their battles with  [[Page H5798]]  the VA to get the benefits and care they need after their exposure to  Agent Orange.   Burn pits are the Agent Orange of our generation of veterans. We  cannot let this generation go ignored, without the care and services  they desperately need.   Our troops didn't hesitate to raise their hands and volunteer to  serve this country and put their lives on the line. We cannot turn our  backs on them when they return home.   Passing this amendment authorizes $1 million in burn pits research,  which takes an important step towards fulfilling our Nation's promise  to take care of our veterans. We have seen some DOD- and VA-funded  studies, but we need to do more to get to the point where the VA does  the right thing.   We need to pass the Burn Pits Accountability Act that I have  introduced with my friend and post-9/11 veteran, Congressman Brian  Mast.   We know that there is a correlation between burn pit exposures and  these illnesses. This amendment takes a small step toward continuing  the research, and serves as a shining light to our post-9/11 veterans  that they are not alone and that they have not been forgotten. It  builds on this progress to ensure that every servicemember and veteran  who was exposed to burn pits gets the care and services that they have  earned and deserve.   Mr. Chair, I appreciate Chairwoman Granger and Ranking Member  Visclosky for their attention in raising this important issue and in  allowing these amendments to come to the floor.   Our veterans care very much to see that Congress is taking action in  the absence of leadership, and I urge my colleagues to support this  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
