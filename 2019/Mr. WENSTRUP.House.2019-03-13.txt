 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of  H.R. 962, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, and ask for  its immediate consideration in the House.    Madam Speaker, I urge the Speaker to immediately  schedule the born-alive bill.    Madam Speaker, a few minutes ago, I rose to call for a  vote on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which  requires any baby who survives an abortion to receive the same medical  care that any baby born at the same age would receive. It requires the  baby to then be transported to a hospital.   As a doctor, I strongly believe that every patient, especially these  infants born alive, should be given appropriate medical care. This  should not even be a question.   New York recently celebrated passing a law that removes protections  from babies born alive after an abortion attempt. Other States also  fail to protect abortion survivors.   Therefore, it is our duty, as Members of Congress, to defend the God- given right to life for every baby in this situation. It is our duty,  as compassionate human beings, to ensure that these uniquely vulnerable  babies receive the care that they deserve.   It is past time to vote on H.R. 962.                            ____________________
