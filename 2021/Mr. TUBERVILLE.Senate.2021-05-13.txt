 Mr. President, you know, if there is one thing I have  been hearing from my constituents lately it is this: We have to get  people back to work so our economy can thrive and our people can make a  living.   This isn't a new sentiment. I have heard this for months as I have  traveled around the State. But what is new is the fact that we can't  find people to work, and that is what I am here to talk about today.   Before the pandemic hit, we had the best economy in decades. The  unemployment rate in January 2020 was 3.6 percent. Wages were up. Blue- collar wages were rising faster than white-collar wages for the first  time on record. Unemployment for African Americans, Hispanic Americans,  and Asian Americans was at the lowest rate recorded, all thanks to  President Trump's pro-growth policies and Republicans' tax reform law.   There is no debating that the coronavirus pandemic hit our economy  very, very hard. Many companies and businesses in Alabama, including  family-owned small businesses, have spent the past year hanging on by a  thread as the pandemic held its tight grip around the country.   Some States opened with a skeleton crew, making the decision to lay  off workers in order just to keep operating, and some were forced to  shut down entirely. Either way, American workers lost out. A few  industries were spared, and unemployment numbers shot sky high.   But a year later, as vaccines became widely available and we better  understood what we needed to do to keep Americans safe, many job  creators thought: OK, this is when the tight grip loosens, and there is  the light at the end of the tunnel.   As more and more people are feeling safe--safe to go places they used  to go and do things--businesses are eager to open and respond but,  today, even as vaccinations go up and cases go down, the Biden  administration is incentivizing people to sit on the sidelines, instead  of encouraging them to join the workforce.   It is the opposite of what the Federal Government should be doing: Do  the right thing now. And it is the opposite of what job creators want  to do for millions of American workers. There are roughly 8.1 million  job openings around our country, as we speak, but the Democrats would  rather discourage folks from seizing the opportunity to go out and earn  a living. That is exactly what the current unemployment payments do.   As part of their partisan stimulus bill, Democrats extended the $300  a week Federal unemployment benefit, a weekly payment, in addition to  the State benefit that folks already get.   In Alabama, people could choose to receive, with no strings attached,  up to $678 per week. That comes out to $16.95 an hour, which is even  more than our Democrat colleagues' job-killing $15 minimum wage  proposal just a few weeks ago. The result has been disastrous for small  businesses across my State and throughout the country that are already  ready to hire to meet the boom and demand for products and services.   On the national level, here is what the National Federation of  Independent Business reported: ``Unfilled job openings continue to  mount, as April is the third consecutive month setting a record high  reading of unfilled job openings.''   On record job openings, April job numbers released last week weren't  much better. The unemployment rate went up by 0.1 percent. Economists  thought we would add 1 million jobs, but we only added a quarter of  that amount.   Small business owners all across Alabama have been able to reopen,  and customers are coming back. Now they  [[Page S2509]]  need people to fill the jobs to keep the doors open.   Across America, businesses are no longer competing against other  businesses. Now they have to compete against the government--government  versus the private sector--and the government is stacking the deck  against our small businesses and manufacturers. Businesses in Alabama  are no exception to anybody else across the country.   Case in point, Al Cason is the President of Bud's Best Cookies in  Hoover, AL. His father Bud owns the company and has been in the  industry for 65 years. Normally, they have four production lines with  two shifts, but because so many--so many--of their would-be workers are  staying home, they can only run two lines, and they are cutting their  production in half. We can't get enough to come to work, Al wrote me.  The government is taking away workers from our business, and it has  been in business for 65 years.   Wesley Averett from Enterprise Health & Rehabilitation Center in  Enterprise, AL, wrote that his long-term care facility is ``unable to  find the help [they] need'' due to the ``severe negative impacts  stimulus and unemployment payments are [having] on the Alabama  workforce.''   And then there is Sandra Walker from Lake Haven Assisted Living in  Luverne, AL, who said:         Our salaries are competitive, but we can't compete with       stay-at-home . . . no strings attached hand outs. . . .       Business is back open but we can't survive without our       workers returning to work.    These are both health companies, mind you, and they are the ones  helping some of our most vulnerable citizens.   And here is what Anita Hilliard in Courtland, AL, told me. The  company she works for employs people in convenience stores throughout  northwest Alabama. She wrote: ``We have had to shut down some of our  shifts'' just because we can't get enough people to work, and sometimes  we have to shut down completely.   But here is what really stuck with me in her letter. She said: ``I am  working and paying taxes to pay others more than I make myself.'' That  is sad. This must end or we will lose the America that we have grown to  know and love.   I couldn't agree with Anita more. America was built by hard workers,  people like Al, people like Anita, people like Wes, Sandra, and  millions more across the United States. But we will never jumpstart our  economy if we keep going with this bad policy of incentivizing people  to stay at home and sit and not work, rather than take employment  opportunities when they are offered to them.   Our businesses need workers to meet customers' demands. This is truly  a great thing after such a hard year. Our job creators have started to  hope and see opportunity again. They have hung the ``now hiring'' signs  on the door. They have posted the job openings. But we need to  encourage folks to rejoin the workforce and to get back to work. Job  creators are creating the opportunity. We just need folks to reach out  and take it.   It should be easy for us to offer encouragement to folks to fill open  oppositions. All we have to do is kick the ball through the uprights  this time around. But Democrats in DC wanted to go it alone. They  wanted to go it alone a few weeks ago. And with the recent stimulus  bill that we passed we ended up with a workforce shortage due to the  inflated unemployment benefits in an economy on the cusp of recovery  that needs available workers.   Getting these folks back to work isn't just about the now. It is  about helping them to see the future again. It has been more than a  year for many who have been out of work. Taking the leap to get back in  sometimes is scary, but we have to help the people take that leap. If  we wait, these businesses and jobs they are now offering right now may  not be there in September. Companies and small businesses are going out  of work and going out of business.   That is why I joined my colleagues, Senator Crapo and Senator Risch,  to sponsor the Back to Work Bonus Act. This bill would give back-to- work bonuses to workers who are able to safely return to work. This  would be a one-time payment of $1,200 for those returning to full-time  jobs and $600 to those returning to part-time jobs. Employers would  verify the earnings and hours of those receiving the back-to-work  bonuses. That sounds much more like an actual stimulus to me.   The Back to Work Bonus Act is a win-win-win--good for workers, good  for employers, and great for our society. I am sure each of my  colleagues has received similar pleas from small business owners across  their State.   The Biden-backed unemployment benefits are crushing their hopes of  getting back to a prepandemic high. We are even seeing some States take  matters into their own hands. Earlier this week, I was glad to see  Alabama be one of the first States to announce plans to stop accepting  enhanced Federal unemployment benefits. As of today, at least 16 States  have announced they won't accept the benefit to help employers and  encourage folks to get back to work. This is a commonsense move to  encourage folks to take the many job opportunities available.   Well, I, for one, think we should listen to the folks on Main Street.  We can help them, and we can help millions of the unemployed. One way  to do it is by passing the Back to Work Bonus Act.   I urge my colleagues to support this practical bill and get our  country back to work. We need to remember: Opportunity through work is  the foundation of our country.   I yield the floor.
