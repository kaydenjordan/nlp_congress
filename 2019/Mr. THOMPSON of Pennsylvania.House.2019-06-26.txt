 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Dr. Michael Messina.   Dr. Messina is retiring this week following a distinguished career in  academia. Most recently, Dr. Messina has served as the head of the  Department of Ecosystem Science and Management at Pennsylvania State  University. He earned his bachelor's degree in forest science from Penn  State in 1979 and a doctorate in forestry from North Carolina State  University in 1983.   In 2009, Dr. Messina was named director of Penn State's School of  Forest  [[Page H5173]]  Resources after serving as a professor and associate department head at  Texas A&M University. He has been a great resource when it comes to  forest science and is a leader in that area.   In July 2012, he led the Penn State School of Forest Resources in the  creation of the Department of Ecosystem Science and Management. He has  used his years of expertise and knowledge to focus on improving the  responsible management of soil and water, healthy forests, and a  diversity of fish and wildlife species. His work has always been aimed  at preserving the beauty of the world around us for all to enjoy.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Messina for his years of service. I wish him  and his wife, Suzy, all the best in retirement.        100th Anniversary of Pennsylvania Ratifying the 19th Amendment     Mr. Speaker, I recognize the passage of  the 19th Amendment providing women the right to vote.   After Congress passed the 19th Amendment in 1919, three-fourths of  the 48 State legislatures were needed to ratify the new amendment. This  past Monday, June 24, marks the 100th anniversary of Pennsylvania  becoming the seventh State to ratify the 19th Amendment.   Women first organized and fought for suffrage on the national level  in July of 1848 at the Seneca Falls Convention in New York. But  Pennsylvania was a center of women's rights even before the Seneca  Falls Convention occurred.   Famous suffragist Lucretia Mott joined with a diverse group of  Pennsylvania women to organize the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery  Society in 1833.   In 1840, the society sent Mott as a delegate to the World Anti- Slavery Convention in London to protest the exclusion of women at the  convention.   Organizations like this were formed all across the Commonwealth to  focus their attention on raising awareness of the women's suffrage  cause.   The decades of effort on the local and national level by women's  suffragists resulted in Congress finally passing the 19th Amendment.   Today women play a pivotal role in our government. The 2018 elections  brought a record number of Pennsylvania women to the ballot box, and a  record number were welcomed to political office across the United  States.   Mr. Speaker, Pennsylvania can be proud of our important role in the  women's suffrage movement and securing the right to vote 100 years ago.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak  about the School Food Modernization Act which would help America's  school cafeterias modernize its equipment and infrastructure.   Earlier this week, I was proud to introduce this act with Congressman  Mark DeSaulnier. We know nutrition plays a critical role in a child's  development and for far too many children, sometimes the only meal of  the day is the one that they receive at school. That is why it is  essential to help schools access funding to purchase modern kitchen  equipment and infrastructure.   Some schools may be using the same equipment so long that it not only  serves a student, but, quite frankly, served that student's parent as  well.   Food service staff needs modern facilities to serve high-quality,  nutritious meals that meet the school nutritional standards. Our bill  allows schools to participate in a loan assistance program from USDA to  help them acquire new kitchen equipment.   Schools would be eligible for Federal guarantees, up to 80 percent of  the loan. It also strengthens training for food service personnel who  want more education on how to prepare healthier meals.   I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation to help students  form a lifetime of healthier eating habits.                            ____________________
