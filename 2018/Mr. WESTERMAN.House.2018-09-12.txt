 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Montana (Mr.  Gianforte) and the gentlewoman from Massachusetts for her support of  the bill.   Mr. Speaker, the Walnut Grove Land Exchange Act should not need to  exist. It is a simple bill which swaps 4 acres of public property,  which currently houses a community, cemetery, and church with 6 acres  of private timberland. And as was mentioned, this church and cemetery  was established decades before the Forest Service.   To those who hear this and think, 10 acres? Why on Earth would it  take an act of Congress to exchange a total of 10 acres? Rest assured  that I had the same initial reaction. Not that this bill or the church  itself are unimportant. On the contrary, the Walnut County Community  Church is vital to the rural residents of Garland County.   The church is not only a place of worship. It has held countless  community meetings and more. Its cemetery is the final resting place  for many of Garland County's servicemen and -women, and the church  itself has served as a search-and-rescue command post in the past.   However, under the current law, the church does not own the land on  which it worships or buries its dead. As such, the Forest Service has  the authority to raise the church's use fee each year and has done so  over the past decade. Worse yet, any improvement or restoration to the  church must be done with the explicit permission of the Federal  Government. As a result, the Walnut Grove congregation has not been  able to modify or upgrade their 80-year-old building, despite the need  to expand to match the growing demands of the community.   Members of the congregation have tried for decades to resolve this  issue with the Forest Service. They have called, written, and  petitioned both the local and regional offices to purchase or exchange  the land. They have willingly taken on maintenance of the property and  have graciously accepted higher and higher usage fees under the guise  that an exchange was coming. An exchange never came.   Mr. Speaker, it is time we stop this 20-year merry-go-round. This  bill is vitally important to this congregation, and it is past time  that we help them resolve their issue.   My bill has wide bipartisan and bicameral support, having passed the  committee unanimously and having a companion measure in the Senate. I  urge swift passage of this bill.                                time  1600
