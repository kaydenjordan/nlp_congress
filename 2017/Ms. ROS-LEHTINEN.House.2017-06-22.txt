 Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the Nora  Sandigo Children Foundation, a nonprofit organization in my home city  of Miami, working around the clock to serve kids in our community who  have been separated from their parents by deportation.   I have known Nora, the founder of this organization, for many years,  and I have seen firsthand her true passion for ensuring the well-being  of these children. Through the support of donors and volunteers, this  organization is able to provide assistance in the form of food,  clothing, educational programs, legal advice, and many other vital  services.   This week, Nora will be visiting our Nation's Capital, with a  delegation of 50 children from Florida, to advocate for the  restructuring of our immigration policies so that the kids for whom she  cares, who are as American as you and I, don't have to grow up apart  from their parents.   Mr. Speaker, our Nation must do right for these children, and I urge  my colleagues in Congress and the administration to work together so  that we can have an immigration system that reflects our Nation's  compassion and provides a solution that is fair and just to everyone.                            ____________________
