 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas for  yielding.   I am so thrilled you are hammering this point. These are people's  lives, as you were saying earlier. We just were having a hearing in a  crime subcommittee, and an article was introduced that said there are  more drugs that come in through public ports than illegally across our  border.   Well, my friend has been involved in enforcing the law as a State  prosecutor. There is no one who can tell you how much in the way of  drugs were missing, but these kids are now--there is incentive from the  Biden administration to keep reusing these kids.   Border patrolmen are saying--my friend may have touched on this  earlier--that, actually, they are recognizing some of the kids who come  in and help people to stay there, and then they will go back across the  border and come with another group.                                time  1415    It is bad enough that this administration is luring people up,  especially children, to their detriment, but it is even worse when they  become just products to be used and thrown away. I had been standing  there all hours of the night seeing the long line of people being  processed and the border patrolmen were asking their questions.   At the opposite end where I would go, there are people passing kids  around and asking: Who is going to be the mother? Who is going to be  the father? Do you want this kid?   I will take the kid.   Madam Speaker, you can see them.   Who is going to take the kid?   Clearly, the child didn't belong to any of the people there. Many  multiple times I have seen them looking at the address that the drug  cartel gave them, and they are supposed to turn that over to Border  Patrol, and then ICE or HHS would ship them to where the drug cartels  want them to go, and they are switching addresses: I would rather go to  that one.   Then they tell the Border Patrol: This is where I have a relative.  This is where I want to go.   That is why the drug cartels call the Border Patrol and us here in  the U.S. their logistics. They get them illegally across the border,  and then taxpayers ship them to wherever the cartels want them.    That would be the Obama administration, Madam Speaker,  although now we have some being put up by the Biden administration.    Madam Speaker, I would just like to reinforce that when  these people get into the United States, their nightmare is not over.  They get shipped to towns all over America. Those who wear colored arm  bands now tell the drug cartel what their situation is. When they get  where they are going, they are still under the thumb of the drug  cartels to either sell drugs or sex trafficking. If they don't pay up  what they owe, then a family member gets killed or some part gets cut  off.    We know how bad the drug cartels are. So it doesn't just end there  when they get to America. That nightmare will continue, and this  administration is all part of it.    Madam Speaker, it is an honor to follow my fellow former  judge from Texas. We both know Jesus, and one of Jesus' comments was  that if we were just lukewarm, we would be spit out of the mouth. I  know my friend's heart, and he is passionate about things that he sees  as unjust, so I know he is in no danger of ever being spit out because  he does have that passion and cares so deeply.    I yield to the gentleman from Texas, my friend.    Madam Speaker, I know that we are brothers, and we are  going to be together for a long time. I am not talking about here in  this Chamber. Anyway, I appreciate my friend very much.   I didn't know anything about Senator Russell, but I have gotten an  education. I thank him.    Madam Speaker, my friend was a former judge in Houston.  In fact, he was the kind of judge that is the only judge in Texas that  is allowed to order an exhumation of a body. We ran into that in one of  my criminal trials, and we had to find a justice who would do that.  Texas entrusts a great deal with our judges.   I did want to touch on some things that I feel rather passionate  about because I know people are being hurt.   My friend Chip Roy and I were talking earlier. Marjorie Taylor  Greene, Matt Rosendale, a number of people spoke on this, but we can't  speak enough on what is happening at the border. It is absolutely a  crisis, and it really does need to be dealt with.   Regardless of what anybody thinks about President Trump, put that  aside and look at the border. Look at what it does to people who have  been standing in line for years to come into this country legally.   We know, and it has been established numerous times, people are not  allowed to cross the southern border unless they pay something to the  drug cartels. It may be paid through the gang member, through the  coyote that is bringing them into the country, but it is still the drug  cartels. They are still in the drug business; they are still in the  prostitution and sex-trafficking business.   It disturbs me that not enough Americans are upset about how much sex  trafficking has gone on. They get absolutely worked up when they find  out an American has been pulled into sex trafficking and not allowed to  get out of it. But it happens all the time, especially with Hispanics  from south of our border. The rapes that occur along the way have been  established by different groups and means.   It is just an abomination that more people are not upset, deeply  upset, about what is going on, enough so that a majority in both  Chambers, House and Senate, would do something about it, not leave  incentives out there dangling to lure more people into dealing with the  drug cartels. It used to be they made most of their money from the drug  trafficking, and that is still probably true.   As I started to mention earlier, my friend Chip Roy and I had an  article dangled in our hearing that says, oh, gee, more drugs came in  through public ports of entry than came through illegally across other  parts of the border.   But what I have seen with my own eyes and heard with my own ears,  spending a lot of time down on the border, the Border Patrol, when they  see a big group, especially with a bunch of children, most of the ones  I talk to say we know when we get a group like that, the drug cartels  are coordinating when they come across the border, especially there at  the river south of McAllen.   They know, when they send a group like that, especially in the middle  of the night, it is going to take a lot of border patrolmen to go  through, ask the questions, document, and in-process each one. They  will tell you that is when we know they are sending drugs. Sometimes,  it may be a high-value person who they are trying to get across into  the U.S.   But I know, one night, on the Texas Department of Public Safety  boats--they have a couple of them there on that part of the river. They  have the thermal technology and night vision. They were identifying  people along the river waiting to come across. The Border Patrol  identified the groups, and eventually, the Border Patrol said: Why  don't you guys go back to the dock, and then we will catch them trying  to enter?    Well, I thought that meant they would be turned away. But this was  during the Obama administration, and their instructions were: No, don't  turn anybody away. Just in-process them.   There were numerous groups of more than 10 or 20 in size, and we got  the report from the Border Patrol that they caught all the groups that  were going to cross. But those groups of two or three that appeared to  be bringing drugs, they somehow knew where to come across and come into  some bushes, and we never found them.   It is impossible for anyone to report how much in the way of drugs  comes across our border outside of a public port of entry, an official  port of entry, because they don't catch them.   In fact, it seems like, from my experience of being there, I have  seen--actually, it surprised me. It sure surprised them. There were  some guys that were up on a pump cage, and they were on the move. They  had people with them. They were on the move.   It was because they knew a big group had just come across the Rio  Grande River, and the Border Patrol had seen the truck. I knew the  direction they came from. I had seen the truck. They knew that the  Border Patrol would have to zoom to where all of those people were,  have to get some kind of a bus like they have there, and process all of  those people at the site and get them on the bus and bring them into  McAllen.   These guys knew all of the Border Patrol was tied up with the people.  They had a bunch of kids in that group, so that meant they really had  to concentrate on that group. These were clearly people who were doing  something illicit and illegal.   I didn't see their drugs, but they clearly were doing something very  illicit, and they also knew that the Border Patrol was going to be tied  up.   I visited with the Border Patrol and had seen what they were doing,  watched some of the in-processing, but they knew how long it took to  in-process a group like that. They knew they had time to do what they  wanted. It was only a mile or two up the road from where they knew the  Border Patrol was occupied.   There were a couple of guys up as lookouts and some others who were  carrying something down below, but they all took off into the trees. I  didn't know if they were armed, and I wasn't armed at the time, so I  didn't pursue them.   You have to know, there are a lot of things that cross the border  that nobody has accounted for. Look at the business model. If you don't  have any conscience, it is a great business model. Fortunately, most  people I know do have a conscience and would never do this. But without  a conscience, they are thinking: Okay, we need drug salespeople in  every town in America. All we have to do is get them across the border,  give them the address where we want them to sell drugs.   They give that to the Border Patrol, and either HHS or ICE gets them  where they want them. That is why Border Patrol says the drug cartels  call us their logistics. They get their future employees across the  border.   They think that they are just coming and going to have a free life in  America, but they are going to be working for the drug cartels. It is  not slavery, as that abomination is known, but it is a form of  indentured servitude. They owe being in the United States to the drug  cartels, and they are going to have to pay them. They made that deal to  get into the U.S.   The reason they were willing to make that deal to get in the U.S. now  is because they keep hearing the Biden administration is going to let  everybody in and give them all amnesty. That lures more and more people  into these terrible circumstances. It needs to stop.   I will repeat again what I have been saying for years. The most  caring, compassionate thing we could do for our neighbor Mexico and its  citizens to the south of us, when we know they have great raw  materials, great minerals, wonderful hardworking people, the majority  of whom believe in a God, as most of the Founders did--they love their  families.                                time  1500    I love watching Hispanic family reunions. It reminds me so much of  reunions I used to see in the town where I grew up. They love their  families. That is a wonderful thing. These attributes that folks south  of the border have, those are things that help make America the  greatest Nation in the world, and we need more of what they have, but  it needs to be done legally.   And to not care at the way that they are manipulated by the cartels?   Their business model, send them across. The U.S. taxpayers will pay  to ship them to whatever town we want them to sell drugs in or be  involved in prostitution or human trafficking themselves. The U.S.  taxpayers will pay to ship them there. And then once there, they all  know, we know where their families are in Mexico or Central America,  and they will keep paying as long as we tell them or they know we  [[Page H1349]]  don't mind cutting off heads, cutting off appendages, and sending the  message.   So the best thing we could do, though, secure the border. Dry up that  tens of billions of dollars, maybe over a hundred billion dollars a  year that they get from the drug business, from the human trafficking,  from the sex trafficking. Dry that money up. We will never dry it  completely up because there are always people who will look for ways.   But you cut that $80 billion or $100 billion or so down to even $10  billion, it dries up their ability to control so much of the national  and local government. It would surely put an end to so many policemen,  police chiefs, and mayors that have stood up to the cartels only to  have their heads cut off and, in some cases, put on a pike.   We are providing the money in this country to the drug cartels to  create corruption run amok in the Mexican Government. So caring,  compassionate people would say, let's dry up the drug cartels' money,  and that will do more for the American people.   They won't have to put their lives at risk or risk sexual abuse, all  kinds of abuse, death, being left by coyote out in the desert  somewhere. They won't have to risk that because the country they love-- many will say, ``I would rather stay there if there were opportunity.''   They get the opportunity if we help end the corruption. But there is  corruption enough. Talking to a DEA agent earlier this afternoon, there  is so much corruption you don't know who even in the national  government is on the payroll of the drug cartels.   So let's help the Mexican people, Central American people, even some  from South America, let's help them by giving them the freedom in their  own country without a corrupt government so they can have the kind of  freedom we have here.   In this article from March 10th, Alex Nitzberg says: ``More than  92,000 Clark County, NV mail ballots returned undeliverable in general  election.''   It talks about corruption in the last election. Just tragic, tragic  stuff. If we keep heading this direction, we are surely going to end up  like some of these corrupt countries.   But there is another article I just saw today that indicates that  Venezuelans are coming from Venezuela into the United States illegally,  and why they are doing that is because of the corruption and oppression  in Venezuela.   Under their progressive, Socialist country government down there,  they have taken what many say was the most prosperous, vibrant country  in South America, Venezuela, all the oil they had there. They took that  country and, as socialism will ultimately do wherever it is tried,  turned it into a fiasco. So the Venezuelans were fleeing and coming to  the United States.   And the question continues to come as to what will Americans do?  Where will they go? When the path we are on to become the devastated  Venezuela are perpetrated on America, where will Americans go?   They can't go to Venezuela. It has already been economically and  socially destroyed by the Socialists.   And as friends from Australia told me a few years ago, you know, if  anything happens to the freedom in the United States, you are not going  to be coming to Australia. They felt like China would take them over  before anybody in the U.S. had time to go there. There will be no place  to go.   You know, Venezuela, they have got America to try to get into since  their wonderful, vibrant country has been destroyed by socialism. We  won't have anyplace.   As I think Reagan said, this is the last best chance on Earth. We  have been so blessed. And the old saying about give a man a fish and he  can eat for a day; teach him how to fish, and he can eat for a  lifetime. Instead of just saying, yeah, come on to America, we will let  everybody in and we will all pay you welfare, we will give you free  healthcare, ultimately the whole system will be bankrupt and nobody  will have anyplace to go, why not help them get rid of the corruption  and stay in the country they love?   Then we have neighbors like Mexico and Venezuela, if we can help them  stop the corruption, with whom we can trade, we can visit, we can  vacation.   My wife and I had our honeymoon at a place in Mexico. We haven't been  back in recent years, though we thought about it, as we keep  celebrating anniversaries. It would be nice to go back where we had our  honeymoon, but there is just too much corruption in Mexico and it is  not worth the chance, in our opinion.   So wouldn't it be wonderful if we took a stand, we dried up the drug  culture, the drug cartels' money by securing our Southern border?   And then the Mexican people have a vibrant country that Americans  fall in love with all over again. We visit, vacation there. They visit,  vacation here. And we mutually help each other. But continuing to fund  tens of billions of dollars to go to the drug cartels in Mexico keeps  the Mexican people under the thumb of the drug cartel corruption.   Now, going back to the point about the DEA, the U.S. Government, they  cannot know how much in the way of drugs that they don't know about.  And I know I have got friends on the other side of the aisle who think,  oh, well, there is a report, there is more drugs going through our  public ports of entry than there are going across our border, where we  don't know they are crossing.    The truth is, we don't know what we don't know about how much and  what kind of drugs are coming across our border.   I know. I voted against putting Sudafed behind the counter, but I  understood drugstores, grocery stores had a problem with people  stealing it because that was an ingredient in making methamphetamine.  But according to what pharmacies and others tell me, law enforcement,  in Texas, okay, once you put Sudafed behind the counter, making it  harder to get, certainly harder to steal, homegrown meth ceased being  the problem it used to be, and now we are getting much stronger drugs  coming from Mexico, and they are much more addictive than even the  methamphetamine.   And I had enough people come in, meth cases that I totally  understand. It is extremely addictive. But now we have got more and  worse drugs coming from Mexico than what we had when they were  homemade. It did get more difficult for a while when a new way of  cooking methamphetamine, what they called a cold cook, didn't smell as  bad. For so long it was easy to find meth plants because they smelled  so bad.   But, anyway, how much meth being cooked, not to the extent it used to  be in Texas. They are bringing up stronger, more addictive, more  individual-destroying drugs from Mexico.   President Trump did what he could to get the border secure. We were  on the way to a much more secure border.   In fact, people are not aware in the second term of George W. Bush, a  number of Texas Members of Congress were upset that more had not been  done by a Republican administration headed by a Texan to secure our  border. And, actually, President Bush had Karl Rove meet with us. And  we began to meet every 2 weeks, as I recall, and Rove would have the  latest report every 2 weeks about how much progress was being made  toward securing our border.   One thing he didn't have--that President Bush didn't have was more  fence or walls on the Southern border, which makes it easier. Sure,  people can build a bigger ladder, as some used to say, but it at least  slows them down where it is easier to keep them out of the country with  their illicit, illegal drugs and sex trafficking.   So President Trump knew the value of a wall, and his knowledge of how  important a wall or a fence was has been totally and for all time  confirmed by the Democratic administration and the Speaker and the  Senate majority leader, as evidenced by the wall or fence, whatever you  want to call it, with all the razor wire around the top. Some places  you have got two layers of that.   So all this time people were saying, you know, it doesn't help, you  can't stop people. It doesn't do any good. But we knew it did good  because former President Obama got him a new house up somewhere around  here and built a 10-foot wall around it. So we knew, regardless of what  people were saying, they knew that a wall or a fence could make a  difference.   But we are hoping that since there is no threat and since the  concerns that the Speaker and majority leader here in the House had  that there was going to be another inauguration last Thursday--we knew  that wasn't going to  [[Page H1350]]  happen. I am just surprised that they were believing QAnon. I didn't  know anybody on our side who believed QAnon, but apparently the Speaker  and the majority leader were concerned that QAnon knew what he or she  or they, whatever it is, were talking about. So we called off  Congress--they called off Congress last Thursday.   So we are hoping that as they see that their beliefs and their  concerns are being assuaged, the acting chief of the Capitol Police has  confirmed there is no Member of Congress who is a threat to another  Member of Congress, no intel from any source that indicates that. I  have had friends across the aisle say, well, Lauren Boebert talked  about wanting to bring a gun on the floor, and that is scary.                                time  1515    Well, that is also a testimony that firearms can be the great  equalizer. Lauren tells me she is five foot exactly, so that should  reaffirm if she has got people in this body that are concerned about  her, it is not because of her five foot status, it is because sometimes  she has a firearm with her, and it truly is the great equalizer.   And I don't hear a lot of people talking about the number of lives  that are saved by law-abiding citizens that have firearms and prevent  crimes.   Madam Speaker, I see my time is expiring. I yield back the balance of  my time.                            ____________________
