 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a local hero in my  district, Sherburne County Veteran Service Officer Bruce Price.   County veteran service officers are one of the most important  resources for our Nation's veterans. When our veterans need help filing  a claim for disability or arranging transportation to their VA hospital  appointments, service officers like Bruce are always there to serve.   Bruce and his staff go beyond this call of duty. They see 3,000  individuals every year and field nearly 20,000 calls from veterans  experiencing difficulty or seeking resources.   While it was no secret to our community that Bruce is a hero, his  efforts are now finally being recognized nationally. Bruce received the  Life, Well Run Community Hero Award for his outstanding service to  others from the International City/County Management Association. We  are grateful to have such an outstanding public servant in Minnesota's  Sixth Congressional District.   Congratulations, Bruce, and thank you for your service.                        Recognizing the Minnesota Lynx     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of one of  Minnesota's most incredible and most successful sports teams, the four- time Women's National Basketball Association champions, Minnesota Lynx.   The Minnesota Lynx started their inaugural season in 1999 with just  12,000 fans in attendance to watch the first regular-season game. This  year, as they celebrate their 20th season, the stands are packed. That  is because, with four championships in the last 7 years, the Lynx are a  dynasty, one that continues to grow.   While they have many incredible individual players, the Lynx are a  true team on and off the court. The Lynx are active in our local  community in the Land of 10,000 Lakes, but they take their commitment  to service even beyond our State's lines.   This week, I look forward to joining the team at Payne Elementary  School at an event with the Samaritan's Feet Shoes of Hope  Distribution. I also look forward to many more winning seasons from  this group of talented and dedicated athletes.   Congratulations to the Lynx on 20 seasons, four championships, and  the many more victories that surely lie ahead. You make Minnesota  proud.              Celebrating 21st Century Bank's 100th Anniversary     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an incredible  financial institution in my district, 21st Century Bank.   Beginning as the Farmer's State Bank of Cedar in Anoka County in  1917, it served the rural agricultural community and is one of the few  banks to come through the Great Depression. Over 100 years later, the  bank has expanded across Minnesota, opening locations all over our  State, including four banks in Minnesota's Sixth Congressional  District.   At the helm is Thomas P. Dolphin, who said: ``In the beginning, it  was a handshake that sealed the deal, and that is still true today at  21st Century Bank.''   Having been at the bank for more than 40 years, Tom has been an  integral part of transforming 21st Century Bank from a small rural bank  with just $3 million in assets to an urban financial network with more  than $425 million in assets, allowing them to serve more families  across Minnesota.   21st Century Bank brings convenient banking and reliable service;  and, indeed, most businesses that work with them are small- to medium- sized businesses, making 21st Century Bank part of the foundation of  our local economy.   After celebrating their 100th anniversary, they continue bringing  families and small businesses the services they so desperately need.  With respect and gratitude, thank you to the Dolphin family and to  everyone at 21st Century Bank for your contribution to our local  communities. We look forward to the next 100 years.                Carver County, Healthiest County in Minnesota     Mr. Speaker, there is no question that exercise is good  for the body. Whether it is walking, biking, or playing hockey on a  frozen lake, exercise reduces your chances of getting heart disease,  helps maintain a healthy weight, improves mood and mental functioning,  and so much more.   In my State, no place does it better than Carver County in  Minnesota's Sixth Congressional District. Carver County has been named  our State's healthiest county by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation for  the sixth consecutive year. The rankings are based on, among other  factors, how people feel and how long they live.  [[Page H4782]]    The walkability of cities and towns in Carver allow its residents to  skip the car ride and use their own two feet to get to the grocery  store or shop; and with countless parks, playgrounds, and trails, there  are plenty of places for Minnesotans to enjoy the outdoors.   Congratulations to the residents of Carver County for grabbing the  top spot once again and setting a great example for the rest of our  State to get out and get active.                            ____________________
