 Madam Speaker, early this year, I made the decision to  hang the transgender flag in front of my office. It was meant to be a  small and simple gesture of solidarity.   Overnight, my office was flooded with messages of gratitude. The flag  outside of my office had gone viral. Folks from all over called,  emailed, wrote, and DM'd my office to thank me for doing it.   But today, we all have an historic opportunity to support substantive  legislation that will be transformative for millions of Americans.   The Equality Act is a bipartisan bill that will provide  comprehensive, Federal nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ  individuals in employment, housing, credit, education, and much more,  because today our LGBTQ brothers and sisters can marry the person they  love on Sunday and, for that reason alone, be evicted from their  housing or fired from their jobs on Monday. That isn't right, but the  Equality Act can fix it.   To my colleagues, let's extend the full promise of this Nation to  every LGBTQ American. Let's pass the Equality Act.                            ____________________
