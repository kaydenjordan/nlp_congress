 Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I am going to cut to the chase: the Republican Study  Committee budget is so extreme, it cannot be taken seriously. It cuts  spending by $10 trillion over 10 years, which is $4 trillion more than  the already irresponsible spending cuts in Chairman Black's budget.   To its credit, the RSC tells us where those cuts will come from,  rather than leaving large amounts unspecified or using matching  asterisks or phony economic assumptions to reduce spending.   The RSC budget cuts Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. It cuts  programs that ensure basic living standards, protect the environment,  and help families afford college.   For 2018, the RSC budget matches the President's level for defense,  including war funding. But for nondefense discretionary spending, the  RSC budget provides $394 billion, which is $122 billion, or 24 percent,  below the austerity cap.   There is no way this House or any House would approve an  appropriations bill that inflicted a 24 percent cut on all government  operations. If just two programs--veterans' programs and NIH funding-- were excluded from those cuts, everything else would be cut by more  than 55 percent.   So yes, this budget claims to reach balance, but it would achieve it  by making cuts that would be catastrophic. Not even Congress is that  self-destructive.   I contend that the two Republican budgets actually show how  dismissing the notion that revenues must be a part of any solution to  restrain deficits and debt, compounded with the flawed notion that  balance must be achieved in the short term, will inflict intolerable  hardship on the American people.   While totally unintentional, they make a pretty compelling case that  for Congress to responsibly address our debts and deficits, while  funding the Federal programs and investments that the American people  want and expect, raising revenues has to be part of the equation.   One of the things that amuses me, in a very kind of dark way, is that  I remember so well, in 2010, when Republicans actually rode to victory  in the House by claiming that we Democrats were going to cut $750  billion out of Medicare. That wasn't true, but they claimed it.   Now, in this Republican Study Committee budget, they have doubled  down on that. It is not exactly double, but they are going to cut it by  $898 billion. I don't think America's seniors and the disabled  population would feel very good about that.   I would like to thank my colleagues for bringing that important issue  to the debate.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, it is fascinating to have this debate and speaking in  such high-principled ways about the need to reduce deficits and debt. I  don't think any Democrat would argue that we need to do something to  reduce deficits and debt. We face a very dire, long-term fiscal future.   But we also lose sight of the fact that the American people expect  something from their government. They expect our government to keep  them safe, but they also expect their government to protect their  drinking water, protect their air, to make sure that the food they eat  is not dangerous, to provide law enforcement and help local law  enforcement to do many things.   The budget, as well as Chairman Black's committee budget, would  decimate all of those services that the American people expect from the  Federal Government.   I think only about what is going on right now with Houston, Florida,  Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands and the enormous cost that the  Federal Government is going to have to bear to help restore those  communities and those territories to some degree of normalcy. That is  what they expect the American Government to do. These budgets would  make that all but impossible.   So we look at it both ways. Later, we will propose a Democratic  alternative that actually makes those kind of investments and makes  sure that the notion of American security is not just a huge military,  but is a foundation of investment in human capital and research and  infrastructure that will allow this economy to grow. We do it with  keeping debt at the same percentage of the economy, as it is now,  because we are willing to raise revenues.   On the other hand, Republican budgets, both the Republican Study  Committee budget and the chairman's budget, anticipate enormous tax  cuts for the wealthiest Americans and corporations--tax cuts that have  been proven to do exactly the opposite of what many on the other side  claim they do, which is to stimulate economic growth.   We will hear claims that, yes, we can cut taxes by $2 trillion or $3  trillion over 10 years, and they are going to be paid for by this  renewal of economic activity. But history tells us that is not what  happens. Not only history tells us that, but virtually all the  economists in the country tell us that, too.   Goldman Sachs, Steve Mnuchin's previous employer, says that the tax  cuts outlined last week would maybe create an additional 0.2 percent of  growth in the economy.   CBO and the Federal Reserve say tax cuts don't pay for themselves.  Even Bruce Bartlett, the author of ``Reaganomics,'' says this whole  notion that tax cuts pay for themselves is nonsense. He actually said  bull, which is half of what he said, but you get the idea.   This is not easy. We can speak in the darkest terms of how we are  imposing this debt on our grandchildren and try to use emotional  arguments. But the fact is, we are dealing with a very realistic,  pragmatic dilemma, and that is: how to do what the American people  expect us to do without making the future impossible.   It is not done by the Republican budgets. We think it is helped along  by the Democratic alternative, and we look forward to having that  debate just a little bit later this morning.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I feel like I have to be Paul Harvey for a  second and talk about the rest of the story.   Because while what Mr. McClintock said was true about the initial  phases of the Reagan administration, at the end of the Reagan  administration, the national debt had almost tripled, and he had been  forced to raise taxes a couple of times in the interim.   So, again, we can argue about how positive cutting taxes were in the  Reagan administration, but the end result wasn't particularly good for  the American economy.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms.  Schakowsky), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Vermont (Mr. Welch), a distinguished member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Vermont.    Mr. Chairman, in closing, I would just say that we need  to cut right to the chase.   It is unlikely that either the Republican Study Committee budget or  the Republican Budget Committee budget could pass this House. It  certainly couldn't pass the Congress.   This is all about moving the ball forward so we can push through a  massive tax cut to the wealthiest Americans, with 51 votes in the  Senate. That is what this day is about, and that is what this process  is about.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to reject both the Republican  Study Committee budget and the Republican Budget Committee budget, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, Democrats and Republicans are looking at the same  challenges facing our country and American families. Education,  healthcare, and housing costs have all increased while wages stay  stagnant.   It used to be that the two parties would debate different strategies  to address the problems facing the American people. Sadly, those times  are behind us.   In giving millionaires, including the majority of this Congress, the  President, and wealthy donors a giant tax cut, the Republican budget  does not even pretend to address the problems facing the American  people. Not only does it ignore working families, it increases their  challenges.   The Democratic budget alternative, in stark contrast to the  Republican budget, begins to address the real challenges our country  faces now and in the long term.                                time  1015    We are less than a decade removed from the worst economic crisis in  most of our lifetimes, and we have a chance to rebound in a way that  builds a foundation for our country to thrive for generations, but we  have to seize that opportunity.   Rather than giving resources to people and businesses that already  have them, we are calling for targeted investments in programs that  grow our economy, create good-paying jobs, and provide real support for  working families and real security in retirement.   Rather than sending thank-you notes to the corporations that bankroll  campaigns, we have an opportunity to make vital public investments that  lead to a brighter future rebuilding roads, bridges, and other critical  infrastructure, all of which lead to good jobs now and in the long run.   Rather than giving the President a multimillion-dollar refund on  taxes he refuses to disclose, we can invest in retirement security for  seniors who didn't inherit millions. We can invest in affordable  education so young people do not have to grow up wealthy to have a shot  at earning it in their future careers.   Instead of taking healthcare away from people, straining emergency  rooms, and making Americans sicker, we have an opportunity to continue  investing in affordable quality healthcare for all of us, finally  eliminating a great burden on American families, a burden that no other  developed nation shares.   This budget is an opportunity for our country to invest in our  future, and if we adopt the Republican budget plan, we will have  squandered it.   Democrats believe in a government that prioritizes American families,  and they should be the priorities of this Congress. I, therefore, urge  my colleagues to oppose the Republican budget and support the  Democratic alternative.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Jeffries), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen), a distinguished member of the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Nolan), a distinguished member of the Agriculture  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a distinguished member of the Budget  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, in closing, it is clear that we have a very different  budget and a very different understanding of the challenges facing our  country. We see that so many Americans are working harder and longer  and can't remember the last time they got a raise.   We know families are worried about how to pay for college, or if  their parents' retirement is secure, or if they will ever be able to  afford to stop working. And we know that trillions of dollars in tax  cuts for millionaires and large corporations will turn these fears of  hardworking Americans families into reality.                                time  1045    Just a few minutes ago, my Republican colleague from Ohio talked  about what the American people want. On many of those things, we agree.  But I know one thing the American people don't want. They don't want  massive tax cuts for the top 1 percent of Americans.   The Democratic budget rejects tax cuts for the wealthy. We invest in  programs that will grow our economy, create good-paying jobs, provide  real support for working families and real security in retirement. We  make education  [[Page H7879]]  and childcare more affordable, and we support policies to help every  American get the healthcare that they need.   Those are the priorities of our budget, and they are the priorities  of the American people.   I, therefore, urge my colleagues to support the Democratic  alternative, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.

Madam Chairwoman, I yield myself 4 minutes.   Madam Chairwoman, I suppose I should be saying thank you. I will get  a huge tax cut under the Republican tax cut plan, as well the majority  of those people sitting here--the majority of our colleagues in  Congress--who are, like me, fortunate enough to be millionaires  already.   Forgive me if I am in no mood to say thank you, because I was elected  not just to represent millionaires, but to represent aspiring  millionaires, working families, seniors, and veterans. For all of them,  for anyone who isn't already a millionaire, this budget is a slap in  the face.   With all of the problems facing our country right now, all the people  struggling to get ahead, it is unfathomable to me that this Congress  could look at people like me and say: Hey, that guy, let's give him  more money. In fact, let's give all millionaires hundreds of thousands  of dollars in tax cuts.   Really, I am small potatoes. President Trump, according to his  financial disclosure, will get hundreds of millions of dollars in tax  cuts.   Where is all that money coming from? If you are listening to this and  you are not a millionaire, probably from you.   To pay for our own tax cuts and the tax cuts for wealthy donors,  Republicans are going to increase taxes on 45 percent of American  families with children. That is just the start. Seniors, people with  disabilities, and low-income families will see their healthcare cut.   Poor seniors will lose benefits that help them keep food on the table  and their homes heated in the winter. Veteran benefits, meals for  hungry schoolchildren, programs that make education affordable and job  training available, investments that generate economic growth and  create good-paying jobs are all at risk in this budget.   They are also cutting corporate tax rates, which we will be paying  for by plunging our Nation into deeper and deeper debt, giving  multinational giants another advantage over small- and mid-size  businesses in the name of perpetuating the myth of supply-side  economics.   Supply-side failed. They renamed it trickle-down, but nothing  trickled down. Now it is job creators. When that fails, maybe they will  call it ``I get mine now; you get yours later--maybe.'' But whatever  they name it, it is a sham. This plan is a hoax on the American people,  and it will make most people's lives more difficult.   So forgive me if I am in no mood to say thank you for the extra money  in my pocket. With millions of Americans struggling and scraping to get  ahead, and with my tax cut increasing their challenges, I cannot begin  to justify my extra money, and, quite frankly, I cannot fathom how my  Republican colleagues are able to justify theirs.   With this budget, Republicans aren't just passing the buck, they are  pocketing it. Madam Chair, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``no''  on the Republican budget.   Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Pelosi), the distinguished minority leader.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
