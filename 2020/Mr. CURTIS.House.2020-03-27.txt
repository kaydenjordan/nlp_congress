 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the CARES Act, the  largest economic disaster recovery package in our Nation's history.  Given the size and the scope of this pandemic, it is a hefty price tag  that must be paid.   But I challenge my colleagues to join me in dealing with the  consequences of spending money we don't have. It is time to get our  financial house in order before it becomes our next crisis.   I represent a State that has a balanced budget and a rainy day fund.  We do it on a State level, and we can do it on a Federal level.  [[Page H1826]]    I have heard stories of the devastating effects of COVID-19. One of  the most important, unique parts of Utah's culture is the pride we take  in serving one another, especially in a time of crisis. This spirit,  coupled with the targeted stream of resources designed to keep money in  the economy and people healthy, will be the key ingredients to ensuring  communities across the State can fully heal from this unprecedented  crisis. We will weather this storm together.
