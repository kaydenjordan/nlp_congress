 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor and recognize Native  American Heritage Month.   Oregon currently has nine federally recognized Tribes, three of which  I am proud to represent here in Congress: The Confederated Tribes of  Grand Ronde, the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians, and the  Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs. I work closely with these Tribal  governments and with Tribal members, and I am proud to partner with  them and support their work.   Oregon's Tribes do incredible work to protect precious natural  resources, to save our salmon, to lift up Native youth, to keep our  communities safe, and so much more.   I want to specifically thank Siletz Chairwoman Dee Pigsley, Grand  Ronde Chairwoman Cheryle Kennedy, and Warm Springs Chairman Raymond  Tsumpti for their leadership.   I also want to acknowledge that Grand Ronde, Siletz, and Warm Springs  are confederations of Tribes that were terminated in 1954 in an  insidious act that ended the government's recognition of Tribal  sovereignty and dismissed the government's trust responsibility in  western Oregon and across the country. Their restoration is only  beginning.   Because of this, Congress must do more to ensure that we are honoring  our commitments to Tribes and taking seriously our trust  responsibility.                            ____________________
