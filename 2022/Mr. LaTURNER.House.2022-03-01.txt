 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the brave men and  women across Ukraine fighting for their freedom and standing strong  against Vladimir Putin and his gang of thugs. As our adversaries look  on, it is time our Nation's leaders step up on the world stage and  restore peace through American strength and power.   Make no mistake. This unprovoked invasion of Ukraine is an attack on  democracy, and Russia must be held accountable for their actions. The  United States must immediately impose additional crippling economic  sanctions against Putin and provide further military and humanitarian  aid to the Ukraine fighting forces.   Most importantly, it is vital that we end our Nation's reliance on  Russia's energy industry by unleashing domestic energy production right  here in the United States. Energy security is national security.   I continue to be inspired by the countless acts of bravery and  leadership by President Zelensky and his people as they fight for their  freedom and independence. May God give strength and comfort to the  people of Ukraine.                            ____________________
