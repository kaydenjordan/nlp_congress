Not less frequently than once every 10 years, the Secretary       of Commerce, in consultation with the United States Travel       and Tourism Advisory Board, the Tourism Policy Council, the       Secretary of State, and the Secretary of Homeland Security,       shall develop and submit to Congress a 10-year travel and       tourism strategy, which shall include--        (1) the establishment of goals with respect to the number       of annual international visitors to the United States and the       annual value of travel and tourism commerce in the United       States during such 10-year period;        (2) the resources needed to achieve the goals established       pursuant to paragraph (1); and        (3) recommendations for statutory or regulatory changes       that would be necessary to achieve such goals.

Section 3 of the Act of July 19, 1940, entitled ``An Act to       encourage travel in the United States, and for other       purposes'' (15 U.S.C. 1546) is amended--        (1) by striking ``sec. 3'' and all that follows through       ``The Secretary of the Interior is authorized'' and inserting       the following:       ``SEC. 3.

SEC. 6. DATA ON DOMESTIC TRAVEL AND TOURISM.         The Secretary of Commerce, subject to the availability of       appropriations, shall collect and make public aggregate data       on domestic travel and tourism trends.       SEC. 7. COMPLETION OF PROCEEDING.         If the Secretary of Commerce has, before the date of the       enactment of this Act, taken action that in whole or in part       implements this Act or the amendments made by this Act, the       Secretary is not required to revisit such action, but only to       the extent such action is consistent with this Act and the       amendments made by this Act.       SEC. 8. DEFINED TERM.         In this Act, the term ``COVID-19 public health       emergency''--        (1) means the public health emergency first declared on       January 31, 2020, by the Secretary of Health and Human       Services under section 319 of the Public Health Service Act       (42 U.S.C. 247d) with respect to COVID-19; and        (2) includes any renewal of such declaration pursuant to       such section 319.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 6965.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6965, the Visit America  Act.   Since the beginning of the COVID pandemic, America's travel and  tourism industry has been seriously upended. The pandemic caused a 48  percent reduction for the industry in 2020. The bipartisan Visit  America Act is the latest bill that the House has brought to the floor  to help turn the tide for a sector that has not rebounded as quickly as  some others.   From the Committee on Energy and Commerce, we are so happy that we  are able to bring this to the floor.   While travel has certainly increased over the last year, it is still  significantly lower than previously before the pandemic. As an example,  business travel spending is on the rise, but it is still expected to be  50 percent below 2019 levels. In the meantime, the number of travelers  visiting the United States from overseas fell by 79 percent in  September 2021 as compared to that same month in 2019.   These are significant reductions that are impacting not only  companies directly involved in the tourism and travel industry but  small businesses all across the Nation that rely on travelers to keep  them in business.   Today, the United States is the only G20 country not to have a high- ranking official focusing on the travel and tourism industry. This has  prevented the industry from producing a coordinated approach to  recovery of the industry and to make us more competitive with the rest  of the world.   H.R. 6965 addresses this deficiency and provides the industry with a  path forward for continuing recovery and growth in the future. This  bill establishes the role of the assistant secretary of commerce for  travel and tourism at the Department of Commerce. It also requires the  assistant secretary to develop and implement a COVID-19 pandemic  recovery strategy, as well as strategic plans for future disruptions  that hopefully we aren't going to see.   The bill also requires the Department of Commerce to develop a 10- year travel and tourism strategy, as well as provides statutory  authority for the United States Travel and Tourism Advisory Board,  which will aid the assistant secretary in developing and implementing  these important strategies.   H.R. 6965 passed out of the Committee on Energy and Commerce last  week unanimously, 56-0. I commend the tireless and passionate efforts  put forth by Representative Titus, the author of this legislation.  Without her and the good work done by Representatives Soto, Case,  Kuster, and the late Don Young--God bless his heart--we would not have  gotten this agenda done. I also thank Chairmen Nadler and Meeks for  working with us to get this to the House floor today.   I know the Senate has also been working on travel and tourism  legislation and is moving forward with a package of bills that includes  the Visit America Act. Although there are some technical differences  between the two bills, my hope is that we can get together and work  together as quickly as possible and get this legislation passed.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                        Committee on the Judiciary,                                Washington, DC, September 23, 2022.      Hon. Frank Pallone, Jr.      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Pallone: This letter is to advise you that       the Committee on the Judiciary has now had an opportunity to       review the provisions in H.R. 6965, the ``Visit America       Act,'' that fall within our Rule X jurisdiction. I appreciate       your consulting with us on those provisions. The Judiciary       Committee is willing to forgo action on H.R. 6965, with the       understanding that we do not thereby waive any future       jurisdictional claim over those provisions or their subject       matters.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.            Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman.                                   ____                                            House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                 Washington, DC, September 23, 2022.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler: Thank you for consulting with the       Committee on Energy and Commerce and agreeing to be       discharged from further consideration of H.R. 6965, the       ``Visit America Act,'' so that the bill may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your Committee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this measure or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will place our letters into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. I       appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work together as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                 Washington, DC, September 26, 2022.      Hon. Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Chair, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chair Pallone: In recognition of the desire to       expedite consideration of H.R. 6965, the ``Visit America       Act,'' the Committee on Foreign Affairs agrees to waive       formal consideration of the bill as to provisions that fall       within the rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Foreign       Affairs.        The Committee on Foreign Affairs takes this action with the       mutual understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and the Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any issues within our  [[Page H8157]]       jurisdiction. I ask you to support the appointment of       Committee on Foreign Affairs conferees during any House-      Senate conference convened on this legislation.        Finally, thank you for agreeing to include a copy of our       exchange of letters in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of H.R. 6965.            Sincerely,                                                  Gregory W. Meeks,                                                          Chairman.                                          House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                 Washington, DC, September 27, 2022.      Hon. Gregory W. Meeks,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      Washington, DC.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Hawaii (Mr. Case).
