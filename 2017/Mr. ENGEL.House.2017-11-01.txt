 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I rise in strong support of this measure.   Mr. Speaker, as a New Yorker, my heart aches today. The appalling  loss of life on the streets of Manhattan yesterday is a reminder that  terrorism remains a threat that demands our focus.   Confronting violent extremism requires sound, reasoned policies;  policies proportional to the threat, policies based on good  intelligence, careful analysis, and a clear understanding of what we  are up against, not policies based on hysterical reactions or biases  against certain faiths or nationalities.   I support this bill because it will ensure that the State Department  has the tools to prevent American terrorists from traveling abroad or  returning to our country.   Under this legislation, the Secretary of State could refuse to issue  a passport or revoke a passport for any American who has provided  assistance to foreign terrorist organizations. Importantly, it also  affords anyone affected the right to an appeals process, helping to  ensure due process rights.   This bill is just common sense. It is also a vital aspect of the  fight against terrorism. We don't want known threats crossing our  borders or slipping from country to country anywhere in the world.   The bill we are considering today would not have, obviously,  prevented yesterday's attack, but this is important. This is just a  piece of a larger strategy.   The President yesterday called our judicial system, which would  prosecute the perpetrator of yesterday's attack, a joke and a laughing  stock. I beg to disagree. That is our judicial system, which  successfully prosecuted shoe bomber Richard Reid; Ramzi Yousef, the  1993 World Trade Center bomber; Faisal Shahzad, the Times Square  bomber; and Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, Osama Bin Laden's son-in-law, in March  of 2014.   Mr. Speaker, the judicial branch has done quite a good job in  prosecuting terrorists. Let's show them a little confidence and give  credit where credit is due.   This is deadly serious. The man suspected in yesterday's attack was  reportedly radicalized after he arrived in the United States. We have  seen this before in San Bernardino and Orlando. ISIS inspires its  adherents from thousands of miles away. That is a problem. And just as  this bill gets at a narrow, specific potential vulnerability, policies  to deal with homegrown extremists and terrorists should take a hard  look at causes and take appropriate action to prevent this sort of  radicalization on American shores.   We won't solve this problem by slamming shut America's front door and  clamping down on immigration. In fact, doing so just contributes to the  terrorist's ideological ammunition and recruitment efforts. There are  proven ways to combat terrorism, but demonizing a religion or chipping  away at constitutional rights won't work. Those approaches play right  into the tactics terrorists use to radicalize vulnerable Americans,  making us less safe and less free.   I want to thank Representatives Poe and Keating, who lead our  Committee on Foreign Affairs' Subcommittee on Terrorism,  Nonproliferation, and Trade. Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan bill gets to  the real concern in the fight against terrorism. I am pleased to  support it.   With all due respect to Mr. Poe, that is just the way it is.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. Keating), the ranking member of the Terrorism, Nonproliferation,  and Trade Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, let me thank Chairman Royce from California,  as well as Representatives Poe and Keating for their remarks.   This is a good bill. It is a commonsense bill. It is a good example  of how we need to legislate when it comes to terrorism. We are acting  out of innovation, out of careful analysis, not out of fear.   We all feel the sting today of an attack on American soil yesterday.  As lawmakers, one of our most important jobs is to help keep Americans  safe, and there is no worse heartbreak than when we see innocent lives  lost.   Mr. Speaker, I am glad we are moving this bipartisan measure today. I  am pleased to support it. I urge all Members to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1845     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of this measure.  [[Page H8367]]    Let me start by thanking our chairman on the Foreign Affairs  Committee, Ed Royce of California, for his leadership and for working  with me to bring this measure forward.   I introduced this resolution with Representatives Chabot, Yoho,  Sherman, and Smith, and I want to thank them all for their partnership.   I really listened intently to Mr. Yoho and also know that we make  progress on the Foreign Affairs Committee because, as Mr. Poe of Texas  said, we work in bipartisan measure, and we try to agree on the  language and we try to make sure that the U.S. Congress speaks with one  voice so that both our friends and adversaries around the world will  understand that we put partisanship aside. We leave it at the water's  edge, and I think that is very important.   I think the kind of people the Foreign Affairs Committee attracts to  serve on the committee, on both sides of the aisle, are the kind who  keep perpetuating this bipartisan spirit because we have differences in  policies, for sure, but we are all Americans. We all want to keep each  other safe, and we all want to make sure that America does the right  thing and that others do the right thing to America as well.   So when we have the incident like we had yesterday with the terrible  terrorist attack in Manhattan, it makes us pause, as a Congress, and  think about what this all means.   People in Hong Kong were made promises as well. They were made  promises years ago that China would be one country, including Hong  Kong, but two systems, that Hong Kong would be its independent system.  And, of course, the Chinese officials and Beijing regime have tried  every which way to go after student protesting, curbing the rights and  values of the people of Hong Kong, so this resolution is really very,  very important.   I thank, again, Representatives Smith, Sherman, Yoho, and Chabot. But  I also want to recognize Doug Anderson and Sean O'Neill on the  chairman's staff for their contributions to this resolution, and  Jennifer Hendrixson-White on my staff. It is a great example, again, of  bipartisanship when it comes to foreign policy. We work together and we  produce what I regard as superior products.   For decades, Mr. Speaker, the United States has shared an important,  unique relationship with Hong Kong. That relationship has been based on  Hong Kong's autonomy from Mainland China. This resolution underscores  our national security interest in seeing Hong Kong remain autonomous at  a time when we have seen some troubling trends.   Twenty years ago, at the time of the handover, China made a  commitment that Hong Kong would continue to enjoy its special status.  Today, China claims that the 1997 Joint Declaration is a so-called  ``historical document'' that has, again, ``no practical significance.''  But the UK and the United States believe in international law, and we  are committed to holding China to its word, again, a ``one country, two  systems'' form of government in Hong Kong.    This approach was experimental when the Chinese and British first  devised it. You may remember that Hong Kong was a British colony. The  Chinese Government essentially said that Hong Kong would continue to  have its own executive, legislative, and judicial rights, that the  people of Hong Kong would continue to enjoy fundamental rights  guaranteed in Hong Kong's laws. But Beijing is now backing away from  its commitments, even declaring the Joint Declaration a historical  document with no relevance today.   Meddling in Hong Kong's elections by China's National People's  Congress led to the Umbrella protests in 2014. Hong Kong residents  critical of the People's Republic of China have disappeared, while the  presence of the People's Liberation Army has grown.   The credibility of Hong Kong's courts has suffered following  decisions to send Umbrella Movement student leaders to prison after  they had already served their previous sentences. Academic freedoms  have eroded. Self-censorship has grown, and journalists face regular  harassment.   So we are worried, Mr. Speaker. We are worried about Chinese  encroachment, about what is going to happen to the people of Hong Kong,  and about the way China's newly aggressive posture is going to affect  our relationship with Hong Kong in the future.   Twenty years after accepting the so-called ``one country, two  systems'' model, China's objective now seems to be making Hong Kong and  the mainland ``one country, one system.'' This is not what the  government in Beijing, the international community, the United States,  Great Britain, or the people of Hong Kong signed up for.   So this issue raises bigger questions, Mr. Speaker:   To what degree will the Chinese Government live up to its  international commitments as China continues to expand economically and  grow in stature on the global stage?   This measure says, ``Enough.'' It sends a message to China that we in  the United States Congress expect Beijing to keep its word. That is not  asking too much. It reiterates that our special bond with Hong Kong is  based on our shared values, the values of democracy, and that we want  to see that relationship endure for years to come.   So I am grateful to my colleagues for working on this measure with  me, especially Mr. Yoho. I ask support from all Members.                                time  1900    In closing, Mr. Speaker, let me again remind everyone that Hong Kong  is special because of its judicial independence and strong rule of law  that is supposed to be protected under the ``one country, two systems''  approach. That is also the reason why the United States shares such a  strong strategic relationship with Hong Kong.   This resolution is a reminder of why our ties with Hong Kong are so  important, and a call for all parties to respect the decades-old  commitments that have underpinned Hong Kong's autonomy. At a time when  China is growing more and more aggressive in its neighborhood, the  United States cannot be seen as ceding ground. We need to stand up for  our friends. We need to stand up for our values. We need to stand up  for our interests. We need to hold all countries to their commitments,  just as the United States lives up to our own.   I ask for all Members to support this measure. I thank our chairman,  Ed Royce, and Mr. Yoho for their remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
