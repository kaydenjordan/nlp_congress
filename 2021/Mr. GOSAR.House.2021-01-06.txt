 Mr. Vice President, I, Paul Gosar from Arizona, rise for  myself and 60 of my colleagues to object to the counting of the  electoral ballots from Arizona.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Is the objection in writing and signed by a  Senator?    Yes, it is.   Senator CRUZ. It is.   The VICE PRESIDENT. An objection presented in writing and signed by  both a Representative and a Senator complies with the law, chapter 1 of  title 3, United States Code.   The Clerk will report the objection.   The Clerk read the objection as follows:     Objection to Counting the Electoral Votes of the State of Arizona         We, a Member of the House of Representatives and a United       States Senator, object to the counting of the electoral votes       of the State of Arizona on the ground that they were not,       under all of the known circumstances, regularly given.                                                        Paul Gosar,                                  Representative, State of Arizona.

There was no objection.   The VICE PRESIDENT. The two Houses will withdraw from joint session.  Each House will deliberate separately on the pending objection and  report its decision back to the joint session.   The Senate will now retire to its Chamber.   The Senate retired to its Chamber.                                time  1315                         Announcement by the Speaker     Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my objection.    Madam Speaker, I filed my challenge on the slate of  electors from the State of Arizona that was actually put forward by  Governor Ducey of Arizona.   My ask to you, the Speaker, through the Vice President, is simple. Do  not count these electors until and unless the secretary of state allows  a forensic audit of the election, a request she has denied repeatedly.   We have been told over and over that even though this was a public  election using public money and public machines utilizing public  employees, the public today has no ability to simply double-check the  veracity of these results.                                time  1415    If the Presidential election was a football game, we would get a  slow-motion review from multiple angles and a  [[Page H85]]  correction of a controversial decision. But not so, we are told by our  secretary of state, for the Presidential election, no review for you.   No access to the Dominion voting machines with a documented history  of enabling fraud through its now discredited adjudication system, a  system that literally allows one person to change tens of thousands of  votes in mere minutes.   In the only audit done in Arizona, a court found 3 percent error rate  against President Trump. Vice President Biden's margin of error was  one-tenth of that, at 0.03 percent. By the way, a 3 percent error rate  at minimum is 90,000 ballots. After finding the 3 percent error rate,  the court stopped the audit and refused to go further.   In Arizona, as my attachments make clear, mail-in ballots were  altered on the first day of counting as shown in data graphs we have  provided, as concluded by data analysts. Over 400,000 mail-in ballots  were altered, switched from President Trump to Vice President Biden, or  completely erased from President Trump's totals.   The proof is in the counting curves, the curves that cannot occur  except with odds so rare and unlikely that winning the Mega Millions  lottery is more probable.   Mr. Speaker, can I have order in the Chamber?                                    Recess     Mr. Speaker, as I was saying, the probability of these  ectopic curves, you have a better likelihood of winning the Mega  Millions lottery than you do having statistical issues here.   Over 30,000 illegal aliens voted in Arizona using the Federal ballot,  yet our secretary of state refused the public access to review the  ballots.   Over a thousand residences were visited for proof of residency and  address; 456 failed that test. They were vacant lots. Even the  Recorder's office was used as an address.   What are they hiding? If the process was fair, these would be  improbable. These would be once-in-a-lifetime-type applications.   So let's look at the ballots, the signatures, and the adjudicated  records. Until this is done, Mr. Speaker, we should not count this  slate.   You have a letter from the Arizona Legislature stating its intent to  review the issue on January 11. Our Governor has refused to allow the  State to properly convene to do its proper oversight.   Mr. Speaker, I ask you one question today: Are you a ceremonial  figurehead in your current role, or did the drafters of the 12th  Amendment and Congress, in the Electoral Count Act of 1887, envision a  role where you made discretionary decisions about ballot fraud and fair  elections?   If you are merely ceremonial, then let's be done with this. Let's eat  our tea and crumpets and witness our national decline.   But if you are not merely ceremonial but vested with discernment,  rationality, and legal authority to not just count from 1 to 270, then  do not accept Arizona's electors as certified. Remand the slate back to  the secretary of state, back to the Governor, with the following  instructions: Until a full, complete electoral forensic audit is  allowed by the secretary of state, the electors currently certified  will not be counted.   It will then fall on the State of Arizona to decide are its electors  in the game or not. Anything less is an abdication of our  constitutional Republic and our ethos: one man, one vote.    We ask: Why? What is there to hide? Shouldn't the lawful victor of an  election be proud, open, and transparent about an election audit? I  would. Instead, we are met with denials, cover-ups, and contempt of  subpoenas.   There is too much evidence of fraud, demonstrated by statistical  anomalies that experts have determined cannot happen in the absence of  fraud, to accept such a slate. I am not asking these electors never be  counted; it is just that they need to be certified the proper way.   Our beloved Constitution is but a mere piece of paper if we do not  follow the law, upholding the law. But now, alas, we find ourselves  lawless, destroying the very thread that binds us together. But we need  to get back to the rule of law. That is what has been violated, truly,  by the actions in these States.                                    Recess
