 Mr. President, our intelligence community unanimously  agrees that Russia interfered in the 2016 elections and that there is  an imminent threat to the 2018 elections. Our country, our democracy,  is under attack, and we should respond. Let's heed the warnings of our  intelligence agencies. The lights are blinking red. Let's listen to our  State attorneys general and Secretaries of State.   My amendment does provide $250 million for State election security  grants to protect our upcoming election. It helps States improve  election cyber security, replace outdated election equipment. We did  provide, as the distinguished Senator said, $380 million in fiscal year  2018. That was the first new funding for election security in years,  but more is needed.   The President is not going to act. The duty has fallen to us. Let's  not, after an election, find out that this country was defenseless  against attacks from Russia, and then say: Oh, gosh, we should have  done something.   This is not a partisan issue. Republicans and Democrats have to be  concerned. I urge an ``aye'' vote on my amendment to secure our  elections.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, Senator Shelby and I both worked hard  through this process to keep out poison pill riders. This amendment is  a partisan poison pill.   We talk about repealing the Federal mandate, but of course, by doing  that, we saw a direct premium increase as a result of that repeal. The  District of Columbia and States like Vermont passed their own mandates  to keep premiums down. Just like Vermont, DC should have the authority  to make its own laws. Instead of telling all of those people who claim  we must have States' rights, here we are telling the District of  Columbia: We will tell you what to do. That is not democracy.   So I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.    I yield to the Senator from Alabama.    Madam President, I thank the senior Senator from Alabama  for his kind words. I also thank our two leaders for their kind words.  Senator Shelby and I met with Senator McConnell and Senator Schumer  earlier this year, and we said that we want to get the Senate back to  what it should be and what it has been. What better way than to do it  on the appropriations bills. I have served here longer than anybody in  this body. I have seen it when it has worked and when it hasn't worked.  Senator Shelby and I felt we could do it.   I urge an ``aye'' vote on this final passage, second minibus package.  Each of these were reported by the Appropriations Committee  unanimously, Republicans and Democrats voting together. Some of us said  we couldn't agree on the Sun rising in the East, but we agreed.   Incidentally, my dear friend, the Senator from Alabama--I wish to  note that the tie I am wearing is one that he and Dr. Shelby gave me  for my birthday this year. I thought that might be a good touch.   I thank what both Senators McConnell and Schumer said. They worked  very hard with us.   The Agriculture bill continues strong support for our country's  farmers. It abandons the Trump budget's proposal to leave rural  communities behind and instead invests in rural development and housing  programs.   The Financial Services bill supports regulatory agencies that the  American people rely on to protect them from unfair, unsafe or  fraudulent business practices.   The Interior bill rejects the anti-science know-nothing agenda  proposed by the Trump administration by protecting the Environmental  Protection Agency from the President's proposed reckless and slashing  cuts. It preserves investments that ensure our children and  grandchildren will enjoy clean air and water. It supports our National  Parks, which are treasures that must be protected for future  generations.   Finally, thanks to the bipartisan budget agreement, the  Transportation bill contains $10 billion in new funding compared to  fiscal year 2017 to invest in our Nation's housing and infrastructure.  Every Member in this body knows of the urgent need to address the  crumbling infrastructure that plagues each of our States. This is a  good first step.   We are here today because Chairman Shelby and I, along with the  subcommittee chairs and ranking members, worked hard to produce  bipartisan bills with input from both Republicans and Democrats. Over  the past 2 weeks, the Senate voted on 11 amendments, and agreed to a  manager's package that contained 46 amendments important to our  Members.   This is the way the Senate is supposed to work: regular order.   Our bipartisan success is due to the Shelby, Leahy, McConnell,  Schumer commitment to move through this process with bipartisan  support, at spending levels agreed to in the bipartisan budget deal,  and reject poison pill riders and controversial authorizing language.   The House, unfortunately, is pursuing a different path. They are  taking up partisan bills filled with poison pill riders that cannot and  will not pass the Senate. If our progress is to continue, the bills  that come out of conference must be bills that can pass the Senate,  which means they must be free of poison pills.   I am disappointed my election security grant amendment was rejected  by the Senate. The integrity of our elections, which are the foundation  of our democracy, should not be a partisan issue. It is unfortunate  that the Senate voted down funding our States need to help upgrade  their election infrastructure and secure our elections from  interference by Russia and other foreign adversaries ahead of the 2018  midterms. We need to heed the warnings of our intelligence agencies, of  the lights blinking red, of the appeals from the attorneys general, the  secretaries of State, and the State and local election officials who  are sounding the alarm. This duty has fallen to us, and we must not  later be found to have been asleep at the switch, with so much at  stake.   But this minibus is the result of hard work and compromise on the  part of the chair and ranking member of each subcommittee. While it is  not perfect, it will touch the lives of the American people in every  State from improving roads to protecting our forests, and I urge that  Senators vote ``aye'' on final passage.   If we pass this bill today, we will have passed seven appropriations  bills out of the Senate and have a firm commitment to take up two more  in the coming weeks. It wouldn't have worked if the chairman had not  committed himself to what the rest of us did but also the chairs and  the ranking members of the subcommittees we have here--Senators Hoeven,  Merkley, Murkowski, Udall, Collins, Reed, Lankford, and Coons.   I also want to thank the majority staff: Shannon Hines, David Adkins,  and Jonathan Graffeo, as well as their subcommittee staff.   I often say that Senators are merely constitutional impediments to  their staff. I know my staff has worked long hours. I might get home on  a Saturday or Sunday, and they are still working, people like Charles  Kieffer, Chanda Betourney, Jessica Berry, Rachael Taylor, Dianne  Nellor, Dabney Hegg, Ellen Murray, and all of the subcommittee staff.   Finally, I wish to thank Jessica Shulkin, who is going to be leaving  the Appropriations Committee in August after nearly 18 years for the  Agriculture Subcommittee. Her expertise, her hard work, and her working  in a bipartisan and professional way has advanced our Nation's  agricultural policy, helped our rural communities, and has kept USDA  and the FDA answerable to Congress. I wish Jessica all the best. She  has been a pleasure to work with.   In conclusion, I have a list of all the staff, and I ask unanimous  consent that it be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:        Vice Chairman Leahy List of Minibus #2 Staff for the Record         Charles Kieffer, Chanda Betourney, Jessica Berry, Jay       Tilton, Rachael Taylor, Ellen Murray, Dianne Nellor, Dabney       Hegg, Ryan Hunt, Melissa Zimmerman, Teri Curtin, Diana       Hamilton, Reeves Hart, Jessica Schulken, Bob Ross, Christina       Monroe, Nathan Robinson, Jordan Stone, Jean Kwon, Shannon       Hines, Jonathan Graffeo, David  [[Page S5538]]       Adkins, Leif Fonnesbeck, Andrew Newton, Carlisle Clarke,       Clare Doherty, Emy Lesofski, Nona McCoy, Chris Tomassi,       Lauren Comeau, Brian Daner, Patrick Carroll, Elizabeth Dent,       Gus Maples, Rajat Mathur, Jacob Press, Jason Woolwine.     In conclusion, I thank Senator Shelby, Senator McConnell,  and Senator Schumer. We worked together. It is kind of nice when  something works out.   I yield the floor.                         Amendment No. 3400 Withdrawn     Madam President, I yield back the remainder of my time,  and I ask for the yeas and nays.    What is the parliamentary situation? Are we in morning  business?    Mr. President, I do have a few comments I will make.   Mr. President, I have had the privilege of serving in the U.S. Senate  for 44 years. For 20 of those 44 years, I was either the chairman or  the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. During those 44 years, I  have seen 19 nominations to the Supreme Court. I voted for most of the  nominees--for both Republican and Democratic Presidents. The first one  was John Paul Stevens, who was nominated by President Ford.   I voted on every current member of our Nation's highest Court.   When I was in Vermont over the weekend I was thinking of these  nominations, and I believe that I have never seen so much at stake with  a single seat as with the current nomination of Judge Kavanaugh.   There is one thing we can all agree upon, Republicans and Democrats  alike, that like many Supreme Court nominees before him, Judge  Kavanaugh has impressive academic credentials and judicial experience.  But unlike most of his predecessors, Judge Kavanaugh also had a  lengthy, partisan career.   Prior to his time on the bench, Judge Kavanaugh was a political  operative engaged in some of the most divisive fights in our Nation's  recent history--including Kenneth Starr's investigation of President  Clinton, Bush v. Gore, and five contentious years as a senior official  in President George W. Bush's administration.   It is no surprise, then, that Judge Kavanaugh has quite a paper  trail--over one million pages. His lengthy, controversial record was  something that the White House was well aware of when the President  selected him. But the President selected him, nonetheless. Under the  advice and consent clause of the Constitution, the burden falls now to  the Judiciary Committee to review his record. It should be self-evident  that records relating to an especially significant period of a Supreme  Court nominee's career should be among those most closely examined by  the Senate.   Indeed, the methodical review of a federal court nominee's full  record is not optional. It is the most fundamental part of the Senate's  constitutional obligation to provide advice and consent. In fact, we  saw just a few weeks ago that such vetting led to the withdrawal of a  circuit court nominee with a record of very offensive college writings.   This process must be even more exhaustive for a nomination to our  Nation's highest Court.   One only need look to the Senate's consideration of Justice Elena  Kagan. Like Judge Kavanaugh, she served in the White House prior to her  nomination. I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee at the time. I  worked with the ranking member at the time, Senator Jeff Sessions. We  requested the full universe of her documents from the Clinton  Presidential Library. We worked together. We wanted to ensure the  request was expedited. We wanted the collection to be complete.   Crucially, President Obama made no claims of executive privilege. In  fact, less than one percent of the documents were withheld on personal  privacy grounds. To this day, those emails are posted online for anyone  to see.   Then, I also supported then-Senator Sessions' request for documents  related to military recruitment at Harvard. Military recruitment at  Harvard is not the sort of thing one thinks of for a Supreme Court  nominee, but Justice Kagan, a brilliant lawyer, had been dean of the  law school.   Well, that request was beyond the scope of our committee's usual  practice, but I agreed with the Republicans that the records could  potentially be of public interest, and therefore they ought to be  subject to public scrutiny.   Transparency weighed in favor of disclosure, but, then, transparency  almost always does.   For Justice Sotomayor, when I was chair, I joined then-Ranking Member  Jeff Sessions to request decades-old records from Justice Sotomayor's  time working with a civil rights organization in the 1980s. Remember,  she was a sitting judge on an appellate court, and we had her record,  which is what some of the Republicans are saying is all we should look  at with Judge Kavanaugh. They wanted the documents during the time she  had worked with a civil rights organization decades before. We did have  3,000 opinions that she had written over the 17 years she served as an  appellate and district court Federal judge. Every Republican wanted  those records, and those of us who were in the majority, the Democrats,  said: Fine, the public should know what they are. We agreed.   What a change, what a change--they wanted to have the records from  Justice Kagan and Justice Sotomayor, and they had to come up with those  records, but he doesn't have to. This is what the American people  deserve to see from Judge Kavanaugh. Every document of public interest  should be made public with no artificial restrictions and no abuse of  executive privilege.   The American people deserve the unvarnished truth of this man, just  as Senate Republicans rightly demanded of the two highly qualified  women that President Obama nominated. We wanted the records from them,  and we want the records from him, but, unfortunately, the Judiciary  Committee is not on track to uphold its bipartisan standard of  transparency. Two weeks ago, my Republican friends expressed a  willingness to request White House documents that Judge Kavanaugh  authored or contributed to as Staff Secretary of President Bush. We  thought it was very similar to requests made of Justice Sotomayor and  Justice Kagan.   But then they had a private meeting with White House Counsel last  week. Now, suddenly, we can't do that. Suddenly, the White House, a  different branch of government, is telling the independent Senate  Judiciary Committee what they have to do, and suddenly all of Judge  Kavanaugh's Staff Secretary records were off-limits.  [[Page S5549]]    Then last Friday, in a stark departure from committee precedent,  Chairman Grassley, who is a friend of mine, shocked me when he sent a  partisan request that omitted any and all records from Judge  Kavanaugh's three contentious years as Staff Secretary. This was a  particularly extraordinary admission, given that Judge Kavanaugh  himself singled out his three years as Staff Secretary as ``among the  most instructive'' for him as a judge, when he provided advice ``on any  issue that may cross the [president's] desk.'' During this time, Judge  Kavanaugh said he helped to ``put together legislation,'' and he  ``worked on drafting and revising executive orders.''   Karl Rove described Judge Kavanaugh as playing a major role in  reviewing and improving practically every policy document that made it  to the President. Judge Kavanaugh said this experience gave him a  ``keen perspective on our system of separated power.''   Yet, Senate Republicans don't want to see any of it. Not even those  memos and other documents that Judge Kavanaugh himself authored and  edited.   Just as I worked to provide these same documents when the Republicans  requested them in a Democratic administration, I do not believe the  Senate can fulfill its constitutional duty to provide advice and  informed consent to a nominee for our Nation's highest Court without  vetting three years' of such critical records.   That is why, yesterday, I joined Ranking Member Feinstein and the  other Judiciary Democrats to send our own records request to the Bush  Presidential Library. The request mirrors--not surprisingly--almost  word for word the request I sent with then-Senator Jeff Sessions for  Justice Kagan.   We simply cannot have a lower standard of transparency for Trump  nominees than for past nominees of both Republican and Democratic  Presidents. The fact that the Judiciary Committee is willing to move  forward without Judge Kavanaugh's full record is especially alarming  because the last time Judge Kavanaugh testified before the Senate under  oath, he appeared to provide a misleading account of his work at the  Bush White House.   In his 2006 confirmation hearing, I and other senators asked about  his knowledge of several Bush-era scandals, including warrantless  wiretapping, torture, and detainee treatment. Judge Kavanaugh testified  he had no knowledge of such issues until he read about it in the paper.  He testified in response to a question from Senator Durbin that he  ``was not involved in the questions about the rules governing detention  of combatants.'' Again, this was under oath.   After his confirmation, press reports indicated that he had  participated in a heated discussion in the White House over the  legality of detainee policies. Judge Kavanaugh discussed whether the  Supreme Court would uphold the Bush administration's decision to deny  lawyers to certain enemy combatants. Judge Kavanaugh advised that his  former boss, Justice Kennedy, would likely reject the argument that the  White House was putting forth.   I try to look at this conversation every way I can. I was a trial  lawyer. I took depositions. I argued cases. I am trying to reconcile it  with Judge Kavanaugh's sworn testimony under oath, but it is  impossible. It makes it all the more critical that we review his  complete White House record to find out what he really did.   The only records I have seen from Judge Kavanaugh's time as Staff  Secretary are a handful of emails previously released through an  unrelated FOIA request. One happens to show very clearly that Judge  Kavanaugh was looped in, notwithstanding his statement, on the Bush  White House's efforts to message the infamous torture memos. From the 1  million records that exist on Judge Kavanaugh, we have but one drop in  the bucket, but in that one drop, they are discussing torture. It is  something he said that he had read about only in the papers. Yet this  email shows he worked on these issues while in the White House.   I am afraid that my Republican friends clearly do not want records  from Judge Kavanaugh's three years as staff secretary to be public, but  the fact that records may be controversial doesn't mean they should be  hidden from the public view. Indeed, just the opposite principle  applies. Just as we gave all of the records on President Obama's  nominations, we should do this.   The American people must not be in the dark about controversial  aspects of a nominee's record. Certain principles are more important  than party. Transparency is one of them.   We have learned this lesson before. Wearing blinders when considering  a former administration official for a lifetime judgeship presents  grave risks.   When President Bush nominated Justice Department lawyer Jay Bybee to  the Ninth Circuit in 2003, I and other Senators asked about his  involvement in the legal issues surrounding the war on terror. He  didn't answer our questions. But a year after he was sworn in for a  lifetime position on the Federal court, the American people learned  that Judge Bybee gave the legal green light for the official use of  torture, something that most people now agree is one of the darkest  chapters in our nation's history. Had we known that at the time, Judge  Bybee would still be known as Mr. Bybee. He never would have been  confirmed. A majority of Republicans and Democrats would have voted  against him.   Judge Kavanaugh was directly involved in some of the most politically  charged moments of our recent history. The Senate owes the American  people an unsparing examination of his nomination--a nomination that  could shape their lives for a generation.   It is my hope that Senate Republicans and Chairman Grassley will  reconsider their partial records request for Judge Kavanaugh and join  the Democrats' request for all of his records. I agreed when they  demanded that for Justices Kagan and Sotomayor.   Well, if that is the standard we followed for both of those  tremendous jurists--Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Justice Elena Kagan-- shouldn't we demand the same of Judge Brett Kavanaugh? He is no  different than they are on the issue of what he has had to say. We  ought to find out what it is. Then make up your mind; vote for him or  vote against him. I am pretty sure that had we gotten the right answers  on then-Mr. Bybee, he never would have become Judge Bybee.   I don't believe that many Senators of either party will stand up here  and say that it is great that we broke the law on torture for dubious  reasons.   I see the Senator from Missouri.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, Vermont is special in large part because of  the dedication and kindness that Vermonters show to neighbors and  strangers alike. I would like to recognize a few Vermonters in  particular who went out of their way to do what needed to be done to  save the lives of others. On July 6, a number of boaters became  stranded on the water near the Colchester Causeway Bike Ferry while  enjoying themselves on Lake Champlain. Luckily for those in distress,  the crew of the Bike Ferry was nearby, and sprang into action.   After quickly rescuing four people, Captain Brian Costello, deckhand  and former coastguardsman Frank Malaki, and captain-in-training Richard  Schattman were told that there were more people who needed assistance.  Before long, all those who had been stranded were safe and sound, with  warm clothes, water, and shelter, thanks to the ferry's crew.   Anyone who has enjoyed the beauty of our great Lake Champlain knows  that, in bad weather, its calm, rolling waves can quickly turn  treacherous. We have always been lucky to have the protection of the  Coast Guard on the water in times of emergency, but it should hearten  many to hear that there are also professional, courageous, and selfless  Vermonters like Captain Costello, Mr. Malaki, and captain-in-training  Schattman nearby to lend a hand.   I share the pride of the Coast Guard in this lifesaving effort. I ask  unanimous consent that the July 19, 2018, article from ``My Champlain  Valley'' entitled ``Bike-ferry crew recognized by Coast Guard for  heroic rescue,'' which commemorates the bravery of these men, be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                 [From My Champlain Valley, July 19, 2018]        Bike Ferry Crew Recognized by Coast Guard for Heroic Rescue                              (By Devin Bates)         South Hero, VT.--A crew from the Colchester Causeway Bike       Ferry got some special recognition from the U.S. Coast Guard       on Thursday for rescuing seven people in Lake Champlain       earlier this month.        Coast Guard officials were so impressed with the crew's       work that they came down to the causeway to express their       gratitude and thank them for their heroic act.        The rescue happened the afternoon of July 6. Winds were       gusty, reaching 25-30 mph. The ferry crew--Cpt. Brian       Costello, former Coast Guardsman and deckhand Frank Malaki       and Captain-in-training Richard Schattman--tracked down and       rescued four people. Three kayakers--including one in the       water--were rescued a short time later.        All seven of the boaters were wearing life jackets and were       unharmed. The crew gave them warm clothes, shelter from the       wind and bottled water.        The rescue occurred just days after 41 year-old Eric Plett       of Weehawken, New Jersey, went missing after falling out of       his kayak near Shelburne Point. Plett's body was recovered       several days later after a search by the Coast Guard and       state police.        ``Any good Vermonter would respond to people in distress,       whether it's on the water or on land, and we happened to be       the closest,'' Costello said. ``We also happen to have an       experienced and trained crew.''        While the crew members were modest about their efforts,       Sector Commander Brian LeFebvre of the U.S. Coast Guard made       sure to give them the recognition they deserved.        ``I applaud the crew, their dedication and selfless service       to the boating public, and I am truly thankful for the       professional seamanship that you exercised in response to       these potentially grave situations,'' LeFebvre said. ``Bravo       Zulu for a job extremely well-done, and thank you very       much.''        LeFebvre urged boaters to be safe out on the lake.        ``Anything can happen at any given time when you're on the       water, even when you least expect it,'' LeFebvre said. ``It's       always important to be wearing your life jacket, especially       if you're on a paddle-craft or in a kayak.''                            ____________________
