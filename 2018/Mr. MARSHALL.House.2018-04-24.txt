 Mr. Speaker, if I could today, I would like to share a  story about one of my favorite communities in Kansas.   At 3,681 feet of elevation, Goodland, Kansas, sits on the border of  the Kansas-Colorado line. You can look to the west and see the Rocky  Mountains literally rising out of the Earth. Partially because of that  elevation and the many hot, dry days there, the farmers have struggled  for decades for a great crop.   But about 20 years ago, one of my good friends, Alan Townsend, and  the farmers who make up 21st Century Bean, started growing pinto beans.  They had some success, and then they started growing black-eyed peas  and garbanzos as well.   Today, 21st Century Bean grows 40 million pounds of beans every day.  They had success at that, and they said: You know what else we can do?  We can process and package these here. So they formed a processing  plant and hired more employees. That was a success. Eventually, they  hired a trucking company. They now have their own trucking company to  ship their products. Today, and every day, 21st Century Bean ships out  enough beans to feed a million people across this country. The great  thing is, their main customer is food banks across this great country  as well.   I am so proud that we have made food banks such a priority in this  year's nutrition bill, the farm bill. This year, we are going to  increase spending from $15 million to $60 million for food banks. Some  other significant products coming out of this nutrition bill is that we  are going to make access to nutrition easier for the elderly, for those  in the military, and, what I am especially proud of, we are rewarding  children for making healthy choices like fresh vegetables and fresh  fruit, as well as the greatest drink known to mankind, wholesome milk.   Mr. Speaker, as an OB/GYN for the past 30 years, I certainly know how  important nutrition is, from preconception, during pregnancy,  breastfeeding moms, and all the way to the last decades of life. I am  so proud that this bill has made a priority helping protect  [[Page H3456]]  those on the edges of life: the newborn and the elderly.   I am proud that our country spends $115 billion every year to help  those who need food assistance and spends another $3 billion of  nutrition assistance across the world. But what I am really proud of,  though, is this gives everybody on food stamps and nutrition assistance  a chance, an opportunity for some type of work training.   I think there is no greater gift we can give to people than teaching  them how to fish, as well as giving them fish when they are in need. I  think that this is a great thing to do. I think it is a great  opportunity for people. Over 80 percent of Americans believe in this  policy. I believe that this is not a punishment, but rather an  opportunity we give to people.   I stand so proudly behind the nutrition component of this farm bill,  which we have strived so hard to improve.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, April 29 through May 5 is National Small  Business Week.   Recent studies and surveys have shown that small business optimism is  at an all-time high, and I have seen that firsthand with the businesses  I have met throughout the big First District in Kansas.   Today, I rise to recognize the hard work and perseverance our small- business owners have and acknowledge their critical role in our local  communities.   In the United States, small businesses create about two out of every  three jobs per year, and more than half of Americans either own or work  for a small business.   Over the past year and a half, I have had the opportunity to have  meaningful conversations with many of the small businesses across my  district. From Superior Boilerworks in Hutchinson to Midwest Energy in  Hays, I have listened and learned about the issues they face and the  ways that Congress can better support small businesses in Kansas.   Due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, I am proud that small businesses  will now work with lower tax rates and a fairer Tax Code. From big  cities to small towns, entrepreneurs and small-business owners across  the country are creating jobs and contributing to the growth of local  economies.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in celebrating our  small-business leaders.                            ____________________
