 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 906, I  call up the bill (H.R. 4468) to prohibit the Administrator of the  Environmental Protection Agency from finalizing, implementing, or  enforcing a proposed rule with respect to emissions from vehicles, and  for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the  House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  on the legislation and to include extraneous material in the Record on  H.R. 4468.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4468, the Choice in Automobile  Retail Sales Act, and I urge all Members to support its passage.   America's economy is at its best when innovation, free enterprise,  and consumer choice rule the day. This formula once made America a  world leader in the automotive sector. Unfortunately, some key  decisionmakers have forgotten that. Elected officials, government  regulators, and auto manufacturers eager to appease their liberal  overlords, especially those in the Biden administration, need a  reminder of that fact.   It is troubling that this administration, in a faltering economy,  would try to replace reliable, available, functional, and affordable  transportation for hardworking Americans with something far less  reliable, far less available, far less functional, and far less  affordable.   Under EPA's recent tailpipe proposal, two-thirds of all new cars  being sold in America must be electric-powered vehicles by 2032. That  is only 8 years from now.   The American people did not ask for this.   While the average price of an EV reportedly fell 22.4 percent in the  last year in response to lack of demand and government subsidies, they  are still far more expensive than a liquid fuel vehicle.   There are also hidden costs: $500 extra annually for insurance; at  least $4,000 for battery replacement, and that is the bottom; $1,200 to  $2,500 for home charging equipment. That is after you pay to rewire  your home.   Range anxiety is still a real concern. EVs need more frequent and  much longer stops for charges. The average EV gets about 234 miles per  charge compared to 403 miles with a gas fill-up. Plus, cold weather,  battery size, and towing weight can shrink battery range significantly.   Any way you look at it, working-class Americans who need reliable and  affordable transportation would take a hit from a mandate eliminating  their options.   This bill protects our constituents, allowing them to buy the  automobile that makes the most sense for them.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for H.R. 4468, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, this bill does not prevent the  EPA from finalizing a rule. It only tells the EPA that it cannot  mandate a specific technology and prevents the EPA from issuing rules  that limit a vehicle's availability based on engine type.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Washington  (Mrs. Rodgers), the chair of the full committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg), the author of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Clyde), the co-lead for this bill.    Madam Speaker, I have tremendous respect for my  colleague that just spoke, but I have to say that this idea that  electric vehicles are emission-free is totally unfounded.   In fact, it is totally false. All you have to do is look at where the  raw materials come from. Look at how China produces those materials.  There are lots of emissions. If the argument is legitimate that we are  going to saves lives here, we are going to cost lives over there  because they are not concerned about the climate. They are not  concerned with the environment, they are not concerned about the people  that they use--slave labor in many cases--to try to harvest the  materials that make these electric vehicles in the first place.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr.  Bucshon).    Madam Speaker, we actually agree on some things  with our Democrat colleagues. We agree that we ought to keep the  environment clean: the air, water, and land. But throwing money at it,  like my Democrat colleagues are trying to do, is not the answer to the  problem.   This rule would result in lost middle-class jobs in the United States  because we can't get new facilities and infrastructure even permitted  to do these things under the current administration. Until that  happens, America will be heavily reliant on China.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs.  Lesko).    Madam Speaker, again, I agree, vote America. I  urge my Democrat colleagues to remember that fossil fuels have raised  more people around this planet across the globe out of poverty than any  other fuel source on the planet, and America knows how to do that best.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr.  Pence), my friend and colleague on the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds  to the gentleman from Indiana.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Weber).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Mr. Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Balderson), my friend, colleague, and neighbor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Fulcher).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Pfluger), my friend and outstanding member of the  Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Obernolte).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Stauber).  [[Page H6165]]         Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Williams), an auto dealer.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa), my friend and  colleague, to close.    Mr. Speaker, that was my closing, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise as the designee of the  gentlewoman from Washington, and I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, the purpose of the CARS Act is to  permit Americans, not the executive branch of the Federal Government,  to continue deciding what type of car makes the most sense for them.   The purpose is not to reopen decades-old requirements that Americans  have become accustomed to with their cars, and which manufacturers  consider to be standard--whether it is the catalytic converter or the  onboard diagnostic system, especially because those regulations were  not trying to do away with an engine type--but, rather, to just address  the most harmful pollution coming from that car.   Rather than creating any confusion for EPA, automakers, or the  public, or leading to unintended consequences or unnecessary  litigation, this amendment sets a limit on how far back in time the  provisions of H.R. 4468 apply.   Instead of applying to any regulation ever issued in the history of  the authority provided under Clean Air Act section 202(a), the  manager's amendment caps the retroactivity of the bill's provisions to  section 202(a) regulations, including revisions, proposed or prescribed  on or after January 1, 2021.   By adding this date, the legislation focuses on pushing back on  regulations that would have the Federal Government, and not Americans,  decide what kinds of cars they should be able to drive.   For over 100 years, Americans have been free to buy their own mode of  transportation based upon what is available, reliable, affordable, and  functional for their lives. Quite frankly, it was because of these  criteria that electric vehicles never took off with American consumers,  but the Model T did.   The Congressional Budget Office has concluded that adopting this  amendment would have an insignificant net effect on the deficit.   I urge all Members to support the amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time to close.   Mr. Speaker, let's look at what we have heard today. If we want to  help America's autoworkers, then let's keep them on the job. It takes a  lot less labor to make electric vehicles than it does to make  combustion engine vehicles.   If we want to protect the environment, then let's keep China from  doing all the mining and refining of the rare earth minerals and  critical materials, and supply chain that we actually need to make  electric vehicles here in America.   If we want to stop supporting China, rather than buy Chinese cars,  which is where this is ultimately going to go if we continue down this  road, let's permit mining and refining of critical materials right here  in America so when we do make electric vehicles, and we give the  American people a choice about purchasing those vehicles, they are made  with American materials mined and refined in America by American  workers rather than putting money in the pockets of the Chinese  Communist Party.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to think about what the future  looks like. We need to rein in the EPA's egregious rule mandating  electric vehicles.   Let me remind you, Republicans are not opposed to electric vehicles.  I have a lot of friends who own electric vehicles. Not very many of  them live in Appalachia, rural communities, where they are impractical  and unaffordable, but if we want to empower the American people with  choice, then we need to roll back this EV mandate because the day will  come when the only choice that people will have is to buy a car that is  manufactured in China by China. That will be the only thing that is  going to be available because we can't get permits here in America to  do our mining and refining of those critical materials.   China has already sent signals that they are going to start and have  already started withholding those critical materials that we need to  make electric vehicles.   The Chinese are setting a trap. God forbid if we let the Biden  administration force us to fall into that trap.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4468, the Choice in  Automobile Retail Sales Act. I urge my colleagues to support it, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
