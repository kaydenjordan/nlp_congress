 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 1:45  p.m. today the Senate vote on the confirmation of the Baranwal  nomination, with all other provisions under the previous order  remaining in effect.    Madam President, yesterday I had a chance to sit down  with a group of my constituents visiting DC from the Rio Grande Valley.  For those who have never been to the Rio Grande Valley, I highly  recommend a visit. It is a beautiful region, a unique part of our  country, rich in culture and history and full of hard-working people  and businesses that fuel our State's and the Nation's thriving economy.  As record numbers of people continue to mass migrate across our  southern border, it has become one of the most heavily impacted areas  in our country, and it is working hard to manage the growing  humanitarian crisis.   Last month alone, 144,000 people were detained coming across our  border. It was the largest monthly total since 2006. It only begins to  paint the picture of how challenging this mass migration has become.  The vast majority of the people who crossed last month were either  unaccompanied children or families, putting a strain on resources  across the border, particularly when it comes to detention facilities.   It is no mistake that the human smugglers, whom we call coyotes back  home, have figured out that if you can smuggle an unaccompanied child  or family across the border, you vastly improve the chances of  successfully placing them in the United States. That is because they  understand our laws better than many Members of Congress do, and they  know how to exploit them for their financial gain.   The detention facilities I referred to a moment ago have been around  a long time--long before the current surge of families and children  began arriving at our borders. They were built as short-term detention  facilities for single adults. As trends have changed, the men and women  of Customs and Border Protection have done everything in their power to  make these facilities workable on an increasingly thin and inadequate  budget.   I want to pause for a moment to say thank you to the men and women in  uniform who are providing around-the-clock enforcement of our laws and  providing quality and compassionate care to the migrants in their  custody. It is a tough job. When you train to be a Customs and Border  Patrol agent, you are not trained in child care, but that is what many  of them find themselves doing--handing out juice boxes and diapers and  providing assistance to those families as they seek to have their  claims for asylum adjudicated.   This is a tough job, and it is getting tougher every day,  particularly in the Rio Grande Valley and along the border. Of the  144,000 crossings last month, nearly 50,000 were apprehended in the Rio  Grande Valley, making it the most heavily impacted of the entire  border.   In fact, it should come as no surprise that Texas is impacted more  than any other State because, of course, we share a 1,200-mile common  border with Mexico. Two-thirds of the apprehensions so far this fiscal  year have occurred in the Rio Grande Valley, El Paso, or Del Rio  sectors. As Federal resources have rapidly depleted, Customs and Border  Protection officers and agents have struggled to manage the processing,  care, and transportation of these migrants, and local communities, it  should be no surprise, have stepped in.   The Humanitarian Respite Center in McAllen is one of several  locations working to care for the migrants and has had its doors open  for 5 years now. In the summer of 2014, we saw then-unprecedented  numbers of Central Americans, particularly children, arriving at the  border. This was back when President Obama called this a ``humanitarian  and security crisis.'' The scenes were heartbreaking and spurred many  folks to action to try to offer their help.   Sister Norma Pimentel is the executive director of Catholic Charities  in the Rio Grande Valley and led the creation of this respite center.  Migrants who are released by CBP or ICE and are awaiting a court date  are often dropped off at the center by officers or agents themselves.  There they can get food, a hot shower, a good night's sleep, and travel  to wherever they are going to await their court date.   There is certainly a need for this type of assistance under the  circumstances, and it has been in existence only 5 years. The respite  center has helped more than 150,000 people and continues its work as  more people cross the border each day.   The number of unaccompanied children who illegally entered the United  States last month is higher than in any other month since the 2014  surge that I mentioned a moment ago. The weight felt by those trying to  provide assistance is getting heavier and heavier. As Federal resources  dwindle, local communities in the Rio Grande Valley and along the  entire Texas-Mexico border have been filling the gaps, despite the fact  that, obviously, immigration and the sovereignty of our borders are  Federal responsibilities. In the absence of Federal response, it is the  State and local communities that have had to step up to help.   Like the respite center in McAllen, these communities regularly  provide care, transportation, food, and shelter for migrants in need. I  believe this generosity shows the true Texas spirit and helps  illustrate how serious the problem has become and how desperately  additional Federal resources are needed.   Thankfully, yesterday the Appropriations Committee took action. The  committee announced an agreement on a border supplemental package that  will include humanitarian assistance needed at the border. The nearly  $4.6 billion includes funding to support the missions of the Department  of Health and Human Services, which is providing care for the record  number of unaccompanied children who are arriving in the United States.  It also provides funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which  is working to enforce our laws and properly care for the adults and  families in their custody, as well as the Departments of Justice and  Defense. The hard-working men and women in these Departments are  working tirelessly to care for the migrants in their custody, and I  want to thank each of them for working day in and day out to enforce  our laws. But, as I mentioned, these are not the only folks trying to  provide support with minimal support from the U.S. Government.   Earlier this month I sent a letter to the chairman and ranking member  of both the Appropriations Committee and the Homeland Security  Subcommittee, requesting that the funding package include reimbursement  for local communities that helped carry the weight of the humanitarian  crisis. NGOs, nongovernmental organizations, like the respite center in  McAllen are trying to do more and more with less and less. Cities and  counties are diverting hard-to-come-by taxpayer dollars from their  intended purposes, such as public safety, power, and clean drinking  water, to do the job that is the responsibility of the Federal  Government. It is unfair for these folks to pay for a humanitarian  crisis that is not of their making. I am glad to see the Appropriations  Committee taking some action to right this wrong.  [[Page S4146]]    The funding agreement yesterday includes $30 million available  nationwide for direct reimbursement for local governments, States, and  NGOs that have spent millions of dollars to respond to this crisis.  Communities, both along the border and throughout the State of Texas,  will be able to request reimbursement directly through local and  national boards of the Emergency Food and Shelter Program at the  Federal Emergency Management Agency to help lessen the financial burden  they have incurred over the past few months.   I want to thank the chairman and ranking member and all of our  colleagues on the Appropriations Committee for supporting this effort  to help alleviate this strain on Texas communities. The funding bill  received broad bipartisan support in the committee and passed by a vote  of 30 to 1. I hope we will soon have the opportunity to pass this  important funding bill here in the Senate. I encourage our friends in  the House to put politics aside and do the same.   As happy as I am that the appropriations committee has come up with  this additional money, this is still a matter of treating the symptoms  and not the underlying cause. President Trump, in his frustrations with  congressional inaction, threatened to impose additional tariffs on the  nation of Mexico. Fortunately, the negotiations that ensued came up  with a plan for Mexico to work with the United States to begin to slow  down or stop the flow of people from Central America across Mexico into  the United States.   I have never seen anything quite like that before in terms of our  relationship with Mexico. They have historically tended to view  immigration as our problem, not theirs, as well as the drug problem,  because the demand in America is our problem and not theirs. This  really represents a change of attitude on behalf of President Lopez  Obrador's administration, and I want to congratulate President Lopez  Obrador and his administration for working with the United States to  address a joint problem. This is not just Mexico's problem. This is not  just the problem of the United States. This is our shared challenge.  Working together, I am confident we can begin to address it.   Finally, I want to say that Congress has largely been AWOL when it  comes to dealing with this humanitarian crisis up to this point. A  couple of months ago, my colleague from the House of Representatives,  Henry Cuellar, a Democrat from Laredo, TX, and I introduced a bill we  called the HUMANE Act, which would fix some of the gaps in our laws  that are being exploited by the human smugglers and are causing this  humanitarian crisis in this huge flood of humanity coming into the  United States.   If Congress would accept its responsibility and do its job, it would  never have been necessary for the President to threaten additional  tariffs on Mexico, forcing this diplomatic negotiation. I am glad it  resulted in a good and positive outcome, that negotiation, but the  fault ultimately lies with Congress for not taking up and debating and  voting on bipartisan legislation like the HUMANE Act that has been  introduced in the Senate and in the House.   I will say that Chairman Graham of the Judiciary Committee has been  focused like a laser on this issue. We were scheduled to mark up a bill  today in the Judiciary Committee that I believe would incorporate many  provisions of the HUMANE Act as part of a bill which would, I believe,  address this humanitarian pull factor because of exploitation of those  gaps in our asylum laws. That now has been postponed, but I hope the  discussions will continue because, ultimately, this is a matter of  congressional responsibility. We can be glad that the Appropriations  Committee stepped up and provided additional resources, including this  $30 million in reimbursement for local communities. We can be glad that  Mexico and the United States are finally now working together on this  shared challenge, but ultimately, if we are going to address not just  the symptoms but the causes of this humanitarian crisis, it is up to  Congress. I believe the American people will ultimately hold us  accountable, as they should.    Mr. President, I have 7 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
