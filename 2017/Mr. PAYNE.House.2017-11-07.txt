 Mr. Speaker, 1 year ago today, the United States held an  election for President.   Going into that election, there were 251 million Americans old enough  to vote, but only 139 million people actually voted. That means that  just 55.3 percent of the voting-age population took part in the  selection of the person to fill our Nation's highest office.   Mr. Speaker, we should break down barriers to voting, not build them.  We should make registering to vote easier, not harder. We should ensure  elections are competitive, not guaranteed.   Mr. Speaker, we must restore the Voting Rights Act. We must restore  voting rights for people who have served their prison sentences. We  must end partisan gerrymandering. We must protect the sanctity of our  elections. We must do this before the next Federal election.                            ____________________
