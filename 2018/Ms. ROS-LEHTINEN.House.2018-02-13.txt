 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Wilson for presenting this  bill before us today, and I rise in strong support of his bill, the  Hamas Human Shields Prevention Act. I was proud to join Mr. Wilson and  others as an original cosponsor.   Three years ago, the House and Senate both unanimously passed a  concurrent resolution that I authored which denounced the use of human  shields by Hamas and, indeed, any other terror group.   Using human shields is an unconscionable practice. It is a gross  violation of international laws and norms. Yet, invariably, the use of  human shields ends up being a winning strategy for Hamas. Why?   Because the international community falls for its deadly ploy. This  is despite the fact that Israel is unmatched in its efforts to avoid  civilian casualties.   We know Hamas forces Palestinians into becoming human shields, and  the terror group is known for firing on Israeli targets from heavily  populated areas or from places like schools or mosques. They do this on  purpose.   This disgusting practice underscores the fact that Hamas doesn't care  at all about the well-being of the Palestinian people, and the sole  purpose of Hamas is to try to force Israel into a situation in which it  may harm civilians, hoping to turn the public sentiment against the  Jewish State.   Mr. Wilson's bill, therefore, puts down an important marker, Mr.  Speaker. It builds upon our previous efforts by adding punitive  measures identifying and then sanctioning anyone affiliated with Hamas  who uses human shields.   Responsible nations must not allow Hamas to continue to use this  cynical ploy, and we in the United States have a responsibility to lead  and to ensure that this gruesome tactic is ended once and for all.   I thank Mr. Wilson from South Carolina for this initiative, and I  urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this important and much- needed measure before us today. I thank Mr. Wilson for, once again,  highlighting this cynical, deadly, and disgusting ploy being used by  Hamas.    Mr. Speaker, as we observe American Heart Month, we  are reminded of how important diet and lifestyle choices are to our  health.   Sadly, heart disease remains the leading cause of death in our  country. Making heart healthy choices, knowing your family's heart  history, and regular checkups are all integral parts of cardiovascular  health.   Organizations like our very own United Way of Miami-Dade work  alongside community clinics to conduct screenings and tests to help  prevent and manage health issues. This month, United Way of Miami-Dade  is partnered with FamilyWize, a program that provides access to  affordable prescription medications.   The University of Miami's HeartAware risk assessment is an online  screening survey offered by UHealth. This program helps patients  identify their risk for developing cardiovascular disease, learn the  next steps based on their risk factors, and promotes lifestyle changes  to lower their risk of heart disease.   Let us all take time during American Heart Month to focus on our  hearts and encourage not only ourselves but our family and friends to  live healthier lives.                            ____________________
