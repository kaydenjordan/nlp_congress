 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   I rise in support of the resolutions presented by my friends from  California, Congresswoman Lee and Congressman Khanna. They are long  overdue.   The actions of this President over the last few weeks are an  escalation of the reckless, arrogant, and ignorant foreign policy of  this White House, if you can even call these hasty decisions a policy.  The President's actions lack a coherent strategy. He lacks an  understanding of history, and he lacks the foresight to see the  consequences of his actions.   Last week, the House and the Senate received briefings that failed to  answer our questions about the basic facts behind the decision to kill  Major General Qasem Soleimani. Republican Senators themselves said the  briefing was so poorly presented that they left more opposed to the  President's actions than before they were briefed.   In other words, the more we learn about this debacle, the less faith  anyone has in the White House's ability to make these decisions.   Some of the questions asked by Members of Congress in that briefing  went unanswered for so-called security reasons. Yet they were later  addressed in interviews and press conferences by members of the  administration as they tried to cover for the President's lies and  obfuscations.   That is why I will join Democrats, and hopefully any Member of the  House unwilling to watch us enter another endless war, in voting for  these bills to limit the President's ability to engage in further  aggression with Iran and keep American troops out of harm's way.   The President has spent the days since his ill-advised attack  blustering to reporters and on twitter, including threatening to attack  cultural sites, a war crime of which the only outcome would be maiming  and killing civilians.   Just last week he ticked off a list of Iranian aggressions that he  claimed were the result of the Iran deal. In fact, each event he cited  occurred only after his foolish decision to pull out of the deal. These  resolutions are critical to curtailing any further misguided action by  President Trump.   The fact is, this action that he has taken makes Americans less safe.  It threatens our diplomats abroad with retribution, it threatens our  military personnel in the region, and it threatens Americans working in  the region.   Many, many years ago, Senator George McGovern said: ``I am fed up to  the ears with old men dreaming up wars for young men to die in.'' Well,  I am fed up too, and so are the American people.   Reports suggest the President thought this move would be celebrated  by Americans. But I speak for myself and the hundreds of constituents  who have messaged me when I say: No more, Mr. Trump. We don't want this  war. We don't want war with Iran. No continuing escalation, no more  killings, and no more sending our daughters and sons into harm's way to  appease the fragile egos of the men in the White House.   I call on all my colleagues to support the resolutions of my  colleagues, Ms. Lee and Mr. Khanna.   And I send a clear message to the White House: Your days of reckless  misadventures with the lives of Americans are over.                                time  1730
