 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Memorial Day and  the upcoming 75th anniversary of D-day to recognize and raise awareness  about the 320th Barrage Balloon Battalion. It was an all-Black  battalion that made considerable contributions during D-day.   Until recently, the 320th battalion's sacrifices and bravery have  been virtually unrecognized. Until the recent book ``Forgotten: The  Untold Story of D-Day's Black Heroes, at Home and at War'' by Linda  Hervieux, the story had really gone untold. People didn't really know  about it.   It is notable that one of the soldiers who is featured in the book-- his name is Wilson Monk--his quote to the author when she called him  was, ``I've been waiting for this call for over 50 years.''   When we look back at the social injustices of the 1940s during Jim  Crow, it is clear that the social discrimination created momentum for  the civil rights protests in the 1950s and 1960s. The lunch counter  sit-ins in Montgomery and the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, the  social injustices that  [[Page H4073]]  were in the news--sadly, always in the news--are documented very well  in our textbooks, but much of the military discrimination against  African Americans was not documented very well.   I want to take a minute today to thank those African American  soldiers who fought during World War II for their valor and sacrifice  for our country.   You may not have heard of the 320th battalion, but on the morning of  June 6, 1944, the unit of African American soldiers landed on the  beaches of France. Their orders were to man a curtain of armed balloons  meant to deter enemy aircraft. They flew at an altitude of about 200  feet to defend soldiers landing on the beaches against strafing attacks  by German aircraft. The battalion served 140 days in France.   One member of the 320th battalion wounded in battle, Waverly B.  Woodson, Jr., would later be nominated for the Medal of Honor, an award  he would never receive.   The Nation's highest decorations were not given to African American  soldiers in World War II. Members of the 320th battalion, the first  African American battalion, which included hundreds of soldiers, were  sent abroad to fight for liberties denied to them at home.   The story of the 320th battalion is a narrative of perseverance in  the face of injustice.   Earlier this week, I had the pleasure to be invited by Representative  Katherine Clark from Massachusetts to go hear the story of ``D-Day  Girls: The Spies Who Armed the Resistance, Sabotaged the Nazis, and  Helped Win World War II'' by women who played a very crucial role in  the military and spycraft that helped us during World War II. Of  course, throughout time, much of their role was relegated to being said  that they were secretaries and answered phones, but they played very  critical roles.   I know one of my former constituents who passed away not too long  ago, Robert Starr, was part of an ambulatory crew that helped pick up  the wounded and remains of people who were dead on the beaches of  Normandy. Again, the story told was that African American soldiers  worked in that role but that they were not part of the initial  invasion.   Sadly, that has been memorialized in Hollywood, as well. I think one  of the best movies about D-day of all time is ``The Longest Day,'' a  great, great movie. But, of course, there were no African American  soldiers depicted in that movie. ``Saving Private Ryan,'' another great  movie, but, again, no African American soldiers were depicted in that  movie, sadly.   It is my hope that we can raise more awareness about the 320th  Barrage Balloon Battalion, these men who fought so bravely during World  War II, so that they, too, will not just be memorialized in the  textbooks but that their story will be brought to Hollywood.    I am certain that there is a Rob Reiner or a Steven Spielberg or a  Spike Lee or someone out there who will help tell the story of these  women who fought during World War II and helped the resistance and also  these African American soldiers whose stories have not been told.   It is absolutely amazing to me that there are many African Americans  in this country even who, if you ask them, they think that there were  no Black soldiers who fought during D-day. It is a story that has been  allowed to be falsely perpetuated for far too long. It is time that we  raise awareness about the 320th battalion and the great sacrifices that  they made for this country.                            ____________________
