 Mr. President, I applaud the bipartisan work that my  Senate colleagues have put into legislation to impose sanctions on  Russia. Russia's interference in the 2016 election represents an  assault on our democracy that, until this point, has gone largely  unanswered by the Administration and Congress. Russia has also  conducted cyber attacks on allies and illegally invaded and violated  the sovereignty of Ukraine and Georgia. I know that my colleagues take  this issue very seriously, and I support the bipartisan compromise,  which will maintain existing sanctions on Russia for its cyber and  military intrusions in Ukraine and require additional mandatory  sanctions on Russia's energy sector, those providing arms to Syrian  troops, corrupt Russian oligarchs and their networks, and human rights  abusers. We cannot allow Russia's hostile actions toward Western  democracies to go unchecked. This legislation sends an important  message to Russia and the world that the United States stands strongly  against Russia's anti-democratic actions.   At the same time, the original version of the legislation would have  had unintended consequences for our nation's civil and commercial space  sectors. National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, and  commercial space missions are critical to space exploration, weather  data, and sending U.S. astronauts to the International Space Station,  as well as supplying them with cargo and instruments for scientific  research. Under the original legislation, these missions would have  been threatened or prevented from moving forward. In response, Senator  Gardner introduced an amendment that would exempt NASA and commercial  space-related launch activities from the sanctions bill. I was proud to  cosponsor this amendment.   In addition to our defense assets, Virginia is at the epicenter of  the Nation's civil space program and commercial space industry. For  more than 70 years, NASA's Wallops Flight Facility has served as a key  national asset to the U.S. space program, an economic driver for the  Eastern Shore, and an invaluable benefit to the Commonwealth. The Mid- Atlantic Regional Spaceport at Wallops Island serves as a leader in  commercial space, partnering with Virginia-headquartered Orbital ATK to  launch critical cargo to the International Space Station. Finally,  research projects at NASA Langley Research Center and Virginia's superb  academic institutions are developing tomorrow's innovative technologies  and scientific discoveries. As Governor and now Senator, I have  remained a strong supporter of Virginia's booming industry, research,  and launch services. Without Senator Gardner's amendment, some of these  activities in Virginia would cease to exist.   To be clear, I stand in agreement with my Senate colleagues on the  issue of Russian sanctions. I also believe that our space program must  transition to American-made rocket engines and parts, and I know that  U.S. companies are working hard in conjunction with NASA toward that  goal. But we need time for that transition to occur, and this important  amendment would make it possible without hurting our current  capabilities. In addition, while the Department of Defense has been  afforded the opportunity to develop new technologies while maintaining  the status quo, it is only fair that we provide the same chance to  civil and commercial space entities.   For these reasons, I was proud to cosponsor Senator Gardner's  bipartisan amendment to S. 722. I look forward to working with my  colleagues in the future to enhance and expand our Nation's space  program.    Madam President, I rise to speak about the ongoing debate  in the body concerning the next chapter in healthcare and what we can  do about it together and, especially, to address one part of the  healthcare market--the individual market.   As most know--and this has been an item about which we are deep into  discussions, the people and the Members of this body--before the  passage of the Affordable Care Act, Americans with preexisting  conditions faced unfair barriers to accessing health insurance  coverage, and healthcare costs had risen rapidly. Prior to the passage  of the Affordable Care Act, my own family, which is probably like the  healthiest family in America because the five of us have only had three  hospitalizations for three childbirths--all for my wife--we had twice  been turned down for insurance coverage for at least one member of our  family because of preexisting conditions.   Since 2010, the rate of uninsured Americans has declined to a  historic low. More than 20 million Americans have gained access to  health insurance coverage--many for the first time in their lives. In  Virginia, over 410,000 Virginians have accessed care on the individual  marketplace and another 400,000 would be eligible if Virginia decided  to expand Medicaid.   Many Virginians use the individual market, and they have shared their  stories with me on my website. I have on my Senate website ``ACA  Stories,'' where I encourage people to share their stories.   The individual marketplace, as folks know, is if you are buying  health insurance, not through an employer, and you are buying  individually--you may or may not be qualified for a subsidy--that  particular marketplace is really important for people who aren't  employed by companies that offer group plans, but it also has its  challenges.   One of my stories was from Lauren Carter, who lives in Lovingston,  VA, in Nelson County. She wrote in to say:         My 39-year-old son has cerebral palsy and a blood clotting       disorder. His ``pre-existing conditions'' started at       conception. Three years ago, he lost his full time job with       health insurance benefits.        The ACA allows him to continue receiving medical care and       purchase his life saving medications. He supports himself       through multiple part time jobs--    This young man with cerebral palsy--       employer based insurance is not an option for him at this       time.    Laura Kreynus from Mechanicsville, VA, near Richmond wrote:         My daughter was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease in April of       2013. That September, my husband was diagnosed with       Parkinson's Disease. We are farmers, we raise the food for       America. As such, we are independently insured.   [[Page S3529]]     They have no large employer to cover them.         Prior to finding a plan through the ACA in January 2015,       our monthly insurance premiums were to increase to nearly       $3,000 a month . . . yes, each MONTH! On top of that, our       health insurance had an annual cap on prescription coverage       of $5,000. The Humira that my daughter takes to combat her       Crohn's Disease retails for $3,800 a month, and that is not       the only medication she requires. So basically, after one       month, we reached the prescription coverage cap, meaning we       would have to pay $3,800 a month for medication on top of       $3,000 a month premiums. Who has an extra $6,800 a month to       pay for this? That is way more than we earn monthly as       farmers.        With the health insurance plan we got through the ACA, our       premiums for 2015 were $1,500 a month, less than half of what       we would have been paying under the previous plan. But the       real saving grace was no prescription cap, so my daughter's       medications are covered with a copay after we reach the       deductible. This is still a lot of money, but at least we can       treat our daughter's disease and hopefully keep her healthy.       And even though our premiums have gone up to nearly $2,000 a       month from $1,500 a month under the ACA, at least we can       still have insurance.    For families like Lauren's and Laura's, the individual marketplace is  critical. But like Laura said, premiums are frequently too high. You  have to have robust enrollment, competition, and certainty for premiums  to come down.   Unfortunately, there has been increasing uncertainty in the  individual market due to actions taken by the current administration.  On January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive order  directing relevant agencies not to enforce key provisions of the  Affordable Care Act. Later in January, the administration terminated  components of outreach and enrollment spending, including advertising  to encourage people to enroll in the individual marketplace.   The administration has also repeatedly threatened to end cost-sharing  reduction payments, which reduce costs for approximately 6 million  people with incomes below 250 percent of the poverty level. These  actions, these statements, these inactions, and this uncertainty have  created uncertainty in the individual marketplace, leading to  instability for insurance carriers, higher premiums, and reduced  competition.   In Virginia, we have seen Aetna and United leave the individual  marketplace, and they have cited this uncertainty created by this  administration as the principal reason. In other States, there are  counties that are at risk to have no insurers offering coverage on the  marketplace in particular States or sometimes in regions in the States.   So this is a problem we can address, and we don't have to repeal the  Affordable Care Act to do it. We just need to improve the Affordable  Care Act, using a tool that has had bipartisan support in this body for  some time.   So yesterday Senator Carper and I introduced the Individual Health  Insurance Marketplace Improvement Act, and I want to thank the other  original cosponsors of the bill: Senators Nelson, Shaheen, and Hassan.   One way to address uncertainty is to use a common insurance tool,  reinsurance--a permanent reinsurance program to help stabilize premiums  and increase competition. The Affordable Care Act originally had a  reinsurance program. It was temporary. It lasted for the first 3 years  of the program, and it did hold premiums down. What we would do is that  we would take that idea, which worked, and we would make it permanent.  We would make it permanent and modeled after a very successful and  bipartisan program: Medicare Part D. Medicare Part D provides a  prescription drug benefit for seniors. It was passed with bipartisan  support during the administration of President George W. Bush, now more  than a decade ago, and the reinsurance program has helped hold down  costs.   This reinsurance program would provide funding to offset larger than  expected insurance claims for health insurance companies participating  in State and Federal marketplaces. It would encourage them to offer  more plans in a greater number of markets, thereby improving  competition and driving down costs for patients and families.  Basically, if reinsurance can cover high costs, an insurance company  will know it has a backstop, which gives it a measure of stability, and  also can set premiums at a more reasonable level for everyone.   The bill would also do one other thing that is important. It would  provide $500 million a year from 2018 to 2020 to help States improve  outreach and enrollment for the health insurance marketplaces,  especially to draw in new members and educate the public--especially  young people who are maybe moving just past their 26th birthdays and  can no longer be contained on family policies--about the need to be  insured. The outreach funding prioritizes counties where there are  limited insurers left in the marketplace.   This is not the only improvement that is needed for our healthcare  system. We need to do more to keep costs down, figure out a way to have  prescription drugs be more affordable, and we can certainly use  technology and data to drive better health outcomes, but this is a fix.  It is a fix of an important part of our system, the individual market.  It is a fix using an idea that has already worked and has already  compelled the support of both Democrats and Republicans--reinsurance in  Medicare Part D. This should be something Democrats and Republicans can  agree to.   My worry is that we are participating now in a secretive effort to  write a healthcare bill behind closed doors and possibly put it on the  floor for a vote without hearing from a single patient, without hearing  from a single provider, a hospital, a business that has a hard time  buying insurance for its employees, an insurance company, or  pharmaceutical company.   We ought to be debating these bills in the world's greatest  deliberative body and proposing amendments and hearing from  stakeholders and then doing the best job we can when we are dealing  with the most important expenditure that anybody ever makes in their  life, healthcare. Healthcare is also one of the largest segments of the  American economy, one-sixth of the economy. Why would we want to pass a  bill in secret?   Senator Carper, my colleagues, and I have introduced this bill as a  good faith effort to say what I actually said when I first got on the  HELP Committee in early January of 2015. There is a huge group of us  just waiting for the door to open so that we can have a meaningful  discussion about moving our system forward, and I believe this bill  could be a very good part of stabilizing and improving the individual  market and bringing relief to many Americans.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
