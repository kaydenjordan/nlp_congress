 Madam Speaker, I enthusiastically support the  Juneteenth National Independence Day Act.   I am glad that Congress is finally taking action to formally  memorialize Juneteenth as a Federal holiday just a year after my home  State of New York took this step.   Juneteenth is a reminder of a sad chapter in our history but one that  we overcame, and this holiday will be a reminder that our freedom is  not guaranteed but rather something that we will always fight for.   While this new holiday is an important step, in the backdrop, there  are numerous efforts underway to limit the teaching of uncomfortable  parts of our history, and there is an insidious plan to restrict the  most important of our rights, the right to vote. Let this new holiday  be not just a reminder but also a call to action that we must continue  to work to secure our rights and freedoms.                                time  1845
