 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  CARES Act. We all know that the COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected  the health and livelihoods of people around the globe.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is not perfect, but it is a solid step forward  to providing the relief needed to revive our economy.   There is no doubt that as a Nation we have endured tough times in our  history, but we have always come back stronger and more resilient.   I am proud today to be here representing west Tennessee during this  trying time.
