 Mr. Speaker, last night, Ohio was subjected to another  Trump administration ICE worker raid involving rounding up 146 workers  at meat processing plants in Salem, Canton, and Massillon, Ohio, making  Ohio among the top States in the union where these workers have been  poached.   Again, Detroit-based ICE agents swooped into Ohio, fully armed, to  round up dozens of workers who toil in one of the least attractive jobs  in our Nation, cold, bloody, slippery, and, yes, dangerous, hard jobs  in the meat processing industry, jobs U.S. citizens don't want.   My message to President Trump: Stop the barbaric tactics. Stop  breaking up working families.   If we don't fix this system, these agricultural jobs will be  offshored, and we will be importing even more of our food. Let us set  up a dependable system to regularize the hiring of workers. Heartland  States like Ohio are capable of creating a level playing field for  businesses and workers from our country and abroad.   To take the crime out of seeking employment in the Americas requires  amending NAFTA and CAFTA by updating those accords to address  continental employment standards.   The President campaigned on reforming NAFTA. Well, Mr. President, we  are making you an offer you shouldn't refuse. Show our workers and our  companies some respect. We will meet you at any time, at any place to  broker a better deal for Ohio and heartland workers.
