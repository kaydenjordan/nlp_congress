 Mr. Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the  majority leader the schedule for the week to come.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. McCarthy), my friend, the majority leader.   (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the information.   Mr. Speaker, I note that the bill that was supposed to be on the  floor either yesterday or today dealing with DACA and dealing with the  children, who are an object of great concern by all the country, is not  mentioned in the gentleman's remarks for legislation that will be  considered next week.   The DACA bill was supposed to be voted in the second immigration bill  pursuant to the rule that we adopted this week. That vote, I thought,  had been postponed until next week. Now, however, I do not see it being  announced as a bill that is going to be considered.   It is disappointing that, after months of committing to working  together on a solution to the DACA crisis, Mr. Speaker, this week, the  House considered two partisan bills.   I would like to point out that Speaker Ryan, on September 5, 2017,  some 8 months ago, said: ``It is my hope that the House and Senate,  with the President's leadership, will be able to find consensus on a  permanent legislative solution that includes ensuring that those who  have done nothing wrong can still contribute as a valued part of this  country.''   Speaker Ryan said more recently, on February 8, 2018, when he urged  people to support the caps bill--that is, setting the limits of  expenditures--``my commitment to working together,'' and he looked at  our side of the aisle when he said that. But, Mr. Speaker, the only  persons who apparently will be included in ``working together'' are  between the Freedom Caucus and others on the Republican side of the  aisle.   He went on to say: ``My commitment to working together on an  immigration measure that we can make law is a sincere commitment. Let  me repeat,'' the Speaker said, ``my commitment to working together on  an immigration measure that we can make law is a sincere commitment. We  will solve this DACA problem.''   He said that February 8, 2018, from that rostrum on the floor of this  House. There has been no ``together.''   Now, my friend, the majority leader, Mr. Speaker, said this: ``This  all started when I was at Camp David with the President this weekend.''   We know that the majority leader is probably the closest ally that  the President has in the Congress of the United States.   ``He was telling me how, earlier last week, he was with some  Republican Senators talking about DACA. They all agreed, but he said we  can't solve that unless we bring Democrats into the room, too.''   That was Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy on FOX News on January 10,  2018.   So I ask my friend, the majority leader, can the gentleman clarify  whether or not changes will be made to H.R. 6136--that is, the Ryan- Trump so-called compromise that, from our perspective, ``together''  meant simply together among Republicans trying to decide what the  Republicans wanted to do. Can you tell me whether there will be changes  to that so-called compromise bill and whether or not that  [[Page H5574]]  bill may be brought to the floor anytime soon?   I yield to my friend.                                time  1215     Mr. Speaker, together, working with their Conference, not  with us, not, frankly, with a bipartisan group that has support on this  floor of 240 Members. 240 Members of the House of Representatives, and  you need 218 for a majority, support an option and have been asking for  that option for a long period of time.   Now, the majority leader is looking somewhat quizzical, Mr. Speaker,  and he wants to know how you get to 240; 193 plus 47.   There were 54 Republicans who asked for the rule putting four bills  on the floor, but 7 were, apparently, encouraged to take their name off  of that, so only 47 Republicans remain. All 193, that is 240. That is a  majority of the House.   What was asked for was to put four options, giving everybody a chance  to put the option that they liked on the floor. Notwithstanding Speaker  Ryan's commitment and notwithstanding the comments that Mr. McCarthy  made following his meeting at Camp David with the President of the  United States where they needed to bring Democrats in, all we have seen  is a deeply divided Republican Party negotiating with itself.   They brought a bill to the floor, and they passed the rule. The only  real effect of the rule, because the bill lost, was to negate the 216  signatures--and we believe there would have been more but for arm- twisting--to bring those compromised bills to the floor, which had both  Republicans and Democrats working together and supporting. Two of those  bills, the principal sponsors were a Republican and a Democrat.   Mr. Speaker, I would ask the gentleman, he says he is going to bring  a bill to the floor--I presume he is talking about the bill that was  going to be brought to the floor yesterday then changed to today, and  then changed to next week--whether there will be amendments in that  bill and, if so, will they be discussed with us and will we have input  into that process?   The gentleman concluded, Mr. Speaker, his comments with he hopes he  could have our support. We are not included. We are shut out. The  compromise has been rejected and undermined, and the Speaker ignored  216 people who asked for those bills to be brought to the floor, and he  said no: no openness, no transparency, closed rules, consistent with  the policies that have been followed in this, the most closed Congress  in which I have served.   So I would ask my friend again, Mr. Speaker: What changes will be  affected in the bill that would be brought to the floor, or are we  going to be told when they are brought to the floor what those changes  are?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I reclaim my time just to remind the majority  leader of what I asked.   The majority leader likes to talk about what we did in the past. His  party shut down the government, and he says I voted to shut down the  government. That is absurd that he could cite a vote of mine against  some sort of proposal that they put forward.   The question is: He refuses to put on a bipartisan, to give even the  House the opportunity to consider a bill that is supported by 240  Members of this House. And, frankly, my perception--and I am not bad at  counting, Mr. Speaker, which is why I am standing at this podium and  why the majority leader is standing at his podium. We understand  counting.   I dare him, Mr. Speaker, I dare him to put the Hurd-Aguilar bill on  the floor, and I guarantee him it will get 240 votes. The people's  House will be allowed to speak. But they are afraid to do that, Mr.  Speaker.   All of this stuff about we had meetings in his office, we had  meetings in his office and he knew, from the start, that the two things  they were asking for were nonstarters. Very frankly, I have had  discussions with the Secretary, who said: Well, we will just stick  with border security and DACA.    But that is all in the past. What we are talking about is today. And  what they did was shut down the people who wanted to vote on their  option, on our option, and on two other options in this, the most  transparent House that would take issues one by one and would face the  tough issues head-on. While people are twisting in the wind and while  children are being separated from their parents, ripped from the arms  of their moms and their dads, we fiddle while Rome is burning, and we  talk about shutting down government.   Their party shut down government a number of times since I have been  here. They did it intentionally. And, very frankly, their Speaker and  the head of the OMB voted ``no'' and to shut it down; they voted not to  open it up.   That is not the issue, Mr. Speaker. The issue is: What are we going  to do to solve a problem the President of the United States said we  ought to solve?   Now, the President of the United States, of course, this morning,  says: No, forget it. Go deal with it.   His tweet at 7:06 a.m. this morning: ``Republicans should stop  wasting their time on immigration until after we elect more Senators  and Congressmen/women in November''--in other words, until we take  over.   This President who said: Well, you know, I met with Kim Jong-un. He  is loved by his people. And, boy, when he says stand up, his people  stand up.   Perhaps, that is what he wants us to do, Mr. Speaker, but we are not  North Korea. We are a democracy, and, very frankly, they don't have the  courage, Mr. Speaker, to bring bills to the floor and allow this House  to work its will. What they do is they negotiate with themselves and  bring bills to the floor, neither of which would have passed yesterday.   After all of their compromise, after all of their talk, and after all  of their commitments to solve the problem, neither one of their bills  would have passed yesterday. They have 240-plus Members. They don't  need us, but they took the bill off the floor because they couldn't get  their own party to come to agreement.   So, Mr. Speaker, my question is, and I will reiterate my question:  What changes are going to be effected in the bill that would have been  considered yesterday, had it not been pulled from the floor, that we  will have to consider next week?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.  [[Page H5575]]         Certainly.    Mr. Speaker, he didn't answer the question, of course. He  hardly ever does.   400,000 more jobs created in 2016 than 2017. He doesn't say that.  They inherited a growing economy. We inherited, when President Obama  took office, a receding economy, hemorrhaging 787,000 jobs in January  of 2009. He doesn't talk about that. That was after the two tax cuts  that they passed in 2001 and 2003 that they said would create the  greatest economy we have ever seen. It didn't. He didn't say that.   Mr. Speaker, he didn't say that the only time we balanced the budget  for 4 years was under President Clinton, and we created jobs and had  the best economy he has experienced and I have experienced. He didn't  say that.   And, Mr. Speaker, what he didn't say is why we are not bringing to  this floor four pieces of legislation, giving everybody on the floor  the opportunity to express their opinion and say to the American people  how they think we can address, yes, border security, which we want to  address.   But what the President asked us to do and the Speaker said he would  do, and the Speaker has not done, and that is to address in a rational  way, in a way that can get the majority of votes--the two bills they  brought to the floor, they knew they couldn't get the votes.   The farm bill that he just talked about that is going to the Senate,  it is dead on arrival. He knows it, Mr. Speaker. The 69 times they  tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act, wasted time. He knows it.   And he mentions, by the way, how bipartisan this Congress is. Let me  tell you why it is bipartisan: we don't control it, but we cooperate  when we can. When we were in charge, it wasn't nearly as bipartisan,  because the Republicans did not cooperate when they could.   And, Mr. Speaker, he talks about fiscal bills. Ninety percent of the  fiscal bills could not have passed this House, kept the government  open, opened the government up, give relief to those who were suffering  from natural disasters without substantial Democratic help, and in many  instances with the majority of Democrats and the minority of  Republicans.   But the answer I looked for, Mr. Speaker, what are we going to  consider next week in terms of an issue that the Speaker said some 8  months ago we were going to solve and promised us in February 2018 he  was going to address to solve DACA? And now we have this crisis in the  country created by the President of the United States with children  being wrenched from the arms of their moms and dads. That is what we  ought to be discussing.   The majority leader is a good friend of the President's. I understand  that. All the President has to do is pick up the phone and call and say  to the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Department of Homeland  Security: stop wrenching those children from the hands of their  parents.   We don't need legislation, but now we have legislation. And I would  ask him if he would bring the Nadler bill to the floor, which will  prevent children from being wrenched from the hands of their families  simply because they have committed a misdemeanor of wanting to seek  opportunity in the land of opportunity that we call America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend for his response, but we need to  know what is going to be considered next week.  [[Page H5576]]  Apparently, they haven't decided. So the majority leader says they will  let us know as soon as they have decided what they are going to do--who  they have to deal with to cobble the votes together on their side of  the aisle. We have 240-plus votes for an option, but they are being  muzzled. They are being prevented to express the will of this House.   Mr. Speaker, I ask the majority leader, does he believe that my  representation that Hurd-Aguilar has 240 votes on this floor  inaccurate?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, we will close now.   Neither of the questions that I posed were answered. And certainly  the fact that there are 240 votes on this floor was not disputed, by  the majority leader, for the Hurd-Aguilar, which addresses security at  the border. By the way, cosponsored by Mr. Hurd, a Member of the  majority leader's party. A Member from Texas who knows about the border  and who, I presume, wants to keep it secure. The bill he has  cosponsored has at least 240 votes on this floor.   This is the most closed Congress in which I have served, the most  closed rules. That is a fact. And apparently it is closed to the  majority, who want to move ahead on a bill and just have the  opportunity to vote on it and to give the Speaker the opportunity to  put something on the floor and have the House consider it, and have Ms.  Roybal-Allard and Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, Republican from Florida, have a  bill on the floor and have it considered, and have Mr. Goodlatte, who  did, in fact, have his bill on the floor, and it lost.   So, Mr. Speaker, I regret that I don't know what there is going to be  next week, because we need to take action. And we need to take action  not by compromising with one side of the aisle and seeing only  capitulation by some. We do need compromise, we do need action, and we  need action that can pass the Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
