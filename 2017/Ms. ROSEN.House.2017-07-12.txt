 Mr. Speaker, if today's vote on the previous question  fails, instead of voting on a partisan bill that rolls back key  environmental laws, overturns State law, and ignores real solutions to  our water supply shortages in the West, we will have the opportunity to  vote on my bill, H.R. 1868, the Restoring American Privacy Act of 2017.   This bipartisan legislation will reverse the President's decision to  assign a disastrous resolution allowing internet providers to sell  their customers' personal information without their acknowledge or  without their consent.   As a former computer programmer and someone who has firsthand  experience writing code, I can tell you that the first step towards  protecting vulnerable and sensitive data is to make sure it remains  private.   S.J. Res. 34, which now, unfortunately, is the law, prevents vital  online protections for millions of Americans nationwide from taking  effect later this year. The resolution, signed by the President,  negating FCC broadband consumer privacy rules is not only wrong and a  blatant violation of privacy, but it jeopardizes Americans' personal  data and puts them at risk of hacking.   The October 2016 rule was the only rule that required internet  service providers to obtain consumers' permission before selling their  private internet browsing history and other sensitive information,  including geolocation and amp usage.   I am simply shocked that most of my colleagues across the aisle voted  for a  [[Page H5451]]  measure that violates Americans' privacy by selling our most intimate  and personal information, all without our consent.   Repealing the FCC rule with S.J. Res. 34 now allows broadband  providers to turn private personal information over to the highest  bidder--or anybody they want, including the government--without a  warrant and without ever telling you.   That is right. Without this rule that President Trump and most  Republicans in Congress blocked, internet service providers don't need  to ask for permission to collect and share sensitive personal  information. Even worse, the passage of this resolution also told  providers they no longer have to use reasonable measures to protect  consumers' personal data.   This is absolutely unacceptable. We are living in a time where  identity theft and internet hacking have become the new norm. Shortly  after President Trump and Republicans repealed these consumer  protections, we experienced a massive ransomware attack that caused  major damage to businesses and companies around the world. No American  wants their most personal information to be up for grabs.   By using the Congressional Review Act to eliminate this rule, the FCC  is now prevented from publishing rules that are substantially the same  absent additional legislation, establishing a dangerous precedent for  private citizens.   Americans should have the right to decide how their internet  providers use their personal information, especially since many people  can't choose their own broadband provider.   What my bill does, Mr. Speaker, is simple. H.R. 1868 makes it clear  that the American people's browsing histories are not for sale; the  American people's personal information is not for sale; the American  people's financial information is not for sale; and the American  people's location data is not for sale.   It is a very simple concept, one that I hope my colleagues across the  aisle will recognize and support. The American people don't want the  legislation that was signed into law this last spring. In overwhelming  numbers, they are calling Congress and letting it be known they want to  keep their private information private.   I am proud to stand up for the American people, and I hope you take  up the Restoring American Privacy Act of 2017 for consideration. This  is commonsense, bipartisan legislation that will reverse a misguided  resolution by saying, once and for all, that ISPs cannot sell  customers' personal information without their knowledge and without  their permission. This bill says that your privacy is not for sale,  period.                                time  1315
