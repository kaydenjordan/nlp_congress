 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a Representative from  Minnesota's Fourth Congressional District in support of my colleague,  Representative Ilhan Omar, of Minnesota's Fifth Congressional District.  Together, we are the Twin Cities.   Representative Omar, alongside of our colleagues, Representatives  Schiff and Swalwell, have been unfairly targeted for removal from  committees, despite their valuable experience, their expertise, and  their perspectives.   The American people elected us to solve problems, to strengthen  Social Security and Medicare, and lower everyday costs. But, instead,  there is prioritizing of issues that the Republicans are engaged in as  a political stunt--no better than their extreme MAGA members who  traffic in hate and violent threats.   My fellow Minnesotans and I see this for what it is: a petty vendetta  that not only undermines our democracy, but it puts the safety of those  Members at risk. Minnesotans and all Americans deserve better.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support Representative Omar  and vote ``no'' on H. Res. 76.                            ____________________
