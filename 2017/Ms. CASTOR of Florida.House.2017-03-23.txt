 Mr. Speaker, I am compelled to come to the  floor this morning to urge my Republican colleagues to stop hiding the  TrumpCare bill. The American people and their Representatives deserve  to know what is in the bill.   But here is what we know so far. It rips coverage away from millions  of our neighbors back home. It is a massive tax or cost increase for  people's insurance, whether you have it through healthcare.gov or  through your private employer. It imposes a significant age tax on our  older neighbors back home. It cuts Medicare and shortens the life of  the Medicare trust fund. It breaks the fundamental guarantee we have  with our neighbors back home who are Alzheimer's patients, children  with complex conditions, the disabled, under Medicaid, all to give a  massive tax break to the wealthiest people in America.    That is a failure in vision and a failure in values, and this bill  should be hidden forever.
