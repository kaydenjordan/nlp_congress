 Mr. Speaker, this is an important bill for reservists and  National Guardsmen who protect our country in times of war. We are in  the longest war of our Nation's history.   The bankruptcy bill of 2005 was a bad bill that made it more  difficult for people to claim bankruptcy; hurt guardsmen and reservists  whose bases are oftentimes surrounded by payday lenders, and they  become subject to large loans in difficult times while in service,  having to even file bankruptcy, let alone, respond to debts that they  incur on behalf of the American people.   But I want to thank Mr. Cline, a great American, and supporter of  reservists and people serving our country, our National Guard and  reservists. For being a cosponsor, Representative Madeleine Dean of  Pennsylvania, and Tim Burchett, an outstanding Tennessean and a  volunteer for joining me in reintroducing this bill.   I would like to thank all the National Guard and reservists who  protect us, both here and abroad.   I ask for unanimous passage.
