 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition of what I call  the Inflation ``Production'' Act.   There are obvious problems of increasing taxes in a recession,  expanding Obamacare, innovation killing price controls on drugs, and  its attacks on American energy.   Hard working families, farmers, and small business owners in central  Arkansas are going to bear the brunt of citizens being audited at the  highest rates due to more than doubling the size of the IRS and it's  increase in funding.   What do we think the IRS is going to do with this increase in staff  and $45 billion in new enforcement funding?   No agency needs six times its current funding to answer phone calls  and improve customer service.   I have seen claims that as long as you don't cheat on your taxes then  you have nothing to worry about.   Clearly, they have never faced the harassment and excruciating  process of an IRS audit.   We must defeat this legislation.
