 Madam Speaker, I am hearing from Minnesotans who want  their leaders to reach across the aisle and pursue common ground.   From fighting inflation to fighting crime, I work to build consensus  on our biggest challenges as vice chair of the bipartisan Problem  Solvers Caucus, and I am proud of everything that we have accomplished  so far.   There is hard work ahead, but Minnesotans know that we are stronger  when everyone is at the table, and that is why I created Common Ground  Workshops and why I will continue to pursue commonsense solutions.                            ____________________
