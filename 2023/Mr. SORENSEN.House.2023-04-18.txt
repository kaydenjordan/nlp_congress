 Mr. Speaker, every day I hear from parents who worry  about their children's safety in school, from bullying to gun violence.  Yet, instead of addressing the issues that are relevant today, we are  debating a bill that takes away certain kids' ability to learn, like  how to be a part of a team, how to build friendships, how to set goals,  and how to work with one another. Every child in America should learn  this.   It is hard to be a kid today. It is hard to go to school. It is hard  to make friends. It is hard to fit in. We need to give kids the  opportunity to be healthy and happy and to have joy.   This isn't about protecting sports. This is about every child setting  their own goals, being a part of their team and overcoming challenges,  and being, finally, proud of who they are and what they can achieve.    Mr. Speaker, stop the nonsense. Let's get back to work  and solve the real problems, which is what the people back home sent us  here to do.
