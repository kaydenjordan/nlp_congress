 Mr. President, in the last week, new details have come  to light regarding Twitter's top executives' past collusion with  political figures to censor speech that they did not want the American  people to see. This problem is not limited to Twitter, but this news  underscores the problem and the need for congressional action to  protect the rights of the American people. Americans deserve to know  when their government and Big Tech platforms are trying to manipulate  what they can say or what they can read.   Recently published emails among Twitter executives reveal the extent  to which the company worked to prevent Americans from seeing a New York  Post story, and this was just weeks before the election. The extent of  the suppression was breathtaking. Indeed, the Twitter executives locked  the Twitter account of the White House Press Secretary who simply  mentioned a story that was published in an established American  newspaper with one of the largest circulations in the country. Facebook  admits that it likewise limited the spread of this story based on a  general warning from the FBI about ``propaganda.''   Evidence has also emerged that in 2020, Biden and Democrat campaign  officials were going so far as to send lists of tweets for their  corporate allies to remove--requests that Twitter granted.   This censorship activity has carried over into the Biden  administration. In 2021, then-Press Secretary Jen Psaki stated that the  government is ``in regular touch with social media platforms'' and  ``flagging problematic posts for Facebook that spread [what she called]  `disinformation'.''   For example, a Facebook official emailed Surgeon General Vivek Murthy  stating:         I know our teams met today to better understand the scope       of what the White House expects from us on ``misinformation''       going forward.    A Facebook employee later told the HHS Department that a number of  posts had been deleted.   In addition to regularly flagging posts for Twitter and Facebook to  take down, the CDC proposed setting up a monthly ``misinformation  meeting'' with Facebook in order to censor American speech.   Additional Freedom of Information Act requests and lawsuits have also  revealed improper coordination between  [[Page S7048]]  government Agencies and social media companies to restrict speech here  in America.   Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, disclosed that it  had communicated with more than 30 Federal officials about content  moderation on its platform, including senior employees at the FDA, U.S.  Election Assistance Commission, and the White House. YouTube, which is  owned by Google, disclosed that it had such communications with 11  Federal officials.   The disturbing truth is that when the Biden administration officials  don't like what Americans are saying, they simply reach out to their  allies at unaccountable big tech companies to silence it.   Government using its power to coerce censorship of disfavored  information is what the Chinese Communist Party or what the North  Korean regime might do. It is not only fundamentally un-American, but  often, it is unconstitutional. Government cannot use Big Tech as a tool  to end-run the First Amendment.   The American people deserve to know when their government, which is  supposed to work for them, is using Big Tech to censor their speech or  manipulate the information they see. I introduced legislation in July  of 2021 to require this transparency. Yet the Senate has failed to act  on it.   The Disclose Government Censorship Act would require that government  officials publicly disclose communications with Big Tech regarding  their actions to restrict speech--actions that would plainly violate  the First Amendment if the government did it itself. The act contains  appropriate exceptions to protect legitimate law enforcement or  national security activity.   It would also require a cooling-off period to address the revolving  door that occurs between government and Big Tech. This Washington  revolving door fuels politically driven censorship, as evidenced by the  fact that the former FBI general counsel who resigned because of the  Steele dossier scandal was then hired by Twitter and, unbelievably, was  at the center of the decision to suppress the New York Post story in  2020.   Our Nation was founded on the ideal that protecting citizens' speech  from government censorship--under the First Amendment--would protect  the people's right to govern themselves by preventing the government  from controlling information and ideas. Americans deserve to know when  their government is covertly trying to accomplish what the First  Amendment prohibits.   Now, as in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs be discharged  from further consideration of S. 2527 and that the Senate proceed to  its immediate consideration. I further ask that the bill be considered  read a third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, my Democratic colleague is objecting to  legislation that simply allows Americans to see when the government is  trying to censor them.   My colleague states that his objection is largely on procedural  grounds, and he has concerns that my bill hasn't been marked up in  committee, but the committee to which this bill was referred has had  over a year to review the legislation, and no progress has been made.   I would ask that my colleague commit to working with me on my  legislation to address this important First Amendment issue in the next  Congress. This problem is simply too significant to ignore. Our  government works for the American people. To ensure this continues, the  First Amendment prohibits the government from controlling what  Americans say or read. But now government is using Big Tech to  accomplish that censorship. Without disclosure of such communications,  Americans' free speech rights become a dead letter because there is no  way to address improper government efforts to ban speech.   My legislation would preserve these rights by allowing Americans to  see when government is trying to silence them. This is a basic element  of self-government.   I yield the floor.
