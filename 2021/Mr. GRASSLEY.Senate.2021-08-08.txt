 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I come to the floor to ask unanimous  consent on two pieces of legislation.   The first one is a bipartisan amendment that I have with Senator  Klobuchar. It has been cleared on both sides of the aisle. It does not  cost anything. It is noncontroversial, and I am not aware of any  opposition or controversy about it.   I filed this amendment as soon as we were on the bill and have been  asking for a vote ever since. I am happy to accept a voice vote. I do  not understand why that is not possible.   This amendment is entitled ``Assisting Broadband Connectivity Act''  that Senator Klobuchar and I introduced last month. This amendment will  make changes to the rural broadband program at USDA so that areas  aren't automatically ineligible for Federal funding because a project  previously received State funding. In other words, if a project got  State money, now they can't qualify for Federal money. This change will  ease the administrative burden for those applying to provide broadband  in rural America. However, this won't change the requirements for Rural  Utilities Service when they administer these programs, such as  overbuild and coordination with other broadband entities.   This bill also provides more flexibility with funding and resources  by allowing States to use funds received from the Federal Government,  such as COVID State funding, to be used for the matching fund provision  that is required for most applications. This update will help rural  America move forward by providing more coordination and funding  availability for broadband projects. This is not unusual for the Rural  Utilities Service. They currently allow CDBG and State revolving loan  funds for water and wastewater to be used for matching purposes.   This amendment will help our States and providers connect all the  pieces from both the State and Federal level to help get some of these  expensive and urgent rural broadband projects completed.   This amendment has been cleared by the Senate Agriculture Committee.  There is no reason it should not get a vote. I am not aware of any  opposition.   The second amendment is also--the second bill is also a bipartisan  bill by Grassley and Leahy. My amendment provides anti-fraud provisions  to the infrastructure package.   This amendment combines two of my bills, the False Claims Amendments  Act and the Administrative False Claims Act, both of which are  bipartisan and have garnered support from both the good-government and  inspectors general communities.   By the way, this amendment is scored by CBO to bring in more than  $100 million, and it seems to me that is a pretty significant amount of  money, particularly when the infrastructure bill was scored by CBO to  add $256 billion to the debt.   This amendment provides long needed improvements to combat fraud  perpetrated against the Federal Government. I would like to thank my  bipartisan group of friends who have supported this bill and this  amendment with their cosponsorship.   Now, just to make clear, the only business interests that have  anything to worry about--and I am emphasizing this because since this  amendment was offered, you would be surprised, all the business  interests that have come out in opposition to this provision. So the  only thing these business interests have to have anything to worry  about with this anti-fraud amendment are the same ones that are already  found in a court of law to have defrauded the taxpayers.   Since I got the False Claims Act passed in 1986, it has brought in  more than $65 billion of fraudulently taken tax dollars.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record the letters of support   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                      July 22, 2021.      Re Administrative False Claims Act of 2021.         Dear Senator Grassley: The undersigned members of the Make       It Safe Coalition (MISC) write to applaud introduction of the       Administrative False Claims Act of 2021 (AFCA). The False       Claims Act is America's most effective anti-corruption law,       but as a practical matter it only has been relevant for the       most outlandish cases of fraud in government contracts. The       AFCA bill would expand the scope of accountability to the       full scope of corruption.        The False Claims Act is a highly effective and       indispensable tool for combatting high dollar fraud against       the government. In 1986, Congress passed a ``mini-False       Claims Act'' called the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act       (PFCRA) to provide civil remedies for false claims of       $150,000 or less. However, it has been underutilized and       ineffective. The AFCA allows the Attorney General to delegate       review authority, which will help with the backlog of PFCRA       cases and enable the Department of Justice to take swifter       action. Furthermore, the bill allows agencies and inspectors       general to recoup the costs of investigating and prosecuting       false claims and statements by utilizing the funds recovered       from AFCA actions. Finally, increasing the payments ceiling       of the PFCRA in the Administrative False Claims Act to $1       million will allow more false claims to be actionable.        The AFCA consists entirely of noncontroversial provisions       reflecting best practices that will be applied where they are       needed to fix the blockades that have sedated the PFCRA. The       undersigned organizations urge all Members of Congress to       support this amendment.            Sincerely,      Empower Oversight.      Government Accountability Project.      National Security Counselors.      National Whistleblower Center.      Project On Government Oversight.      Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility.      Whistleblowers of America.                                   ____         Dear Chairman Durbin and Senator Grassley: Taxpayers       Against Fraud, National Whistleblower Center, Project On       Government Oversight and Government Accountability Project       write you in support of your legislation to strengthen the       False Claims Act, the government's primary fraud-fighting       law. Our organizations have been advocating for       whistleblowers and fraud-fighting for decades and view this       legislation as critical to the continued success of False       Claims Act enforcement and the public-private partnership.        The Department of Justice has stated that since the Act was       revitalized in 1986 over $64 billion have been recovered,       with nearly 80% of the recoveries coming from whistle blower       initiated actions. Our experience shows that the indirect       benefit of the FCA could be worth an additional trillion       dollars in deterrence. As Congress and the Biden       Administration are considering ways to move our country       forward post-pandemic, we need to stand guard against those       who seek to pilfer government programs.        By any measurement, the FCA has been a remarkable success,       we believe that legislative changes you have put forward will       strengthen the Act against modern fraud schemes. We are       confident that the legislation you have introduced will       encourage more whistleblowers to come forward to assist the       government and result in the recovery of billions of       additional stolen government dollars.        We particularly encourage you to focus on the following       provisions which would most significantly benefit       whistleblowers and the continued enforcement of the FCA:        (1.) Clarify the materiality standard. The current FCA       ``materiality'' standard is easy to understand-liability only       results from ``material'' violations. The FCA explicitly       defines ``material'' to mean ``a natural tendency to       influence, or be capable of influencing, the payment or       receipt of money or property'' by the United States. Congress       added this statutory definition in 2009 to clarify that       liability attaches when the government could have rejected       the fraudsters' claims for payment.        Nonetheless, this clear-cut standard was arguably       undermined in a 2016 Supreme Court decision, Universal Health       Services, Inc. v. United States ex rel. Escobar, 136 S. Ct.       1989 (2016). In this case, the Supreme Court provided       numerous factors that a court could consider for when       determining whether fraud was ``material'' to the       government's decision to pay a claim. On one such factor, the       Court wrote: ``[I]f the Government pays a particular claim in       full despite its actual knowledge that certain requirements       were violated, that is very strong evidence that those       requirements are not material.''        Although the government's prior knowledge was described as       merely being ``strong evidence'' that a false claim was not       material, some courts and many companies have made the       government knowledge factor dispositive, stating that there       must be proof that the government actually refused to pay the       claim. This logic leaves no room for the government to pay a       claim in an emergency situation and later bring an FCA case.  [[Page S6052]]         For instance, the government might make the decision to       continue paying Medicare payments to a dishonest hospital       that is the only available healthcare facility for a rural       population. Under the wayward reading of the Supreme Court's       Escobar decision, such corrupt entities could use the       government's payment decision to shield itself from FCA       enforcement and drain government funds with impunity.        The proposed FCA amendments restore the Act by granting a       heightened presumption of materiality to all instances when       the government could have demanded repayment or payment from       the defendant. The defendant can then only overcome this       highly deferential presumption by meeting a strict ``clear       and convincing evidence'' standard.        If a company accused of defrauding the government actually       admits to submitting false claims, but then argues that the       false information is not material, it is only fair for that       company to be required to prove that false information has no       tendency to impact the government's payment decision. This       high burden correctly rests with the defendant.        (2.) Clarify when the government may dismiss whistleblower       cases. The FCA permits the government to dismiss       whistleblower, or so-called ``qui tam,'' actions if the       whistleblower ``has been notified by the Government of the       filing of the motion and the court has provided the person       with an opportunity for a hearing on the motion.'' 31 USC       3730(c)(2)(A).        Recognizing that whistleblower-initiated actions have       recovered the bulk of FCA recoveries over the last I 00       years, the government has been reluctant to dismiss these       actions. In fact, prior to 2018, the government had dismissed       less than 50 cases in the 155-year history of the Act.        Then, in January 2018, the Justice Department released the       so-called ``Granston Memo,'' which outlined the Department's       focus on dismissing whistleblower-initiated FCA actions.       Since then, over 50 whistleblower actions have been silenced       through arbitrary dismissals, in less than four years. When       challenged, the Justice Department has argued that it has       ``unfettered discretion'' to dismiss these cases,       notwithstanding the statutory requirement that the court       provide the whistleblower with a ``hearing.''        By dismissing whistleblowers and their fraud concerns       without any oversight, the Justice Department is discouraging       individuals from even stepping forward. The Amendments       provide a level of assurances for would-be whistleblowers,       clarifying when a whistleblower-initiated action may be       dismissed by the court.        With our country spending trillions of dollars in pandemic       spending and infrastructure improvements, now is not the time       to silence whistleblowers with backroom dismissals. We       applaud these leading anti-fraud Senators for providing a       level of certainty and protection to America's courageous       whistleblowers.        (3.) Clarify that the FCA provides anti-retaliation       protection to former employees. The current FCA is arguably       silent on whether individuals receive protection from       employers who blackball or otherwise retaliate post-      employment. The proposed amendment removes any uncertainty by       explicitly extending the protections found in 31 USC 3730(h).        For too long, whistleblowers have faced retaliation from       former employers. The amendments put the world on notice that       blackballing whistleblowers will no longer be tolerated. We       applaud your long-standing commitment to protecting       whistleblowers.        On behalf of whistleblowers, we thank you both for your       leadership on anti-fraud initiatives and championing these       much-needed improvements to the FCA. These amendments would       not only encourage more whistleblowers to step forward, but       they will deter future fraudsters from targeting vulnerable       government programs.        Please feel free to contact us with any questions or       comments. We would be eager to meet and further discuss how       your efforts will improve anti-fraud efforts. Please contact       Jeb White to schedule a meeting.        Sincerely,      Taxpayers Against Fraud      National Whistleblower Center      Project On Government Oversight Government Accountability       Project.     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  following amendments be called up to the substitute and reported by  number: Grassley 2435, that is Grassley-Leahy; and Grassley 2500,  Grassley-Klobuchar. So I want to emphasize, both of these are  bipartisan pieces of legislation.    I will accept that modification, but I want to add, in  fact, I think every Senator ought to get a vote. We have wasted all day  Thursday, Saturday, and now through Sunday. That is enough time to vote  on a multitude of amendments, and we just sat around those 3 days  accomplishing nothing.
