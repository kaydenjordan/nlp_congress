 Madam Speaker, one of the most sacred American  values is the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   The right to life is not to be forsaken, and today we see Democrats  reject the science of life and the fact that life begins at conception.   One of the longstanding acts of bipartisanship is the Hyde amendment,  with one of its most vocal supporters being then-Senator Joe Biden.  Since first enacted in 1976, it has saved over 2.4 million innocent  lives.   Americans who hold their pro-life convictions should not be forced to  front the bill for abortion services and violate their belief that life  is worthy of protecting.   President Biden's recent budget proposal excludes this lifesaving  amendment after 40 years of being included. This should not be  controversial.  [[Page H3017]]    I will continue to fight to uphold the Hyde amendment and make sure  not one dollar of taxpayer dollars goes to destroy the life of an  unborn child. These children are the future of our country.   Life is too sacred, and we must respect the millions of Americans who  believe everyone has a right to life.   In God we trust.                            ____________________
