 Mr. Speaker, I rise this afternoon really with a very,  very sad and heavy heart. I don't know anyone in our country who  watched what took place across the country who wasn't dismayed, who  wasn't heartbroken, who wasn't confused. And as my constituents said:  What is happening in our country?   Now, there are some that say this must be done. This executive order  must be done in the name of national security.   I am a veteran of the House Intelligence Committee, but it doesn't  take a veteran of the House Intelligence Committee to understand that  this harms our national security.   We need to have more voices in the House. We need Republicans and  Democrats standing up together, because historians will replace your  surname, and those that don't raise their voices will be called coward  because this is ripping at the fabric and the soul of our Nation. It is  appalling. It is unlawful. I believe it is unconstitutional.   If you stood up for history and what was done to others, it is taking  place right now in our country.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 724,  which would rescind the President's ban for the sake of our national  security.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair understands the gentleman from  Washington has not yielded for that purpose. Therefore, the unanimous  consent request cannot be entertained.
