 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on  Rules, I call up House Resolution 756 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 756         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 4394) making appropriations for energy and       water development and related agencies for the fiscal year       ending September 30, 2024, and for other purposes. The first       reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of       order against consideration of the bill are waived.

Sec. 6.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 4364) making       appropriations for the Legislative Branch for the fiscal year       ending September 30, 2024, and for other purposes. All points       of order against consideration of the bill are waived. The       amendment printed in part C of the report of the Committee on       Rules accompanying this resolution shall be considered as       adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read.       All points of order against provisions in the bill, as       amended, are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Appropriations or their respective       designees; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 7.  House Resolution 699 is laid on the table.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I  yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania  (Ms. Scanlon), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and  in support of the underlying legislation.   House Resolution 756 provides for consideration of H.R. 4394, the  Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of  2024, under a structured rule, with 1 hour of debate equally divided  and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the  Committee on Appropriations or their respective designees and provides  one motion to recommit.   The rule makes in order 60 amendments. Further, the rule provides for  consideration of H.R. 4364, the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act,  2024, under a closed rule, with 1 hour of debate equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  Appropriations or their respective designees and provides for one  motion to recommit.   Madam Speaker, since President Biden took office, gas prices are up  60 percent; natural gas prices are up 25 percent; coal prices are up 70  percent; and electricity prices are up 24 percent.   This should raise alarms on the other side of the aisle. I don't mean  pulling fire alarms. This should get the attention of the other side.   H.R. 4364 restores American energy dominance. It invests in our  national security and delivers fiscal responsibility for the American  taxpayer.   As a Navy veteran, I am proud to support H.R. 4394, which provides  $32.51 billion in Defense spending. That is an increase of more than $1  billion over FY23 enacted levels.   This legislation continues efforts to modernize the Nation's nuclear  weapon stockpile, supports Columbia-class submarine reactor development  and helps counter our adversaries.   Additionally, H.R. 4394 prioritizes energy security and economic  competitiveness by investing $200 million in critical mineral  production and supporting domestic uranium enrichment capabilities.   Finally, this legislation rescinds $5.58 billion of absolutely  reckless spending that was wasted by the previous majority. It  terminates Biden's waters of the United States rule and it cuts the  dangerous, radical, and extreme Green New Deal programs.   Madam Speaker, additionally, H.R. 4364 ensures that Members of  Congress can address the needs of their constituents while prioritizing  deficit reduction.   H.R. 4364 reduces spending by 4.5 percent, provides Capitol police  officers with an increase of $46 million over last year, and protects  House networks by banning the purchase of telecommunications equipment  made in China.   As we work to pass single-subject appropriations bills, I am proud to  support the underlying legislation which upholds the House Republicans'  commitment to the American people.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I have to share a story about Secretary Granholm because you just  can't make up this stuff. NPR reported this story, which makes it even  more rich.   Secretary Granholm took a 4-day EV propaganda road trip on the  taxpayers' dime that turned into an absolute nightmare for the  Secretary. At a stop in Georgia, there was only one available EV  charging station for the Secretary's motorcade. What did she do? Well,  they had the Department of Energy advance team--who were traveling in  gas-powered vehicles, I might  [[Page H4965]]  add--they had that advance team go in and reserve a spot while others  waited in long lines, battling the summer heat.   Rightfully, a family that was traveling with a baby actually called  the police on Secretary Granholm and her advance team.   Earlier this year, Granholm stated, ``We can all learn from what  China is doing,'' regarding climate policies. Let's just talk about  what China is doing because that is about as laughable as the story  about her failed propaganda trip.   China emits 30 percent of the world's global emissions. They emit  more than the developed world combined. They emit more than the United  States, the EU, and Japan combined. By far, they are the largest  polluter in the world.   My friends across the aisle will say nothing to criticize China, by  the way.   China's coal-fired power plants generate more than 23 percent of all  forms of U.S. energy combined, and they are allowed to increase their  emissions through 2030 under the laughable Paris climate accord. We  could all laugh at this if it wasn't for the devastating effects that  Democrats' climate policy has on the working class in America and for  our competitive edge on our number one adversary on the world stage,  and that is China.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me be clear about something. You can't be anti-China and pro-EV.  You can't be anti-China and pro-Green New Deal. These things are  completely incompatible.   Let me explain. Throughout the Biden Presidency, his administration  has been dead set on advancing the foolish, reckless, and extreme Green  New Deal agenda. This path forward has propped up our adversaries such  as China, which we now rely on for critical minerals to build the  expensive EVs that liberals like to parade around in in their affluent  suburban neighborhoods. Biden's officials openly acknowledge that fact.   During an Appropriations subcommittee hearing earlier this year, the  Interior Secretary admitted that the Biden administration's Green New  Deal policies actually make our Nation more reliant on China. She  admitted it at the hearing.   Do you know what? She is right.   China accounts for 63 percent of the world's rare earth mining, 85  percent of rare earth processing, and 92 percent of rare earth magnet  production. This plays a massive role in producing 70 percent of the  global EV battery supply.   While Democrats cheer on these foreign green efforts, China is busy  emitting more greenhouse gas than the U.S. and all other developed  nations combined.   It has never been more clear. When President Biden and Democrats push  for their green agenda, what they are really doing is empowering the  Chinese Communist Party, and they are doing it at the expense of the  American worker.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   It is quite the intellectual yoga exercise to somehow say that  Republicans are encouraging Russian gas. It is the exact opposite.   Let's think about it. Do you know why there are Russian oil tankers  in the harbor in Boston? It is because far-left radical activists,  namely the entire Democratic Party, have decided to cancel a pipeline  that should have been running from Philadelphia into New England called  the Constitution Pipeline that would have brought clean natural gas  from Pennsylvania into New England so the residents there have cheap,  abundant natural gas and are not forced to buy dirty petroleum from  Russian.   Again, the intellectual gymnastics and yoga are quite amazing.   Let's talk about some other far-left, radical policies of my friends  across the aisle and how it has made us more dependent on Russia and  more dependent on China.   For one, they have a new list of regulations on coal-fired power  plants, making it harder for us to burn our clean coal here in the  United States and forcing coal producers to ship coal to places like  China, where they don't use scrubbers, by the way. Liberals across the  aisle ended the Keystone XL pipeline, coincidentally killing tens of  thousands of union jobs that they purport to support. They also  canceled Federal oil and gas leasing on Federal land.   I ask you, which policies make us more dependent on Russia, ours or  the radical left's?   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Langworthy), my good friend and fellow member of the  Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Talking more about the Democratic fascination with helping China,  let's go back to 2022. In 2022, gas prices hit an all-time record high.  Instead of reversing the failed policies of the Biden administration  that actually led to gas prices increasing at that rate, instead of  doing that, Biden sold 180 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum  Reserve to temporarily lower gas prices in a cheap political gimmick.   What did this do? This drained our emergency energy supply to its  lowest level since the 1980s, the lowest level since I was born.   Who benefited the most from this? Well, it wasn't the American  worker. It was China. According to the Department of Energy, China's  state refining company bought 2 million barrels of Strategic Petroleum  Reserve oil in 2022.   Instead of powering China's economy, House Republicans are passing  legislation this week that actually lowers energy costs, that ends  radical Green New Deal programs, and restores our energy independence.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield  myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, it is clear, President Biden's energy policies benefit  our foreign adversaries, not the American worker.   The Biden administration has made our vehicle market heavily  dependent on communist China. The administration has also cut deals  with Iran. I might remind everybody that Iran is a state sponsor of  terror. In fact, the Biden administration released $6 billion in oil  revenue that will fund terrorist operations against the United States  and our number one ally in the Middle East, Israel.   Recently, the President drained our strategic oil reserve to the  lowest levels. To what end? To fuel China's economy.   Earlier this year, FERC Commissioner Mark Christie predicted in a  Senate hearing that our energy grid is: ``. . . heading for a very  catastrophic situation. . . . ''   Why is this? It is because of the far left's rush to foolish green  policies. This is the wrong path to go down.   This is why I am proud to support the underlying legislation which  restores the Strategic Petroleum Reserves. It also helps our national  security mission, increases funding for our ports and inland waterways,  like the locks and dams that run through my district, and it invests in  our Nation's security.   After the previous majority spent $3 trillion outside of the  appropriations process, this legislation actually reins in billions of  dollars to reduce our out-of-control national debt.   Under House Republicans, we have passed legislation to lower energy  costs for the American family, reformed our permitting process, allowed  the Mountain Valley pipeline to finish construction, and preserved  vehicle choice in the marketplace. This legislation before us keeps up  that commitment to the American people.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the previous  question and ``yes'' on the rule.   The material previously referred to by Ms. Scanlon is as follows:     An Amendment to H. Res. 756 Offered By Ms. Scanlon of Pennsylvania         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 8. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       resolution (H. Res. 178) affirming the House of       Representatives' commitment to protect and strengthen Social       Security and Medicare. The resolution shall be considered as       read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on       the resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening       motion or demand for division of the question except one hour       of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means or       their respective designees.        Sec. 9. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H. Res. 178.     Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.
