 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, since last week, the Senate--ostensibly  one of the great deliberative bodies in the world--supposedly has been  ``debating'' the $740 billion National Defense Authorization Act. It  has been a very, very silent debate because of the 700 amendments that  have been filed to this bill. There have been no rollcall votes on any  of them. I do understand that in the managers' amendment, some of the  noncontroversial, nonsignificant amendments have been accepted and  absorbed, and that is fine. We have had a vigorous debate, but nobody  in the world has heard that debate because there has not been one  amendment here on the floor.   Knowing the way the Senate does business, I worry very much--and I  hope I am wrong, and I will do my best to prevent it, but I worry very  much that we are supposed to be getting out of here for the Fourth of  July break tomorrow night. Right now, it is a little after 2 p.m. on  Wednesday, and we are out of here on Thursday.   Given the fact that we are talking about 53 percent of the  discretionary budget of the U.S.A., I am just a little bit worried  about how many real amendments, significant amendments, are going to be  offered.   Let us be clear that over the last year, we have been part of what I  consider to be the biggest do-nothing Senate in the modern history of  this country. This country faces enormous crises in terms of the  pandemic, faces enormous crises in terms of an economic meltdown,  enormous crises in terms of racial injustice and police brutality,  enormous crises in terms of being the only major country on Earth not  to guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right, and enormous  crises that in Siberia last week, the temperature was 100 degrees,  which is frightening the scientific community because they understand  this is the tip of the iceberg regarding climate change. We have all  these crises out there, and nothing much happens here in the Senate.   Well, I think maybe it might be a good idea to start some real debate  right here. I have introduced six amendments that are significant. I  will discuss each of them. Other Members, Democrats and Republicans,  have also introduced significant amendments.   Given the fact we have done virtually nothing over the last year, I  think it is not inappropriate to have some serious debate on one of the  very major pieces of legislation we will be dealing with.   We are talking about a bill that will spend some $740 billion. That  is more money in terms of military spending than the next 11 nations  combined. Does anybody have a problem with that? Some of us do. Maybe  others don't. Let's debate it.   We are talking about a bill that will be spending more money on the  Pentagon than we did during the height of the Cold War and the height  of the wars in Vietnam and Korea. Does anyone have a problem with that?  Well, I do. Maybe some other people do. Maybe you don't. Tell me why  you think we should be spending more money on the military today in  terms of inflation than we did during the war in Vietnam. Let's debate  it.   We are talking about a bill that will provide 53 percent of the  entire discretionary budget to the bloat and wasteful Pentagon at a  time when the Defense Department cannot even pass an independent audit.  We have a huge budget for the Pentagon. They cannot pass an independent  audit, and the response of the Senate is, well, let's give them even  more money. It may make sense to some people. It doesn't make sense to  me.   In my view, it would be rather disgraceful for us to leave town,  recess the Senate for 2 weeks without getting a vote on a single  amendment and then come back in a couple of weeks to pass a $740  billion Defense bill without any opportunity to amend that bill.   If the horrific pandemic that we are now experiencing, where tens of  thousands of people are coming down with the virus every single day--if  the pandemic has taught us anything, it is that national security, the  well-being of our people, and protecting our people is a lot more than  just building bombs and missiles and jet fighters and tanks and  submarines. Our people are in trouble today in an unprecedented way  with the pandemic and with an economic meltdown in which tens of  millions of people have lost their jobs over the last couple of months.  We have to focus on how we protect those people. It is not just  spending money on planes and guns and bombs.    In order to begin the process of addressing some of the most  important issues facing our country, I have introduced five amendments,  all of which I think are important and all of which I believe need to  have a vote and a debate. Let me very briefly explain what those  amendments are and what they would do.   The first amendment would reduce the military budget by 10 percent  and use that $74 billion in savings to invest in distressed communities  in every State in this country that have been ravaged by extreme  poverty, mass incarceration, deindustrialization, and decades of  neglect.   It is no secret to anybody that the American people are hurting all  across this country. We have communities where unemployment today is  20, 25, 30 percent, where people are sleeping out on the streets, where  schools are underfunded, where decent-quality childcare is virtually  not available, and where air and water pollution is rampant. It is time  that we stop turning our backs on those communities.   What we are doing right now is focusing attention on the fact that 40  million Americans are living in poverty. Half of our people are living  paycheck to paycheck. And maybe--just maybe--instead of investing more  money in nuclear weapons and submarines and God knows what else, maybe  we want to invest in our own people, in jobs and healthcare and  education, so that they can live their lives with dignity and security.   I believe right now, in the midst of all of the crises this country  faces--the crisis of the pandemic, the crisis of the economic meltdown,  the crisis of racial injustice, the crisis of 100 million people being  uninsured or underinsured, the crisis of climate change--I think the  American people want real transformation. They are tired of the status  quo. They want a government that represents all of us, not the 1  percent and wealthy campaign contributors.   I do understand that the people behind this military budget who love  it so much are the military-industrial complex and the defense  contractors. They are doing phenomenally well. It is a great budget for  them. Their CEOs make tens of millions of dollars a year. They make  huge profits every single year. It is a good budget for them. But maybe  we may want to get our priorities right and have a good budget for  working families and low-income families in America. That is what my  amendment does.   This amendment is being cosponsored by Senators Markey and Warren. It  is also being supported by over 60 organizations throughout this  country representing millions and millions of people, including  organizations like Public Citizen, Union of Concerned Scientists,  Physicians for Social Responsibility, and the Coalition on Human Needs.  These organizations are saying that maybe--just maybe--instead of  investing in weapons of destruction, instead  [[Page S4099]]  of spending more money on the military than the next 11 nations  combined, maybe we should invest in our people.   What this amendment would do is provide funding, again, for 1,000  distressed communities, from Vermont to Oklahoma, which would receive  Federal funding to hire more public school teachers, provide nutritious  meals to children and parents, and offer free tuition to public  colleges, universities, or trade schools.   At this pivotal moment in American history, we have to make a  fundamental decision that we want to continue spending billions on  endless wars in the Middle East, on weapons of mass destruction--of  which we have more than enough--or do we provide decent jobs and  education and healthcare for millions of people in our country?   Further, a major reason why there is so much waste, fraud, and abuse  at the Pentagon is, in fact, that the Defense Department remains the  only Federal agency in America that hasn't been able to pass an  independent audit, which deals with the second amendment that I have  introduced.   I don't think it is too much to say that the largest agency of the  Federal Government has to pass an independent audit.   There is nobody in the Senate who does not believe there is massive  waste and fraud at the Pentagon. Defense contractor after defense  contractor has pled guilty to fraud. We have massive cost overruns.    In the second amendment that I am offering, which has been  cosponsored by Senator Grassley, a longtime Republican leader here;  Senator Lee, a Republican from Utah; and Senator Wyden, of Oregon, all  that we are asking is that there be an independent audit of the Defense  Department and that it be completed no later than fiscal year 2025. It  is not a very radical idea.   The third amendment I am offering is one that, I would hope and  expect, would have wide support right here. I think it does have  support among the American people, and it certainly has widespread  support among the medical community and the epidemiologists of this  country.   Just yesterday, I was participating in a hearing of the Committee on  Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. We had the leading experts in  this country, including several representatives of the Trump  administration--Dr. Fauci and others--talking about the pandemic and  what we could do about it. There was widespread consensus. Nobody, I  think, has any doubt anymore, except maybe Donald Trump, that masks are  a very, very important preventive measure. They are not going to solve  all of the problems, but the evidence is overwhelming that the people  who wear masks in public, when they are around other people, are less  likely to transmit the virus or to receive the virus. Nobody doubts  that anymore.   So the question that we have to ask ourselves is this: How does it  happen that, in the wealthiest country in the history of the world and  with the strongest economy in the world, we have doctors and nurses  today who are dealing with people with COVID-19 and don't even have the  personal protective equipment that they need? How in God's name does  that happen?   We are spending 18 percent of our GDP on healthcare--twice as much as  any other country. Yet we cannot provide a $1 mask to a doctor or to a  nurse whose life is at stake. It is not only doctors and nurses.   What a number of countries around the world are doing, which is very  smart, is producing or acquiring large numbers of high-quality masks,  and they are distributing those masks to all of the households in their  countries. We should be making sure that every household in this  country has the masks that each needs. That will save lives. There is  an estimate from the University of Washington that it could save 30,000  lives during this pandemic if 95 percent of the American people were to  wear masks. It would also save us a substantial sum of money because it  is a lot cheaper to invest in masks than in the hospitalizations for  those who have the virus. I should mention that other countries that  are not as wealthy as we are--countries like South Korea, France,  Turkey, Austria, and others--are doing just that.   Again, this is an idea that has won support from not only Dr. Fauci  but from other leading healthcare experts who testified before the  Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions yesterday. That is  the third amendment--making sure that we utilize the Defense Production  Act to produce the masks that our medical professionals and the  American people need. We can save tens of thousands of lives and  hundreds of billions of dollars by doing it.   The fourth amendment I have filed would prohibit funding for military  aid and logistical support for the disastrous, Saudi-led war in Yemen.  I believe it is past time that we put an end to our unconstitutional  and unauthorized participation in this war.   On this issue, I am certainly not alone. A bipartisan majority of the  U.S. Senate has already voted three times--not once, not twice, but  three times--to halt all U.S. military support for the Saudi-led war in  Yemen. It is time for us to do that again--this time, not just in words  but in action. We should have no money going toward U.S. participation  in this horrible war, which is destroying a nation with some of the  poorest, most desperate people on Earth.   So that is the fourth amendment, and I think it would be hard for  anybody here to deny that it is an important amendment. This has  already been, in one form or another, passed three times. So let's get  some teeth into it.   The last amendment that I have filed would reduce the defense budget  by one-tenth of 1 percent--not a lot of money--and use that money to  make our Nation safer by reaching out to people throughout the world  and expanding educational and cultural exchange programs.   In other words, the theory behind this whole bill is that, by  spending $740 billion on the building of planes and tanks and guns and  the most sophisticated weapons of mass destruction in the history of  the world, it will make us safer. Well, I am not so sure. Maybe what  makes us safer is when we break down the fears and the hatred that  exist between peoples all over the world. Maybe what makes us safer is  when we get to know each other--that is, as human beings--whether we  are Chinese or Russians or Iranians or Brazilians or Canadians. Maybe  we all share the same human aspirations.   Throughout history, it has always been easy to demonize people you  don't know--always easy. That is what demagogues have always done. We  are fearful of Jews, of Blacks, of the Irish, of Italians, and of gay  people. It is so easy to demonize people with whom we are not  comfortable and don't know. They are not in our communities, and we  don't know anybody. Let's demonize the people of Iran, and let's  demonize the people of China and Russia.   This is not saying that I or anybody else here is in agreement with  their policies, but are weapons the only approach we have toward them?  Yes, we need a strong military, and I believe in a strong military. Do  you know what I also believe? When we have kids from the United States  who go to other countries and when other countries send their kids,  their farmers, their doctors, their nurses to America and when we get  to know each other, we have a shot at breaking down the irrational  hatred which foments so many problems throughout the world.   As a former mayor, I can tell you--and I am not alone--that this idea  of sister cities is certainly not a radical idea. I suspect that almost  everybody here in the Senate comes from a State in which a sister city  program exists or that you have programs with cities in other  countries. In Vermont, we have a number of them. I started several of  them when I was the mayor of Burlington. It was a beautiful thing to  see--kids from another country coming to our country and our people  going to other countries and learning.   All I am asking for is one-tenth of 1 percent--$7 billion--no, less  than that. What am I talking about? All I am asking for is $700 million  to encourage cultural and educational exchange programs. By taking this  tiny fraction from our defense budget--one-tenth of 1 percent--and  applying it to these exchange programs, we will send a message about  the critical role these exchange programs play. They exist all over  this country already, but I want to see them grow, in supporting not  [[Page S4100]]  only American security but our common, global security. Therefore, I  have listed and described five amendments   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending  amendment and call up the following amendments en bloc: Senate  amendment Nos. 1788, 1920, 1789, 1919, and 1918; that they be reported  by number; further, that there be 2 hours of debate on the amendments,  equally divided and controlled by me or by my designee and by Senator  Inhofe or his designee; and that, following the use or yielding back of  that time, the Senate vote on the adoption of the amendments, in the  order listed, without intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, Senator Inhofe is right. He and I have  known each other for years and, I think, respect each other. We have  very, very different philosophical leanings, but that does not mean we  cannot respect each other.   All I would say to my friend from Oklahoma is that the function of  the Senate is for 100 Members to determine what is important, not just  a few. What may not be important to me may be important to you, and  what may be important to you may not be important to me. Yet I think,  especially on a bill of this significance, the Members--Democrats and  Republicans--have a right to come forward and bring forth amendments.  If I don't like an amendment and you have brought forth the amendment,  it is likely I am going to vote against it, and you are going to vote  against my amendment. I get it. It is called democracy. It is the  process we go through here. I just cannot understand why we are not  voting on amendments. When we get back, I would rather see a process  take place whereby dozens of amendments are brought up and debated and  voted up or voted down. That is what, I think, this Senate is supposed  to stand for.    Mr. President, if I may respond to my friend, Jack Reed  is a good friend of mine, and I know that you and he are working hard  and well together. Yet you are two Senators, and there are 98 others of  us, and on what you two may agree to be important or not to be  important others may disagree.   All I am saying to the Senator is to let people bring up their  amendments. If the Senator doesn't like it and I don't like it, we will  vote against it. I just don't know why we are restricting amendments in  a Senate which is supposed to be one of the great deliberative bodies  in the world. The world is supposed to look at us, but they are not  looking well at us when a few people determine what is going to be  voted on or not.    I would simply say to my friend, he is quite right-- unanimous consent gives every Member a lot of power, and I do not want  to be objectionable, but I feel very strongly on this issue, and I hope  we can work on something.    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the  Record some of the finalist essays written by Vermont High School  students as part of the 10th annual ``State of the Union'' essay  contest conducted by my office.        The material follows:                 Samuel Dooley, Milton High School, Senior         The country that we live in today is plagued with       fundamental problems. Ranging from political corruption to an       inefficient healthcare system, yet the single most important       issue facing our country today is nationwide environmental       neglect. Without  [[Page S4131]]       extreme actions being taken immediately, more irreversible       damage will be done.        In 2018, the United States emitted 6.5 billion metric tons       of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. This is an estimated       8.8% more than 1990. Between 1990 and 2010, the United States       lost 949,750 acres of forest on average per year. The U.S.       Department of Energy estimates that 1.9 million gallons of       oil are spilled into U.S. oceans every year.        Current studies show that the effects of climate change are       more severe and are moving faster than was formerly       predicted. What needs to happen is large scale environmental       programs with legal incentives such as tax breaks, as well as       punishments for not adhering to the plans like jail time and       loss of government funding or subsidies. The most accurate       proposal of recent years is the Green New Deal. This proposal       called for a World War 2 type mobilization of the country to       achieve 100% clean energy by 2030. This plan also looked to       better the economy by creating jobs in sustainable       industries, unlike jobs currently involved in fossil fuel       industries, as well as investing in renewable public       transportation and clean organic agriculture. The first step       to combating climate change would be to immediately adopt       this proposal, yet in March of 2019 the proposal was rejected       by a Republican controlled Senate.        The very first step that should be taken is the       readmittance of the U.S. into the Paris Climate Agreement. It       is the duty of the United States to set an example for the       rest of the world about how to combat climate change. An       important idea is to make environmental agencies as       nonpartisan as possible, similar to the NLRB where the       members consist of nearly equal Republicans as well as       Democrats at all times. This would ensure that decisions are       made based on science instead of based on party ties and       political affiliations.        The most important goal being to make the United States       completely carbon neutral. A plan for most, if not all,       energy produced to come from clean sources would be necessary       to achieving that goal. Another necessity would be the       implementation of programs designed to restore forests and       wildlife. This would mean increased regulation on logging       industries as well as oil industries. With an increased       punishment for violating these regulations. These initiatives       would be able to transition Americans losing their jobs in       fossil fuel industries into clean energy industries, which       would be a sustainable alternative. Green jobs would have       higher job security than fossil fuels due to the fact that       there is a finite amount of coal and oil available to be       extracted, once the planet no longer has these resources       available all of these millions of workers will lose their       jobs with no replacement. With a program like the Green New       Deal, these workers will have jobs that do not have an       expiration date. It is important to remember that those first       and most heavily affected by this crisis, are people with       lower incomes. This is not only an environmental issue, but       also a human rights issue.        It is up to all of us now to be able to preserve this       planet and create a stable system which will allow all       generations moving forward to prosper in a healthy       environment.             Meredith Jackson, Burlington High School, Freshman         One issue in Vermont that doesn't get enough recognition is       the cost of eating healthy. It isn't affordable for many, and       the expenses can even discourage people to eat healthily. If       the prices are discouraging people to eat healthily, then       they might resort to unhealthier foods because they are       cheaper and in more of the average price range for most.        Healthy Living and City Market both have a goal to provide       local farm-fresh produce including prep items for healthy,       nourishing, meals, and a selection of ingredients to cook       vegan or gluten-free meals. Healthy living and City Market       are great in that they provide fresh local produce, and for       the quality that it is the prices make sense. On the Healthy       Living website, the price for a container of raspberries can       range anywhere from $4.29-$5.69. That may not seem like a lot       but at McDonald's, you can get an entire meal for that much.       That is just what many people choose to do, resort to cheaper       options such as fast food.        Unlike fresh produce and wholegrain-rich foods, fast food       is quick, easy, and very cheap, making it ideal for people       who can't afford to shop at places like city Market or       Healthy living.        According to Gallup, 80% of Americans eat fast food on at       least a monthly basis, and 96% of Americans eat fast food       annually. Fast food isn't bad unless a person has it often,       say at least once a week. Eating unhealthy foods, too often,       can cause people to become overweight or even obese. Over       99,000,000 adults in the U.S. are overweight and over       70,000,000 are obese.        Obesity can cause many health issues that could have been       prevented if that person were of a healthy weight. Some risks       include high blood pressure, diabetes, gout, breathing       problems, such as sleep apnea and asthma, Gallbladder disease       and gallstones, Osteoarthritis, Heart disease, stroke, and       even cancer. Maintaining a healthy weight and lifestyle will       reduce the risk of many of these health problems.        It's not guaranteed that people become obese overtime       because healthy food is too expensive, eating unhealthily       isn't the only factor that causes obesity, but it could very       well be. If healthier foods were cheaper, it would be an       option for more people and would encourage them to eat       healthier reducing the risk of obesity. Having the       availability of healthy meals is important.        A healthy diet is beneficial to your everyday life in so       many ways. Some benefits to eating healthy are a maintained/      healthy weight, reduced risk of chronic illnesses such as       cardiovascular disease and cancer, more energy, and an       increase in happiness. Also, a recent study has proven that       having a diet consisting of plenty of fruits and vegetables       and limits highly processed food, can reduce certain signs of       depression.        This issue is very real and very important but thinking up       solutions to this problem can be quite the challenge. There       are a few solutions that seem doable and not too farfetched       or unrealistic.        First, expanding the fresh produce area in stores like       Hannafords to give more options and kind of push out some of       the unhealthy, overly processed items in the store. This       wouldn't necessarily make it less expensive but having more       options might encourage people to shop in that section more       often.        Second, doing some more advertising for the Farm Share       Program. The Farm Share Program provides limited-income       Vermonters with access to high-quality produce on a weekly       basis. The program helps hundreds of families get access to a       season's worth of farm-fresh produce by reducing the cost of       the shares. The program itself is already a solution to this       problem, but I feel like advertising would be good because it       would inform more people that they have that option. All they       have to do is sign up.        Third, and last, is more of something people could do       themselves or with a group of people, but people could start       their own gardens or start a larger neighborhood garden. This       would provide people with plenty of fresh fruits and       vegetables. All they would have to do is chip in a little       hard work and time, then they could have all the free produce       that was grown.        Eating healthy is expensive because a lot of work goes into       growing, and getting, that local farm-fresh produce into       stores. Farmers spend countless hours growing the crops from       which it all comes from, people need to pick, sort, and wash       everything, then, there is packaging and delivering. The list       goes on. Another part is due to the fact that it is high       quality, locally grown, and fresh. A lot of money goes into       providing it, so a lot of money needs to be made in order for       them to keep providing the produce to stores for everyone.       The problem is big, the solutions are limited, but something       needs to be done in order to provide farm-fresh products to       the people of Vermont at a more reasonable and affordable       price.              Caleb Matosky, Rice Memorial High School, Junior         As citizens of one of the wealthiest nations in the world,       we have an inherent responsibility to set an example for       others to follow. America has failed to take action and       address what is perhaps the greatest threat our world has       faced since the beginning of recorded history: climate       change. If Americans continue to deny its effects, the future       of our country will be put into jeopardy. Rising sea levels,       more severe weather events, rampant wildfires, devastating       droughts, and disappearing winters are just a few of the       effects of climate change we are already experiencing.       Skeptics and deniers might argue that America is taking       enough action to fight global warming: this sort of lazy and       selfish thinking is what has caused the American people and       our government to allow climate change to occur uninhibited       until the very end of the last century. If our government       does not make drastic changes within the next several years,       America as we know it could be forever changed. We have the       money, we have the ability to implement changes, and all that       remains is for lawmakers to place the future of our planet       over their allegiance to fossil fuels.        I propose widespread legislation to ensure that America is       powered by 80% renewable energy by 2030, which would be a       large step in the right direction for the future of our       planet. We need to penalize those who profit off of       destroying the environment through fossil fuels, as these       energy producers produce more emissions per day than many       people produce in a year. Through new laws which put a price       on CO2 emissions, and government tax relief for those who       produce renewable power, we can work to rid the earth of       harmful coal burning. According to the U.S. Energy       Information Administration, coal fueled power generation       produces 1.15 billion tons of CO2 each year. It is also the       most carbon rich fossil fuel, producing 2.5 tons of CO2 per       ton of coal burned. Despite this, coal is still being used as       the primary source of energy in America. This needs to       change. Additionally, we need to take action to crack down on       other nations who disregard the state of the world's climate,       and ensure that nations such as China and India take       responsibility for their role in the issue.        The United States is the wealthiest nation in the world,       and if only a fraction of our military budget was used to       invest in the future of our environment, the future of       younger generations and the future of our species as a whole       we might be able to prevent many of climate change's worst       effects. There is no time left to wait, or to deny the       challenges before us: we must take urgent action and do       everything we can to lower CO2 emissions before it is too       late.
