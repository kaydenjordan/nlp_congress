 Mr. President, I was necessarily absent due to a  family funeral for the votes on confirmation of Executive Calendar No.  384 and the motion to invoke cloture on Executive Calendar No. 407.   On vote No. 266, had I been present, I would have voted nay on the  confirmation of Executive Calendar No. 384.   On vote No. 267, had I been present, I would have voted nay on the  motion to invoke cloture on Executive Calendar No. 407.                            ____________________
