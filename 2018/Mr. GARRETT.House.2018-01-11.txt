 Mr. Speaker, I thank the patron of this amendment for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, we have covered many things in the past year, to include  tax policy, healthcare, helping eviscerate ISIS, but I would argue this  is the most important moment in the time that I have been in this  building.   Not only is the Fourth Amendment at stake, so, too, I would argue,  are due process under the Fifth and Fourteenth.   We must stand strong for individual liberty and privacy. That is who  we are as a nation. If we do not put the ``F'' back in FISA, it becomes  ISA, and all eyes are on you.
