 Mr. Speaker, today, we are debating a partisan bill  that spends over $400 billion on everything but long-term investments  in America's roads and bridges.   Despite being the largest percentage increase in surface  transportation programs in the last quarter-century, very little of the  money going out the door is directed at the policies, programs, and  people that need it.   It ignores the need to streamline our project review process, creates  more bureaucratic red tape, and, once again, leaves rural America  behind.   A focus on the rail title, for example, reveals complete ignorance of  the industry. Freight railroads are the most fuel-efficient way to move  freight over land, covering more than 480 miles on a single gallon of  fuel. Yet, my colleagues on the left included section 9607 that would  require Class I freight railroads to replace locomotives constructed  prior to 2008 with brand-new fossil-fuel-burning locomotives by 2030.   This ignores the significant efforts of the Class I freight railroads  themselves to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate  change. It locks the industry into utilizing internal combustion  engines for decades, negating the ongoing efforts with suppliers to  research, test, and adapt zero-emission locomotives for future  incorporation into their fleets.   This section alone would cost the industry tens of billions of  dollars and, needless to say, was written without the consultation of  the railroads or stakeholders.   This is just one of the many examples in this partisan bill of the  significant disconnect between constituents and the majority's Green  New Deal agenda. We have a bill that cares more about appeasing the  climate lobby than fixing the cracks in our bridges.   I cannot support this legislation today. Instead, I will continue  working with my colleagues who are serious about addressing American  transportation and infrastructure, and I encourage everyone to do the  same thing.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, there is a lot to unpack in that statement right  there. Let me start with section 1201 of H.R. 3684, which basically  requires States to prioritize the state of good repair for their roads  over constructing new capacity.   Well, it is almost impossible to achieve a state of good repair when  new capacity is necessary to achieve that state of good repair. You are  telling States they can't do that, exercising more Federal control over  the States.   It would greatly limit the State's jurisdiction over their own roads.  Each State has unique transportation systems with needs that vary  greatly, and their decisions to expand highway capacity should be made  by them and not in a vacuum, certainly not here in Washington, D.C.  DOTs must consider everything, from balancing loan service to asset  management.   Section 1201 is an attempt by the Federal Government to identify the  needs of States for them and direct their policies rather than  promoting State flexibility. This section would limit the scope of  good-paying construction projects and jobs for our constituents. It  disproportionately affects rural and suburban communities, mind you,  where new capacity is often needed far more than repairs.   As I mentioned before, Washington cannot and should not try to  dictate every need of the road systems State by State when the  individuals who understand those roads are the best ones to make that  decision. They are the ones who are driving on them every single day.   Instead, Congress should focus our efforts on empowering States to  build the transportation systems their communities need rather than  create more bureaucratic hurdles.   It is interesting to note the comments about electric vehicles in  China. I don't think we should emulate China in any way, shape, or  form, number one. Number two, I am curious to note how those electric  vehicles are powered: by coal-fired power plants. Then, we have the  conversation about the Paris climate accord and who is emitting the  most carbon.   I don't know how you expect to power all these electric vehicles just  by plugging into the wall. Power has to come from somewhere. You are  against nuclear. We are shuttering coal-fired plants. I would ask for  some suggestions on that, but I don't see any realistic ones coming  from the other side.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Gibbs).    Madam Speaker, the gentleman's comments were  dangerously close to what I would consider disparaging, and I would  bring that to your attention.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Perry).    Madam Speaker, before I yield to my distinguished  colleague from North Carolina (Mr. Budd), it is my understanding that  we are to address our comments to the Chair and not to each other.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. Budd).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Van Duyne.)    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to urge a vote against this en bloc. This en bloc  contains 8 percent of the total amendments that Republicans were  allowed to offer in this process.   To me it is amazing that this bill prioritizes things like artwork in  rail terminals. I heard the chairman say earlier that, look, in Russia,  they have chandeliers hanging in their rail stations. So I am not sure  that we necessarily need to emulate Russian infrastructure,  particularly focusing our hard-earned taxpayer dollars on hanging  chandeliers and other artwork that the chairman categorizes as art  infrastructure. I don't consider art infrastructure. I don't think my  constituents would either.    Our infrastructure is crumbling. I live in a district that is  connected to Tennessee via the I-40 bridge, a glaring example of where  we need to be placing our infrastructure dollars. That bridge was shut  down just about 6 weeks ago for structural deficiencies.   Ironically, we have two bridges connecting Arkansas and Tennessee.  They are in Memphis and West Memphis, Arkansas. One bridge which was  built in 1969, we refer to it as the ``new bridge.'' That is how old it  is.   Thankfully, those structural defects were found in time. But the  majority is proposing to waste some of the billions of dollars on  infrastructure on art--and without any way to pay for it after sending  $70 billion to transit agencies over the last year to support them  through the pandemic. But now the majority thinks we should be allowing  these same agencies to divert Federal resources for art and that it is  okay to use that money for paintings and whatever else you might  consider.   If you vote against this amendment, your vote says that you believe  that art is infrastructure, Mr. Speaker, and that we should send  taxpayer dollars to support infrastructure dollars as art. It is as  simple as that.   Our limited transportation resources need to be invested in  rebuilding our communities' roads and bridges.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this en bloc amendment  No. 3, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I claim the time in opposition to this en bloc of amendments.   Again, this bill is nothing more than a partisan exercise, and this  en bloc just throws together, again, a bunch of bad ideas with little  opportunity for input or debate.   Nothing further proves that point than the disproportionate amount of  Democrat amendments we will be considering today, many of which will  not be subjected to the scrutiny of standalone votes or debate.   Over 100 Democrat amendments have been approved by the Rules  Committee while less than 30 Republican amendments have been made in  order.   Unfortunately, this is not just about the terrible legislative  process--it is also about the policy which moves forward with no pay- for in sight. This is completely unacceptable.   Members should not be forced to choose between voting on a bill that  just burdens future generations of Americans with more debt and greater  dependence on China or passing another short-term surface extension.  But those are the two options presented to us by the majority here  today.   What we are looking at is a bill with policies that prevent rural  communities from growing and that raises inflation so average Americans  will continue to see rising prices in everyday products like milk and  gas.   I had hoped we wouldn't make this bad bill even worse, but this en  bloc only adds more spending and more bad policies.   This bill is over 1,600 pages and over 230 amendments were filed by  Members on both sides. But we are going to spend less than 12 hours  working through amendments and debate to rush to an inevitable partisan  vote.   This is not a process anyone should be proud of and very indicative  of how we got here today: just a one-sided, my-way-or-the-highway  approach.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this en bloc amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H3559]]         Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Again, just as a reminder for the many of the tens of people who are  watching at home, this en bloc amendment contains 38 Democrat  amendments. In contrast to the en bloc No. 3 that we just considered  that contained all of the Republican amendments, only 19 were  considered there. So that represents, again, 8 percent of the total  number of amendments that were made in order.   And there are a good number of these amendments, by the way, that are  offered by Members on the committee. In fact, I mean, there are an  awful lot of them. And it just underscores how this process has been so  flawed and so ill-conceived.   Back in the not-too-distant past--I have been on this committee now  for 11 years--we would bring a bill to committee to mark up, and it was  agreed upon by the four principals of the committee. And the amendments  would be agreed upon by the four principals of the committee, and that  is how we achieved bipartisanship. Those days, apparently, are gone.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the remaining time?    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   American demand for high-speed rail is low; and Federal money for  transportation must be spent on projects and infrastructure that  Americans need and use.   The issue is not whether America must lead the world in high-speed  rail, but whether Americans actually want high-speed rail.   In California, the high-speed rail project launched in 2008 has been  continually plagued by cost increases and delays. According to the L.A.  Times, costs have gone from $33 billion to over $100 billion, and it is  at least 12 years behind schedule.   These projects inevitably result in environmental and endangered  species concerns, eminent domain fights, potential displacement of  families and businesses, including in low-income communities, and  highly questionable demand that will leave these railroads dependent on  government subsidies forever.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I will try to only use 6 of those 7  minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This bill contains--tons of money just won't matter if we fail to  support programs for roads and bridges. The huge funding levels aren't  what they appear to be because the bill spreads the dollars thin over  41 new programs; adds many new burdensome mandates to programs that  States rely on; doesn't include meaningful regulatory reforms so  dollars are used more effectively.   Instead of getting money to States quickly so they can use it how  they need, the majority adds new restrictions, like prohibiting new  highway capacity that would hamper States' ability to build the  projects that their communities need.                                time  2030    Really, this is the wrong time for this big, drastic change. This  bill wants  [[Page H3561]]  to force Americans off the roads and into transit and passenger rail.  But the central planning push couldn't come at a worse time because of  the pandemic-related uncertainty and ongoing changes in transportation,  work, and living patterns that will last for years to come.   Even before the pandemic, 85 percent of Americans traveled to work in  a car, truck, or van, and only 5 percent used public transportation.  But the majority chose to bankrupt the programs the overwhelming  majority of Americans rely on.   As employers are becoming more flexible with teleworking, the  majority believes we should be less flexible with our State and local  partners. We should focus on core infrastructure and proven programs  that provide for flexibility instead of dictating a one-size-fits-all  progressive idea of what transportation should look like.   The majority calls this is a transformative bill. Well, the American  people can be assured they will see the price of gas and goods  transform upwards with the increasing inflation this unpaid-for bill  will drive.   We just heard 38 amendments and not a single reference to how any of  those would be paid for. In fact, there is not any pay-for in this  entire bill. Any argument that we don't want to work with the majority  is just simply false.   In addition to the strong resiliency title in Republican bill STARTER  Act 2.0, I frequently said I was willing to work with the majority. And  the ranking member said that he wanted to work with the majority on  their priority of reducing transportation's impact on the environment,  but that we also needed to work to address Republican priorities like  streamlining. They simply refused.   In committee, we proposed compromises that would include both climate  and streamlining provisions and offered a ``Buy American'' amendment to  ensure we weren't sending U.S. dollars for electric vehicle  infrastructure to support the Chinese Government's slave labor and  environmental destruction. The majority rejected those proposals.  Instead, House Democrats are willing to sell out to China to claim they  are reaching their climate goals.   Republican Members are not willing to ignore the fact that relying on  China, the worst polluter in the world, will absolutely increase global  emissions.   Furthermore, we have to remember this is a transportation bill, first  and foremost. Spending $1 out of every $2 on meeting Green New Deal  objectives begs the question: Is this bill still a transportation bill?   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this en bloc amendment, I urge a  ``no'' vote on the underlying bill, and I yield the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
