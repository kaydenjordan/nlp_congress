 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Rose Marie  Strippoli, an accomplished artist from Bristol, Pennsylvania.   In addition to receiving numerous awards throughout her career, her  most recent acrylic painting titled ``The Passage'' was recognized as  best in show at the 70th Tinicum Arts Festival last week. Her abstract  painting, combining vibrant colors with masterful strokes, stood out  amongst submissions from more than 180 artists at the festival.   In addition to her artistic excellence and success, she has  tirelessly advocated for local artists in the Bucks County area. One of  her most notable accomplishments was her work to establish an exhibit  at the Lower Bucks Campus of the Bucks County Community College  featuring a rotation of pieces from local artists. The exhibit opened  in 2015 and has highlighted many up-and-coming local artists since that  time.   Her constant drive to better herself as a person and as an artist  earned her a spot in the Centre for the Arts Hall of Fame in Bristol in  2016.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Rose Marie on her accomplished career and  extend to her the best of luck in her future endeavors. Her work has  improved opportunities for young artists in our community, for which we  owe her many thanks.        Commending the Lifesaving Actions of Police Officer Ryan Bunda     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the brave and  lifesaving actions of Police Officer Ryan Bunda of the Warminster  Township Police Department.   On July 11, 2019, Officer Bunda observed a white pickup truck rolling  slowly down a busy roadway in his patrol area. Officer Bunda, in an act  of incredible bravery and initiative, ran alongside the truck, opened  the door, and used his hand to press the brake, bringing the vehicle to  a halt.   The driver of the truck was suffering from a seizure, and Officer  Bunda, with the help of a local firefighter who was passing on the  other side of the road, removed the victim from the vehicle and  administered lifesaving first aid on the side of the road   With the help of this firefighter and the additional medical  assistance of EMTs, who arrived shortly after, Officer Bunda saved the  driver from life-altering harm or death, as well as protecting the  safety of other drivers on the roadway.   This act of bravery on behalf of Officer Bunda serves as a reminder  of the debt of gratitude we owe to the incredibly brave and selfless  public servants in law enforcement.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Officer Bunda for his brave actions and his  career of service, and I extend thanks to all first responders and law  enforcement officials across Bucks County and across our country.               Honoring the Life and Memory of Troy M. Pereira     Mr. Speaker, today, I rise with a heavy heart to  honor the life and memory of Troy Pereira of Falls Township,  Pennsylvania, a graduate of Pennsbury High School and a gifted student- athlete.   Troy held a career as a warehouse logistics specialist for H&M in  Burlington, New Jersey.   Troy participated in community sports programs, such as the  Morrisville Babe Ruth baseball team and the Morrisville Bulldog team.  He was also a member of the championship Pennsbury men's volleyball  team, which qualified for the State volleyball championship in 2013.   Athletics aside, Troy is remembered as a generous and kind soul who  was deeply loved by all who met him. My heart goes out to his parents,  Matthew A. Pereira and Kathleen Holder Hirko, and her husband, Jeffrey  Hirko; his brother, Kyle Pereira; and his sister, Chelsea Pereira.   Troy's life was taken from us too soon. In the short time he was with  us, Troy was a leading example of the importance of community  engagement. May he now enjoy his eternal reward for a life he spent  serving others.                            ____________________
