 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I must confess, today I was astonished to read an  article in one of the online magazines that House Democratic leadership  had asked their Members to vote against this stopgap funding bill  because of the stalemate over the funding of the State Children's  Health Insurance Program. We just heard the chairman of the Energy and  Commerce Committee detail the work that has already been done on this  bill.   Let me assure this Congress, there are probably people in here  saying: What do you mean? We voted on this bill. We voted this bill out  of the House weeks ago. It was offset. Everything that the Senate asked  for, they were delivered: the 5-year timeframe, the funding levels the  Senate asked for. They got everything they wanted.   Yes, it was offset in a responsible fashion, but now we are told  House Democratic leadership says vote ``no'' on this continuing  resolution because we don't like the stopgap funding for the State  Children's Health Insurance Program.   What in the devil do they want to happen? We did our work. We did our  work. We had our legislative hearings on this bill in the summertime.  We did delay things, unfortunately, 1 day. There was a shooting at a  House baseball game--you may remember that--that caused us some delay,  but we came back 2 weeks later. We got our work done.   We had a responsible bill. It was reflective of everything that was  requested by the Senate. It was offset, as was requested by a number of  Members of this body, and it has languished over in the Senate since  the early part of October. It is time for the Senate to take up and  pass that bill so we don't have to have this continued discussion.   This continuing resolution is important because it stops a problem  that some of our States are going to face. It was completely  unnecessary. The other body could fix it, and they should.
