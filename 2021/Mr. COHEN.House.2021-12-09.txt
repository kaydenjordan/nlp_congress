 Madam Speaker, the President has done an excellent job on  trying to address our economic problems, and one of the main reasons we  have economic problems is because of the coronavirus.   The President has an excellent vaccination program that the  Republicans, unfortunately, are fighting. As people have experienced  the pandemic, they have been less willing to go out and engage in  commerce and travel and had to reduce some of their business  activities. This has hurt the supply chain and hurt our economy. So the  President's vaccine plan is also an economic plan.   Republicans in the Senate led an effort to cancel all the vaccination  programs that the President has to protect us, to keep us healthy, and  to move our economy forward. That is unfortunate. We need to support  these vaccination plans, and we need to support the President in these  efforts.   Inflation has been a problem. The President has released some oil  from the reserve to help deal with gas prices. Gas prices are going  down, and they will go down naturally.    One of the great reasons why inflation has increased is because of  used car prices. You have to think about when used car prices go up,  Madam Speaker, somebody is selling that used car, and they are getting  more money to put in their pocket. Things are getting better.   God bless New Mexico.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me the  time.   Madam Speaker, my subcommittee works on issues concerning civil  rights and civil liberties, and we have had hearings on the pardon  power. The pardon power is something I have been interested in since  the 1970s when a Democratic Governor of Tennessee abused the pardon  power, and I stood up against him. I have stood up against this  previous President, Trump, who abused the pardon power even more. He  gave pardons to his family, to people who were administration  officials, to people who worked on his campaign, and to people who lied  to the Justice Department and to the FBI because they were protecting  the President from the impeachment articles that were lodged against  him and which would have shown his contravention of the Constitution.   I have listened to the debate here some. It is astonishing to me.  There is nothing more important in this government and this Congress  than protecting democracy, and democracy was threatened by Donald  Trump. This bill, which Adam Schiff has sponsored with many cosponsors,  protects democracy. It puts checks and balances on the President.   No person should have unfettered power, and the President tried to  use the pardon power to take care of people who took care of him, to  shut them up so they wouldn't testify against him: Roger Stone, Mike  Flynn, you name it, Madam Speaker, down to Paul Manafort.   He pardoned people who lied, who grifted, who dealt with the Russians  and who were part of the conspiracy to take over the election by  communicating with Kilimnik and getting information out there in the  social media to beat Hillary Clinton and elect Donald Trump, the most  disgusting Presidency in the history of this country.   That is why this bill is so important, to protect our democracy and  save us from abuses by a future President who doesn't have limitations  on him.   Madam Speaker, I pledge allegiance to the flag and hope all of us do.  I support this bill.
