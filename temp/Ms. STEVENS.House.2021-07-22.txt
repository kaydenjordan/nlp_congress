 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the gun  violence plaguing this country and the elected officials who stand by  and watch, content on not passing new laws to address its scourge on  the American people.   I rise for the 9-year anniversary of the mass shooting that took  place in a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, 9 years ago this week--12  lives gone, 70 injured.   I rise for all of those who were at the baseball game just this last  weekend around the corner, running for their lives because they heard  there was a shooting.   Your gun rights are not under attack when 23 million firearms were  sold in the United States of America in 2020 alone. But what is under  attack is your ability to live freely in this country without the  threat of gun violence in a movie theater, in your place of worship, in  your school, in your backyard, or driving around at night.  [[Page H3825]]    I rise for the students who marched for their lives, and I rise  because the need to pass a law for gun safety is of the fierce urgency  of the now.                            ____________________
