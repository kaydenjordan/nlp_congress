 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman, my colleague from  the great city of Detroit and from Michigan, for showing this  leadership.   ``None of us are home until all of us are home.'' This is the slogan  of Project HOME, an organization in my district that empowers  individuals to break the cycle of poverty and homelessness, starting  with permanent supportive housing.   Safe, affordable housing is the basis of stability and well-being.  Secure housing improves health outcomes, helps children perform better  in school, and can break generational cycles of poverty. But given the  skyrocketing cost of rent, which is outpacing incomes, secure housing  is out of reach for many low-income families.   Lacking a fixed address makes it harder to land a job, enroll  children in school, apply for assistance and benefits.  [[Page H9285]]                                     time  1600    The affordable housing shortage is a crisis in my district and in  many other cities and neighborhoods across the Nation.   I represent Philadelphia, a city which has a poverty rate of around  25 percent. Let me repeat that, a city with a poverty rate of about 25  percent. Most low-income renters spend at least half of their income on  housing. This leaves no room for unexpected expenses such as medical  bills, which can quickly send vulnerable families into housing  inability, eviction, and, sometimes, homelessness.   We must increase funding for programs that help the most vulnerable,  including children, people with disabilities, and seniors, such as  homeless assistance grants and the housing choice voucher program.   Those living in poverty, including 400,000 in the city of  Philadelphia, are struggling to find safe and affordable places to  live. Over 40,000 families are on the Philadelphia Housing Authority  waiting list--40,000 are on that list.   Most low-income renters in Philadelphia receive no government  assistance with their housing costs, driving many to rely on  alternative arrangements to secure shelter.   These are steps that we can take to address this growing crisis. We  must invest in preserving existing public housing and improving health  and safety through increased funding for the Public Housing Operating  Fund and the Public Housing Capital Fund.   In the city of Philadelphia, the Philadelphia City Council recently  passed a right to counsel law, providing attorneys for low-income  families facing evictions.   But millions of Americans in other cities and communities face  evictions every year. This lack of access to legal representation has  led to unjust evictions. I am an original cosponsor of the Eviction  Protection Act, which creates grants to provide legal representation to  those facing eviction.   It is not an accident that two Members who stood up here are also  members of the Ways and Means Committee, as I am. We all recognize that  we can use the Tax Code to lift our neighborhoods and boost our  stability in housing.   Yes, we can use the Tax Code. I am happy that my colleagues are from  the Ways and Means Committee, and we should work together on that.   I support the expansion of the low-income housing tax credit-- especially the credits for securing extremely low-income households--to  bring capital to underserved regions.   Access to affordable housing is a right. It is time Congress  acknowledges that fact. All Americans deserve quality homes--all  Americans. None of us are home until all of us are home.   I want to stress that message: None of us are home until all of us  are home.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman, again, from Detroit,  Michigan, for her leadership in bringing us together to talk about a  subject that is very key to a lot of our survival. It is extremely  essential that we have that opportunity, but it starts with leadership,  and it starts today. We need to be relentless on this subject, and we  need to be no nonsense.
