 Mr. Speaker, I support the underlying water resources  development legislation.   In communities across the country, our infrastructure is falling  apart, as colleagues on both sides of the aisle have pointed out. This  is evident in the state of our Nation's dams. In communities like  Waterbury, Vermont, dams are rapidly aging and the risk of breach  continues to grow.   In 2016, Congress took a very positive step to address this issue  with the passage of the WIIN Act. Section 1177 of the WIIN Act  authorized funding for the Army Corps to rehabilitate some of the  Nation's oldest Corps-constructed dams that are classified as high  hazard potential. As you know, the failure of a dam that is so  classified is anticipated to cause the loss of life.   While section 1177 was a positive start, its limited authorization  and per project cap have hindered its effectiveness. To that end, I  want to thank Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio for their  willingness to work with me to address this matter.   Section 105 of the legislation before us addresses these shortcomings  by increasing the provisions in authorization and giving dams greater  authority to accrue Federal funds over multiple years.   The benefits of these changes to communities like Waterbury, Vermont  are very clear. In 2011, Mr. Speaker, Waterbury suffered a devastating  flood during Hurricane Irene. Despite the damage that the village  suffered--totally flooded--the flooding in Waterbury would have been  far more catastrophic if it weren't for the Corps-built Waterbury Dam,  a 1930s-era construction in need of significant repair. Section 105  will give the Corps the tools it needs to get work done rehabbing high- hazard dams like Waterbury across the country.   Both parties agree we need to improve our infrastructure. This bill  will take important steps to do that and address some of our most  outdated, hazardous dams in this country. I urge my colleagues to  support this bill.
