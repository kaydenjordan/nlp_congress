 Madam President, I rise today to honor a true  hero from Olathe, KS Officer Erik Clark. His brave actions during an  active shooter situation at Olathe East High School helped keep an  already tragic situation from taking students' lives.   On Friday, March 4, a senior student at Olathe East was called into  the administration office after a tip that he had brought in a gun to  school. A few minutes into meeting with the assistant principal, the  senior wouldn't open his backpack, prompting Officer Clark--the  school's resource officer--to step into the situation. Shortly after  Clark arrived, the student pulled out his weapon and began opening  fire.   In a flurry, Clark responded and returned fire, ultimately shooting  and subduing the student, but not without himself and the assistant  principal being wounded as well. Both, however, have thankfully been  discharged from the hospital. I pray that something like that may never  happen in those halls or any others across America again, for even  though there were no fatal wounds, the scars of trauma everyone at  Olathe East will surely run deep.   Lastly, I want t thank this brave officer for being so courageous to  dive headfirst into peril on that day. If it were not for Officer  Clark, this situation could have turned out to be a much darker day in  Olathe. As the son of a police chief, I know the risks our men and  women in blue take on each day. I admire Officer Clark for continually  working to ensure our safety. He has shown what true valor looks like,  and Olathe East is safer because of him. I ask now that my colleagues  show this same admiration and recognition for Officer Clark and that he  may stay safe protecting his community.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise today to honor a school  administrator that went above and beyond the service to his students,  Dr. Kaleb Stoppel.

Lastly, I want to thank Dr. Stoppel for being so responsive to the  situation and keeping students out of harm's way. Had he not  investigated the tip, this tragedy surely would have been much graver.  Olathe East is safer because of him. I ask now that my colleagues show  this same admiration and recognition for Dr. Stoppel and that he may  stay safe while educating our future leaders.                            ____________________
