 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I am, in a moment, going to ask unanimous  consent that we proceed to confirm a nominee.   Stephanie Sullivan has been nominated to be U.S. Ambassador to the  African Union. She was nominated June 15, 2022, for a position now  vacant since January of this year.   Let me briefly say why this is important.   The African Union is the entity most likely to successfully negotiate  peace in Sudan, a country now roiled by domestic violence, by a war  between one faction of its military and another, and thousands of  Americans are at risk.   I think it is crucially important to fill all of our vacant  ambassadorial positions, but this one is particularly critical because  of the role the AU can and should play in resolving this conflict. But  we lack an ambassador in this vital continent-wide organization.   I will go on at some greater length about the qualifications and the  background of this talented career Foreign Service officer who has been  an ambassador twice before in Africa. But I will also say that  statements that she has made in her role as an ambassador reflect the  policy of the administration at the time, not her personal preferences  or values. She is a talented representative of the United States, as a  diplomat, whose actions and statements reflect the administrations she  has served.   With that, I ask unanimous consent, as if in executive session, that  the Senate consider Calendar No. 68, Stephanie Sanders Sullivan, to be  Representative of the United States to the African Union, and that the  Senate vote on the nomination without any intervening action or debate;  that, if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table, and the President be immediately notified of the  Senate's action.    Madam President, would the Senator yield?    Go ahead.    At, apparently, another time, I look forward to having the  opportunity to hearing some substantiation of the wild charges just  made by my colleague from Ohio.   I did as much research as I could before appearing in what I had  understood, mistakenly, to be the foundation of his objection. Now I  look forward to figuring out how this nominee to serve again as an  ambassador is an advocate of far-left gender therapies of some kind.   Let me make two simple points, if I can, in response to the comments  I just heard on the floor. As someone who chairs the Senate  Appropriations subcommittee that funds our development efforts around  the world, and particularly in Africa, and as someone who was just in  five different countries across the continent, to characterize China's  engagement with Africa as one that promotes development in a positive  way that is respectful and uplifting, and our engagement as simply  ``hectoring,'' badly misses decades of the United States' being the No.  1 supporter of public health across the continent.   We are just now celebrating the 20th anniversary of President Bush's  signature initiative, PEPFAR, which has saved 25 million lives. The  Chinese do not invest in public health anything like the scale and  scope the United States does. The Chinese, it is true, don't ask  questions about the suppression of minorities, about the mistreatment  of journalists, about the closing of political space, about domestic  repression, and the United States does. So, if that is to be  characterized as hectoring, then I would be glad to stand up for  hectoring.    We do challenge autocrats across the continent of Africa, and we do  stand up for democracy. We also invest significantly in human  development at a time when China invests principally in airports and  soccer stadiums and highways.   So I would be happy to have a debate at any time that my colleague  from Ohio chooses to stay long enough to have the discussion about the  foundations of our engagement in the developing world.   I also, frankly, take exception to his characterization of a  talented, long-serving member of the Foreign Service who represented us  as a confirmed ambassador in both Ghana and the Democratic Republic of  the Congo.   Let me make the core point that I intended to make earlier, but in  order to accommodate my colleague's need to be interviewed on  television, I cut my comments short.   In Sudan today, a newly emerged war is raging between two militaries.  Thousands of people are at risk. In particular, Americans are at risk.  It is the African Union--a continent-wide organization headquartered in  Addis, in Ethiopia's capital--that could and should be the entity that  leads to peace in Sudan. To not have a confirmed ambassador is to  weaken our ability to engage with the AU and to engage with the leaders  of these two military factions in Sudan.   For too much of the 2 years of the Biden administration, we have  struggled to get confirmations here on the floor of the Senate of  talented nominees. We have worked closely together to make sure that we  have overcome some of the holds and some of the blocks to nominees in  the past. I am disappointed and frustrated by the spurious argument by  my colleague as to why he is standing in the way of this particularly  capable, seasoned, and experienced member of our Foreign Service.   I had imagined, based on previous statements made by my colleague,  that he might be objecting to something she said on the occasion of  George Floyd's murder, and I came to the floor today with significant,  detailed content from the previous administration, making it clear that  she wasn't acting simply on her own, that she wasn't acting on some  leftist agenda, but that she was acting in response to the direction  from both the Africa Bureau and the Deputy Secretary of State.   I had thought he might also be referencing a posting that was made on  the occasion of a pride event, of an LGBTQ pride event--something that  happens in Embassies all over the world and that reflects a shared  commitment by the American people to human rights that is  understandably part of diversity and inclusion.   My hunch is that I will have to wait for another time for my  colleague to prioritize debate on the floor of the Senate over making  his way to a cable television hit, but I respect my colleague. He is  someone who has written  [[Page S1243]]  a very compelling book, who has been elected by the people of Ohio, and  whom I expect to have the opportunity to get to know. We have only  served together now for several months, and today was literally the  first time we had exchanged words.   So I hope there will be more reason and more substance to his  opposition to this nominee than what I heard on the floor tonight, and  I look forward to engaging with him in that discussion and that debate.   With that, I conclude my remarks on this particular topic, and once  handed the closing remarks, will speak briefly and then close the  floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, which I think is now, that it  stand adjourned until 10 a.m. on Thursday, April 20; that following the  prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of  proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be  reserved for their use later in the day, and morning business be  closed; and that following the conclusion of morning business, the  Senate resume consideration of Calendar No. 28, S. 870.    For the information of the Senate, there will be two  rollcall votes at 11:15 a.m. and one vote at 1:45 p.m.                            ____________________     Madam President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate at this time, I ask that it stand adjourned under the  previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:34 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, April 20, 2023, at 10 a.m.
