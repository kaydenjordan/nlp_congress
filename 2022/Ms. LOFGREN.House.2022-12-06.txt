 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1508, I call  up the bill (H.R. 7946) to provide benefits for noncitizen members of  the Armed Forces, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on H.R. 7946.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today, this House will pass H.R. 7946, the Veteran  Service Recognition Act 2022. This is a bill that recognizes and honors  the commitment and sacrifices of our noncitizen servicemembers and  veterans.   Noncitizens have served in our military in every conflict since the  Revolutionary War. In tribute to their patriotism, our laws offer  noncitizen servicemembers an expedited pathway to citizenship.   Unfortunately, this expedited path is not always known to the  servicemembers themselves; sometimes there is confusion or lack of  information. Not every legal permanent resident who could avail  themselves of this opportunity has, in fact, done so; and we have found  instances where servicemembers believed that just by serving they had  become a United States citizen. Our bill does have some measures to  make sure that that information is better communicated in the future  and there is less confusion.   However--and unfortunately--the complexity of the current immigration  system puts some unnecessary roadblocks to naturalization but also can  have a terrible impact on veterans who have not availed themselves of  the opportunity.   The traumas of war can have terrible effects on our veterans.  Individuals suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder are far more  likely to become entangled with the criminal justice system. When that  happens, citizens merely avail themselves of the criminal justice  system. For example, if they are arrested for drug possession, they  might serve time in the county jail, and when they are released, they  have paid their debt to society. But noncitizens who are in the same  situation--people who fought for our country--might serve their jail  time for drug possession, but then they also face immigration court  because a crime that might lead to relatively minor consequences for a  U.S. citizen could lead to deportation of a noncitizen veteran.   Now, noncitizen veterans' service records are meant to be considered  during removal proceedings, but such consideration rarely occurs.  Consequently, veterans who earned the right to citizenship decades ago  have been deported.   H.R. 7946 corrects this problem by giving deported veterans the  opportunity to apply for a second chance and obtain lawful permanent  residency. Relief under this bill is discretionary--available only to  those veterans whose return is in the public interest.   Additionally, the bill creates a review process for servicemembers in  removal proceedings to ensure that their service records are taken into  account by immigration judges. It has an advisory council to examine at  length the veteran's record to see whether or not he or she was  suffering from PTSD and the like. The information can then be given to  the immigration judge, but the immigration judge retains the authority  to make the decision.   The legislation, as I mentioned earlier, makes needed changes to  current laws to allow servicemembers to naturalize as early as  possible, and we believe these changes will ensure that future veterans  will not be at risk of deportation.   Finally, H.R. 7946 codifies the current Parole in Place for the  immediate relatives of U.S. citizen servicemembers and veterans, making  permanent an administrative program that began in 2007 under then- President George W. Bush. At the time, we had come across instances  where an American soldier was killed in action, but his mother was  subject to deportation, and that mother who was sent outside of the  country could not even visit the grave of her deceased military son.   George Bush sought to change that. We have kept that change in place  ever since, and this would codify it.   This bill is supported by numerous advocacy, labor, and veterans'  groups, including The American Legion, the Nation's largest veterans  service organization. We made a commitment to our noncitizen  servicemembers when they joined our Armed Forces, and our laws really  should reflect that commitment.   I am proud to have worked alongside my colleagues, Chairman Nadler,  as well as Chairman Takano, and I would like to mention specifically  other members of our caucus who introduced bills on this subject--they  were all collected into this final product--including Congressman  Correa, Congressman Ruiz, Congressman Vargas, Congressman Grijalva, and  several others.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I will note that the exclusion of those serious offenses was in the  base bill. We didn't have to be convinced of that. We used the  definition of ``veterans'' in the veterans code, and veterans who have  an honorable or a general discharge are eligible for benefits, so that  is what we used. Dishonorable discharges are not included.   I will just say this: These are discretionary matters. If you have  multiple DUIs--let's say you have three DUIs, but they are 25 years  ago, and you have a completely clean record. You might be able to seek  administrative review of that matter. That is all this does.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Takano), the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee who has played  such a key role in this, noting also that the Iraq and Afghanistan  Veterans of America are supporting this bill and supporting Mr. Takano.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Nadler), the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I would just note, once again, that those  with dishonorable discharges are not eligible under the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington  (Ms. Jayapal), a member of the Immigration and Citizenship  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Correa), who has served on the Immigration and  Citizenship Subcommittee. He served in this Congress. He is the author  of one of the bills that was included in this bill and has visited with  deported veterans across the border.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Castro), who has played such a useful role in the crafting  of these measures.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), who is a proud member of the Immigration and  Citizenship Subcommittee and a long-serving member of the House  Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This bill is an important step forward to making sure that those who  served our country in the military are given every consideration. We  know from the reports we receive from our vets how tough it can be.   I think it is important to note that Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of  America are supporting this bill. They know better than I do the kind  of trauma that can be experienced in these theaters and have been  experienced by our brave men and women in the military. They also know  that sometimes those traumatic experiences can lead to a path that is  destructive for the veteran, a veteran who is suffering from PTSD.   Now, if a military member, a vet, was born in California and they use  drugs because of PTSD, they might spend some time in jail, but then  they would have paid their debt to society.   If, instead, their fellow soldier was a legal permanent resident of  the United States, born in another country, but volunteered to fight  for our country, after they pay their debt to society for the exact  same circumstances, then they are booted out of the country.   That is why The American Legion is saying they support this bill,  because we owe some kind of honor and stature to those who step forward  to volunteer to fight for our country. That is what we owe them.   I will just close with this. I am going to represent a town called  Salinas, California. I was there last month, and they have put up on  every light pole on the downtown street pictures of people from Salinas  who served in the military. It is so inspiring.   They had a little ceremony to unveil these photographs of the Salinas  heroes. After that, one of the veterans organizers said to me, the  worst experience of his life was driving his sergeant to the border to  be kicked out of the country he fought for. It is not right.   This bill will change that, and I hope that we will all vote in  favor.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.           Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Vicente Gonzalez of Texas
