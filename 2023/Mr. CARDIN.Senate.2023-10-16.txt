 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I come to the floor today to express my  shock and horror at what Hamas has done in its terrorist attack on  Israel. It is difficult to comprehend the evil we witnessed last week.   Before Saturday, October 7, 2023, there were over 1,000 innocent  Jewish people going about their lives in southern Israel. They were  young people at a music festival, grandparents outside of their homes,  children celebrating birthdays, mothers with little babies in their  arms. Hamas massacred them all. We have not seen this kind of atrocity  since the early days of the ISIS caliphate.   Tragically, we must not only mourn the death that Hamas left behind;  we must try to rescue the hostages--some of them American citizens-- that Hamas dragged back to Gaza.   For the Jewish community around the world and for all Israelis, this  was the most horrific week in generations--some of the toughest in  Israel's entire history. So I want to make one point crystal clear: The  United States stands shoulder to shoulder with the State of Israel.   Seventy-five years ago, Harry Truman was the first world leader to  officially recognize Israel, only 11 minutes after its creation. He did  that because the United States and Israel share common values. And for  over seven decades, the relationship between our two nations has only  gotten stronger and deeper.   So despite the pain that many of us feel from these barbaric  attacks--and we will continue to feel--now is the time for us to show  our total support for Israel, not just in words but by our deeds. This  is exactly what we are doing.   From the bottom of my heart, I want to thank the U.S. Embassy team in  Israel and our Embassies across the region for their tireless efforts.  Even as they themselves have taken cover from rocket fire, American  diplomats have stepped up to work hand in hand with Israel to serve  over a half a million Americans who are there. In fact, across the  Biden administration, public  [[Page S4973]]  servants have been working around the clock to help Israel make sure it  has everything it needs to defend its people.   President Biden has had several calls with Prime Minister Netanyahu,  offering America's full support. He has also ordered the USS Ford's  carrier strike group to the eastern Mediterranean.   A warning that Hezbollah in Lebanon and the regime in Iran need to  hear loud and clear: Do not join this conflict. Don't even think about  it. The United States and our allies and partners will not tolerate  such actions.   Our Secretaries of State and of Defense are working nonstop to  coordinate the flow of security assistance to Israel, and planeloads of  U.S. defense items have already landed. And they have both been in the  region working with our partners to shore up support for Israel.   Congress also has to make sure we do everything we can to help come  together to help Israel. Bipartisan congressional support has always  been the bedrock of the U.S.-Israel relationship.   In the days since this attack, I have been talking with my colleagues  throughout the Senate and the House. I have had several conversations  with the Republican ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee, Senator Risch. I have let the administration know our  committee is prepared to work quietly and quickly in a bipartisan  manner to support Israel. That is why, earlier today, I introduced,  along with Senator Risch and more than 91 cosponsors, a bipartisan  resolution that sends a clear message that America stands with Israel-- always has, always will.   And over the course of the next days and weeks and months, I will be  leading my colleagues to make sure Israel gets everything it needs to  defend itself and its people. That means replenishing Israel's air  defenses so that they have what they need to repel the rocket attacks.  That means authorizing supplemental money for Israel's defense as it  navigates the aftermath of this attack. And, as the chair of the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee, that means getting the President's nominee  for Ambassador to Israel, Jacob Lew, confirmed and in his post as soon  as possible. We need a confirmed Ambassador in Israel to assist in  these efforts.   We also need to be pushing back against the narrative that Hamas is  trying to spread across the global community, the idea that there is  some equivalency between Israel's security operations and Hamas's  terror attacks. There is no equivalency here. This is about Israel's  right to defend itself against a designated terrorist organization. It  is about freeing abducted citizens--women, children, old people--who  have been held hostage.   Now, I am concerned about the safety and welfare of the Palestinians,  because Hamas does not care one bit about the safety and welfare of  millions of Palestinians, their lives, and their humanity. During their  terror attack on Israel, Hamas also killed Arabs, including a heroic  ambulance driver who went to help the wounded people at the music  festival, because that is what decent human beings do. They help in  times of need. Hamas has made them pay with their lives. So most  Palestinians want no part of what Hamas is doing, and I believe we must  find a way to support safe passage for those residents of Gaza who are  trying to get out.    We also need to make sure that innocent people stuck there get the  food and water and medical care that they so desperately desire. The  best thing we can do for Palestinians in Gaza is to make sure Hamas can  never do this again.   Finally, as we look to the future, we must not allow this conflict to  derail the normalization process that has been in the works between  Israel and Saudi Arabia. This would be an absolute game changer, and  Hamas knows that.   Agreeing to normal relations is the stepping stone to peace and  prosperity for Israel and for the entire region, including for the  Palestinian people. A stable and prosperous Middle East that includes a  stable and prosperous Palestinian state is one of the best ways to  undercut Iran's resistance ideology and Hamas's goal of destroying  Israel.   They don't want a Palestinian state at peace with Israel and  accountable to the Palestinian people. We cannot let terrorists win. We  cannot let them win, and I know that we will not, thanks to the  resilience of the Israeli people.   Early on the morning of October 7, an Israeli journalist who lives  near the border of Gaza heard mortar rockets flying overhead. He rushed  with his wife into a safe room in his home with his 3-year-old and 1- year-old daughters. When he knew Hamas had infiltrated their kibbutz,  he thought:         We're going to die here.    He called his father, who lived in Tel Aviv. His father told him:         You have to be quiet. You have to be locked.    His father, a retired general in his sixties, was going to get in his  car and come rescue them. He told his son:         Nobody, nobody can stop me.    Over the next 10 hours, the grandfather fought his way south. He got  to the door of his son's house and then found the dead bodies of  terrorists outside. He called out to his son to open the safe room  door. From inside, one of the girls recognized his voice and shouted:         Grandfather is here. Grandfather is here.    That is when they knew they were safe.   That is the kind of courage Israelis have. That is the kind of  bravery that they see in Israel through this terrible tragedy. And we  must not rest until our committee, our Congress, and our Nation has  done everything we can to support Israel in this time of need.   So to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle here in the Senate,  let's work together to support Israel.   And to those who committed these atrocities, we will hold you  accountable for these crimes against humanity, no matter how long it  takes.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.
