 Madam Speaker, all children are created by  God at conception with a purpose. We must continue our work to end the  scourge of abortion in America without exception.   The strides that we have made for the pro-life movement over recent  years are incredible, and I am honored to be part of a group of such  hardworking pro-life legislators.   Our daughters are part of the pro-life generation, full of students  and young women that want to protect life in the womb. They have seen  their siblings in sonograms. They have seen the pictures, and when they  are told it is a glob of tissue, they know better.   I introduced the Protecting Life on College Campuses Act, which would  prohibit any Federal funds from going to a college or university which  is supplying dangerous chemical abortion pills.   This past Christmas, the week before Christmas, while no one was  looking, the Biden administration and Governor Pritzker advanced very  radical abortion policies, which are deeply unpopular with the American  people. They want to remove parental involvement every step of the way  for minors receiving an abortion because they are not pro-choice; they  are pro-abortion.   Standing strong in this fight, we are participating in what could be  potentially the last March for Life under Roe, and I could not be more  thrilled.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the  life and service of Wayne County Deputy Sheriff Sean Riley.   Our communities in Illinois and across the Nation continue to mourn  the loss of our fallen hero.   Deputy Riley was called home to be with the Lord on December 29,  2021. He was on duty, responding to assist a motorist when he was shot  and killed.   May God continue to comfort this family as they grieve this awful  loss. Wayne County Sheriff Otey said, ``The only thing Sean cared about  more than being a deputy was his family.''   Please join me in prayer for the family of Deputy Sean Riley, the  Wayne County Sheriff's Department, and our community in Illinois.   Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the sons of  God.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the Congressman for  hosting this Special Order.   Madam Speaker, Americans have experienced whiplash this past year as  the Biden administration has spun us from the America first agenda to  America last.   We watched in horror as the Taliban released thousands of al-Qaida,  ISIS, and Taliban prisoners from the prison at Bagram Air Base. Our  servicemembers bravely sacrificed to capture those terrorists, and the  Biden administration allowed them to be released. One of the ISIS-K  prisoners led the bombing that killed our 13 servicemembers.   Biden's failure in Afghanistan led to the surrender of tens of  billions of dollars in U.S. military equipment to the Taliban. Military  equipment paid for by U.S. taxpayers will now be used against America  because of President Biden. As Afghanistan fell, President Biden  disappeared, first to Camp David and then to Delaware.   His Cabinet refused to brief the American people directly and instead  sent spokesmen. Additionally, the Defense Secretary refused to testify  before Congress.   The Biden administration then flew an estimated 78,000 Afghan  nationals to American soil and then lied to the American people about  the vetting process they were using to ensure that no ISIS, al-Qaida,  or Taliban terrorists were brought to our shores.   To this day, no one in the Biden administration has been held  responsible for the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan or for the  lies that were told to the American people, and no one has been fired  or resigned.   Madam Speaker, who will be fired?   Who is resigning?   The American people deserve accountability. China, our enemy, has  watched all of this unfold; and, sadly, our children and grandchildren  will pay the price of Biden's incompetence.
