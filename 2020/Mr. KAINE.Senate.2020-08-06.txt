 Mr. President, today I am introducing a bipartisan bill to  [[Page S5275]]  make the process of siting natural gas pipelines fairer, more  transparent, and more responsive to landowner concerns.   For some time now, I have been listening to Virginians with  passionate views on the process involved in permitting the Atlantic  Coast and Mountain Valley Pipelines. For various reasons, many oppose  one or both of these projects while others support these projects. The  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, is tasked with analyzing  all the issues--purpose and need for a project, impacts on people  1iving on the route, potential risks to the environment or property-- and deciding what course best serves the public interest.   From listening to all sides, I have concluded that while reasonable  people may reach different conclusions, FERC's public input process is  flawed and could be better. Accordingly, this legislation proposes  several steps to address several shortcomings, all of which were  originally brought to my attention by Virginia constituents. For  instance, this bill requires programmatic analysis of pipelines  proposed around the same time and in the same geographic vicinity so  that the full impacts of multiple projects can be analyzed. It requires  a greater number of public comment meetings so that citizens are not  required to commute long distances to meetings at which they must speed  through just a few minutes of remarks on these complex topics. It  ensures that affected landowners are given proper notice and  compensation. It guarantees that landowner complaints will be heard  before construction commences. And it clarifies the circumstances under  which eminent domain should and should not be used.   I am pleased to be joined by my colleague Senator Mark Warner on this  bill, which is an update to a version we introduced in the 115th  Congress. The public deserves reasonable opportunity to weigh in on  energy infrastructure projects, and we are heeding calls by our  constituents to make this process fairer and more transparent without  mandating a particular outcome.   I encourage the Senate to consider this legislation, not to pave the  way for pipelines nor to throw up insurmountable roadblocks to them,  but to give the public greater certainty that the federal government's  infrastructure decisions are fair and transparent.                                  ______                                         By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Peters):   S. 4504. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to  expand the availability of medical nutrition therapy services under the  Medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.
