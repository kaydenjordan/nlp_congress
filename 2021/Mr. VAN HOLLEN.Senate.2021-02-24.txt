 Mr. President, now is the time to take substantive  action to transition to renewable resources, combat climate change, and  build a brighter future for Americans. To help manage that transition,  President Biden has nominated Jennifer Granholm to be the Secretary of  Energy.   As the first female Governor and first female attorney general in  Michigan history, Granholm oversaw the State's response to the great  recession and worked closely with the Obama administration to save the  Nation's auto industry and 1 million jobs. Granholm embraced innovative  ideas to electrify the auto industry, stimulate State-wide job growth,  and build the State's clean energy sector. She founded the American  Jobs Project to promote technological advancements and clean energy  policies to spark job creation and continues to push for clean energy  policy nationwide.   Additionally, Granholm backed tax credits and incentives for wind and  solar and signed legislation requiring Michigan to get 10 percent of  its energy from renewable sources. She is eminently qualified to  spearhead research and development and set policies to reach President  Biden's stated goal of getting to a 100-percent carbon pollution-free  power sector by 2035.   Granholm received bipartisan support from the Senate Energy and  Natural Resources Committee, and we should follow their lead. She knows  that clean energy is the key to creating millions of good jobs and  mitigating climate change and is dedicated to advancing our Nation's  nuclear security. For these reasons, I support Jennifer Granholm's  nomination for Secretary of Energy.                            ____________________
