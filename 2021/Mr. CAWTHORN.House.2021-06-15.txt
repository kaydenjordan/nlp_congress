 Mr. Speaker, for over 200 years, American citizens have  chosen dangerous freedom over peaceful subjugation. For the past few  decades, the American patriot has watched in horror as the Federal  Government has opened the shackles of safety and firmly clamped them  around the Second Amendment.   As the Second Amendment restrictions have risen, so has violent  crime. Washington wonders in one moment why violent crime is rising,  and then takes away the right of Americans to defend themselves in the  next.   Mr. Speaker, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives  exists for the sole purpose of regulating and keeping me from three of  the things I hold most dear as an American.   This administration's proposed head of the ATF thinks that the Second  Amendment was created for hunting and sporting. David Chipman could not  be more wrong. The purpose of the Second Amendment was and is to hold  back a tyrannical government. Chipman's tyrannical reading of the  Constitution would turn millions of Americans into criminals overnight.   I am here to tell you today that these Americans who seek to defend  their right to bear arms are not the criminals our Nation ought to be  concerned by.   Mr. Speaker, the most dangerous threat to our safety and security  does not arise from Americans wanting to protect themselves. No, it  comes from men and women like those in this Chamber who would choose  the quiet of servitude over the tumult of liberty.   The Second Amendment was designed to protect the First, and this  Nation will not give up its liberties so easily.                            ____________________
