 Mr. Speaker, I sadly rise today to pay tribute to  Judge Bruce Mosier, who lost his life yesterday; to his lovely and  beautiful wife, Diane; beautiful daughter; and extended family.   The whole of Harris County in Texas loved and respected Judge Bruce  Mosier. Oh, he was a strong and vibrant Democrat, but he was a man  that, whenever you called upon him, he would serve. He loved the law,  practiced, and continued to represent individuals, many of whom could  not help themselves. And, of course, he stood by his wife's side,  championing every effort she made to empower people to vote. He was a  stalwart in the last Presidential election. He continued to encourage  and support all of us to do what is right and to ensure the rights of  all people to vote.   Judge Bruce Mosier served his neighborhood, served his county, served  his State, and served this Nation. I will miss Judge Mosier. I will  miss his friendly smile and his kindness, his willingness to help those  who were just starting in their political or legal career, his  willingness to lift up this country and to be the kind of American that  always had an open mind to anyone, no matter how different they might  be.   So today, my dear friend, Judge Bruce Mosier, may you rest in peace.   Diane, we will continue to love you and honor his legacy, work with  you to continue his dreams and aspirations, and encourage those in this  Nation, our county, and our State to be participatory participants in  the wonderment of democracy in this Nation that is, that was, Judge  Bruce Mosier.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 321,  the INSPIRE Women, Act.   I support this legislation because Article 1 Section 8 of the United  States Constitution states our duty ``To promote the Progress of  Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and  Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and  Discoveries . . .''   This includes the education of our next generation of women  considering participation in the fields of science, technology,  engineering, and mathematics and to pursue careers in aerospace.   Statistics show that women remain underrepresented in the science and  engineering workforce, although to a lesser degree than in the past,  with the greatest disparities occurring in engineering, computer  science, and the physical sciences (NSF, Science & Engineering  Indicators, 2014).   1. Female scientists and engineers are concentrated in different  occupations than are men, with relatively high shares of women in the  social sciences (58 percent)   2. biological and medical sciences (48 percent)   3. relatively low shares in engineering (13 percent)   4. computer and mathematical sciences (25 percent) (NSF, Science &  Engineering Indicators, 2014).   Women make up 47 percent of the total U.S. workforce, but are much  less represented in particular science and engineering occupations  (U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Women in the  Labor Force: A Databook, 2014):   1. 39 percent of chemists and material scientists are women;   2. 27.9 percent of environmental scientists and geoscientists are  women;   3. 15.6 percent of chemical engineers are women;   4. 12.1 percent of civil engineers are women;   5. 8.3 percent of electrical and electronics engineers are women;  [[Page H273]]    6. 17.2 percent of industrial engineers are women; and   7. 7.2 percent of mechanical engineers are women.   These statistics show that measures need to be taken in order to  promote women participation in the fields of science, technology,  engineering, and mathematics and to pursue careers in aerospace.   H.R. 321 will support NASA GIRLS and NASA BOYS, virtual mentoring  programs using commercially available video chat programs, to pair  National Aeronautics and Space Administration mentors with young  students anywhere in the country.   NASA GIRLS and NASA BOYS give young students the opportunity to  interact and learn from real engineers, scientists, and technologists.   H.R. 321 will also support the ``Aspire to Inspire'' Program (A2I),  which engages young girls to present science, technology, engineering,  and mathematics (STEM) career opportunities through the real lives and  jobs of early career women at NASA.   H.R. 321 also promotes the Summer Institute in Science, Technology,  Engineering, and Research (SISTER) program at the Goddard Space Flight  Center designed to increase awareness of, and provide an opportunity  for, female middle school students to be exposed to and explore  nontraditional career fields with Goddard Space Flight Center women  engineers, mathematicians, scientists, technicians, and researchers.   Let me close by urging all Members to join me in voting to pass H.R.  321.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 255 the  ``Promoting Women in Entrepreneurship Act.''  [[Page H275]]    As a Senior Member on the House Committee on Homeland Security who  sits on the Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection,  and Security Technologies, I know well of the need to encourage and  train women to thrive in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and  Mathematics (STEM) fields.   Promoting diversity in the STEM professions is more than just an  idea; it requires an understanding that there is a need to have a  process that will ensure the inclusion of all minorities and women in  all areas of American life.   Studies have found that women make up almost 50 percent of the  workforce.   Studies note that 23 percent of STEM workers are women; however,  women make up 48 percent of workers in all occupations.   Only 26 percent of women who do attain degrees in STEM fields work in  STEM jobs.   According to the most recent available data women are less likely to  focus on the STEM disciplines in undergraduate and graduate studies.   In 1991, women received 29.6 percent of computer science B.A.'s,  compared to just 18.2 percent in 2010.   Jobs in computer systems design and related services, a field  dependent upon high-level math and problem-solving skills, are  projected to grow 45 percent between 2008 and 2018.   There are approximately 6 million women and minority owned businesses  in the United States, representing a significant aspect of our economy.   My home city of Houston, Texas, the energy capital of the world,  knows the importance of professionals in the STEM industries.   It has been reported that the highest-paying STEM occupations are  petroleum engineers with an annual salary of $147,520, architectural  and engineering managers with an annual salary of $138,720, natural  sciences managers with an annual salary of $136,450, computer and  information systems managers with an annual salary of $136,280, and  physicists with a reported annual salary of $117,300.   There is an increasing demand for individuals with STEM degrees to  extend their focus beyond the laboratory so they can be leaders in  discovery and commercialization.   Women deserve a fair shot in the STEM programs in this nation.   In addition, I believe that work needs to be done to modernize key  contracting developmental programs designed to increase opportunities  for women, minorities and low-income individuals who pursue STEM  degrees and STEM job training.   I support programs at the National Science Foundation that have  worked to reduce the current barriers and ensure women have the support  they need in the STEM fields.   Mr. Speaker, we should encourage women to pursue degrees and careers  in the STEM fields so we can continue to compete in the global economy.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Marchant). The question is on the motion  offered by the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Comstock) that the House  suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 255.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 239, the  ``Support for Rapid Innovation Act of 2017,'' which amends the Homeland  Security Act of 2002 to provide for improved innovative research and  development.   I support this bill because it would extend the Department of  Homeland Security secretary's pilot program for research and  development projects and prototype projects through 2020.   This bill would require the secretary to report annually to the House  Homeland Security and Science committees and the Senate Homeland  Security Committee on the dynamics of the projects undertaken.   Specifically, H.R. 239 would amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002  to include fundamental improvements to facilitate information,  analytics, and methodologies related to cybersecurity risks and  incidents, consistent with the current law.   In particular, it adds a new section to the Homeland Security Act,  directing the Department of Homeland Security to support--whether  within itself, other agencies, or in academia and private industry--the  research and development of cybersecurity-related technologies.   As a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee and Ranking  Member of the Judiciary Committee and Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism,  Homeland Security, and Investigations, I support this bill as it  directs the Under Secretary for Science and Technology to bolster  research and development, along with the testing and evaluation of  cybersecurity technology to improve the sharing of information,  analysis, and methodologies related to cybersecurity risks and  incidents.   The Rapid Innovation Act is a smart bill that will enable the  Department of Homeland Security to establish and improve technologies  for detecting attacks or intrusions.   The ``Support for Rapid Innovation Act of 2017'' will equip the  Department of Homeland Security with vital tools and resources to  prevent and remove attacks and threats implemented by those who target  our nation.   Mr. Speaker, we face growing cybersecurity threats, which demands  that we increase research and development, along with the testing and  evaluation of cybersecurity technology to expand the sharing of  information, analysis, and methodologies related to cybersecurity risks  and incidents.   This is a comprehensive bill that will help protect all Americans in  every corner of this nation.   I urge all Members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 239.    Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland  Security Committee, I rise in support of H.R. 240, the ``Leveraging  Emerging Technologies Act of 2017,'' which requires the Secretary of  Homeland Security to engage with innovative and emerging technology  developers, including technology-based small businesses and startup  ventures that can help tackle the rapidly expanding list of homeland  security technology needs.   H.R. 240 helps to protect America's computer and communications  networks, which security experts believe represent the nation's most  critical national security challenge, including Internet functions and  connected critical infrastructure such as air traffic control, the U.S.  electrical grid, and nuclear power plants.   H.R. 240 authorizes DHS to establish personnel and office space in  diverse geographic areas around the United States that have high  concentrations of technology developers and firms.   The bill also directs DHS, within 6 months, to develop and submit to  Congress a Department-wide strategy to engage with innovative and  emerging technology companies.   Importantly, the bill specifically requires the Secretary to include  in that strategy ways to effectively integrate technology-based small  businesses and startup ventures.   Importantly, the bill also requires the DHS Secretary to coordinate  with those in the venture capital industry to assist in the development  of technologies that are ready for commercialization and use in the  Homeland Security Enterprise.   Since its founding, the Department of Homeland Security has overcome  many challenges as an organization but much more  [[Page H279]]  progress must be made regarding effective inter-operable communication  between the federal, state, and local agencies.   Although not a panacea, H.R. 240 is a step in the right direction  because it will help improve DHS' overall functions so that it can more  effectively protect our people.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important  legislation.
