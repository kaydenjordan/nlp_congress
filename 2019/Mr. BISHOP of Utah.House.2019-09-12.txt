 Mr. Chair, I was hoping the gentleman would  insert me as well.   Mr. Chair, I appreciate the opportunity of being here. We are here  today on day two of the Democrat week of energy proposals. And once  again, we will quote Earl Weaver when he went out to the umpire and  said:         Is this as good as it gets, or are you going to get better?    I will say the same thing on this bill as we did yesterday. Is this  as good as it gets, or are you actually going to get better?   This is the same concept we had with the first bill that we did. We  voted second, but we actually discussed it as the first bill yesterday,  in which we did things that are basically illogical, not for science  reasons. Science was essentially taken out and shoved into a trash can,  but, actually, we did it for political reasons.   It is signified by the amendments that the Rules Committee,  unfortunately, made in order in which we made amendments in order to  have all sorts of studies on the issue.   In the real world, you would try and do a study, come up with  results, and then come up with the policy. That is not what we did  yesterday. We decided on a policy, and then we are going to institute a  lot of non-comprehensive, skewed studies to try and see if we can come  up with arguments in favor of the policy we already did. It is  backwards.   It is okay to do it. You have the votes to do it. That is fine. Just  don't have the audacity to say that this administration doesn't trust  science or that we don't trust science over here, when you also put an  amendment in there to deny any kind of seismic research, which would  give you the data we haven't had since the 1980s, but only some of that  seismic data. It is a skewed approach to it.   But the most significant issue is the one that Mr. Huffman has raised  several times today in which he was right--slightly off center with  it--but he is actually right.   Yesterday, many of the arguments that were made were that the States  and State populations in these areas want a kind of moratorium on  drilling in their areas. I get that. Listening to those people is a  good thing to do. But where the gentleman got it wrong, though, is that  they weren't talking to the States who were wanting that. We are not  talking about the areas within their States or even the water that  abuts their States as legally theirs. They wanted the ability to  control what happens on Federal waters, which is not part of the  State's concept.   Once again, if you would allow me the ability to have control of what  happens on Federal lands in my State, in the State, we might have an  apples-and-apples situation, but that ain't it.   There is also the concept that there was not consultation with Native  Americans who live in Alaska and that, once again, is actually  inaccurate. There have been consultations going on since the gentleman  was playing volleyball in college. And they will continue to go on from  that side.   In fact, that is where the difference comes. The people in Alaska who  live there don't want this bill. And, once again, they don't want it  because it is impacting their State, their property, their land, which  is not what was happening yesterday, where States were trying to impact  what was happening on Federal water.   It was sad that when we had the hearing on this bill, the Democrats  did not invite those residents of this area to testify. We did. And  when they came in March to testify, the Tribal leaders from the only  village in this coastal plain, the one that is closest to this area,  simply said they were against this bill.   Their exact words were: ``The Arctic Inupiat will not become  conservation refugees. We do not approve of efforts to turn our  homeland into one giant national park, which literally guarantees us a  fate with no economy, no jobs, reduced subsistence, and no hope for the  future of our people.''                                time  1015    That is what they want in their area. When some of the other speakers  said there is no consultation, that is not true.   Mr. Young is saying exactly what the constituents want in their area.  Even though this land is controlled by Fish and Wildlife, the mineral  resources are not Federal. These people who are testifying that they  don't want this bill own a majority or a significant portion of those  mineral rights. It is their mineral rights, and they should have the  ability to say what they want, too. They have spoken clearly year after  year.   That is where the difference of yesterday and today is significant,  and the gentleman is glossing over that. That is significant.   These people need to have the ability to control their own destiny.  They are not trying to control something that is not within the State.  It is their resources. It is their area.   We have had this debate before. We had it when I first came here. It  is going to continue on ad nauseam.   The problem is this is not a good energy position for the future.  What we produced yesterday as Republicans is a program that increases  jobs, increases the economy, and makes this country stronger. The stuff  the Democrats are putting on in their energy week is disjointed,  discombobulated, and doesn't actually help anyone at all.   Once again, Mr. Chair, I agree with Mr. Young. Trust his people on  what they want to do with their resources--not Federal--their  resources.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
