 Mr. Speaker, I will take some time this morning to  recognize three heroes of Guam who are celebrating milestone birthdays  this month.   First, there is Mr. Troy Moylan, who is an icon within the business  community of Guam. A proud son, husband, father, brother, and family  man, Troy continues a tradition of the insurance industry, which is  synonymous with the Moylan name in Guam and within the Pacific region.   A healthcare czar who has advanced the medical insurance industry in  Guam, ensuring greater care for women and children and expanding  services to regions with indigent communities, he has helped grow  Guam's economy by creating jobs and increasing investments. His  generosity to the people of Guam has been evident in many great causes  and organizations.   Troy is a great conservative, a decent man, and a proud fan of the  Pittsburgh Steelers.

Just to place it on the record, the term ``dinga''' refers to  twins. These two heroes have served the people of Guam in the  capacities of firefighter and customs officer.   Daniel is a longtime firefighter in Guam and has placed himself in  harm's way to protect his community. From battling wildfires to  reassuring individuals in unsafe conditions to delivering kids in  ambulances as an EMT, this hero is an icon in Guam.   Daniel is famous for ensuring that his brothers and sisters in the  fire stations are well fed, as he is a renowned cook. Daniel is also a  decent man, a proud son, a good sibling, and certainly a favorite uncle  to numerous nieces and nephews. He is also a fan of the Pittsburgh  Steelers.   His brother David has been protecting Guam's community and our  borders as a lieutenant in the Guam Customs and Quarantine Agency for  many years. His efforts have resulted in the interception of drugs and  other contraband entering the island, and he has worked diligently to  protect Guam's economy through the seizure of counterfeit goods.   David has placed himself in harm's way too many times, but he has  always stated that it was for the betterment of his community and his  island. He is also a decent man, a proud son, a good sibling, and  another favorite uncle. This fan of the Dallas Cowboys continues to  strive to protect our island.   From these historic and sacred Halls of democracy, and on behalf of a  thankful Nation and the island of Guam, I thank Troy, Daniel, and David  for their service to our community and wish them a happy birthday.                            ____________________
