 Mr. Speaker, tonight, as we have every other week for  the last few months, I want to talk about the Mueller investigation and  the kinds of results that are being developed by the FBI, by the  Department of Justice, on a lot of very serious topics. The main topic  is the Russians interfering with our elections, particularly the 2016  election.   That kind of interference goes to the heart of our Nation. It goes to  the heart of our freedom. It goes to the heart of our independence. It  goes to the heart of this country's sovereignty and to be able to make  decisions without interference by nations other than the United States  of America, other than us as citizens of the United States of America.  I think we need to step back and think about this a little bit, because  it is clear now.   Just today, the Senate Republican chair of the Intelligence Committee  said there is no doubt that Russia undertook an unprecedented effort to  interfere with our 2016 elections. He says he looks forward to  completing the committee's inquiry and issuing findings and  recommendations to Americans.   The vice chairman, Senator Warner from Virginia, says:         After a thorough review, our staff concluded that the       intelligence community's conclusions were accurate and on       point. The Russian effort was extensive, sophisticated, and       ordered by President Putin himself for the purpose of helping       Donald Trump and hurting Hillary Clinton.    In order to protect our democracy from future threats, we must  understand what happened in 2016.   So, a year ago, Special Counsel Robert Mueller was appointed to look  into this affair and what exactly happened and to bring those to  justice who broke our laws, who interfered with our sovereignty and our  freedoms.   But all along the way, the White House has objected, has tried to  describe it as a witch hunt, as a hoax, as nothing but a charade, when,  in fact, in this 1-year period there have been five guilty pleas and 22  indictments.   We kind have got to go back to the beginning, Mr. Speaker.  [[Page H4130]]    A year ago, Democrats were asking the President to turn over his tax  returns, which all Presidents have done and which candidates do. The  President refused and continues to refuse to this day to turn over his  tax returns.   So the question is: What is in there to hide? What is the big deal?  What is he afraid of us seeing in those tax returns?   Today, it came out in the news that the financial disclosure  statement shows a payment to Michael Cohen, his attorney, that he said  he never made.   We have got to get to the bottom of these numbers, to the bottom of  this Russian interference. Mr. Mueller and the FBI need to conclude  their investigation without any interference, without any obstruction.  For all of us as Americans, this applies to the very core of what a  democracy is, and that is free, fair, and unimpeded elections.   So there are three key questions that we keep asking. We ask our  friends on the Republican side, particularly Speaker Ryan and Senate  Majority Leader McConnell: Let's move forward with investigations here  in this Congress. Why not?   Let's find out what is really going on. Let's protect this  investigation so that threats by the White House to fire Mr. Mueller,  to fire Rod Rosenstein from the Department of Justice--they did fire  individuals out of the FBI--let's let these detectives and these law  enforcement officials finish their job. But the questions are: What are  they hiding? What are they afraid that people will see? And why not let  the detectives and the law enforcement officers finish their job?   Let's play this out and see exactly what the facts are so we all know  what happened and how we can stop it from happening again to make sure  we have free and fair elections.   I have been able to ask these questions and participate in these  Special Order hours with several of my friends. One of those who has  taken a keen interest in protecting this investigation and making sure  that the facts do come to light has been my friend, Jared Huffman from  northern California.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Huffman),  for some of his thoughts as to where we are, because we have had many,  many changes in terms of the lawyers who were representing either the  White House or the President personally. They are gone. We have got new  lawyers. Former District Attorney and Mayor Giuliani is now involved.  Other people. The President's personal lawyer, Mr. Cohen, is now out  and under investigation himself. There seems to be something happening  pretty much every day. I would like to get my friend's thoughts about  it.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from northern  California, and his points are really well taken. This investigation,  rather than just sort of pushing some paper around, we have had other  special counsel appointed from time to time and just in this--some of  them take years. Whether it was the Contra affair, Watergate, or  whatever, it takes years and years.   Here, really in 1 year, we have had 13 Russian either agencies or  corporations and individuals indicted. We have had at least six or  seven Americans indicted in this whole process.   Recently, I think within the last few days, or maybe it was even  today, Paul Manafort, chairman of the Trump campaign, objected to the  indictment that he found himself under. He went to court and said that  Mueller had exceeded his authority by bringing the indictment. The  judge said: No, that indictment stands.   There has been a lot of smoke. We know that there is some fire  creating that smoke. We have got to find that. We have got to find  precisely what happened.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney),  who has joined us and has got some thoughts about this that he will  share.    Mr. Speaker, my friend from Connecticut has reminded  me of something. And I think something that has really infuriated me is  the President's attacks on the FBI, the Federal Bureau of  Investigation, our chief and top law enforcement agency in this  country.   Is it perfect? Absolutely not. But are they doing their job to the  best of their ability to protect Americans, to protect America?  Absolutely. And for the President to sort of just continue to chip away  and to excoriate the FBI because it is undertaking an investigation  that may implicate him in breaking laws of the United States of  America, I think, is something that we haven't seen. This investigation  needs to continue to do its work, to talk to witnesses, to determine  what has occurred here.   The Senate Judiciary today, or within the last day or two, released  thousands of pages of testimony and information. One of the places that  it talked about was what happened at a meeting--I think it was at the  Trump Tower--in June of 2016, so 5 months, 6 months before the  election, between a Russian attorney. I think another Russian was  there; Paul Manafort, the chairman of the campaign; Jared Kushner, son- in-law of the President; and Donald Trump, Jr., his son.   There is a lot of concern about what actually occurred in that  particular meeting. There is a lot of material here that is very, very  troubling.   I know my friend from California has thought about this. He has  thoughts about Mr. Giuliani saying that Donald Trump may take the Fifth  Amendment, which I think came out of nowhere. But why would he want to  take the Fifth Amendment?   Again, the question is: What is he hiding? What is he afraid of?  Let's just let law enforcement complete its work.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back to the gentleman from California.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman talked about quid pro quo,  and the thing that I am worried about, I serve on the Terrorism and  Illicit Finance Subcommittee of the Committee on Financial Services,  where we deal a lot with sanctions: sanctions against North Korea,  sanctions against Iran, sanctions against China, sanctions against  Russia. With Russia having gone into Ukraine, Russia having gone into  Crimea, and then Russia having interfered with our elections, a lot of  sanctions are out there, but this administration seems to be using kid  gloves in applying them.    Yes, I yield to the gentleman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I know my friend from Connecticut has  some other thoughts, so I yield to him.    Mr. Speaker, we will wrap up this portion of our  Special Orders because I know we have another subject that Ms. Pingree  and Mr. Blumenauer and Mr. Tonko would like to address.   Mr. Speaker, the seriousness of this subject can't be overstated: the  impact on elections; the trust in our system of elections; the trust in  our law enforcement; the trust in our courts; the trust, which is  attacked by this President and too many others, of our institutions of  the press, whether it is The Washington Post or The New York Times or  somebody investigating.   And it goes to trust of this Nation and what we have formed. And when  you have got outside influences like Russia sticking their nose in our  business and trying to put their thumb on the scale as to who should  run this Nation, I can't think of a higher crime.                                time  2000    And we know the National Security Advisor for Donald Trump, Michael  Flynn, indicted; Rick Gates, campaign advisor for the Trump campaign;  George Papadopoulos, foreign affairs advisor for Trump campaign;  Richard Pinedo; Alexander van der Zwaan--all indicted, sentenced, or at  least pled guilty. Indicted still: the campaign chairman, Paul  Manafort; 13 Russian nationals; and 3 Russian entities.   This investigation needs to get to the bottom of all of this. We have  got to try to figure out: Is there anything being hidden? Is there  anything that we, as Americans, should know about this interference  that we don't know today? And our law enforcement officers, from Robert  Mueller to the FBI to the cop on the beat, need to be allowed to finish  this investigation.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend from California and my friend  from Connecticut. I yield to my friend from Maine (Ms. Pingree) because  she seems to be ready to go here. I don't know about her two  colleagues, the one from New York and the one from Oregon, because they  seem to be kind of getting ready but not nearly as ready as my friend,  Congresswoman Pingree.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend from Maine.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Maine. The farm  bill--and agriculture and the environment--is always something she  cares a lot about, whether it is conversations about milk or eggs or  local control, which is really sort of at the heart of her concern  about this bill, that, you know, Maine, and its local governments and  the State as a whole, cares about its environment and it cares about  its agriculture. And she, as a Representative, makes that clear to the  rest of us how important it is to her State.   So I thank the gentlewoman from Maine, and I now yield to my friend  from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oregon for  those comments, who, as always, is very knowledgeable and passionate  about the things that really matter to most Americans, and I thank him  for being such an advocate for the environment, always, every day.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis), my  friend. I know Mr. Polis has some things he would like to add to this  conversation.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Colorado for  bringing up these important points, and I wish him well as he goes on  about a campaign for Governor in the State of Colorado.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko), my  friend, again, a tireless advocate for the environment. Obviously, New  York produces, especially in his part of the State, a lot of farms and  a lot of agriculture. This is a subject that he knows well.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from New York for  those comments. I can say, to those who are listening, that Mr. Tonko  serves on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee and speaks up  about the environment and about concerns about chemicals, the effects  on public health, the effects on the environment, and I thank him for  his advocacy.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Kind), my  friend, for his thoughts on this particular subject, a gentleman who is  an outdoorsman, and talks about the farms and the cheeses of Wisconsin.  He is here as a real advocate for his State. I am sorry that he has had  the Green Bay Packers and they have fallen on hard times.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Wisconsin for  those comments. He makes so many good points, and he does it in a way  that really is understandable by all of us.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer),  my friend, if he wishes, to close.  [[Page H4136]]                                     time  2030     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
