 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 205.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, H.R. 205, the Protecting and Securing Florida's  Coastline Act, would permanently protect the eastern Gulf of Mexico  from oil and gas drilling.   Nearly all of the eastern Gulf remains protected under a leasing  moratorium until 2022 under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of  2006. This bill would permanently extend that moratorium and, in doing  so, would safeguard Florida's marine resources, environment, and  coastal tourism economy.   Some of Florida's more valuable assets are tied to its beaches and  its coastal ecosystems. These drive a tourism economy in Florida that  brings in billions of dollars each year and supports over 1.4 million  jobs.   Over 2,000 Florida businesses, including restaurants, hotels, and  outfitters, have expressed their strong support for permanently  protecting the eastern Gulf because they know firsthand the economic  consequences of an offshore oil spill.   Following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster, Florida suffered a  $7.6 billion loss in tourism revenue, and bookings for hotels and for- hire fishing trips dropped significantly. Even for places that were  left unscathed, the perception of oil-covered shores was enough to  redirect vacationing tourists to other coastal States. That is why  voters in the Sunshine State, Democrats and Republicans alike, have  made clear time and time again that offshore drilling has no place near  Florida's shores.   The eastern Gulf of Mexico also has incredible value as a military  test and training range, and enactment of H.R. 205 is critical for  America's national security and military preparedness.   In 2015, the Department of Defense determined that offshore oil and  gas in the eastern Gulf of Mexico would jeopardize the ability of the  military to conduct operations in the region.   Even the Trump administration, which bends over backwards to support  the oil and gas industry, understands how deeply unpopular offshore  drilling is in Florida and has manipulated the offshore leasing process  for political reasons.   Five days after proposing to offer all of America's oceans to oil and  gas companies, former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke rushed down to  Tallahassee to meet with then-Florida Governor Rick Scott.  Understanding that Governor Scott was facing a tough Senate race but  could never oppose anything from the Trump administration, Secretary  Zinke tweeted that he was ``removing Florida from the draft offshore  plan'' at the Governor's behest.   However, Secretary Zinke was contradicted less than 2 weeks later  when a top Interior Department official stated that Florida was, in  fact, still under consideration for offshore leasing. Then, at one of  our hearings in the Natural Resources Committee, Secretary Zinke seemed  to say that Florida was both safe yet still being considered.   The problem for Secretary Zinke was that the oil and gas industry  really wants to drill in the eastern Gulf, and this administration  wants to do whatever this industry wants. But the people of Florida do  not want the industry near their shores, and this administration needs  Florida to vote for it next year.   So now the administration has paused the new leasing program because  they can't show their true intentions before the next election. With a  wink and a nod towards industry, the administration has paused their  plans for new leasing. But it is only a sham disguised to convince  Florida that it is safe, while also making it clear to the industry  that, if they get a second term, the eastern Gulf will be open for  drilling.   In May, I wrote to Interior Secretary Bernhardt requesting a copy of  the leasing program as it currently exists so we could settle the  debate over whether Florida was in or out. Unsurprisingly, Secretary  Bernhardt has failed to turn over that plan.   The fact is that Florida's beaches will not be safe from the threat  of offshore drilling until we have passed the two bills we are debating  today: this one to protect Florida's Gulf Coast and H.R. 1941 to  protect Florida's Atlantic Coast.   Florida voters should not have to worry over the next 16 months  whether drilling rigs will one day appear on the horizon. H.R. 205  provides Florida's Gulf Coast permanent protection from offshore oil  drilling and deserves this body's full support.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Rooney), the original sponsor of the legislation.    Madam Chairwoman, I yield such time as she may consume  to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Castor), an original cosponsor-- along with Mr. Rooney--of this legislation before us, H.R. 205.    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Gaetz).    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   For the record, this bill will not affect LWCF funds at all. All the  money for the fund comes from existing oil and gas activities in the  central and western Gulf of Mexico. The Land and Water Conservation  Fund is credited with the first $900 million in offshore revenues. Last  year, those revenues were $4.7 billion, and projections are that  existing activity in the Gulf of Mexico is enough to keep the fund  going for a long, long time.   We don't need to drill in the Atlantic or the Pacific or near Florida  to find more money. Revenues are not a problem. The real problem is  that only twice in the history of the fund has Congress appropriated  the full $900 million that it should get. In fact, over time, we have  collected $37.8 billion of revenue that should have been spent on LWCF,  but Congress has appropriated less than half, $18.4 billion. Revenue is  not the issue.   This permanent protection for Florida coastal areas is not going to  hurt the fund. It has been stated three times already by my friends on  the other side of the aisle, but that is completely false.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Chair, as a point of reference, the BP oil spill  cost the fishing industry at least, at the minimum, $94.7 million and,  at the maximum, $1.6 billion in 2010. I mention that because, you know,  oil spills are not necessarily good for fisheries in the long haul.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I thought I would close by talking a little bit about,  because it relates to the discussion that we are having today,  protecting these very valuable coastal areas in this country.   My Republican colleagues introduced the American Energy First Act  today, and, frankly, it is quite frightening. It is really the ``Earth  isn't burning fast enough'' legislation, as I like to call it.   America is already the number one producer of oil and gas in the  world.  [[Page H7630]]  This administration is lifting protections on hundreds of millions of  acres of public lands for even more drilling.   Our Republican colleagues feel that is not enough. It is never enough  for them. For them, President Trump's extreme antienvironment,  anticlimate agenda needs to be pushed even further. They are rolling  out a bill to give even more money away to their oil and gas polluter  friends.   This Republican bill that was introduced today by the minority would  force the Florida Gulf Coast for offshore oil and gas, let States  decide where energy development should happen on Federal public lands,  gut Federal regulation, shorten environmental review times, give vast  amounts of public money to four States in the Gulf of Mexico, and make  Americans pay if they wanted to object to a government decision.   Think about it. Right now, oil and gas companies get to nominate  public lands for leasing without paying a dime. If Republicans had  their way, oil and gas companies would keep the free ride, and anyone  who wants to protest a lease would have to pay a fee to challenge them.   These ideas are destructive, and they couldn't even pass in an all- Republican government. Nearly all of this legislation was introduced in  various forms by Republicans in the last Congress when they controlled  everything: the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the  Presidency. But the bills that were introduced today are so pro- polluter, so backwards-looking, they weren't able to pass them in the  House under Republican control.   If my House colleagues just can't or won't take climate change  seriously, then we shouldn't take this bill seriously at all. The  American people want us to act on climate. They reject the Trump  administration's pro-polluter agenda. That is why we are voting to  protect our coasts today, and that is why I urge my colleagues to vote  ``yes'' on H.R. 205.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from Florida for his  thoughtful and necessary amendment that will restore offshore drilling  regulations and that will reduce the risks the Gulf communities face  from offshore development.   I thank him for that, and I very much support the amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, first of all, let's start with the premise here. The  premise of protecting jobs for women and people of color is a laudable  one. But on the eastern coast, at this point, there are no jobs to lose  or protect because there are no jobs. If there was to be any activity,  it would be when the moratorium would be lifted in 2022.   The point of this amendment has nothing to do with the bill, and it  is simply an attempt to block protections for the eastern Gulf based on  a fake concern for jobs for women and people of color.   I recall the hearing we had yesterday about the Department of the  Interior's Bureau of Land Management reorganization and its transfer of  central activities to Grand Junction, Colorado. In that, the majority  asked the question: What about the retention of senior, female, and of- color staff in this move? How many are we going to lose? Do they need  to be protected?   At the hearing, the minority Members told us that was not an issue,  that we shouldn't worry about it, that nothing was going to be lost and  everything was going to be protected.                                time  1600    Here we have the issue being raised again, but from another  perspective. I believe that enacting this bill and protecting Florida's  shore from the dangers of offshore drilling will safeguard  [[Page H7633]]  jobs in coastal tourism, recreation industries, and many others that  are held by the people of Florida, including women and people of color.   For example, the Florida Gulf Coast Business Coalition is a diverse  coalition of businesses and industries committed to protecting  Florida's Gulf Coast, and they have offered strong support for the  underlying legislation.   The real threat to jobs and economic opportunity in Florida would be  failing to extend the existing moratorium. This is why elected  officials, including the entire Florida congressional delegation and  the Florida Governor, oppose drilling in the eastern Gulf and support  H.R. 205.   This is not a serious amendment and does nothing to protect jobs  belonging to women, to people of color, and, conversely, keeps the  Florida Gulf Coast at risk.   For these reasons, I urge opposition to the amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, again, the amendment is not necessary, and  it is an attempt to delay and to put further risk to the Florida Gulf  Coast, and I would urge its defeat.   More importantly, I think concrete, real policy initiatives to  enhance opportunities for women and people of color in this country are  something this Congress should undertake as a whole. But crocodile  tears on this particular piece of legislation and this amendment aren't  going to do it.   I urge opposition. I urge its defeat.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
