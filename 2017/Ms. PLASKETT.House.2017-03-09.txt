 Mr. Speaker, this is a very special day to many of us  Caribbean Americans as we pay tribute to the life of Christopher  Wallace, otherwise known as Biggie Smalls.       Livin' life without fear,      Putting five karats in my baby girl's ear,      Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool,      Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school,      Stereotypes of a black male,      Misunderstood,      And it's still all good,      And if you don't know, now you know.                            ____________________
