 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a great man, Deputy J.  Benezette from the Cass County Sheriff's Office who recently received  the Life Saving Award.   Deputy Benezette was on his way home from an extra duty assignment at  the sheriff's office and heard a dispatch call. An incident had  happened nearby, and he answered that call for service.   Deputy Benezette got on the scene, where two motor vehicles were  involved in an accident. One vehicle was completely overturned and had  water pouring into it. With two people trapped inside and one  struggling to keep her head above water, Deputy Benezette was able to  quickly rescue both of them, saving a life and preventing a drowning.   His actions show dedication to duty under the most extreme  circumstances, and he has been recognized with the Life Saving Award by  his department.   Deputy Benezette serves Cass County and our Fourth District  faithfully. He is a hero for our community and will be our guest at the  State of the Union Address next week.   Mr. Speaker, I thank him and every member of our law enforcement  community across America for the service they do for us.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, there seems to be a lot of confusion today,  a lot of bewilderment, a lot of dismay from my friends on the other  side of the aisle on exactly why we are here today.   I am here to tell you it is a shame we have to be here today, that we  have to publicly put everyone on record to denounce socialism. I rise  today in somber support of this resolution, a resolution to denounce  the evils, the horrors of socialism.   Mr. Speaker, this is a somber issue because our Nation was founded on  the principles of liberty and freedom, enshrined in our founding  documents as the thesis of our very Nation.   However, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle here have made  light of the horrors of socialism and at times have advocated for this  radical ideology to the point that the youth of our Nation have been  deceived.                                time  1300    They have begun falling away from the true ideals of the freedoms on  which our Nation was founded, that being liberty and democracy.   Let me clear up some of this confusion for our good friends: This  cannot happen. We can never let it happen again.   Socialism has created famine, mass murders, and the killing of over  100 million humans around the world.   Many of the worst crimes in history were committed by socialist  ideologues: Stalin, Mao Zedong, Castro, Kim Jong-un, and Maduro.   Yes, I am here today to tell you that we also condemn categorically  any form of socialism, including Vladimir Putin.   This history cannot be forgotten, as socialist regimes have  indefinitely led to the destruction of personal liberties and are still  a constant threat.   Future generations must be taught. They must understand the horrors  of socialism.   So, we stand here today. It is a shame we have to be here to do this,  to teach this lesson, to denounce the horrors of socialism, and to  protect the freedoms of our great Nation and take a stand for personal  liberty.   Our young people have been led astray. Our Nation has been blinded to  some degree, and it is time to lift the scales off those blind eyes. It  is time that every American take a stand.   It is time to tell the truth. The truth is the only thing that  matters, and the truth is that socialism is evil.
