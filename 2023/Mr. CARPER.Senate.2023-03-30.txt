 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I am standing next to a woman from New  Jersey who is our communications director and who handles Delaware and  somehow manages to handle New Jersey and raise a family at the same  time. She is amazing. We are delighted that we could have the two of  you on the floor at the same time. It is a wonderful coincidence.                          Fire Grants and Safety Act    Mr. President, I rise today to highlight something that I believe  unites all of us; that is, support for our local firefighters across  the country. I don't care if you are in New Jersey or Delaware or  Oregon or New Mexico. There is a great affection and appreciation for  our firefighters.   Our firefighters throughout America are everyday people who every day  do extraordinary things with their lives. They put their lives on the  line to protect us. They have to lay down their lives to save ours and  the lives of our families.   For that, we owe it to them to make sure that they are fully equipped  with the lifesaving protection, with the equipment, the education and  training they need to get their job done.   That is why I am very proud to colead the Fire Grants and Safety Act  with my colleagues on the Congressional Fire Services Caucus. And one  of them would be our chairman--that would be Gary Peters of Michigan;  Susan Collins of Maine, a longtime supporter of firefighters and a  leader in the Congressional Fire Services Caucus; and Lisa Murkowski,  also a leader in the Congressional Fire Services Caucus, from Alaska.  And I was pleased that the Committee on Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs, on which I am privileged to serve and used to be  chair, passed this important bill out of committee just earlier this  month.   The Fire Grants and Safety Act reauthorizes critical Federal programs  that support local fire departments; namely, among those, FEMA's  Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response, also known as the  SAFER Grant Program, and the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program.   These programs are not just incidental. They are vital. They are  critical. They are essential to local firefighting departments to help  recruit staff, to purchase lifesaving equipment like firetrucks and  protective gear, provide fire training and education to current  firefighters and also to new firefighters and improve medical services  to our communities.   In Delaware, our fire departments rely on these programs to protect  our community. In fact, in 2021, and, I think, in 2022, the SAFER  Program and the so-called AFG Program provided almost $3 million in  funding to Delaware fire departments. That may not sound like a lot of  money in New Jersey or California or some other places; $3 million is  real money in a State the size of Delaware, and it is put to very good  use every year.   We know these threats from fire are in our homes, but those threats  are in our businesses, and there are wildfires. We know they are not  going away. We know they are not going away.   In Alaska last year, 3 million acres burned in a wildfire--a  wildfire. Three million acres burned in one wildfire. That is nearly  half of the acreage burned in the entire United States of America. Just  think about that--one wildfire in Alaska. Just 3 weeks ago, I am told  high winds spread a fire in my home State of Delaware that engulfed  about a half dozen homes and left some 16 people homeless and caused  over $1 million in damage.   We have to make sure that our firefighters have what they need when  they wake up each morning to bravely respond to the calls that come  their way. Without action, authorization of both the SAFER and AFG  Programs would expire later this year.   As I said at the beginning of my remarks, support for our local  firefighters is an issue that brings us together. There are a lot of  issues that divide us, as the Presiding Officer knows. There are some  issues that unite us, and this is one of those issues.   The Senate voted yesterday to begin consideration of the Fire Grants  and Safety Act. That vote passed by 96 to 0. That doesn't happen every  day, as the Presiding Officer knows. Let me repeat that: 96 to 0.   And we were happy to see that kind of unanimity, and I think it bodes  well for when we return after the recess in the next week or two to  take up this legislation.   I look forward to the Senate coming back in 2 weeks. I look forward  to finishing the job that we have begun. And we look forward to  passing, again, this important legislation.   I strongly encourage our friends over in the House of Representatives  to do their part and to send the Fire Grants and Safety Act to the  President's desk. We owe that to our first responders.   Mr. President, with that, I thank you for a chance to speak on the  floor today. And I wish you and your family a safe recess and see you  in 2 weeks.   With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
