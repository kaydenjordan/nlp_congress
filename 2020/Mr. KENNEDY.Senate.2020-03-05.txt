 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I want to spend a few minutes talking  about a friend of mine from Louisiana who is a fine American and a fine  Louisianian, and he is retiring. His name is Ronnie Anderson.   I want to celebrate his 51 years of service. That number is correct.  I know some of our pages here can't imagine someone being in a single  job for 51 years, but Ronnie has served 51 years, and he has devoted  those years, in large part, in service to our State's Farm Bureau.   He has led the Louisiana Farm Bureau to greater influence, to growing  membership, and that is not a small feat, because America was born on a  farm. In some respects, Louisiana was born on a farm, and farming is,  as you well know, Madam President, a challenging yet very rewarding  vocation and profession.   For 31 of the last 31 elections, the Louisiana Farm Bureau members  have chosen Ronnie as their president. So he has won 31 elections in a  row by our farmers in Louisiana, which is almost as good as the  President's electoral record.   Farmers from East Carroll, in my State, to Beauregard Parishes and  elsewhere in between have come to trust Ronnie as someone who knows  them, who cares about them, who cares about their farms, and who was  willing to rack up 71,000 miles driving his truck across the State of  Louisiana in an effort to win their confidence, as Ronnie did  repeatedly.   Ronnie spent most of his 71 years on this Earth working alongside the  farmers whom he represents. He grew up caring for dairy cows in East  Feliciana Parish. In Louisiana, as you may know, we call our counties  parishes.   Along with Ronnie's wife, Vivian, Ronnie still produces horses, hay,  beef cattle, and timber. All the while he was doing this, he helped  widen the arms of the Louisiana Farm Bureau and double its membership  to nearly 150,000 women and men over the course of Ronnie's three  decades as the organization's president.   Louisiana is a very diverse agricultural State, where each region is  distinct, and Ronnie has represented every nook and every cranny of our  farming and ranching community.   I am not alone in standing in awe of Ronnie Anderson's service. I am  in awe, and I wish Ronnie and Vivian, in their next chapter, the chance  to enjoy life. I know they have both enjoyed the 51 years of service to  the Farm Bureau, but now will enjoy life in a different way.   I wanted to come here today and celebrate Ronnie's service and that  of Vivian's, his life partner, as well.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I have 6 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.
