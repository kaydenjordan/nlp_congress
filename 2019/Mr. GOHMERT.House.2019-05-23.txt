 Mr. Speaker, it is wonderful to hear the great tributes  to those who have served this country well, as we just heard. In fact,  we have so many people to whom we should be eternally grateful.   As Abraham Lincoln said, they gave their last full measure of  devotion for the freedom of this country, not for some wishy-washy  government in Washington, D.C., that can't figure out what it should do  or not do, but for the idea of freedom.   I heard more discussion again recently about the Revolution. I have  read a few new books I hadn't read this year about the Revolution, the  victory at Yorktown, and other aspects of the Revolution.   And, still, there are so many historians who wonder why there was  such a dramatic difference between the outcome of the United States  Revolution, 1775 to 1783, and the French Revolution which followed.   I think the historians have it right who have said that the key  difference, the reason the U.S. Revolution lasted and was unlike the  French, which resulted in so many heads being cut off and eventually  resulted in a monarchy again, the key difference was that the U.S.  Revolution was about liberty and freedom.    It wasn't about vengeance. They weren't out to cut off as many of the  British heads as possible. It was about liberty. Unfortunately, too  many in the French Revolution, not all, but too many in the French  Revolution were about revenge and not about liberty.   So the great efforts of great heroes in France got hijacked. Many  people lost their lives, and then they lost their effort to have a  republican form of government, as we have had.   A lot of people don't understand the difference between democracy and  a republic. I think it is fair to say, as most historians do, we have a  democratic republic.   Democracy would mean the majority always rules, and our Founders  realized that sometimes you can have too much passion and not enough  time for clear reflection. You are better off, especially among a  majority that really doesn't understand the total aspects and factors  involved in a decision, selecting and electing representatives with  majority votes, except for President.   We set up the electoral college so all States would have a say in who  was President, not just the few that had the most people.   But all the other elections were about a majority--so a democracy-- electing representatives to their governmental entities locally, State,  and Federal. So, really, we have a democratic republic.                                time  1215    It is interesting, as we saw this week, the Speaker of the House  getting ready to go meet with a President of the United States from the  other party, and he really wanted to talk about infrastructure and  making this country stronger.   I think probably most everybody on both sides of the aisle has seen  the surveys regarding the permanent structures, the infrastructure of  this country that helps tie us together as a nation, and most of the  scores are D-minus, D, D-plus at best. And that is about all you see.   We are better in some areas than we are in others, but whether it is  dams, bridges, or highways, we have a lot of infrastructure needs. And  that is something that I would hope that we could come together on and  work out, as those who went before us were able to do.   We are told in Proverbs that, where there is no vision, the people  perish. And it is interesting, when you see towns that had community  leaders with visions who could see certain things needed to be done to  have a vibrant community 10, 50, 100 years later, you saw how blessed  that community was to have leaders with vision.   You go to some communities, and you find, gee, they haven't  progressed very well. They seem to be eternally declining and holding  on to what they have. Normally, you will find leaders in a community  like that who have been spiteful, who didn't want somebody else to get  credit for what was being done. And they prevented a community from  flourishing for years into the future just because they were small- minded and had petty differences and didn't want somebody else to get  the credit.   One of my heroes, Ronald Reagan, is often credited with the line that  actually had been around for a great deal longer than President Reagan,  but he used the line: It is amazing what you can get accomplished if  you don't care who gets the credit. And that has been true since the  beginning here in Washington and, even before Washington became the  capital, in Philadelphia and New York.   But the Speaker announced at a press event, before going over to the  White House to talk about infrastructure, that the President of the  United States had been engaged in a coverup. We weren't told a coverup  of what. We were not told what was done to cover up.   ``Coverup'' is a very ingenious term to be using, almost as brilliant  as the term ``collusion,'' because neither the term ``collusion'' nor  ``coverup'' are crimes. There is no law that says it is a crime to  cover up. There is no crime that says it is a violation of the law to  collude.   So words like that have been chosen and used and repeated over and  over and over so that the public thinks, ``Oh, my goodness, crimes have  been committed. There was collusion. There was a coverup.'' Well, of  what?   We now know that, after 2\1/2\ years of hearing about collusion with  the Russian Government--and I am certainly no fan of Robert Mueller. He  did more damage to the FBI than any FBI Director ever, including the  worst of J. Edgar Hoover, when he was spying on Americans.   We had Mueller's FBI that took innocent people, destroyed their  lives. In the case of the longest serving Senator, Republican Senator,  at the time, he even saw to it that he was convicted immediately before  his election, and then that cost him the election.   And then he was killed in a plane accident that he would never have  been involved in if Mueller's FBI hadn't framed him for a crime he  didn't commit and gotten him voted out of office right before or at his  election. That was, of course, Senator Ted Stevens from Alaska.   And Dr. Hatfill, who Mueller accused of committing the crimes of  murder using anthrax right after the 9/11 attacks. There was no  evidence to support that Dr. Hatfill committed the crimes.   We are told that, at one point--though Mueller kept pursuing Hatfill  and questioning his neighbors, telling the neighbors, through Mueller's  minions, that Hatfill had committed murder with anthrax and they needed  to be careful and report anything. They basically ruined the Hatfill  family's lives.   But, at one point, President Bush is reported to have called him in  and said: There is no evidence that Dr. Hatfill is the guy who did  this. Are you sure? I mean, there is just no evidence. And Mueller  stated: I am 100 percent certain.   So, when it turned out he was not the guy that had been involved with  anthrax and should have been cleared--by anybody but Mueller--Mueller  was asked if he had any regrets about destroying the life of an  innocent man. He said, ``Absolutely not,'' and never apologized.  [[Page H4154]]    Unfortunately, U.S. taxpayers paid millions of dollars in settlement  for Mueller's vindictiveness with no evidence.   Curt Weldon stood right here at this podium making speech after  speech in my freshman term. This was obviously well after 9/11. I  didn't get here until 2005. But in 2005, 2006, he was talking about a  program through which information had gotten to the FBI, and, according  to Curt Weldon--Able Danger, I think, was the name of the program that  had identified some radical Islamist terrorists, wannabes, and that  they were planning an attack in the United States.   And according to Curt Weldon's speeches right here at this podium  where I am standing, the FBI, if they acted, they probably could have  prevented 9/11, but they didn't act.   And I kept thinking: I don't know if what he is saying is true. I was  not familiar with the Able Danger program at that time. But what I kept  thinking was: Gosh, these are really serious allegations about the  leadership of the FBI. Surely Mueller is going to have to come out and  address these allegations from Congressman Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania.  And the FBI never publicly addressed those issues, not that I have been  able to find.   But they did address them. Mueller's FBI, in fact, raided Weldon's  adult daughter, a lawyer, her office, early in the morning. And, gee,  somebody in the FBI committed a crime, apparently, and leaked it to the  media so they could be there when the warrant was run early in the  morning. And somebody alerted Democratic operatives. They had signs  that morning around the office talking about, you know, Curt Weldon is  caught red-handed, he is a thief, alleging all kinds of crimes.    It turns out he hadn't committed any crimes. It turns out, some  months later, they notified the Weldon family they could come get all  the stuff that Mueller's FBI had collected during the raid. They were  told: It has never been presented to a grand jury. We just did the  raid. No prosecution, no grand jury, no indictment.   But since they did that 2 weeks before his election, he narrowly lost  that election.   So it appeared to me pretty clear that Mueller's way of responding to  allegations that his FBI--and, in fairness to him, he hadn't been there  that long before 9/11, so he had plausible deniability: ``Gee, I just  got there. I didn't know about Able Danger at the time.'' But, instead,  what he chose to do was have his FBI affect an election adversely,  causing a critic to lose.   So these are all part of Robert Mueller's background.   But even as much as he wanted to ruin Donald J. Trump, later  President Trump, the guy that he begged for a second appointment as  Director of the FBI, just shortly after he was begging Trump for  appointment to Director of the FBI again and President Trump turned him  down, he jumped at the chance to investigate and try to destroy the  life of the sitting President who refused to hire him. And he spent 2  years, virtually 2 years, on it. I have seen $25 million, $35 million  that Mueller spent.   Mueller took the unusual step of hiring people to assist him in the  Special Counsel's Office who hated Donald Trump. Normally, when there  has been a special counsel of integrity, they know they are going to be  vilified, so they are careful to hire people that appear will be even- handed.   I can't imagine any person of integrity actually hiring people who  contributed to the opponent of the person to be investigated, who would  go to what they hoped would be her victory party, who despised the man  who got elected. It is surprising he would go out of his way to make  sure that he hired people that hated President Trump, whom they were  supposed to investigate.   But here again, the one good thing that I can say about Robert  Mueller is--and he apparently served honorably and well in Vietnam, so  I thank him for that service--the guy is consistent. When he decides he  wants to destroy an innocent man, he gets after it.   Weissmann hated President Trump. These other folks that hated Trump,  some of them still work at the FBI. Many of them have been fired and  run out of the FBI or DOJ in shame. They should have had more than that  happen, and hopefully they will.   But there was no crime committed. His report indicates that there  were efforts by Russians to reach out and try to pull the Trump  campaign into some type of conspiracy, but nobody in the Trump campaign  took the opportunity that was presented by Russia, and there was no  crime of conspiracy with Russians.   And then, as we go along, the more we find out, we find out that,  actually, it is a whole lot worse than Mueller indicated. Mueller  indicated no collusion, no conspiracy, no crime that anybody in the  Trump campaign committed with Russian agents. But if Mueller had been  the man of integrity that I would have hoped, he would have  investigated those who did conspire with Russian agents.   Because, now, the information is coming out that the Clinton campaign  had hired Fusion GPS. Perkins Coie law firm was helping them negotiate  and work through some of these things, using their firm's name in the  conspiracy--it sure seems like a conspiracy to me--as they hired a now- disgraced foreign agent who had worked for MI6, Christopher Steele, to  do digging to try to find some tie between the Trump campaign and  Russia, any kind of dirt they could get.                                time  1230    They tried to lure Don Trump, Jr., into some kind of deal. They said,  gee, there is a Russian person who has all kinds of negative  information about Hillary Clinton.   He agreed to meet and found right away that this is not what it was  represented to be and got out of the meeting as quickly as he could.   Here again, Christopher Steele was hired, apparently through Fusion  GPS, to dig up dirt, true or not true, about Donald Trump. Fusion GPS  hired this foreign, disgraced intelligence agent to do digging, using  Russian agents.   Fusion GPS also hired the spouse of one of the top FBI people, Bruce  Ohr. That was his wife, Nellie. She was hired to dig up dirt, anything  she could in Russia about Trump.   I didn't realize until more recently that Christopher Steele was not  even traveling to Russia to dig up this dirt. He was simply contacting  people in Russia, trying to find somebody who had some dirt on Donald  Trump.   Apparently, he has now recently indicated: You know what? I guess  there is a good chance that the people I was talking to in Russia who  gave the false information about Donald Trump, yeah, they may have been  working for Vladimir Putin.   It appears the evidence is now starting to come out, no thanks to  Robert Mueller and the tens of millions of dollars he wasted, the years  that he wasted. The truth is starting to come out, and it is making  people who are in positions of power very uncomfortable.   We have heard Clapper and Brennan making really inappropriate  statements for somebody who had been involved in our intelligence- gathering agencies. But it is appearing that it was probably Brennan-- we will be finding out in the days ahead--who may have asked England's  intelligence agencies to spy on American citizens involved with the  Trump campaign because our intelligence community is not authorized to  spy on American citizens. So there may be a wink and a nod.   We need to get to the bottom of whether our intelligence community  winks and nods, and says: Hey, we want to spy on our own citizens, but  we are not allowed to legally. So how about you spy on these citizens,  and we will spy on some for you in our country?   We need to know if that kind of thing has really gone on. If it has  gone on, if there is a quid pro quo, we need to know. We need to know  if some of our top intelligence officials have committed crimes. This  is serious stuff.   It turns out there was no collusion, no conspiracy between anybody in  the Trump campaign and Vladimir Putin or Russia. But it is appearing  more and more that there was a conspiracy between people associated  with the Clinton campaign, Fusion GPS, Perkins Coie, Christopher  Steele, potential agents of Vladimir Putin, to try to destroy Donald  Trump before the election and after the election.   We expect to see more coming out as some of the information that was  classified is declassified. It appears now we  [[Page H4155]]  are hearing, and we heard previously, that an Australian Ambassador had  spoken to a member of the Trump campaign, just tangentially part of the  campaign.   But what we have found out now is, apparently, the Australian  Ambassador was manipulated through the Democratic effort to defeat  Donald Trump, recruited to tell a tangential member of the Trump  campaign that the Russians had Hillary Clinton's emails.   Then they set that same Trump marginal official up by asking him  questions: Have you heard anything about Russia having information on  Hillary?   He said: Well, yes. I heard that Russians had Hillary Clinton's  emails.   Then they used that information to help them get a warrant to spy on  the Trump campaign. It was a total setup by potentially our  intelligence community, potentially British MI6.   We have to get to the bottom of this. People who have committed  crimes need to go to prison.   In the meantime, there is all this animosity that has been stirred up  against Donald Trump. Now we find out there was nothing to the  collusion. He knew that he had not committed any kind of conspiracy  with Russia. He knew that this was all bogus. He was hearing rumors  that if there was a conspiracy, it involved the other campaign.   What do you do? How do you act? I would submit, you act exactly as  President Trump has acted, frustrated. He can't believe that his own  United States Government is trying to set him up and say that he  committed some crime that he never committed. He can't obstruct justice  when he is doing everything he possibly can to ensure that justice gets  done.   That is where we have been. We heard the roadblocks, the things that,  oh gee, there was collusion. When that didn't materialize, then: Well,  there is a coverup.   No allegations other than just the general term ``coverup.''   Clearly, efforts are being made in this city to prevent President  Trump from being successful in getting legislation through this House  and through the Senate that could become law and help the country.   Even on issues of securing our border, President Obama talked about  the need to secure the border and stop illegal immigration. Senator  Clinton had talked about the need to stop illegal immigration and  secure the border. Most of the leaders on both sides of the aisle have  talked about that at some point.   Why don't we do it? Well, he would get credit for keeping a campaign  promise, and apparently, it is more important to stop the President  from keeping campaign promises than it is important to some to help the  country.   What it reminded me of, as I thought back--and I have been here 14  years. Never expected to be here this long. I feel like I am kind of  going to a scary movie. Get into it and I am sorry I went, but I can't  leave until I see how it turns out. I want to make sure that we get on  a proper footing here.   I know in the 14 years that I have been here, I have not seen either  party work so hard to prevent the other party's President from being  successful.   As I majored in history, I have never stopped studying history.  American history is my favorite. I have tried to think back, okay, when  was the last time, if there ever was a time before, when one party  worked so hard to prevent another party's President from being  successful and helping the country?   I think it probably goes back to John Quincy Adams' days. John Quincy  Adams, he was the first son of a former President to be elected  President, and he did not get a majority of the vote. It ended up that  he didn't get a majority of the electoral college.   It was thrown here to the House of Representatives to decide, under  the Constitution. Henry Clay, so beloved and respected here in the  House of Representatives, he decided to throw his support to John  Quincy Adams.   I have studied John Quincy Adams, read a very thorough biography. I  liked it. I chose it because it incorporated more of John Quincy Adams'  own journal, where they kept calling him JQA. John Quincy Adams,  apparently, kept more of a journal than any President we have ever had.  He started very young, and he went until the last few weeks of his life  when he could no longer see to write.   I didn't know until I read that, for example, that his last night at  home before he came to the House floor to give a speech against the war  with Mexico, because he was concerned that that would perpetuate  slavery longer, that the reason he had run for the House of  Representatives after being President was to try to do what William  Wilberforce had done in England, and that is to use his elected  position to fight to end slavery.   Wilberforce got it totally outlawed 3 days before he died in 1833. In  1830, that is what Adams thought he was supposed to do. That is why he  ran for Congress.   The night before, he had a massive stroke. The next day, when he  tried to stand up and speak against war with Mexico, he couldn't see.   He couldn't sleep, and he asked his precious wife if she would mind  reading him any of William Wilberforce's sermons. She chose one. She  read it for him, and he finally dozed, listening to William  Wilberforce's sermon the last night he slept at home, before he had his  massive stroke on the House floor here in the Capitol.   In 1824, John Quincy Adams was still a man of integrity. He was  always a man of integrity. Some feel like it is possible that he was  the smartest President we have ever had. Certainly, he was one of the  top-educated Presidents we have ever had. He spoke a number of  languages.   One thing he had in common with our current President, he is the only  other President to have had a wife who was not born in America. Much  like President Trump's wife, John Quincy Adams' wife spoke multiple  languages, very fluent. She herself was brilliant. So we share that  with the current First Lady.   John Quincy Adams even wrote some history books in German. His  favorite foreign language was French. He was an amazing guy.   He knew he was a man of integrity, and when studying his life, you  figure out that he was a man of integrity.   He asked Henry Clay for his support. Henry Clay threw his support  behind John Quincy Adams for President. That got him the votes in the  House to win the Presidency.   When it came time to pick Cabinet members, President-elect Adams said  that he believed the person who would make the best Secretary of State  would be Henry Clay.   Those people who were close to him, who loved him, said, yes, he was  right, that Henry Clay would make a fabulous Secretary of State, but  that if he appoints Henry Clay to be Secretary of State, it will look  like he cut a deal with Clay in return for his support for him for  President, which gave him the election. If he agreed to make him  Secretary of State, people would think he made an illegal deal.                                time  1245    He said: He is the best person for the job. I didn't make any kind of  deal with him. He threw his support behind me. I never mentioned  Secretary of State to him. I never mentioned making him a Cabinet  official, but I think the world of the man. I think he would be the  best Secretary of State. People know I am a man of integrity. I  wouldn't do an illegal deal to be elected President, so they just need  to get over it. He is the best man. I am going to appoint the best man  to be Secretary of State. People who know me will know that I never  made a deal, promised him Secretary of State in return for throwing his  House support behind me. That is just a lie, and I am not going to be  prevented from appointing the best man for Secretary of State by my  fear about what somebody might think.   So he appointed Henry Clay to be Secretary of State, and people got  really upset: There must have been a deal. He must have cut a deal with  Henry Clay. In return for Henry Clay's support that won him the  Presidency, Henry Clay gets to be Secretary of State.   Apparently, there was no deal, but people thought there was. People  felt like: This looks terrible. It looks like he made a deal. He must  have made a deal. We know Adams is an honest guy, and so if he made a  deal with Clay, he surely would have kept his end of the deal.   There was no deal, but there were so many in the opposition party who  were  [[Page H4156]]  mad about it, they just decided they were not going to let John Quincy  Adams accomplish anything as President.   He was elected in 1824, sworn in, in 1825. His term was 1825 to 1829.  He was defeated by Andrew Jackson and defeated fairly easily because  people thought he had cheated to win by making a deal he didn't make  with Henry Clay.   During those 4 years--anyone can do the research--he couldn't get  much of anything done. There were even cases of Members of this House  who were of the opposition party, the Democratic Party, there were  Democrats who had actually written and sponsored bills they desperately  wanted to get passed. When John Quincy Adams threw his support behind  the bills because he thought they were a good idea, the person who  wrote the bill, sponsored the bill, withdrew his support. He did not  want John Quincy Adams to get credit for passing some important bill.   He had some great ideas. He wanted a national observatory. He felt  like it would be good to have a uniform system of weights and  measurements. That had not happened. He wanted to create a naval  academy for the country. He wanted to have a code, a systemized  national bankruptcy law.   Bankruptcy is mentioned in the Constitution. There were finally some  laws passed before he was President, but it wasn't a uniform national  bankruptcy law as it needed to be.   He had some great ideas, but they weren't passed because people did  not want him to get credit. They were willing to hurt the country to  prevent John Quincy Adams from having a great victory.   That is what went through my mind. Somebody may be able to find a  case in which one party did everything it could to prevent a President  from having any big successes.   It is a little late. President Trump got a great tax bill. It wasn't  as good as I had hoped it would be, but it was helpful to the country  overall. He got that passed, signed into law.   Hopefully, we are going to vote on the Mexico-Canada trade agreement.  It is better than NAFTA was. Hopefully, we will get that done, and we  won't keep harming the country by failing to bring that for a vote.   For Adams, there was a tariff that was passed. That was about the  biggest piece of legislation passed during his 4 years, but it didn't  even get enacted until Andrew Jackson took over as President.   So Adams, a man of integrity, was accused of making an illegal deal  with Henry Clay to get himself elected President. The country suffered  for 4 years. Those who despised John Quincy Adams, they were able to  hurt the country for 4 years just to keep John Quincy Adams from having  a major victory.   It is important to learn from history. As we know from the old adage,  those who refuse to learn from history are destined to repeat it. Of  course, I also grew up learning there is a corollary to that, that  those who do learn from history will find new ways to screw up. We have  seen both of those play out in this country.   I am hoping it will come together, and we will be able to pass some  of the critical legislation to secure our border and to get some  infrastructure built so we don't give a country to our children and  grandchildren that has infrastructure crumbling and with so much debt  that they can't afford to rebuild the infrastructure. We already know  that we are the first generation in American history that didn't have  as our driving goal to give a country to our children better than we  had it.   The debts continue to skyrocket, over $23 trillion now. We really  need to come together on these important issues.   With regard to the President's effort to try to secure the border, I  continue to believe with all my heart, the most compassionate, caring  thing we could do for the people of Mexico--and I was talking to the  Ambassador from Guatemala yesterday. I sure like him. Guatemala, of  course, was the only country to immediately recognize Jerusalem as the  capital of Israel, as it was 3,000 years ago, and should be and is  today, and will be for the future. Guatemala had the courage to back us  up on that.   Apparently, MS-13ers come mainly from El Salvador, but Guatemala  wants to help. We ought to help Guatemala to help us. I hope that will  be occurring.   If we really want to be compassionate for the people of Mexico and  Central America, the best thing we could do is secure the border, cut  off the tens of billions of dollars every year, maybe into the hundred- plus billion, that go to the drug cartels. It funds corruption in  Mexico. It is the one thing that keeps Mexico from being one of the  very top economies in the world.   They have fantastic natural resources. They have a better location  geographically than the United States does. They are between North  America and South America. They are between two oceans. They have a  great location. They have some of the most hardworking people in the  world.   I also am thrilled that the huge majority have faith in God. I think  we could stand another boost of people who have faith in God, a  devotion to family, a hard work ethic like we generally find among the  huge majority of Hispanic people from Mexico and Central America. We  could afford more of that here, but we have to enforce the law.   If we secure the border, Mexico ought to be able to put down the drug  cartel corruption and become a top economy. Then you won't have people  doing everything they can, risking their lives, having their daughters  raped repeatedly coming up here from Mexico or through Mexico to the  United States. We can go back to having the kind of vibrant tourism  that we once had in support of Mexico.   But there are efforts that are being undertaken here in the House by  friends across the aisle who do not want Donald Trump to have success  in helping the United States, and, really, it would greatly help  Mexico.   What is the result? Well, here is a story from May 21, Washington  Times, Steven Dinan: ICE says Prince George's County released illegal  murder suspects.   The story says: ``Two teens arrested last week on charges stemming  from a horrific killing in Maryland were supposed to be deported last  year, but local authorities didn't turn them over to ICE, the  immigration agency said Tuesday.   ``Prosecutors say the teens, Josue Rafael Fuentes-Ponce, 16, and Joel  Ernesto Escobar, 17--suspected of being MS-13 gang members--feared they  would be ratted out for an April robbery, so they and an accomplice  snuffed out a 14-year-old suspected snitch. They made her strip before  beating her with a baseball bat and chopping her with a machete. The  girl's body was found in a creek this month.''   This is in Prince George's County.   ``U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, in a pointed statement  Tuesday, said the crime could have been averted''--could have been  completely prevented--``but for Prince George's County's sanctuary city  policy.''   That is what stopped it, or it is what kept our ICE agents from  preventing the baseball bat and machete mutilation of this 14-year-old  girl.   ``Mr. Fuentes-Ponce and Mr. Escobar were in county custody last year  on attempted murder charges for another crime. ICE placed a detainer on  them, asking to be notified when they would be released so agents could  deport them. ICE said the Prince George's County Department of  Corrections defied the request.   `` `These individuals had demonstrated violent criminal behavior  before, and because they were released in spite of the lawful detainer,  they were afforded an opportunity to take a life.' ''   And not just take a life. They beat her, stripped her, beat her with  a baseball bat and then chopped her up with a machete.   Thank you very much, Prince George's County, for your sanctuary city.  No telling how many people will have to lose their lives while you defy  Federal law.   This article says: ``ICE has placed new detainers for both teens  after the murder charges. Prince George's corrections spokesman Andrew  Cephas said the agency didn't release the teens into the community. He  said the Corrections Department did have custody last year but remanded  the teens to  [[Page H4157]]  Cheltenham Youth Detention Center, a State facility, after a judge's  ruling.   `` `Neither of these individuals were released to the public from  Prince George's County Department of Corrections. They remained  detained in the juvenile facility until the disposition of their cases  earlier this year.' ''   Yeah, right. The cases were disposed of, a little slap on the wrist  for their attempted murders. But this says the county department does  inform ICE--or the Prince George's County spokesman said they inform  ICE about upcoming releases but did not provide notification in this  case.   ``ICE says the county should have given notification of any transfer  out of custody so the agency could lodge a detainer with the new prison  or jail.''                                time  1300    ``Under a 2014 Department of Corrections policy, county jails say  they will notify ICE of impending releases but won't hold the migrants  for pickup unless ICE has a signed warrant from a judge.   ``Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration  Studies, which advocates for stricter immigration controls, said the  teens are at the center of several raging immigration debates.   ``Mr. Fuentes-Ponce came to the U.S. in late 2015 as part of the  surge of families from Central America who have overwhelmed the border  in recent years.   ``Under the Obama administration, the family was paroled into the  U.S. to await its immigration case. Like many other families, Mr.  Fuentes-Ponce didn't appear for his hearing and was ordered deported in  absentia, ICE said.   ``Mr. Escobar, meanwhile, entered the U.S. in 2016 as an  unaccompanied alien child, the other major demographic in the border  surge.''   That is one of the things we debated for hours and hours yesterday in  our Judiciary Committee. The committee's majority wants to have even  more widespread amnesty than DACA, which President Obama had said 20- something times it would be unconstitutional for him to do what he  ultimately did creating the DACA program. He didn't even sign executive  orders, I understand. He had the Secretary of Homeland Security do a  couple of memos.   So he changed Federal law without the bill being passed by the House  and Senate, without signing it into law. He didn't even sign an  executive order. He just had a couple of memos that changed the policy.   ``Mr. Krikorian wondered whether the killing of the 14-year-old girl  would receive as much attention as the death of an illegal immigrant  teen in Border Patrol custody this week.''   There was a teen who died from an apparent flu.   ``That case prompted reporters to question Mr. Trump about what steps  he would take.   `` `The antiborder activists are quick to blame the Border Patrol for  deaths that are out of their control, but rationalizes the crimes  committed by people who would be removed if the law were enforced.  There really is a double standard here.'   ``The D.C. area has long had a large Central American population,  making it one of the top destinations for families and unaccompanied  alien children involved in the surge. Prince George's, Fairfax, and  Montgomery Counties are among the top 10 locations.   ``More than 5,660 unaccompanied alien children have been placed with  sponsors in Prince George's County over the past 5 years, topping  Fairfax at about 5,200 and Montgomery at about 4,300.   ``The unaccompanied alien children have strained schools and,  security experts say, created a breeding ground for gang recruitment.   `` `Most of the Central Americans coming across the border are not  criminals, but gangs have used this flow of people across the border to  bring their members into the U.S., and others who weren't gang members  in Central America have become gang members here,' Mr. Krikorian  said.''   So it would really help if we could come together, if the President  wouldn't have to be building the wall without any help from a Democrat- controlled House.   It is a shame they want to do all they can to try to prevent the  President from protecting the country, but we ought to learn a lesson  from the damage that was done between 1825 and 1829 during the  Presidency of John Quincy Adams, and we ought to come together, get the  border secure.   Let's not have any amnesties until the border is secure, then we can  talk about them, debate them. But every time we talk about amnesty--I  got a picture this week from a friend on the border, a 6-year-old and  an 8-year-old, unaccompanied children, yet we are told: Oh, no. We are  doing this DACA amnesty because the children were brought into the  United States by their parents, and so these children were drug into  the United States without their choice, and so we need to give them  legal status.   And yet you have got a 6-year-old and an 8-year-old that are coming  in, as my friend across the aisle said yesterday: Well, they don't come  in without help. She is right. The parents weren't with them. The  parents weren't with them, forcing them.   We also have been hearing that, since there is so much fuss made  about allowing people to stay that had children with them, the children  have now become a negotiable commodity. I have been there when children  were passed back and forth between different adults--you know, who is  going to claim these kids--and they are waiting for the border  patrolmen to get down to them so they can answer the questions.   But the drug cartels have figured out, the gangs have figured out-- gangs are often paid to bring people in illegally, and the gangs get  paid by the drug cartels because, as we know, every inch of the border  of the United States is controlled by some drug cartel.   So the gangs make money, the drug cartels make money by bringing  people in. And since they have learned they have a better chance of  staying in if they bring somebody's kid with them, then more kids are  coming in now.   But it is interesting. I am wondering how the debates will go when we  say, well, here is a person we want to give amnesty to because their  parents dragged them into America, even though there were no parents  with them. Well, so the gangs brought them in.   Anybody in the drug cartel brings in a child, that means we are  supposed to give them amnesty?   At some point, we have got to secure the border. It is the most  compassionate thing we can do. Mexico will become a great economy in  the world, one of the top, and the wonderful people of Mexico, Central  America will have a better standard of living. Heck, you might have  United States citizens thinking maybe they would like to go work in a  vibrant economy in Mexico if and when we can help stop the drug cartels  with all the money that they have got coming in.    Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time I have left.    Since we are going into Memorial Day weekend, I am  thrilled Sergeant Derrick Miller has been released. I testified at two  different hearings for him. I am thrilled he is released. He shouldn't  have been incarcerated.   Lieutenant Clint Lorance, hopefully that can be brought to an end and  he can be released like American Taliban John Walker Lindh was.   But I want to finish by mentioning Ross McGinnis. I promised his  father, Tom, I would never forget him, and I haven't.   Ross was 19 when he was in Iraq. Ross loved the Army. Ross finished  high school in Knox, Pennsylvania, joined the Army. He loved it, and  his platoon sergeant said everybody loved Ross. Ross helped energize  people.   Ross was a machine gunner up in the turret of a Humvee going through  a village in Iraq. A grenade was projected into the bed of the Humvee,  and Ross was the only one in a position to jump out and save himself.  He yelled, ``Grenade.'' Ross saw the four people in the bed crouch.  Ross knew they were going to die, so Ross jumped down, covered the  grenade, and saved four people's lives.   I went to Ross' funeral, his graveside in Arlington Cemetery, because  two of the four people Ross saved were my constituents.   Ross' sergeant and the two others who made it back from Iraq for the  funeral came up after the ceremony,  [[Page H4158]]  knelt before Ross' remains, put their hands on Ross' remains, and as  they told me, they thank God for Ross McGinnis, and they thank Ross for  saving their lives.   We should thank God for all of those who have served and protected us  and thank the families of those that lost a loved one protecting us.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
