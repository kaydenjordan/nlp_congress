 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman  from Minnesota for pointing out the truth. I am glad that I decided to  wear my boots today because it is getting deep in the swamp up here  today, listening  [[Page H5620]]  to the garbage on the other side of the aisle.   Let's put it this way: The Democrats have already pushed through $2  trillion of reckless, wasteful spending at the expense of working-class  Americans, and now they are wanting to push through another $4.3  trillion reckless spending bill that will reward their political  friends, their wealthy donors, and their allies, at the expense of  working-class Americans.   Let me tell you, the Budget Committee chairman said we should  increase the debt limit a gazillion dollars--a gazillion.   We have folks on the other side of the aisle just in the last 30  minutes that have said we should not have a debt limit. This is the  Democratic Party. They do not believe there should be limit in debt.  They have said this on the floor. But that is not what the American  people want.   If you want to raise the debt $480 billion until December, guess  what? Listen to the White House. Just last week, the White House said  there is $480 billion of unobligated funds from your Biden bailout bill  from March. Use that.   But, no, you want to continue to take more money from working-class  Americans by putting in debt their kids and grandkids. Of course, on  the other side of the aisle, they will tell you: Oh, we will never pay  back the debt. That is what comes from the other side of the aisle.   Folks, we have so many crises right now: a border crisis, an  Afghanistan crisis, an inflation crisis, an energy crisis, all as a  result of Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, and Chuck Schumer. And now they are  trying to increase the debt $480 billion more that will fuel those  crises.   The American people have had enough.
