 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Francis Graham of  Waco, Texas, who passed away on January 10, 2019.   Frank was born on March 19, 1930, in Sparta, Wisconsin, to Francis  Graham, Sr., and Theresa Snyder Graham. He was the second of nine  children.   In 1947, at the age of 16, Frank dropped out of high school and  enlisted in the United States Army Air Corps. Frank later served in the  U.S. Navy from 1950 to 1954 as a member of an underwater demolition  team, a predecessor unit to the Navy SEALs. In 1955, Frank returned to  the Army and served until 1971, when he retired as a sergeant major  serving with the Special Forces.   After he retired from the military, Frank decided to continue his  education and obtained his doctorate in psychology at the University of  Southern Mississippi in 1976.   In 1982, Frank and his wife, Patricia, moved to Waco. For over 20  years, Frank practiced as a psychologist with the U.S. Department of  Veterans Affairs and the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.   Frank was an active member of the local Special Forces chapter, the  Woodway Veterans of Foreign Wars, and was the past president of both  the local American Heart Association and the Italian Club of Waco. He  was also involved with Saint Jerome's Catholic Church and was a Fourth  Degree member of the Knights of Columbus.   Frank had a variety of hobbies, including breeding horses for racing,  traveling, reading, movies, having family and friends over for game  night, and being a connoisseur of fine wines and food.   Frank was also a member of my Military Service Academy Review Board,  which assists in selecting candidates for nomination to our Nation's  service academies.   Mr. Speaker, Frank's life was defined by his service to his family,  to our country, and to our community. He will be forever remembered as  a husband, a father, a grandfather, a veteran, a selfless servant, and  a great friend.   My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to  the Graham family. We also lift up the family and friends of Frank  Graham in our prayers.   I have requested that a United States flag be flown over our Nation's  Capitol to honor the life and legacy this humble servant.   As I close today, I ask all Americans to continue praying for our  country, for our military, for our veterans, and for our first  responders who keep us safe at home.  [[Page H2610]]                                 Honoring Jack Restivo     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Jack Restivo of Bryan,  Texas, who passed away on March 1, 2019.   Jack was born on July 17, 1925, in Bryan, Texas, to Andrew and  Corrine Restivo. He was one of 11 children.   Growing up in Bryan, he graduated from Stephen F. Austin High School  and later attended Texas A&M University in College Station as a member  of the class of 1946.   In 1943, in the midst of World War II, Jack left Texas A&M to join  the United States Army Air Corps, and he trained to be an aerial  gunner.   He was discharged in 1946 and, soon thereafter, met the love of his  life, Mary Jo. They married in 1947, and Jack began his career in the  insurance business in Bryan, Texas. In 1955, he was promoted and  transferred to Waco.   In Waco, Jack later founded A-1 Fire and Safety Equipment Company. He  and his family continued to grow this company until Jack retired in  2000.   Jack was active in supporting St. Louis Catholic Church and Reicher  Catholic High School. Jack was on the school board of Reicher, and in  1986, he and Mary Jo received the Cougar Award for Excellence for their  dedication to this school.   Jack loved spending time with his family and friends, golfing,  traveling with Mary Jo, and everything related to Texas A&M. He was a  longtime season ticket holder for Texas A&M football, baseball, men's  basketball, and women's basketball. He was a member of the Texas A&M  Champions Council, the Texas A&M Foundation's Legacy Society, and an  endowed member of the 12th Man Foundation. He also served on the  executive committee of the 12th Man Foundation.   Mr. Speaker, Jack's life was defined by his service to his family, to  our country, to Texas A&M, and to our central Texas communities.   He will be forever remembered as a husband; a father; a grandfather;  a great-grandfather; a veteran; a mentor; a selfless servant; and a  great, great friend.   My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to  the Restivo family. We also lift up the family and friends of Jack  Restivo in our prayers.   I have requested that a United States flag be flown over our Nation's  Capitol to honor the life and legacy of this humble servant.   As I close today, I ask all Americans to continue praying for our  country, for our military men and women who protect us abroad, for our  first responders who protect us here at home, and for our veterans.                           Honoring John Paul Fritz     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor John Paul Fritz of  College Station, Texas, who passed away on January 8, 2019.   John Paul was born on August 31, 1989, in Houston, Texas, to John  Mark and Cathy Jane Fritz. He was the fourth of seven children.   John Paul was known for his love of the outdoors, whether it was  climbing trees and building forts, or bringing home animals like  rabbits, turtles, frogs, and snakes.   John Paul was initially homeschooled but later continued his  education when he joined the United States Navy on November 9, 2009.   In the Navy, John Paul attended Nuclear Field ``A'' School and  Nuclear Power School. Upon completion of his training, he was selected  as a junior staff instructor for the modifications and additions to a  reactor facility prototype.   In 2013, John Paul was stationed aboard the submarine USS Florida and  completed missions that were vital to our national security.   In 2017, he was selected to become an instrumentation and control  equipment instructor, the final course for nuclear electronics  technicians.   It came as no surprise to anyone who knew John Paul that he was  passionate about science, specifically chemistry and nuclear physics.   This last year, during Christmas, John Paul returned home and built a  heat shield out of several household items. He and his friends were  trying to develop a new type of efficient rocket fuel, and they hoped  to start a company once he retired from the Navy.   John Paul was also known for his love of his family. He was engaged  to be married this summer, and he dearly loved his daughter, Madeline  Elizabeth Ann Fritz.   Unfortunately, his time on this Earth was cut short way too early.   Mr. Speaker, John Paul's life was defined by his service to his  family and to our country. He will be forever remembered as a father, a  sailor, a son, a brother, and a friend.   My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to  the Fritz family. We also lift up the family and friends of John Paul  Fritz in our prayers.   I have requested that a United States flag be flown over our Nation's  Capitol to honor the life and legacy of this young sailor.   As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our  country, for our veterans, for our military men and women who protect  us, and for our first responders who keep us safe at home.                             Honoring Red Cashion     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Red Cashion of College  Station, Texas, who passed away on February 10, 2019.   Red was born on November 10, 1931, in College Station on the Texas  A&M University campus. His father was the secretary of the YMCA when it  was housed on the campus, and Red welcomed many Aggies to campus by  letting them ``rent'' his red wagon as they moved into the dorms.   After graduating from A&M Consolidated High School in 1949, Red  attended Texas A&M University on a baseball scholarship and graduated  in May 1953.   He was then commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States  Army. Red served in the Army for 4 years, working with the National  Security Agency, primarily in Washington, D.C., and at Fort Meade.   During the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1963, he was recalled to  Washington, where he briefed President Kennedy on the ongoing situation  with Cuba.   In the 1960s and 1970s, Red raised his family in the Brazos Valley  and started a business with his father-in-law and best friend.  Together, they opened Burgess, Cashion & Haddox, which later became  Anco Insurance. For many years, Red served as chairman emeritus at  Anco.   Red's father-in-law got him interested in officiating football games.  Red began to officiate junior high school games while still in college,  and he eventually became a line judge for the National Football League  in 1972.   In 1976, Red became a head NFL referee and ultimately officiated  Super Bowls XX and XXX.   Overall, he served as an official for the NFL for 25 years,  officiating more than 500 games. He was inducted into the Texas Sports  Hall of Fame in 1989 and was named the NFL's Referee Association  Honoree in 2011.    In 2015, he received the Art McNally Award to recognize exemplary  professionalism, leadership, and commitment on and off the field.   After his retirement from the field, Red continued to work as a  trainer of NFL referees and served as the referee's voice on John  Madden's video game, ``Madden NFL.''   Although Red spent a lot of time traveling across the United States,  he stayed involved in the Brazos Valley community. He served as  chairman of the Bryan-College Station Chamber of Commerce, the Brazos  County Industrial Foundation, the Brazos County Association of  Independent Insurance Agents, and the Region VI Education Service  Center.   In 1972, he was honored with the Brazos County volunteer award, and  in 1994, he received the Brazos County Citizen of the Year award.   Red was also a bell ringer every holiday season with the Salvation  Army.   Red was involved with many churches in Brazos Valley, first as an  elder at the A&M Presbyterian Church, which his father helped found.  Later, Red was a deacon at First Baptist Church in Bryan and, most  recently, a member of the A&M United Methodist Church.   Like most Aggies, Red loved Texas A&M University. In 1990, Red served  as the campus Muster speaker. He was also honored in 2003 by being  named a Texas A&M Distinguished Alumni and has the football official's  locker room inside Kyle Field named for him. Red was also later named a  Mays Business School Outstanding Alumni and a Fish Camp Namesake.  [[Page H2611]]    He was a member of the President's Council, the 12th Man Foundation  Champions Council, and the Corps of Cadets Development Council.   Until his passing, Red was also the chair of the Association of  Former Students' Student Loan Trustee Committee.   Mr. Speaker, Red's life was defined by his service to his family, to  our country, to the Brazos Valley, and to Texas A&M University.   He will forever be remembered as a husband; a grandfather; a great- grandfather; a veteran; a selfless servant; and a great, great friend.   My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to  the Cashion family. We also lift up the family and friends of Red  Cashion in our prayers.   I have requested that a United States flag be flown over our Nation's  Capitol to honor the life and legacy of this humble servant.   As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our  country, for our veterans, for our military, and for our first  responders who keep us safe at home.                                time  1245                           HONORING DR. JAMES EARLE     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. James Earle of  College Station, Texas, who passed away on February 4, 2019.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        March 8, 2019, on page H2611, the following appeared: As I close  today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our country,  for our veterans, for our military, and for our first responders  who keep us safe at home. ------ 1245 HONORING DR. JAMES EARLE  Mr.  Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. James Earle of College Station,  Texas, who passed away on February 4, 2019.    ========================= END NOTE =========================     Jim was born on May 2, 1932, in Jacksonville, Texas, to Herbert and  Edna Earle. While attending Jacksonville High School, Jim excelled in  sports, particularly boxing. Jim won many Golden Gloves titles and  earned the nickname ``The Mangler'' in high school. In high school, he  also started drawing caricatures.   After graduating from high school, Jim attended Texas A&M University,  where he was a member of the Corps of Cadets. While at Texas A&M, Jim  organized the first boxing club and lettered in both boxing and track  and field.   Jim graduated from Texas A&M in 1954 with a degree in architecture.  Upon graduation, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the  United States Air Force.   While serving in the Air Force, Jim was stationed at Dyess Air Force  Base in Abilene, Texas. It was at a base event in the summer of 1957  where he met his future wife, Theresa. She sat in front of him for a  caricature, and he said: ``You're so pretty, I think I'm going to marry  you.'' They married just a few months later and raised two loving  daughters. They had been married 61 years at the time of his passing.   Jim completed Active Duty in 1957 and returned to Texas A&M to begin  his career as an educator. He began teaching mechanical drafting to  first-year engineering students. He later became the head of the  Engineering Design Graphics Department. In 1964, Jim earned his Ph.D.  in education. He continued to teach until 1995, when he retired.   Throughout his career, Jim was active in the American Society for  Engineering Education and held many leadership positions in the  Engineering Design Graphics division. From 1986 to 1991, he served as  chair of the Annual Conference Committee of that organization. He was  named professor emeritus of Civil Engineering in 1995 and ``A Legend of  Aggieland'' in 2000.   During his time as a student and professor at Texas A&M, Jim created  and drew a beloved cartoon character, Cadet Slouch. Jim depicted Slouch  as an undergraduate cadet trying to navigate campus life. Topics  included class assignments, the Aggie football team, and life in the  Corps of Cadets. Cadet Slouch and his friends, Simp, Cedric, Squirt,  and Fish Jethro, were published in The Battalion, the student  newspaper, from 1955 to 1985.   When drawing Cadet Slouch cartoons, Jim was often influenced by his  time as a student and, later, as a professor. The Cadet Slouch cartoon  series was a commentary on the many changes going on at Texas A&M,  including the enrollment of women and the voluntary participation in  the Corps. Cadet Slouch was beloved by generations of Aggies while it  was published.   In addition to the cartoon's run in the student newspaper,  collections of Cadet Slouch cartoons were published in several books.   On a personal note, during my time at Texas A&M in the mid-seventies,  I always enjoyed reading the Cadet Slouch cartoon in The Battalion  newspaper.   In 1979, Jim and Theresa started their own publishing company. Jim  wrote and published drafting workbooks at affordable prices, which were  sold to more than 125 universities and colleges across the United  States. Many more high schools used his textbooks to teach students  mechanical drafting.   It was in these workbooks that many of Jim's graduate students  advanced their own careers by contributing to the content of these  books. These books introduced the concepts of techniques of engineering  graphics to over a million students across the country and around the  world. Jim completed his last workbook, ``Engineering Graphics  Designs,'' when he was 80 years old.   Jim's career bridged the gap between drafting by hand to three- dimensional, computer-aided design. Jim believed that one must always  adapt to changes in technology, so he bought a computer and mastered  AutoCAD to the extent that he was a beta tester for Autodesk.  Nevertheless, he never let technology cloud the basics of good drafting  and design.   Jim also had an interest in history. He served as an officer of many  historical societies, including the Westerners, the National Outlaw and  Lawman Association, the Western Outlaw and Lawman Association, and the  Texas Gun Collectors Association.   Jim became an expert on many historical figures and published a book  in 1988 about Billy the Kid. Through his publishing company, he worked  with friends to bring stories of western lawmen and outlaws into  reality.   Mr. Speaker, Jim's life was defined by his service to his family, to  his students, to our country, and to Texas A&M University. He will be  forever remembered as a husband, a father, a grandfather, a veteran, an  educator, a mentor, a selfless servant, and a great friend.   My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to  the Earle family. We also lift up the family and friends of Jim Earle  in our prayers.   I have requested the United States flag be flown over our Nation's  Capitol to honor the life and legacy of this humble servant.   As I close, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our country,  for our veterans, for our military who protects us, and for our first  responders who keep us safe at home.                              Honoring Ed Berry     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Ed Berry of Bryan,  Texas, who passed away on February 24, 2019.   Ed was born on April 22, 1940, in Waco, Texas, to Ed Berry, Sr., and  to Udis White Berry. He graduated from Waco High School and attended  Texas A&M University, where he was a member of the class of 1962. While  at Texas A&M, Ed was a member of the Corps of Cadets, where he was a  member of Squadron 4 and, ultimately, the commanding officer of  Squadron 8. He was also a member of the Ross Volunteer Company. He  received his degree in mathematics, and was also in the first class in  the world to graduate with a master's degree in computer science.   On August 31, 1963, he married the love of his life, Barbara Teal, in  Houston, Texas. They raised three sons in the Houston area and moved to  Dallas in 1983. In both Houston and Dallas, Ed coached his sons'  basketball and baseball teams for a total of 13 years. He also served  as a deacon, a choir member, a Sunday school teacher, a Bible study  leader, and a number of additional volunteer positions at South Main  Baptist and Tallowood Baptist in Houston, Prestonwood Baptist in  Dallas, and Travis Avenue Baptist in Fort Worth. At Prestonwood, Ed was  also the chairman of the deacons and the president of the choir.   After graduating from Texas A&M, Ed went to work at NASA for IBM and  contributed to the Gemini and Apollo missions. He also worked for 25  years as the information systems leader for many companies, including  Sysco Foods, Zapata Corporation, and Texas Oil and Gas. He later worked  in technology and management consulting for Oracle Corporation and  Cambridge Energy Research Associates.  [[Page H2612]]    For the last 15 years, Ed worked as a Realtor. He spent 10 years as  the executive director of the Bryan-College Station Association of  Realtors. During his tenure, the association became one of the top  three in the State of Texas.   Mr. Speaker, Ed's life was defined by his service to his family, to  Texas, to our country, and to God. He will be forever remembered as a  husband, a father, a grandfather, a community leader, a selfless  servant, and a great friend.   My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to  the Berry family. We also lift up the family and friends of Ed Berry in  our prayers.   I have requested the United States flag be flown over our Nation's  Capitol to honor the life and legacy of this humble servant.   Also, as I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for  our country, for our veterans, for our military who protects us, and  for our first responders who keep us safe at home.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
