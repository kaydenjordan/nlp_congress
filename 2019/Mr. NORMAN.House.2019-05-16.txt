 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the late Emily  Carnes, a former resident of South Carolina's Fifth District who  dedicated her life to the preservation of the historic Buford  battlefield.   The Battle of Buford was significant and momentous in the southern  campaign during our Revolutionary War. 113 Continental troops perished  during this struggle and another 150 suffered terrible wounds.   Witnessing this carnage was Emily Carnes' great-great-grandfather,  Jacob. Emily would go on to tell her ancestor's story in her book,  ``Jacob Was There''.   The book describes Jacob Carnes, who was 16 years old at the time,  and on the fateful day of May 29 of 1780, Jacob was employed plowing in  a field close to the historic site when the Continental troops under  Colonel Abraham Buford clashed with the British forces led by  Lieutenant-Colonel Banastre Tarleton.   Jacob hid behind a tree during the struggle, but was eventually  discovered by British troops, who took him into custody. While in their  custody, British troops commanded Jacob to bury an American soldier  alive. Jacob refused.   In reply, a British soldier fired his musket and shot off one of  Jacob's fingers, therefore, adding Jacob's name to the long list of  patriots who gave their blood for our freedom.   In remembrance of her great-great-grandfather's traumatic experience  and the historic importance of the battle to the southern campaign,  Emily Carnes singlehandedly cared for and preserved the 2 acres of leaf  and debris-filled battlefield for years. She did this with no support  and very few means. Indeed, she couldn't even afford to fly a flag in  remembrance of those who gave their life for our independence.   Finally, in 2010, the Friends of Buford Massacre Battlefield was  established, and Ms. Carnes was awarded an honorary member.   Thanks to Ms. Carnes' lifelong efforts, the former 2-acre site now  encompasses over 47 acres of surrounding land on which the battle was  fought, with the site now proudly flying the Stars and Stripes, the  Buford Battle flag, and the State flags of Virginia and South Carolina.   The site now also includes modern comforts like a patio, walkways,  informational kiosks, and a memorial bronze plaque inscribed with the  names of 216 men recognized for defending their country in the Battle  of Buford.   We thank Ms. Carnes for her lifelong passion and dedication to this  sacred soil and for preserving this moment in a State and Nation's  history for all of us to remember and enjoy.                            ____________________
