 First, I want to thank Senator Collins and assure her that  I appreciate the excellent work that she and Senator Murray have been  doing, and I will be a vote for cloture so that we can proceed.   Mr. President, Vermont is one of the States that suffered devastating  damages as a result of recent floods and very much is in need of the  replenishing of the FEMA disaster aid fund.   As a Congress, as a Senate, our leaders, Senator McConnell and  Senator Schumer, and our Appropriations chair and vice chair, Senator  Murray and Senator Collins, have been working  [[Page S4674]]  very hard to get a continuing resolution passed so that we will keep  the lights on in government.   And we can't shut down. Just think about it. Military people won't  get paid. That is just absolutely unacceptable. Start there, and the  cascade of terrible things that are all avoidable will happen.   I am very appreciative of the efforts of our leadership, especially  our committee chair and vice chair, for their work to avoid a shutdown.  I am totally committed to avoiding a shutdown. It is unacceptable to  inflict so much unnecessary harm on so many innocent people because of  a crackpot theory that if you shut things down and burn the place down,  it is going to result in a good outcome.   There are no good outcomes, as Senator McConnell said earlier, when  you use as a tactic to try to get your way to shut the government down.   So I will be supportive of the efforts on a bipartisan basis here to  work toward a resolution. It is still very much in play as to what is  going to happen to the FEMA money that is so essential to people who  have suffered as a result of natural disasters.   I talk about Vermont, of course--and I will do that right now--but I  am very mindful that my colleagues in Hawaii suffered that devastating  fire in Maui, and, of course, we have had hurricanes and storms in  Texas, in North Carolina, in Georgia, in Florida. So one thing all of  us should be doing is helping each other when our citizens are the  victims of a natural disaster.   So the No. 1 priority is to keep the lights on because we are going  to fight another day. No. 2, my hope, is that there is still time to  include aid for the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help us in  Vermont, to help folks in Hawaii, to help folks in North Carolina,  Georgia, Florida, and elsewhere.   But I want to talk a little bit about what the situation is in  Vermont. We remember the iconic photo that was broadcast nationwide of  the downtown of the capital city of Vermont, Montpelier, underwater.  The water is gone now. It has dried up.   This is a local business in Montpelier, and that is the Minikin toy  shop in Montpelier. The water was up to here. This is now gone, but the  question is--this shop, the Minikin toy shop, where I bought things for  my grandkids--Kelly Tackett, the owner, she spoke with the Burlington  Free Press about the flooding in her toy store. And she said:         This was my lifelong dream shop. Those photos [of the       flooding] make me realize this is likely the end of Minikin.       I worked so hard to bring it to life.    She really needs a second chance here, and our FEMA funding can make  a difference. I visited and spoke with her and her young family as they  were cleaning up the shop right after the flood.   Cabot, VT, is a small community, the home of Cabot cheese. It is at  the headwaters of the Winooski River, and all of the businesses in the  town were hit by flooding. The owners of Harry's Hardware, which also  serves--this is a real Vermont story--as a bar and the town's only gas  station, were trapped in the building by the floodwaters, which rose  from a trickle to a flood within minutes.   Vermont is still dealing with major infrastructure damage. There were  more than 1,100 damage sites on roads and bridges in the State, causing  significant challenges for commuting in rural areas due to unclear  information on closures. We are still dealing with the recovery from  that.   Over 12 million pounds of debris from the flooding have been cleared,  and the community has stepped up to extract it, as seen on Flood  Recovery Day, where volunteers cleaned up over 100,000 pounds in 1 day.  But there is still much more to go. Other key components of Vermont's  infrastructure and economic drivers--railways, rail and hiking trails,  ski resorts--suffered damage and need to be repaired.   For the vast majority of these business owners, the disaster recovery  loans offered by the Small Business Administration, they are not a  financial reality; it will only force folks into more debt. They need  grants. They need flexibility. They need options.   I want to thank my senior Senator, my colleague Senator Sanders, who  convened a meeting with the FEMA Administrator, with Governor Scott,  and Congresswoman Balint. But the Administrator, Criswell--who is doing  a terrific job, by the way, and Vermonters thank FEMA for their great  work--she was very candid that the FEMA fund is running on vapors. It  needs to be replenished.   So as tough as the situation is--and I do agree we have to avoid the  shutdown--my hope is that, before the end of the day, we will be able  to have included FEMA relief to replenish that fund and make certain  that the good work that FEMA is doing can continue.   It is really a basic question here: No. 1, do we use shutdown threats  and shutdown reality as a tactic? We, in this body, have rejected that.   And the second is, do we find a way to make certain that when  citizens throughout our country--not just Vermont or Hawaii but any  citizens--who are in harm's way when a natural disaster occurs, that we  are here so they can count on us to help them get to the other side?   We have an opportunity to begin the process of keeping government  functioning and rejecting the politics of shutdown threats. And we have  the opportunity to work together again to replenish the FEMA disaster  relief--the farm relief--that is so essential so that our citizens who  have been in harm's way can get the recovery funds that they need.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
