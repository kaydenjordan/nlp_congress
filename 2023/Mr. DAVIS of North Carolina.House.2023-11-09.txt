 Madam Speaker, I am thrilled to  introduce to the American people Lady Pirate Marissa, Pirate Nation's  latest sensation.   She is not just any pirate, mind you, Madam Speaker, she is the first  female live pirate mascot at East Carolina University.   Pirate Marissa's presence has helped to enhance the game day  experience by helping to pump up the crowd and keeping everyone  excited. I believe Pirate Marissa will provide Pirate Steve with all  our university needs to win every sword fight.   Pirate Marissa not only makes her daughters, Rachel, Raelyn, and  Ryliegh proud; she makes us all proud.   A big shout-out to East Carolina University marketing department. I  am  [[Page H5665]]  grateful they have kept the passion and excitement alive in Pirate  Nation and honoring the rich legacy of our official mascot, PeeDee the  Pirate.   People love pirates. No quarter. Go Pirates.   Aargh.                            ____________________
