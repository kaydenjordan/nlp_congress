 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the American  Innovation and R&D Competitiveness Act.   Our country is filled with talented innovators who put their heart  and imagination into new ideas that advance our Nation. Through  research and development, their incredible breakthroughs can come to  fruition.   Unfortunately, the R&D immediate expensing tax provision expired at  the end of 2021, removing the incentive to prioritize research and  development in the United States.   By disincentivizing R&D here at home, American tax policy encourages  manufacturing and production to move abroad. That is why I am  reintroducing bipartisan legislation that encourages R&D throughout the  country.   Sixty-four original cosponsors have joined me and Congressman   John  Larson to make R&D immediate expensing permanent, cementing this  critical tax provision and reestablishing the United States as the  leader in research and development.   Today's research and development dollars create tomorrow's jobs, and  we need to keep R&D dollars inside our country where they can help  strengthen American businesses and workers.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in advancing this  critical legislation.                            ____________________
