 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize  Forsyth Country Day School in Lewisville, North Carolina, on receiving  the National Athletic Trainers' Association Safe Schools Sports Award.  This honor is given to academic institutions that demonstrate  excellence in prioritizing safe athletic programs that keep students  injury-free.   Students' health and safety should always come first. However, often  in our culture, health and safety take a back seat when students face  high pressure to compete and perform. Such risks are counterproductive  to the personal growth that schools like Forsyth Country Day School  strive to foster through their athletic programs.   I applaud Forsyth Country Day School on its authentic dedication to  students' development through athletics. I commend its administrators,  faculty, and coaches for earning this prestigious award.                            ____________________
