 Mr. Speaker, this is a must-pass bill.   Many disabled veterans and their families depend on their veterans'  benefits to pay for things like food and medicine.   For many of these veterans, these payments are a lifeline. In some  cases, these benefits may even be the only income these veterans have.  It is only  [[Page H4259]]  fair that we ensure that the benefits paid to veterans who were injured  during their military service do not lose value because of inflation.   If we don't, it could become hard for people who were injured while  serving this Nation in uniform to keep their heads above water.   H.R. 4958 would financially protect the veterans who protected us by  providing a cost-of-living increase. The amount of the COLA will be the  same increase that Social Security beneficiaries will receive.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Disability Assistance and Memorial  Affairs ranking member, Ms. Esty, for being the lead cosponsor of this  bill with me. This bill has also enjoyed bipartisan support.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4958 and help  disabled veterans and their families keep up with the rising costs of  basic necessities.
