 Madam Speaker, today, we rise to pass a trade deal for  the middle class. Today, we rise to strengthen the protections for the  workers. Today is a great day, for today, we are standing up for our  manufacturers and our manufacturing economy.   To all the suppliers in my district who advocated, who reached out,  who asked for the certainty for their workforce, for the investment,  today, we are getting something done for you. We do not say Republican  or Democrat, but we say manufacturing. We say hoorah for the middle  class, for the growth and the expansion for our middle class.   We came here to champion our manufacturing economy. We came here to  get something done, to reach a compromise, to shed the awful effects of  the original NAFTA, and to deliver yet again for people. That is what  we are here for in our majority.
