 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my colleague,  Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, and the Houston Astros for winning  the 2017 Major League Baseball World Series. The Astros finally earned  history this season by winning their first World Series title.   But they weren't the only ones to earn something by beating my Los  Angeles Dodgers. Congresswoman Jackson Lee also earned some of LA's  iconic Philippe's French dip sandwiches as part of our friendly wager.   We may be on opposing teams when it comes to baseball, but we both  play for the blue team here in Congress, and I look forward to working  with her to fight for working men and women across the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, congratulations to Houston: Houston strong,  and Houston proud.                            ____________________
