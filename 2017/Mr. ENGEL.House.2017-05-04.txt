 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this bill, and  I include in the Record a statement of the American Hospital  Association against the bill.   I just want to say this bill can have a very simple slogan: American  people are going to pay more and get less. That is what this bill does.                 Statement on the American Health Care Act    (By Rick Pollack, President and CEO, American Hospital Association,                              April 27, 2017)         The latest version of the AHCA continues to put health       coverage in jeopardy for many Americans. Our top concern is       what this change could mean for older and sicker patients,       including those with preexisting conditions, such as cancer       patients and those with chronic conditions. For these       reasons, along with our previously stated concerns about the       AHCA, we cannot support the bill. However, we urge Congress       to continue to work with stakeholders on a solution that       provides meaningful coverage.        The amendment proposed this week would dramatically worsen       the bill. The changes included put consumer protections at       greater risk by allowing states to waive the essential health       benefit standards, which could leave patients without access       to critical health services and increase out-of-pocket       spending. This could allow plans to set premium prices based       on individual risk for some consumers, which could       significantly raise costs for those with pre-existing       conditions.        Additionally, the Congressional Budget Office has not yet       scored the amendment. However, CBO previously projected that       the AHCA would result in 24 million fewer people covered in       2026. It is unlikely this amendment would improve these       coverage estimates.        As the backbone of America's health safety-net, hospitals       and health systems must protect access to care for those who       need it and ensure that the most vulnerable patients are not       left behind. The AHCA continues to fall far short of that       goal.
