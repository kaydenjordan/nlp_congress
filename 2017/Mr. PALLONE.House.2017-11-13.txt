 Mr. Speaker, this year's natural disasters have  devastated millions of Americans across the country, leaving so many  with little more than the smartphone in their pocket. But when these  people look to the government for help, they find that too many of the  governments' websites aren't made for the computers they have with them  all the time--their phones. Our bill takes a big step forward in fixing  that issue and helping these Americans get back on their feet. I want  to thank Congresswoman Kelly for championing the Connected Government  Act in the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. I urge my  colleagues to support this common sense bill, and I hope we can secure  passage in the Senate soon.
