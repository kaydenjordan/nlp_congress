 Mr. President, I have just seen the rarest of occurrences  in the so-called debate on these nominees on the floor. We actually had  an explanation of the nominee we would be voting on.   The fact that the Senate's time is taken in a way that it never has  been before to process the President's nominations is outrageous. There  is a view that we need more time to think about the nominee. There is  plenty of time to do that. It is called the committee process. It is  called a vetting process that also may very well take too long now, but  there is plenty of time for these circuit court nominees we are voting  on this week to be vetted. There is plenty of time to ask them  questions. There is plenty of time to look into their backgrounds.   The only reason, in my view, that we take the time we are taking to  do six votes on six judges in a week--that is six 15-minute votes. If  we were efficient enough to do that, it would take an hour and half to  vote on these six judges, and the final vote on none of them would be  different than taking 5 days.   So why do we take 5 days? We take 5 days because that means we can't  get to anything else. That means the President's ability to populate  the government, as people elected him to do, is diminished. It also  eliminates the time we have to do the other work the Senate is designed  to do.   The Senate is in, as the majority leader likes to describe it, the  personnel business, but that is not supposed to be the only business of  the Senate. I think we have now had over 90 of these cloture motions on  nominees that the President has made. What does that mean? In the first  2 years of each of the previous six administrations, there were a total  of 24 cloture motions--24 times in six Presidencies in 2 years did we  do what we are doing right now. That is an average of 4 times--we are  certainly going to be up to 104 times well before the end of 2 years-- the floor was abused in this way, an average of 4 times there was  reason to have a debate.   I haven't looked back at those debates. I guess I should. Wouldn't it  be shocking if those debates were actual debates? Wouldn't it be  stunning if all four of those times in each of those six Presidencies,  when the cloture motion was required and using the maximum time  available was insisted on--or at least a substantial portion of the  maximum time available was insisted on--wouldn't it be something if we  looked back and found that there really was a reason to debate those  nominees?   There might have been someone who was rejected, as John Tower was to  be Secretary of Defense. If you were going to reject one of your  colleagues in the Senate, that was probably a pretty debatable moment,  and maybe it very well justified 20 or 30 hours, the maximum that could  be insisted on. Now that is initially insisted on for everyone. Some of  them take that time. Many of them take a portion of that time.   What is really lost is the other work that could happen in the course  of the week. That is why in 2013 and 2014, when Democrats were in  control of the Senate, a bipartisan group of Senators got together and  said: Let's eliminate a lot of these confirmations that aren't worthy  of Senate time. Let's take people who, when there were only one or two  of them in the whole government  [[Page S2578]]  in 1882, might have been worthy of a Senate debate and Senate vote-- let's take them off the list now that there are 210 of them to be  confirmed. Let's take them off the list. Of course, neither of those  numbers are numbers from the debate, but that is what we did.   Then let's put a whole other group on the list so that if no one  demands a vote, they can be confirmed if the committee recommends they  should be confirmed without a vote. We tried to eliminate the process  so that we could focus in on that rare occasion when there really  should be a debate on the Senate floor about these nominees.   At the end of this week, I will look to see how many minutes were  actually taken talking about these six nominees. It doesn't mean that  the six nominees shouldn't be talked about. It doesn't mean, when you  are going to put someone on a court of appeals for life, that the  Congress shouldn't look carefully at them, but that has already  happened. In some cases, it happened months ago, and in other cases,  weeks ago. That has already happened. This is just a matter of whether  we are going to vote or not. No votes will be persuaded by running the  clock. No votes will be changed by running the clock. Of course, the  power to put people on a Federal bench for life is an important power  given in the Constitution to the President for the Supreme Court and  such other courts as Congress may determine the country needs. It is  not something to be taken lightly, but it is also not something to be  abused.    It is not a process where the protection you might use 4 times in 2  years is suddenly used 90 times in 15 months. Something is wrong when  that has happened to the process.   At the end of the day, the Senate is a place where the minority  deserves to be heard. The Senate is a place where the rights of the  minority--it makes it a unique legislative body, just like electing  only one-third of the Senate every 2 years makes it a unique  legislative body. It takes a long time to change the entire Senate. It  has always been one of the purposes of the Senate is to be sure the  minority had a chance to be heard, and the minority is always able to  hold on to that right until the minority decides they are going to  abuse that right.   When a right becomes an entitled, ``Oh, it says we can have up to 30  hours of debate so we are going to insist on it every single time,''  that is when that right is in jeopardy. That is when you run the risk  of losing that right.    Mr. President, on May 5, 1984, former President Ronald  Reagan issued a proclamation designating the first week in May as  National Correctional Officers Week. He did so ``in recognition of the  contributions of correctional officers to our Nation.'' I believe it is  important to continue to recognize the contributions and critical work  that correctional officers engage in on a daily basis, often risking  their own safety in the course of carrying out their duties.   Correctional officers are tasked with keeping inmates safe, as well  as the thousands of staff supporting the operation of correctional  facilities. Our Nation's correctional officers are not only an integral  part of the criminal justice system, but they play a key role in  helping maintain public safety.   Correctional officers are also placed in a unique position to have  meaningful interactions with incarcerated individuals. It is not  uncommon for correctional officers to provide the prisoner population  with the support and resources they need to succeed after their release  so that inmates are able to become productive members of society.   During National Correctional Officers Week, we are reminded of the  service and sacrifice of correctional officers. I wish to take this  opportunity to thank the over 400,000 correctional officers in the  United States for the often thankless job that they do. I ask my  colleagues to join me in honoring these key public servants.                            ____________________
