 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 635 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:  [[Page H9530]]                                     H. Res. 635         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 4182) to amend title 5, United States Code, to       modify probationary periods with respect to positions within       the competitive service and the Senior Executive Service, and       for other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be       dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the       bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. The bill shall be considered as read. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. No       amendment to the bill shall be in order except those printed       in the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution. Each such amendment may be offered only in the       order printed in the report, may be offered only by a Member       designated in the report, shall be considered as read, shall       be debatable for the time specified in the report equally       divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent,       shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject       to a demand for division of the question in the House or in       the Committee of the Whole. All points of order against such       amendments are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 1699) to amend       the Truth in Lending Act to modify the definitions of a       mortgage originator and a high-cost mortgage, to amend the       Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of       2008 to modify the definition of a loan originator, and for       other purposes. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. An amendment in the nature of a       substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print       115-42 shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended,       shall be considered as read. All points of order against       provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as       amended, and on any further amendment thereto, to final       passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of       debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Financial       Services; and (2) one motion to recommit with or without       instructions.    The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Marshall). The gentleman from Georgia is  recognized for 1 hour.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to my friend from New York (Ms. Slaughter),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to my friend from New York (Ms. Slaughter),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Georgia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I just had a chance to visit with my  colleague from New York. We were talking about, well, the same thing  all Members talk about when they get together: those things they have  in common, those things that make their day a little bit better, those  things they are struggling with that make their day a little bit worse.   I regret that so often we come to the House floor and the debate that  we are having seems like we just have absolutely nothing in common  whatsoever. I am sure it has been your experience. I think you can ask  any freshman Member of this institution, Mr. Speaker, ``What is the  biggest surprise you have had in your first year in Congress?'' and  they will say, ``I am surprised at how hardworking and conscientious  and diligent and committed absolutely every single one of my colleagues  is, because I was reading in the local paper back home, and it sounded  like it was a big cesspool there in Washington, D.C. I am pleasantly  surprised at how sincere my colleagues are at working for their 700,000  to 800,000 constituents back home.''   Mr. Speaker, we have two bills that this rule makes in order for  debate today, and they are two bills that I will tell you are  incredibly well intentioned. I plan to support them. I plan to  enthusiastically support them, but they are on issues that are hard in  their minutia.   The first bill that is made in order today under a closed rule, Mr.  Speaker, is H.R. 1699. It is the Preserving Access to Manufactured  Housing Act. We had testimony in the committee yesterday, and the  discussion was how do we protect buyers of manufactured housing from  being exploited while still enabling those Americans who don't have  other avenues for purchasing housing to get into that most affordable  of housing, manufactured housing. We have common goals to protect  people and to empower people, but how do we get that done?   This bill was worked through committee. I believe it is a good  compromise. We didn't allow any amendments to this. There were no  germane amendments presented in committee, so that is coming under a  closed rule today.   This rule also would make in order a structured rule for H.R. 4182,  the Ensuring a Qualified Civil Service Act of 2017.   Again, Mr. Speaker, when you go and read the headlines, it makes it  sound like every discussion on Capitol Hill is among a bunch of  partisan hacks. It is just not true.   The civil service, an incredibly important part of American  Government, has dedicated men and women who show up every day to  institute the laws that you and I pass, to be the interpreters of the  bridge between the laws that we pass and the way they hit folks on the  ground. We all want those employees to be protected from the swinging  pendulum of partisanship.   I don't want a Republican President to get elected and fire all the  Democrats serving in government. There are some bright-minded  scientists, some great folks in law enforcement, some really talented  people in education. I don't want them to lose their jobs because of  the partisanship of a President.   Similarly, I don't want to see a Democratic President get elected and  fire all the folks who are Republicans. There are some fantastic  Republican minds in our Department of Agriculture helping our farmers  to succeed, our Department of Labor helping our workers to succeed. You  go right on down the list, there are strong men and women helping folks  to succeed.   But we are also facing a reality that that same civil service system  that seeks to protect those hardworking, those exceptional workers  trying to serve America, that same system that works to protect them  also protects folks who are completely derelict in their  responsibilities.   We had that discussion as a conference, as a House. In fact, in a  bicameral discussion, it went to the President's desk for his  signature, as it came to the VA, to say: Can't we do more to reform a  civil service system, to reform Federal labor union provisions so that  folks who need the protection, because they are exceptional, continue  to be protected; but those folks who are failing our veterans, that  those folks cease to be protected from a system that seeks to require  accountability? We passed that together. We did that together here, Mr.  Speaker. We sent it to the Senate. They did it together. The President  signed it into law.   This Ensuring a Qualified Civil Service Act does one thing and one  thing only: it extends the probationary period of a new civil service  worker from the current 1 year to 2 years.   The Department of Defense has done this already, and it has been  working exceedingly well for them. The concern is: Have I been able to  adequately assess an employee's ability to perform in a 12-month  period?   We are committed to trying to train people up, Mr. Speaker. Nobody is  trying to run folks out before they have had a chance to learn their  job. The question is: Is a year long enough to uncover the flaws in an  employee or is 2 years a wider window?   You will hear folks on the other side say: Rob, why in the world  can't you all figure out if an employee is talented in year one?   That is fair.   They will say: Rob, if you are going to train somebody up, why  couldn't you get it done in year one?  [[Page H9531]]    That is fair.   But as the GAO has looked at this issue, what they found is managers  aren't getting that done in year one. Whether it is because they are  ineffective as managers or whether it is because they keep trying to  give people a second chance and get them trained up is an open  question. This bill mandates nothing, but it allows this 2-year window  so that managers can give their new employees a good first, second, and  third look.   The data suggests that once folks get fully protected by the civil  service system, it is very difficult to move underperforming employees  out. That work should be done during this probationary period. This  bill aims to lengthen that probationary period to 2 years.   Mr. Speaker, reasonable men and women can disagree on these measures.  I believe they are important steps in the right direction. But what  gives me so much pleasure to come to the floor to bring this rule to  you today is the earnestness with which these two bills were presented.   These are common challenges: How do we ensure the very best staff for  the American people? How do we ensure access to homes and protection  for home buyers for the American people? These are sincere concerns,  legitimate disagreements.   If we pass this rule today, we will enable a debating period. We will  bring these bills to the floor so that we can air our concerns and  challenge our assumptions. I hope, at the end of the day, my colleagues  will decide to support this rule and to support the two underlying  pieces of legislation.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds just to let my  colleagues know that this bill passed out of committee by more than a  2-1 margin, a big bipartisan vote out of committee to reform  manufactured housing to provide more access.   Mr. Speaker, I don't profess to be an expert on that, so I yield 5  minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr), one of my colleagues  from the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), a good friend and authority on the issue.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), a good friend and authority on the issue.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), a good friend and authority on the issue.    Mr. Speaker, I would share with the gentlewoman from New  York that I have no further speakers remaining, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H9534]]    Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman raises a lot of important points. I am  absolutely concerned about funding the United States Government, but,  sadly, in a way that has become systemic as we talk about who we are as  a people, Mr. Speaker, we can either be glasses half full or we can be  glasses half empty.   Is it true that the number of days we have left in this continuing  resolution are limited?   It is.   Is it also true that this House has fully funded the government ahead  of schedule for the first time since the good people of the Seventh  District elected me to Congress?   It is.   This House has nothing to be ashamed of. In fact, this House should  be shouting it from the rooftops:         The United States Constitution gives the United States       Congress a job to do. The House has done its. Senate, get to       work.    This is the first time, Mr. Speaker, that we have been able to fund  all the appropriations bills--there are 12 of them--before the end of  the fiscal year since I was elected in 2011. The Senate has passed, I  believe, zero appropriations bills so far this year.   Mr. Speaker, let's not give anybody a pass on getting the good work  done. Let's do hold people accountable, but let's not chastise  ourselves and create an atmosphere of failure.   Success begets success. We succeeded together for the first time in a  long time. Let's not waste that opportunity to get that bill across the  floor of the Senate.   Similarly, Mr. Speaker, we are talking about civil service  protections today. There is not a man or a woman in this Chamber who  doesn't want the absolute best Federal workforce that we could find;  not one.   The question today is: Do we lock you in and give you all of those  ironclad protections that every American knows the civil service system  offers?   We all know that it is hard to get fired from a government job. We  all know that.   Should we extend the probationary period where folks can be  monitored, trained up, disciplined, worked with from 1 year to 2 years?   If that gets us a better Federal workforce to serve the American  people, the answer should be a unanimous yes.   I say to my friends who oppose this bill: If it doesn't end up in  that result, I will vote with you to repeal it. But I believe it will  end up with a more highly qualified workforce, that it will end up with  an American taxpayer who feels like they are getting their money's  worth.    I will tell you the best thing we can do for our civil service  employees is to end the narrative that civil service is a place of  failure instead of a place of success, it is to end the narrative that  substandard people work for the Federal Government as opposed to  exceptional people work for the Federal Government.   I represent employees of the CDC in my part of the world, Mr.  Speaker. The Centers for Disease Control is second to no one in the  intellectual firepower that they assemble to serve the American people.  Those men and women put themselves in harm's way to battle those  pandemics that scare the bejesus out of the rest of us. They do it as  an act of service, and they should be praised for it.   The best thing we can do for them is to make sure folks don't slip  through the cracks and they get saddled with a substandard partner. We  want them to have access to an exceptional partner. This bill would do  that.   Mr. Speaker, as to access to manufactured housing, the bill from my  friend from Kentucky, it is absolutely true that every man and woman in  this Chamber wants to protect the American consumer from predatory  lending. That is undisputed. But as my friend in Kentucky stated, when  do we protect someone right out of the opportunity to have a home? In  the name of protecting people, when do we fail those very same people?   We had testimony in the committee yesterday, Mr. Speaker, presented  credit union after credit union after credit union that would no longer  loan money to its members to purchase a manufactured home. They  wouldn't do it. They couldn't do it.   Talk about predatory lending if you want to; it is not your local  credit union that is doing it. Talk about big Wall Street banks  exploiting people if you want to; it is not your local credit union who  is doing it.   Talk about people who want to build your community; it is your local  credit union.                                time  1315    Yet credit union after credit union said: The men and women whom we  strive to serve, we will no longer help access the American Dream. We  can't. Why? Because of the regulations coming out of Washington, D.C.   Do we want to protect the American consumer? We do, and we can, but  we can't protect them right out of home ownership. We shouldn't, yet we  have.   Passing this bill today that my friend from Kentucky brings forward  corrects that mistake, puts us back on track for protecting consumers  and enabling consumers.   Mr. Speaker, you can pick any day of the week on Capitol Hill, and  you can find a way to describe everything that goes on as nefarious, as  misguided, as contrived. But, Mr. Speaker, you can also look at days on  Capitol Hill and see the earnestness with which men and women work  together to move this country forward. That is the day we have today. I  hope it is the day we have tomorrow and the next day and the next day.   I urge my friends, support this rule. Support bringing this bill to  the floor for manufactured housing. Support bringing this bill to the  floor to improve the civil service system.   We can do that with a vote right now, Mr. Speaker.   The material previously referred to by Ms. Slaughter is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 635 Offered by Ms. Slaughter         At the end of the revolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       3440) to authorize the cancellation of removal and adjustment       of status of certain individuals who are long-term United       States residents and who entered the United States as       children and for other purposes. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 3440.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate  [[Page H9535]]       vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous  question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.
