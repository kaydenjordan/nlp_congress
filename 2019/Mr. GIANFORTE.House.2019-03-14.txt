 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a trailblazing  Montanan as we celebrate Women's History Month.   A fearless, principled leader, Jeannette Rankin was a courageous  pioneer. The daughter of a rancher and a teacher, she was born and  raised in Montana. Growing up, she helped on her family's ranch and, in  1902, graduated from what is now the University of Montana.   As a staunch advocate for women's suffrage, she successfully led  efforts to secure women the right to vote in Montana in 1914, 6 years  before the 19th Amendment to our Constitution was ratified.   Four years before women could vote throughout our Nation, Montanans  elected Jeannette Rankin to Congress. She was the first woman to serve  in this body.   Dedicated to her guiding principles, Jeannette Rankin is foundational  to Montana's and our country's history. It is my distinct honor to  recognize her for her lasting contributions to our country during  Women's History Month.                            ____________________
