 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Sexual  Harassment Independent Investigations and Prosecution Act, also known  as the SHIIP Act, which addresses longstanding systemic problems in the  way that the military investigates and prosecutes sexual harassment. I  thank Senators Booker, Gillibrand, and Feinstein for being original  cosponsors and Representative Speier for introducing this important  legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives.   It has been 2 years since Army SPC Vanessa Guillen was murdered after  she reported being sexually harassed by another servicemember. Her  tragic death was the catalyst to an investigation that led the  Independent Review Commission to recommend key changes to the way the  Department of Defense handles sexual assault and sexual harassment.  Some of these changes, including the codification of sexual harassment  as a crime, were established last year through the Fiscal Year 2022  National Defense Authorization Act. Others, unfortunately, were left  out.   We must continue to build on the important work of the Independent  Review Commission and the steps taken in the Fiscal Year 2022 National  Defense Authorization Act for the sake of our servicemembers. This  includes codifying the requirement that any sexual harassment or  assault complaint to be reviewed by a third-party investigator outside  the chain of command. This change is essential to restoring the trust  between soldiers and their superiors. Servicemembers would no longer  have to fear their voices being stifled or dismissed altogether.   That is why I am introducing the SHIIP Act to require that all  complaints of sexual assault and harassment be reviewed by a specially  trained investigator outside the chain of command. The provisions in  this legislation will move prosecutorial decisions on sexual harassment  cases to the new special trial counsel, created by the Fiscal Year 2022  National Defense Authorization Act, and require that independent sexual  harassment investigators be outside the chain of command and trained to  investigate sexual harassment. These changes are essential to ensure  servicemembers feel safe reporting any misconduct and that their  complaints are investigated properly.   I urge my colleagues to pass the SHIIP Act as another step forward  toward restoring faith in the military justice system.                                  ______                                         By Mr. REED (for himself, Mrs. Capito, Mr. Van Hollen, and Ms.          Murkowski):   S. 4120. A bill to maximize discovery, and accelerate development and  availability, of promising childhood cancer treatments, and for other  purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
