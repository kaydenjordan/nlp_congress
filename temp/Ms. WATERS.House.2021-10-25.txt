 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4111) to require the Secretary of the Treasury to direct the  United States Executive Director at the International Monetary Fund to  advocate that the Fund provide technical assistance to Fund members  seeking to enhance their capacity to evaluate the legal and financial  terms of sovereign debt contracts, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4111         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Sovereign Debt Contract       Capacity Act''.  [[Page H5839]]            SEC. 2. SUPPORT TO ENHANCE THE CAPACITY OF INTERNATIONAL                     MONETARY FUND MEMBERS TO EVALUATE THE LEGAL AND                     FINANCIAL TERMS OF SOVEREIGN DEBT CONTRACTS.         (a) In General.--Title XVI of the International Financial       Institutions Act (22 U.S.C. 262p-262p-13) is amended by       adding at the end the following:       ``SEC. 1630. SUPPORT TO ENHANCE THE CAPACITY OF FUND MEMBERS                     TO EVALUATE THE LEGAL AND FINANCIAL TERMS OF                     SOVEREIGN DEBT CONTRACTS.         ``The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United       States Executive Director at the International Monetary Fund       to use the voice and vote of the United States to advocate       that the Fund promote international standards and best       practices with respect to sovereign debt contracts and       provide technical assistance to Fund members, and in       particular to lower middle-income countries and countries       eligible to receive assistance from the International       Development Association, seeking to enhance their capacity to       evaluate the legal and financial terms of sovereign debt       contracts with multilateral, bilateral, and private sector       creditors.''.        (b) Report to the Congress.--Within 1 year after the date       of the enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter for the       next 4 years, the Secretary of the Treasury shall report to       the Committee on Financial Services of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the       Senate on--        (1) the activities of the International Monetary Fund in       the then most recently completed fiscal year to provide       technical assistance described in section 1630 of the       International Financial Institutions Act, including the       ability of the Fund to meet the demand for the assistance;       and        (2) the efficacy of efforts by the United States to achieve       the policy goal described in such section and any further       actions that should be taken, if necessary, to implement that       goal.        (c) Sunset.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall       have no force or effect after the 5-year period that begins       with the date of the enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on  this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, the Financial Services Subcommittee  on National Security, International Development and Monetary Policy  held a hearing on China's lending practices and their impact on the  international sovereign debt architecture. The hearing examined China's  dominant position as the largest official creditor in the world, with  China's outstanding claims larger than those of all other bilateral  creditors combined. We also examined how China lends with respect to  the terms and conditions China imposes on borrowing countries through  its sovereign debt contracts.   Among the witnesses who testified were authors of a recent study that  examined 100 China sovereign debt contracts, which found that since  2014, every sovereign debt contract examined contained strict  nondisclosure requirements that prohibited the borrower from disclosing  the terms of, and even the existence of, the debt itself.   Many of the contracts examined sought to elevate Chinese Government  loans over other creditors by requiring the creation of China- controlled offshore collateral accounts and by explicitly prohibiting  the debt from being included in any multilateral debt restructuring  initiative.   The study also found a number of contracts with cross-default and  accelerated payment provisions that give China substantial leverage  over an array of domestic and foreign policy decisions that a borrowing  country might undertake.   The absence of transparency not only prevents citizens from holding  their governments accountable for their borrowing decisions, but it  also obscures a country's true financial picture from other creditors,  which can undermine sovereign debt rescheduling operations that are  based on systems of trust and equitable burden sharing among all of a  country's creditors.   For example, in Zambia, one of three countries that has applied for  debt relief under the new G20 Common Framework initiative, new  revelations about undisclosed Chinese debt nearly doubled its total  official amount owed from $3.4 billion to $6.6 billion.   Opacity also creates greater opportunity for political capture and  corruption and undermines debt risk management and surveillance work.   It was this context in which I introduced, with Ranking Member  Patrick McHenry, H.R. 4111, the Sovereign Debt Contract Capacity Act,  which directs the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the United  States executive director at the International Monetary Fund to use the  influence of the United States at the IMF to advocate that the Fund  provide technical assistance to bolster the capacity of developing  country debt managers to evaluate and negotiate both the financial and  the legal terms in sovereign debt contracts.   It is important that this kind of capacity building also be available  through multilateral channels like the IMF, which have a wider global  reach. Multilateral approaches can also be more effective since  national programs risk being perceived as an instrument of power  politics and beholden to certain interest groups within a country.   To be sure, some countries sign bad contracts for the wrong reasons,  including corruption and governance problems. In a country that is  running up oppressive, hidden debt because its leaders are corrupt,  training is not going to help a lot. But ensuring that technical  assistance is available to any developing country that requests help in  assessing the technical, legal complexities of sovereign debt contracts  would be an important step in reform of the sovereign debt crisis  management system.   Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   In closing, I want to note that H.R. 4111 also directs the U.S. to  advocate for the IMF to develop and promote a shared understanding of  standard terms and sound practices with respect to sovereign debt  contracts.   Officials for countries that sign oppressive debt contracts are often  told that the proposed terms are market standard where either there is  no standard or where the standard is quite different from what is being  proposed. This would be another positive reform of the sovereign debt  architecture.   I would like to thank Ranking Member McHenry for working with me on  this important bill. H.R. 4111 has been endorsed by Oxfam, Bread for  the World, ONE, and the AFL-CIO.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2989) to amend securities and banking laws to make the  information reported to financial regulatory agencies electronically  searchable, to further enable the development of RegTech and Artificial  Intelligence applications, to put the United States on a path towards  building a comprehensive Standard Business Reporting program to  ultimately harmonize and reduce the private sector's regulatory  compliance burden, while enhancing transparency and accountability, and  for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2989         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on  this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2989, the Financial  Transparency Act of 2021.   As chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, I would like  to thank Representative Maloney for her leadership on this bill, as  well as Representative McHenry, the ranking member of the committee,  for working on this bill in a bipartisan manner.  [[Page H5847]]    The Financial Transparency Act takes a proactive approach to  modernizing our data standards and publication protocols within the  financial services industry. This bill requires that the SEC, FDIC,  OCC, CFPB, Federal Reserve, NCUA, and FHFA work with the Treasury  Department to adopt data standards for the information it collects and  to upgrade their reporting requirements so that reported data is stored  in an open, searchable, and accessible manner.   The bill also ensures that these standards are created in a  coordinated manner to enable searchability across these agencies,  helping to catch bad actors more easily while promoting greater  transparency and trust from the public in our financial system.   In this digital age, it is imperative that our regulators keep up  with our rapidly changing financial markets and utilize technology in a  way that safeguards our data while promoting the safety and soundness  of our financial system. This bill puts the United States on equal  footing with many other countries that already have begun using  searchable data formats in submissions to regulators.   This commonsense bill would also benefit retail investors, as they  will be able to search through publicly available documents, rather  than having to manually save each document in order to extract the  information they want.   In addition, companies that analyze this data will be able to more  quickly report their findings to the public, helping better inform the  investing public about the state of our capital markets.                                time  1715    H.R. 2989 will also benefit regulated entities, like banks, credit  unions, asset managers, and public companies, as they will now have  clearly delineated criteria and frameworks to upload their data,  ensuring consistent data standards and the ability for financial  institutions to do more efficient compliance tasks that must be  performed manually today.   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                        Committee on Agriculture,                                   Washington, DC, October 25, 2021.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Chairwoman, Committee on Financial Services,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Madam Chairwoman: This letter confirms our mutual       understanding regarding H.R. 2989, the Financial Transparency       Act of 2021. Thank you for collaborating with the Committee       on Agriculture on the matters within our jurisdiction.        The Committee on Agriculture will forego any further       consideration of this bill so that it may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor for consideration. However,       by foregoing consideration at this time, we do not waive any       jurisdiction over any subject matter contained in this or       similar legislation. We request that our Committee be       consulted and involved as this bill moves forward so that we       may address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. The       Committee on Agriculture also reserves the right to seek       appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any       House-Senate conference involving this or similar legislation       and ask that you support any such request.        We would appreciate a response to this letter confirming       this understanding with respect to H.R. 2989, and request       that a copy of our letters on this matter be published in the       Congressional Record during Floor consideration.            Sincerely,                                                       David Scott,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                 Committee on Financial Services,                                   Washington, DC, October 25, 2021.      Hon. David Scott,      Chairman, House Committee on Agriculture,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mister Chairman: I writing to acknowledge your letter       dated October 25, 2021, regarding the waiver by the Committee       on Agriculture of any jurisdictional claims over the matters       contained in H.R. 2989, the ``Financial Transparency Act of       2021.'' The Committee on Financial Services confirms our       mutual understanding that your Committee does not waive any       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or       similar legislation, and your Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as this bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues       within your jurisdiction.        The Committee on Financial Services further recognizes your       interest in appointment of outside conferees from the       Committee on Agriculture should this bill or similar language       be considered in a conference with the Senate.        Pursuant to your request, I will ensure that this exchange       of letters is included in the Congressional Record during       Floor consideration of the bill. I appreciate your       cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to       continuing to work with you as this measure moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                     Maxine Waters,                                                        Chairwoman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), the sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time until Mrs. Wagner  yields.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.    Mr. Speaker, I would again like to state that I support this  bipartisan bill. The Financial Transparency Act of 2021 helps modernize  our regulatory framework so that government, private industry, and the  public all benefit.   Now more than ever, it makes sense for Congress to harness technology  in a manner that provides greater transparency, accountability, and  efficiency, and this bill does exactly that.   I want to thank Representative Maloney and Ranking Member McHenry for  working with my staff in a bipartisan manner to get this bill across  the finish line.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2265) to amend the Investment Company Act of 1940 to  postpone the date of payment or satisfaction upon redemption of certain  securities in the case of the financial exploitation of specified  adults, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2265         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  on this legislation and insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2265, the Financial  Exploitation Prevention Act of 2021, sponsored by the gentlewoman from  Missouri (Mrs. Wagner).   It is not a surprise that adults over the age of 65 are sometimes the  targets for financial exploitation and have become victims of financial  crimes more than any other demographic. Just last week, in its annual  report on elder fraud and abuse, the Department of Justice reported  that in 2020 alone, seniors suffered over $1 billion in financial  losses due to fraud.   Unlike other adults, seniors are often dependent on their savings to  support them in retirement, making any fraud that much harder to  recover from. Brokers and investment managers, who often stand in as  the stewards of the savings of seniors, are in a unique position to  protect elders from financial crimes.   In 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission released a policy  letter, called a no-action letter, stating that the Commission would  not take an enforcement action against the agents of an investment  company, including mutual funds, if the person paused a payment or  redemption based on the suspicion of financial exploitation. This pause  on cashing out the savings of a senior can provide invaluable time to  ensure that the redemption is consistent with the will of the senior.   H.R. 2265 would codify this SEC letter. It would also make two  further changes to describe how a mutual fund adviser can establish the  process at each fund to protect seniors.   I thank Mrs. Wagner for working with my staff to craft the language  in this bill. This is a helpful piece of legislation that will provide  one more tool to market participants to protect investors and, in  particular, our Nation's retirees.   I urge Members to support H.R. 2265, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further Democratic speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5142) to award posthumously a Congressional Gold Medal, in  commemoration to the servicemembers who perished in Afghanistan on  August 26, 2021, during the evacuation of citizens of the United States  and Afghan allies at Hamid Karzai International Airport, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5142         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. FINDINGS.         The Congress finds the following:        (1) At 9:44 A.M., on August 26, 2021, the Pentagon       confirmed that one explosion occurred at the Hamid Karzai       International Airport.        (2) The explosion was confirmed to be a suicide bombing by       ISIS-K terrorist group.        (3) Estimates as high as 200 deaths were reported,       including 13 servicemembers of the United States, as well as       hundreds more wounded.        (4) The attack on Thursday, August 26, 2021, at the Hamid       Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, killed 13       United States servicemembers, making it the deadliest single       day of the war for the United States in more than a decade.        (5) The American servicemembers went above and beyond the       call of duty to protect citizens of the United States and our       allies to ensure they are brought to safety in an extremely       dangerous situation as the Taliban regained control over       Afghanistan.        (6) The American servicemembers exemplified extreme bravery       and valor against armed enemy combatants.        (7) The American servicemembers dedicated their lives and       their heroism deserves great honor.        (8) Maxton Soviak, Kareem Nikoui, David Espinoza, Rylee       McCollum, Jared Schmitz, Hunter Lopez, Taylor Hoover, Daegan       William-Tyeler Page, Nicole Gee, Humberto Sanchez, Dylan       Merola, Johanny Rosario Pichardo, and Ryan Knauss have been       identified as the 13 servicemembers who died from the blast       while stationed at Hamid Karzai International Airport.       SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDALS.
