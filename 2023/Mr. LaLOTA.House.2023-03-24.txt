 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet on Monday next, when it shall  convene at noon for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative  business.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of International  Women's Month and the important protections given to women and girls  under Title IX.   As a father of three young and wonderful girls, all of whom play  sports, I understand the importance of celebrating female sports and  the incredible opportunities and protections under Title IX.   Unfortunately, some people want to erode these important protections  by allowing biological men to compete alongside and against women and  girls.   A young woman having to compete against a biological young man who is  often built different and bigger just isn't fair. It deprives young  women of a fair sense of competition. It deprives them of the  confidence that comes from practicing and winning.   Mr. Speaker, Congress must act to protect our daughters; to give them  a fair chance to compete; and to uphold the protections granted to them  by Title IX.
