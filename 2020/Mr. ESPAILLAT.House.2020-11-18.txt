SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term       ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--        (A) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on       Appropriations of the House of Representatives; and        (B) the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on       Appropriations of the Senate.        (2) Beneficiary countries.--The term ``beneficiary       countries'' means the beneficiary countries of the Caribbean       Basin Security Initiative.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous material on H.R. 7703.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I first want to thank Chairman Engel for his leadership  of the Foreign Affairs Committee and his role in passing this important  bill.   I also want to thank my colleague, Mr. Rooney, a staunch supporter of  the Caribbean, for leading this bill with me, and Ranking Member McCaul  for his collaboration.   The Caribbean Basin Security Initiative is a vital tool to combat the  illicit drug trade, promote good government, and improve civil society.  The international narcotics trade has a devastating impact across our  hemisphere, and much of the demand for illegal drugs, unfortunately,  comes from right here in the U.S.   We have worked hard to stop drug trafficking and combat corruption in  Central America and Mexico, but all too often, our allies in the  Caribbean are overlooked.   The Caribbean is our third border and, for decades, has been growing  as a hub for the illegal and illicit drug trade. Proper investment in  the Caribbean will help to improve our allies' capacity to combat  transnational crime, violence, and regional instability, while also  enhancing our security.   Crime from the drug trade has rattled many of our allies in the  region, and this funding will go to programs that interdict  traffickers, provide programming for at-risk youth, and improve the  independence of the judicial system in those Caribbean countries.   This bill also adds a focus on disaster resilience, given the  increasingly frequent and worsening hurricanes in the region, which I  believe is of primary importance as we continue to see the impact of  climate change on national and regional security.   We have seen the success of the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative  over the last decade, and this bill will build on the success by  authorizing $74.8 million per year for the next 5 years to further  deepen our commitment to that region.   By partnering to increase the security and stability of our Caribbean  allies as we combat the narcotics trade, we will also be reducing the  flow of illicit drugs into the United States.   I believe CBSI is a crucial program, and I ask my colleagues to join  in bolstering it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from the Virgin  Islands an additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, this is an important bill, and I urge my  colleagues to support it. I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to  the resolution (H. Res. 672) expressing support of the Three Seas  Initiative in its efforts to increase energy independence and  infrastructure connectivity thereby strengthening the United States and  European national security, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 672         Whereas, in 2015, 12 Central and European nations of the       European Union established the Three Seas Initiative to       increase energy, infrastructure, and digital communications       autonomy and resilience through support of collective       financing for new infrastructure projects to connect the       region between the Adriatic, Baltic, and Black Seas;        Whereas the United States pledged support and willingness       to serve as a steadfast partner of the Three Seas       Initiative's effort at the July 2017 Warsaw summit;        Whereas, in February 2020, the Secretary of State announced       a United States commitment of up to $1,000,000,000 in       financing for Three Seas Initiative countries to promote       energy security and economic growth;        Whereas the Three Seas Initiative will advance economic       growth, resilience, transport and digital connectivity, and       energy security in this strategic region, thereby increasing       the national security of the United States;        Whereas the President of the European Commission recognized       the Three Seas Initiative as a ``catalyst for the cohesion       and convergence of the EU and for the strengthening of the       transatlantic link'';        Whereas Soviet-imposed communist rule in Central and       Eastern Europe left the region with a significant       infrastructure deficit, especially in the realm of north-      south transportation and energy lines;        Whereas the current state of infrastructure in Central and       Eastern Europe nations restricts energy, water, and       telecommunications interconnectivity across the region;        Whereas the infrastructure deficit leaves these nations       overly dependent on Russia for their energy and additional       economic needs;        Whereas Russia seeks to undermine democratic institutions       and liberty in Europe through hybrid means, including using       energy as a tool for coercion;        Whereas Russian gas pipeline projects, such as Nord Stream       II and Turk Stream, are political and seek to undermine       Europe's energy security;        Whereas the Three Seas Initiative provides a positive       alternative for financing for transport, energy and digital       connectivity projects in the Three Seas region to China's       17+1 and Belt and Road Initiatives, which have exported       corruption, debt traps, and poor labor and environmental       standards;        Whereas diversification of energy sources and supply       routes, including development of renewable energy sources and       technology, is critical to bolstering energy security;        Whereas members of the Three Seas Initiative have       prioritized key energy projects such as the Krk, Croatia LNG       terminal, Gas Interconnector Republic of Poland-Republic of       Lithuania, the Bulgaria-Romania-Hungary-Austria (BRUA) gas       interconnector, and other cross-border interconnections;        Whereas members of the Three Seas Initiative have also       prioritized key digital infrastructure and transportation       projects to support modern and vibrant economies including       the Three Seas Initiative Digital Highway, the Viking Train,       the Adriatic TEN-T Core Network Corridor, and the FAIRway       Danube, among others; and        Whereas the Three Seas Initiative includes vital allies of       the United States: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) supports the Three Seas Initiative in its efforts to       increase energy resilience and infrastructure connectivity       across Central and Eastern Europe and to further the process       of building a Europe that is undivided, secure, prosperous,       and free;        (2) encourages Three Seas Initiative nations to take action       on joint financing of projects to strengthen energy,       infrastructure, and digital communications projects in       Central and Eastern Europe, including through national       contributions to the Three Seas Initiative Infrastructure       Fund;        (3) reaffirms the authority of the President under the       Build Act of 2018 (division F of Public Law 115-254) to       provide United States financing to the Three Seas Initiative       and its projects in cases that advance national economic or       foreign policy interests of the United States and would       produce significant developmental outcomes or provide       developmental benefits to the poorest population;        (4) reaffirms the authority of the United States       International Development Finance Corporation under the       European Energy Security and Diversification Act of 2019       (title XX of division P of Public Law 116-94) to provide       support for the Three Seas Initiative and its energy       infrastructure projects in countries with upper-middle-income       or high-income economies in cases described in paragraph (3)       or if such support is necessary to preempt or counter efforts       by a strategic competitor of the United States to secure       significant political or economic leverage or  [[Page H5903]]       acquire national security-sensitive technologies or       infrastructure in a country that is an ally or partner of the       United States;        (5) encourages the Three Seas Initiative member nations to       boost cross-border cooperation and financing on       diversification of energy sources, including clean energy       sources and infrastructure;        (6) encourages Three Seas Initiative nations to extend this       vision of enhanced regional infrastructural connectivity to       non-European Union member states in the Three Seas region,       including Ukraine, Moldova, and those in the Western Balkans;       and        (7) strongly condemns any efforts of Russia to weaponize       energy as a means to put pressure on or to undermine liberty       and democracy in Europe.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include in the Record any extraneous material on H. Res. 672.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation, and I  would like to thank Congresswoman Kaptur for her leadership and hard  work. This is a strong, bipartisan resolution that seeks to promote and  encourage Europe's independence from Russia's coercive energy influence  and ensure greater interconnectivity of infrastructure in the region.   Our Eastern European allies and partners know all too well the need  to get out from under Russia's stranglehold on the region's energy  resources, and this resolution sends an important message that Congress  stands with our close friends as they look to build up their own  capacity.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), who is the author of this important resolution.    Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank Congresswoman  Kaptur for her work on this measure and for being an advocate for  energy security and the United States-European cooperation on this  particular issue.   Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to support this measure, I urge all  Members to do the same, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to  the resolution (H. Res. 1145) condemning the poisoning of Russian  opposition leader Alexei Navalny and calling for a robust United States  and international response, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 1145         Whereas Alexei Navalny is a well-known anticorruption       activist and leader of the political opposition in Russia;        Whereas Mr. Navalny garnered 27 percent of the vote in the       2013 Moscow mayoral election;        Whereas since that election, Mr. Navalny and his party have       been repeatedly denied the opportunity to compete in       elections;        Whereas Mr. Navalny has been imprisoned multiple times for       participating in unsanctioned protests;        Whereas Mr. Navalny was attacked twice with a chemical       substance in 2017 and potentially poisoned in 2019 while in       prison;        Whereas over the years a number of Russian journalists,       human rights activists, politicians, whistleblowers, and       others have been killed or died under mysterious       circumstances, in Russia and overseas, including--        (1) former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko (in London) and       investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya in 2006;        (2) human rights lawyer Stanislav Markelov, journalist       Anastasia Baburova, whistleblower lawyer Sergei Magnitsky,       and human rights activist Natalya Estemirova in 2009; and        (3) opposition politician Boris Nemtsov in 2015;        Whereas, on August 20, 2020, Mr. Navalny fell ill while on       a domestic flight in Russia;        Whereas, on August 22, 2020, Mr. Navalny was evacuated by       airlift from Omsk, Russia, to Berlin, Germany, for his       protection and to ensure he would receive a high standard of       health care to improve his chances of recovery;        Whereas German chemical weapons experts conducted tests and       found ``unequivocal'' evidence that Mr. Navalny had been       poisoned with a Soviet-era military-grade chemical nerve       agent from the Novichok group;        Whereas specialized laboratories in France and Sweden       confirmed that Mr. Navalny was poisoned with a nerve agent       from the Novichok group;        Whereas the Government of the Russian Federation has       repeatedly denied that Mr. Navalny was poisoned;        Whereas the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany       has called on the Government of the Russian Federation to       open an investigation into Mr. Navalny's case;        Whereas the Russian Federation is a party to the Chemical       Weapons Convention (CWC);        Whereas, in November 2019, after Russian agents used a       Novichok-class nerve agent in an attempted assassination of       former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in the United Kingdom in       March 2018, CWC parties agreed to add the Novichok group of       nerve agents to ``Schedule 1'', a list of chemicals       classified as chemical warfare agents that are subject to       declaration requirements and other restrictions;        Whereas, on September 4, 2020, NATO strongly condemned the       attack on Mr. Navalny and called on the Russian Federation to       cooperate with the Organization for the Prohibition of       Chemical Weapons on an impartial, international       investigation;        Whereas the G7 foreign ministers issued a statement on       September 8, 2020, that called on the Government of the       Russian Federation ``to urgently and fully establish       transparency on who is responsible for this abhorrent       poisoning attack and, bearing in mind Russia's commitments       under the Chemical Weapons Convention, to bring the       perpetrators to justice'';        Whereas the Russian Federation is a state party to the       International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR);        Whereas Article 6 of the ICCPR states that ``Every human       being has the inherent right to life'' and ``No one shall be       arbitrarily deprived of his life'';        Whereas Article 9 of the ICCPR states that ``Everyone has       the right to liberty and security of person.'';        Whereas the Russian Federation is a member of the       Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE);        Whereas respect for human rights is key to the OSCE's       comprehensive approach to security and therefore the OSCE       monitors the human rights situation in its 57 participating       states;        Whereas pressure on Germany to reconsider its support for       the Nord Stream 2 pipeline from the United States and       international community, including many European Union       countries, as well as from leading politicians within       Germany, has grown since the attack on Mr. Navalny;        Whereas Congress passed the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law       Accountability Act of 2012 (title IV of Public Law 112-208)       and the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act       (subtitle F of title XII of Public Law 114-328) in 2016 to       provide the United States Government with authorities to       respond to grave violations of human rights and corruption in       Russia; and        Whereas in response to the Novichok-class nerve agent       attack described in this preamble against United Kingdom       national and former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his       daughter Yulia in 2018, the United States Government imposed       two rounds of sanctions on Russia pursuant to the Chemical       and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of       1991 (Public Law 102-182; 22 U.S.C. 5601 et seq.): Now,       therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) condemns the apparently purposeful poisoning on August       20, 2020, of Russian anticorruption activist and opposition       leader Alexei Navalny;        (2) expresses its appreciation for the prompt and generous       efforts of the Cinema for Peace Foundation and the Government       of the Federal Republic of Germany to ensure high-quality       health care for Mr. Navalny after he was poisoned by       facilitating his transfer by airlift from Russia to Germany;        (3) welcomes reports that Mr. Navalny has emerged from a       medically induced coma and is gradually recovering from the       poisoning;        (4) hopes for Mr. Navalny's full and complete recovery so       that he may promptly resume his life and work;        (5) urges the Organization for Security and Cooperation in       Europe and multilateral human rights monitoring bodies to       monitor the case of the August 2020 poisoning of Alexei       Navalny as a probable violation of his fundamental human       rights and to respond accordingly;        (6) calls on the Government of the Russian Federation to       cooperate with independent, impartial, and thorough       investigations by competent authorities and the Organization       for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons of the reported       poisoning of Alexei Navalny;        (7) calls on the United States Government to support       international or multilateral efforts to ensure an       independent, impartial, and thorough investigations by       competent authorities and the Organization for the       Prohibition of Chemical Weapons of the reported poisoning of       Alexei Navalny;        (8) urges the United States Government, in all its       interactions with the Government of the Russian Federation,       to raise the case of the poisoning of Alexei Navalny and       underscore the necessity of bringing the organizers and       perpetrators to justice;        (9) calls on the Secretary of State and the Secretary of       the Treasury to use their authority under the Sergei       Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012 (title IV of       Public Law 112-208) and the Global Magnitsky Human Rights       Accountability Act (subtitle F of title XII of Public Law       114-328) to designate individuals whom they determine upon       investigation to have been involved in the poisoning of       Alexei Navalny as perpetrators, organizers, or masterminds,       on the list of specially designated nationals and blocked       persons maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of       the Department of the Treasury, freezing their assets and       making them ineligible to receive United States visas; and        (10) supports the 60-day review period triggered by the       submission of a letter to the President by the Chair and       Ranking Member of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House       of Representatives to investigate whether the poisoning of       Alexei Navalny constitutes use of a chemical weapon by the       Government of the Russian Federation in contravention of       international law, and if so, to impose sanctions pursuant to       the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare       Elimination Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-182; 22 U.S.C. 5601       et seq.).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include in the Record extraneous material on H. Res. 1145.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and I want  to thank Mr. McGovern for his leadership and hard work.   In recent years, a number of Russian journalists, human rights  activists, politicians, whistleblowers, and others have been killed or  died under very mysterious circumstances in Russia and overseas. The  poisoning of Alexei Navalny, Russia's most prominent opposition leader,  is yet another horrific example of the ruthlessness under President  Putin's government.   I am proud to support this bipartisan resolution which condemns the  brutal poisoning of Mr. Navalny on August 20, 2020, calls for U.S.  support for a credible and impartial international investigation into  the attack, and urges sanctions against those responsible. It is  important that the House go on record in a bipartisan way to send a  clear and unequivocal message to the Kremlin that we reject their  criminal tactics and we will demand accountability. There must be  consequences for this egregious act.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                 Committee on Financial Services,                                  Washington, DC, November 13, 2020.      Hon. Eliot Engel,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing concerning H. Res. 1145,       the ``Condemning the poisoning of Russian opposition leader       Alexei Navalny and calling for a robust United States and       international response.'' In order to permit H. Res. 1145 to       proceed expeditiously to the House Floor, I agree to forgo       formal consideration of the bill.        The Committee on Financial Services takes this action to       forego formal consideration of H. Res. 1145 in light of the       mutually agreed changes to provisions within the jurisdiction       of the Committee on Financial Services. We are also doing so       based on our mutual understanding that, by foregoing formal       consideration of H. Res. 1145 at this time, we do not waive       any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or       similar legislation, and that our Committee will be       appropriately consulted and involved as this or similar       legislation moves forward with regard to any matters in the       Committee's jurisdiction. The Committee also reserves the       right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or       similar legislation that involves the Committee's       jurisdiction and request your support for any such request.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding, and I would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during Floor consideration of H. Res.       1145.            Sincerely,                                                     Maxine Waters,      Chairwoman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                  Washington, DC, November 11, 2020.

Res. 1145, Condemning the poisoning of Russian opposition       leader Alexei Navalny and calling for a robust United States       and international response. I appreciate your willingness to       work cooperatively on this legislation.        I acknowledge that provisions of the bill fall within the       jurisdiction of the Committee on Financial Services under       House Rule X, and that your Committee will forgo action on H.       Res. 1145 to expedite floor consideration. I further       acknowledge that the inaction of your Committee with respect       to the bill does not waive any future jurisdictional claim       over the matters contained in the bill that fall within your       jurisdiction. I also acknowledge that your Committee will be       appropriately consulted and involved as this or similar       legislation moves forward, and will support the appointment       of Committee on Financial Services conferees during any       House-Senate conference convened on this legislation.        Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of letters is       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill. Thank you again for your       cooperation regarding the legislation. I look forward to       continuing to work with you as the measure moves through the       legislative process.

In the interest of permitting your Committee to proceed       expeditiously on this bill, I am willing to waive this       Committee's right to sequential referral. I do so with the       understanding that by waiving consideration of the bill, the       Committee on Oversight and Reform does not waive any future       jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in       the bill which fall within its Rule X jurisdiction. I request       that you urge the Speaker to name Members of this Committee       to any conference committee which is named to consider such       provisions.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), who is the author of this important  resolution and the co-chair of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I, again, thank Congressman McGovern for his hard work  on this resolution. I strongly support this measure and urge all the  Members to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 8259) to prohibit Russian participation in the G7, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 8259         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include in the Record extraneous materials on H.R. 8259.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this measure, and I thank  the author, my friend, Mr. Meeks from New York, a senior member of the  Committee on Foreign Affairs, for his leadership and hard work.   Throughout this Congress, the committee has focused on measures to  counter Russian aggression and hold President Putin accountable for the  unlawful invasion and attempted annexation of Crimea. But President  Trump has flagrantly ignored the pleas of our allies and attempted to  invite Russia back into the G7 despite its continued aggression in  Ukraine, Georgia, and other sovereign countries near its border.   Putin and his cronies must be held accountable for their actions. And  for Trump to put out the welcome mat for Russia would be a slap in the  face to our allies and the Ukrainian citizens living in Crimea.   This important bipartisan bill would prevent the U.S. Government from  facilitating Russian participation in the G7, or a reconstituted G8,  and requires a report about Russia's nefarious relationships with the  Taliban in Afghanistan and any bounty program it instituted for the  killing of American troops.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Meeks), the author of this important bill and an esteemed  member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, again, I thank Congressman Meeks for his hard work on  this measure. I am very pleased to support this important measure, and  I urge all Members to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to  the resolution (H. Res. 825) celebrating the 50th anniversary of the  entry into force of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear  Weapons (NPT), recognizing the importance of the NPT's continued  contributions to United States and international security, and  commemorating United States leadership in strengthening the nuclear  nonproliferation regime since the dawn of the nuclear era, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 825         Whereas on December 4, 1961, the United Nations General       Assembly unanimously approved a resolution supporting an       international agreement to prevent the proliferation of       nuclear weapons;        Whereas the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons has been a       bedrock principle of United States foreign policy since 1945;        Whereas the October 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis nearly led       the United States and the former Soviet Union to a       catastrophic nuclear exchange;        Whereas the aftermath of the Cuban Missile Crisis led to a       series of bilateral and multilateral agreements to reduce the       chances of nuclear war and prevent the spread of nuclear       weapons;        Whereas on August 17, 1965, the United States submitted its       first draft of such a treaty to the Eighteen Nation       Disarmament Committee;        Whereas in May 1966, the Senate adopted S. Res. 179       supporting the President's efforts to negotiate such a       treaty;        Whereas the United States, the United Kingdom, and the       Union of Soviet Socialist Republics signed the Treaty on the       Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) on its first day       of opening for signature on July 1, 1968;        Whereas the Senate gave its advice and consent to       ratification of the NPT on March 13, 1969, by a vote of 83 to       15;        Whereas the NPT entered into force on March 5, 1970, the       date it was ratified by the United States and the Soviet       Union;        Whereas the NPT provides stability that is critical for       United States and international security, and its success has       and will continue to depend upon the full implementation by       all State Parties of the NPT's three mutually-reinforcing       pillars: nonproliferation, access to peaceful uses of nuclear       energy, and disarmament;        Whereas United States leadership has been and will continue       to be indispensable to the development and success of the       global nuclear nonproliferation regime;        Whereas on May 11, 1995, the NPT was extended indefinitely;        Whereas North Korea is the only non-nuclear weapon state       that was a party to the NPT before acquiring nuclear weapons;        Whereas the United States has supported the NPT's       disarmament goals by negotiating bilateral arms control       agreements and achieving dramatic reductions in its own and       other states' nuclear weapons stockpiles through these       treaties, including the 1972 SALT I Treaty, the 1987 INF       Treaty, the 1991 START I Treaty, the 2002 Moscow Treaty, and       the 2010 New START treaty;        Whereas the United States has promoted the NPT's       nonproliferation pillar by supporting states that       relinquished their nuclear weapons and acceded to the NPT,       such as Belarus, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and South Africa;        Whereas the United States has worked to ensure the peaceful       uses of nuclear energy by supporting the International Atomic       Energy Agency and its safeguards programs, including the       Additional Protocol;        Whereas the 2018 Department of Defense Nuclear Posture       Review affirms, ``The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)       is a cornerstone of the nuclear nonproliferation regime. It       plays a positive role in building consensus for non-      proliferation and enhances international efforts to impose       costs on those that would pursue nuclear weapons outside the       Treaty.'';        Whereas on June 28, 2018, the United States, United       Kingdom, and Russian governments released a joint statement,       reaffirming their commitment to work toward ``the ultimate       goal of the elimination of nuclear weapons, as set forth in       the NPT''; and        Whereas Congress has long been a leading voice for       nonproliferation, including through the Export-Import Bank       Act of 1945, the McMahon Act of 1946, the Atomic Energy Act       of 1954, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978, the       Export Administration Act of 1979, the Nunn-Lugar Soviet       Nuclear Threat Reduction Act of 1991, the Nuclear       Nonproliferation Prevention Act of 1994, and other       legislative efforts: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) calls for continued support for the Treaty on the Non-      Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) to prevent the spread       of nuclear weapons, to further reduce the number of nuclear       weapons, and to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy as       it has over the past 50 years;        (2) reaffirms that a strong nonproliferation regime is in       the United States interest;        (3) recognizes that the United States, through its network       of alliances, has led the world upholding the pillars of the       NPT and continues to work together to strengthen the NPT; and        (4) urges the United States to continue to be a leader in       supporting the NPT and the global nonproliferation regime,       by--        (A) continuing to encourage all States Party to the NPT to       comply fully with the NPT;        (B) maintaining support for the International Atomic Energy       Agency through its assessed and voluntary contributions and       promote the universal adoption of the IAEA Additional       Protocol;        (C) continuing to encourage opportunities for cooperation       with other nuclear weapons states to reduce the number and       role of nuclear weapons;        (D) encouraging universality of the NPT and the Additional       Protocol;        (E) discouraging the unlawful spread of uranium enrichment       technologies and ensuring such technologies covered under the       NPT are properly verified;        (F) developing policies to prevent withdrawal of additional       states parties from the Treaty;        (G) maintaining global moratoria on nuclear explosive       testing, which is in the national security interest of the       United States; and        (H) working towards a successful 2021 NPT Review       Conference.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H. Res. 825.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and I would  like to thank the author, Congressman Sherman, for his hard work and  leadership.   Arms control and nonproliferation have been bipartisan pillars of  United States security since the earliest days of the Cold War. After a  half a century of successfully contributing to the nonproliferation and  reduction of nuclear weapons, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of  Nuclear Weapons continues to bolster the United States national  security and global stability.   This important resolution recognizes the importance of the NPT and  calls for continued U.S. leadership in global  [[Page H5910]]  nonproliferation efforts and the further reduction in the number of  nuclear weapons. The current administration has undercut and  disregarded our important arms control regimes, and I hope that  President-elect Biden will immediately change our course after he is  sworn in.   With this measure, the House is going on record to support a return  to the leadership and policies that helped make the world safer for  decades. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Sherman), the author of this important resolution and  an esteemed member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank Congressman  Sherman for his hard work on this measure. I am very pleased to support  this measure, I urge all Members to do the same, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4636) to authorize the Secretary of State and the  Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development  to prioritize and advance efforts to improve waste management systems  and prevent and reduce plastic waste and marine debris, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4636         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Partnering and Leveraging       Assistance to Stop Trash for International Cleaner Seas Act''       or the ``PLASTICS Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Eight million metric tons of plastic enter the ocean       every year. Marine debris damages the health of marine life,       impedes local economic development, and threatens health       systems. Ten river systems carry an estimated 90 percent of       the river-based plastic waste that ends up in the ocean.        (2) Mismanaged plastic waste has the highest risk of       contaminating rivers and oceans. China contributes the       largest share of this mismanaged waste, followed by       Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Egypt,       Nigeria, and South Africa. The United States is the world's       second-largest producer and consumer of plastics products,       and the top exporter of plastic scrap.        (3) Most marine debris, particularly plastics, enters the       oceans from land-based sources, mainly in developing       countries, that lack the capacity to adequately manage waste       and prevent dumping.        (4) During the Our Ocean Conference in October 2018, the       United States announced assistance to prevent marine debris       from entering the ocean through development of waste       management systems and reduce plastics in marine protected       areas in the Indo-Pacific.        (5) During the June 2019 G20 Summit in Osaka, Japan, the       United States joined other G20 members in endorsing the       ``Osaka Blue Ocean Vision'' to reduce additional pollution by       marine plastic litter to zero by 2050 and the G20       Implementation Framework for Actions on Marine Plastic       Litter, which outlines a commitment to prevent and reduce       plastic debris in the oceans through waste management and       clean-up efforts to remove marine plastic debris and       prioritizes efforts to advance innovative solutions and       international cooperation to support such initiatives.       SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States to consult, partner,       and coordinate with the governments of foreign countries,       international organizations, private and civil society       entities, and other stakeholders in a concerted effort to--        (1) prevent and reduce marine debris and plastic waste,       including through reduced consumption, greater transparency       in global trade of plastic waste, and support for integrated       waste management systems in developing countries;        (2) advance innovative market-based solutions and catalyze       private capital to prevent and reduce marine debris and       plastic waste, support integrated waste management systems,       and improve market demand for recycled material;        (3) build the capacity of national and subnational       governments in other countries to develop and implement       integrated waste management systems, measure and report       progress in reducing plastic waste, and prevent plastic waste       from entering rivers and oceans;        (4) support local economic development through programs       that assist community members, particularly women, youth, and       marginalized populations, to derive economic benefit from       waste products and participation in waste management systems;       and        (5) engage in international and regional cooperation to       prevent and reduce marine debris and plastic waste, share       best practices, and empower national and subnational       governments, local communities, civil society, and the       private sector to engage in such efforts.       SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that, in pursuing the policy       described in section 3, the President should direct United       States representatives to appropriate international bodies to       use the voice, vote, and influence of the United States to       advocate support for the following:        (1) Efforts to improve transparency in global trade of       plastic waste, improve plastic waste regulation to ensure the       safety of humans and the environment, strengthen integrated       waste management systems, and prevent, reduce, reuse, and       recycle plastic waste, to the extent practical.        (2) Collaborative approaches to establish measurable       targets and objectives, with related action plans, for       reducing marine debris and plastic waste from all sources and       sharing best practices in waste prevention and management       systems to prevent plastic waste.       SEC. 5. UNITED STATES SUPPORT TO IMPROVE WASTE MANAGEMENT                     SYSTEMS AND PREVENT AND REDUCE MARINE DEBRIS.         (a) In General.--The Secretary of State and the       Administrator of the United States Agency for International       Development, in coordination with the heads of relevant       Federal departments and agencies, are authorized to       prioritize and advance ongoing global efforts to--        (1) prevent and reduce marine debris and plastic waste,       including through reduced consumption, greater transparency       in global trade of plastic waste, and support for integrated       waste management systems in developing countries;        (2) advance innovative market-based solutions and catalyze       private capital to prevent and reduce marine debris and       plastic waste, support integrated waste management systems,       and improve market demand for recycled material;        (3) build the capacity of national and subnational       governments in other countries to develop and implement       integrated waste management systems, measure and report       progress in reducing plastic waste, and prevent plastic waste       from entering rivers and oceans; and        (4) support local economic development through programs       that assist community members, particularly women, youth, and       marginalized populations, to derive economic benefit from       waste products and participation in waste management systems.        (b) Coordination With Private Sector.--The Secretary and       the Administrator, in coordination with the Chief Executive       Officer of the United States International Development       Finance Corporation and the Chief Executive Officer of the       Millennium Challenge Corporation and in consultation with the       heads of relevant Federal departments and agencies, are       authorized and encouraged to work with entities in the       private sector and with nongovernmental organizations to       leverage sources of public and private capital to complement       the efforts described in subsection (a), including by       financing infrastructure investments, supporting capacity-      building activities, and entering into cost-sharing, cost-      matching, and other cooperative agreements to support and       finance such efforts.        (c) Monitoring and Evaluation.--The Secretary and the       Administrator shall establish monitoring and evaluation       mechanisms, including measurable goals, objectives, and       benchmarks, to ensure the effective use of United States       foreign assistance to achieve the objectives described in       paragraphs (1) through (4) of subsection (a).        (d) Domestic Resource Mobilization.--In carrying out the       authority under subsection (a), the Secretary and the       Administrator, in coordination with the heads of relevant       Federal departments and agencies, shall seek to provide       technical assistance to mobilize the domestic resources of       recipient countries in order to increase cost-sharing, self-      reliance, and host country ownership of waste prevention and       management programs.        (e) Cost Limitation.--No additional funds are authorized to       be appropriated to carry out this Act.        (f) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretary and the Administrator,       in consultation with the heads of relevant Federal       departments and agencies, shall jointly submit to the       appropriate congressional committees a report on ongoing       programs and monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to carry       out the authority under subsection (a) that includes a       description of--        (1) the monitoring and evaluation plans and indicators used       to measure performance of assistance programs, in accordance       with subsection (d);        (2) best practices and lessons learned in implementing the       efforts authorized under subsection (a);        (3) the extent to which recipient countries have       demonstrated a commitment and willingness to cooperate to       advance the efforts described in subsection (a) and to       dedicate resources to support waste prevention and management       initiatives;        (4) the extent to which host country governments and other       governments in the region are investing resources to advance       initiatives to prevent or reduce marine debris and plastic       waste and develop integrated waste management systems; and        (5) the extent to which other funding sources, including       through private sector investment, have been identified to       advance waste prevention and management initiatives.        (g) Appropriate Congressional Committees Defined.--In this       section, the term ``appropriate congressional committees''       means--        (1) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on       Appropriations of the House of Representatives; and  [[Page H5912]]         (2) the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on       Appropriations of the Senate.       SEC. 6. PLASTIC WASTE REDUCTION INITIATIVE.         (a) In General.--The Chief Executive Officer of the United       States International Development Finance Corporation is       authorized to establish, in coordination with relevant       Federal departments and agencies and incorporating any       existing programs of the Corporation for such purposes, an       initiative to pursue investment opportunities to address       plastic waste pollution and support improved, integrated       waste management systems in developing countries, including       by catalyzing global public and private-sector investments to       prevent and reduce marine debris and plastic waste in such       countries.        (b) Reference.--The initiative established under subsection       (a) may be referred to as the ``Plastic Waste Reduction       Initiative''.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 4636.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend, the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  McCaul), the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, for his  hard work on this measure, which I am pleased to support.   This bill aims to address a growing problem we all see around the  world: plastic waste and other debris in our oceans.   Products made from plastic are a part of everyday life. In the  morning, we brush our teeth with a plastic toothbrush and wash our hair  with shampoo from a plastic bottle. We drink water from a plastic cup,  eat snacks out of plastic containers, and consume meals with plastic  utensils. We drive cars with plastic components and do our work on  plastic keyboards. At the end of the day, when we throw plastic away,  we don't often think about where it ends up.   Well, every day, more than 8 million metric tons of it end up in the  ocean, leading to a host of problems. It damages the health of marine  life, chokes off economic development, and harms the environment.   Most marine debris enters the ocean from land-based sources, mainly  in developing countries that aren't able to manage waste and prevent  dumping.   This legislation will advance efforts to work with national  governments and local communities to develop integrated waste  management systems to effectively prevent and reduce plastic waste.   It encourages Federal departments and agencies to work with the  private sector and nongovernmental organizations, aiming to leverage  public and private capital in concert with American assistance  programs.   It supports local economic development initiatives to assist  community members--particularly women, young people, and marginalized  populations--to realize the economic benefits to be gained in scaling  up waste management systems.   It also urges U.S. leadership in international and regional efforts  to prevent and reduce marine debris and plastic waste. This legislation  supports the commitment that the United States made at both the 2018  Our Ocean Conference and the 2019 G20 Summit to achieve measurable  benchmarks in preventing marine debris from entering the ocean and  reduce plastic pollution.   The United States is one of the world's largest producer and consumer  of plastic products, and the top exporter of plastic scrap. So we have  a critical role to play in addressing this particular issue. This  legislation puts us on the right track to remedy this rapidly growing  problem.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this legislation, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                time  1500     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is a great example of how America can  lead in finding solutions to environmental challenges such as this one,  a grave challenge to the world, and helps to create jobs and builds  prosperity.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support it, and I am grateful that Mr.  McCaul and all the bill's cosponsors have put this forward.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 8405) to direct the Department of State to ensure persons  representing the United States in international athletic competitions  in certain countries are appropriately informed, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 8405         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``American Values and Security       in International Athletics Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) In 2017, the International Olympic Committee (IOC)       revised its Host City Contract to require host countries to       ``protect and respect human rights and ensure any violation       of human rights is remedied in a manner consistent with       international agreements, laws, and regulations applicable in       the Host Country and in a manner consistent with all       internationally recognised human rights standards and       principles, including the United Nations Guiding Principles       on Business and Human Rights, applicable in the Host       Country''.        (2) The Olympic Charter states the goal of Olympism is ``to       place sport at the service of the harmonious development of       humankind, with a view to promoting a peaceful society       concerned with the preservation of human dignity''.        (3) The IOC set up an advisory committee on human rights in       December 2018, and IOC President Thomas Bach said,       ``Promoting humanistic values in sport has been a core       feature of the IOC since its beginning. Our mission, to put       sport at the service of humanity, goes hand-in-hand with       human rights, which is part of our DNA.''.        (4) In the report, ``The Cybersecurity of Olympic Sports:       New Opportunities, New Risks'', the UC Berkley Center for       Long-Term Cybersecurity listed the ``hacking and release of       sensitive athletic data'' as one of the four significant       categories of cyberattacks on major sporting events.        (5) According to the State Department's 2019 Country       Reports on Human Rights Practices, the People's Republic of       China's Ministry of Public Security employs ``tens of       millions of surveillance cameras'' to monitor the general       public, as well as ``political dissidents, religious leaders       and adherents, Tibetans, and Uyghurs''.        (6) The People's Republic of China (PRC) Government's       extensive use of artificial intelligence surveillance       technology, including facial and voice pattern recognition       technology, poses grave humanitarian, privacy, and security       concerns. PRC authorities have used surveillance technology       to monitor, control, and repress an estimated 1.8 million       Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur       Autonomous Region. PRC State media has confirmed that       ``voice, image, position and behavior recognition       technologies'' will be used in the Beijing 2022 Winter       Olympics.       SEC. 3. HUMAN RIGHTS AWARENESS FOR AMERICAN ATHLETIC                     DELEGATIONS.         (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       individuals representing the United States at international       athletic competitions in foreign countries should have the       opportunity to be informed about human rights and security       concerns in such countries and how best to safeguard their       personal security and privacy.        (b) In General.--        (1) In general.--Not later than 120 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall       devise and implement a strategy for disseminating briefing       materials, including information described in subsection (c),       to individuals representing the United States at       international athletic competitions in a covered country.        (2) Timing and form of materials.--        (A) In general.--The briefing materials referred to in       paragraph (1) shall be offered not later than 180 days prior       to the commencement of an international athletic competition       in a covered country.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 8405.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me commend Mr. McCaul, our ranking member of the  Foreign Affairs Committee, for authoring this bill. We know that  people-to-people connections are a great way to build bridges of  friendship and understanding between countries, and that international  sports have long provided the best example for those connections.   Yet, even as we put serious differences aside to see major sporting  events go forward, we cannot ignore the fact that some governments  simply don't respect basic human rights, and may seek to violate the  privacy of our athletes by collecting information about them without  their knowledge or consent.   We think about China hosting the upcoming Winter Olympics. We will be  sending our athletes to a country where the government conducts mass  surveillance and abuses the human rights of its own citizens. Our  athletes have the right to know about their security concerns, and  about how best to keep themselves and their privacy secure.   This legislation will require the State Department to develop a  strategy to better support our athletes. We want to make sure that they  understand the security and human rights situations in the countries  where they compete and can take the best steps to protect themselves.  It is a commonsense bill, and I am glad to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I, again, thank Mr. McCaul for his  bipartisan leadership on this matter. I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 8438) to reauthorize the Belarus Democracy Act of 2004, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 8438         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Belarus Democracy, Human       Rights, and Sovereignty Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Section 2 of the Belarus Democracy Act of 2004 (Public Law       109-480; 22 U.S.C. 5811 note) is amended to read as follows:       ``SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         ``Congress finds the following:        ``(1) The Government of Belarus, led by Alyaksandr       Lukashenka, continues to engage in a pattern of clear and       persistent violations of human rights and fundamental       freedoms.        ``(2) The Government of Belarus, led by Alyaksandr       Lukashenka, continues to engage in a pattern of clear and       uncorrected violations of basic principles of democratic       governance, including through a series of fundamentally       flawed presidential and parliamentary elections undermining       the legitimacy of executive and legislative authority in that       country.        ``(3) The Government of Belarus, led by Alyaksandr       Lukashenka, continues to subject thousands of pro-democracy       political activists and peaceful protesters to harassment,       beatings, and imprisonment, particularly as a result of their       attempts to peacefully exercise their right to freedom of       assembly and association.        ``(4) The Government of Belarus, led by Alyaksandr       Lukashenka, continues to suppress independent media and       journalists and to restrict access to the internet, including       social media and other digital communication platforms, in       violation of the right to freedom of speech and expression of       those dissenting from the dictatorship of Alyaksandr       Lukashenka.        ``(5) The Government of Belarus, led by Alyaksandr       Lukashenka, continues a systematic campaign of harassment,       repression, and closure of nongovernmental organizations,       including independent trade unions and entrepreneurs,       creating a climate of fear that inhibits the development of       civil society and social solidarity.        ``(6) The Government of Belarus, led by Alyaksandr       Lukashenka, has pursued a policy undermining the country's       sovereignty and independence by making Belarus political,       economic, cultural, and societal interests subservient to       those of Russia.        ``(7) The Government of Belarus, led by Alyaksandr       Lukashenka, continues to reduce the independence of Belarus       through integration into a so-called `Union State' that is       under the control of Russia.        ``(8) On August 9, 2020, the Government of Belarus       conducted a presidential election that was fraudulent and did       not meet international standards. There were serious       irregularities with ballot counting and the reporting of       election results. The Government of Belarus also put in place       restrictive measures that impeded the work of local       independent observers and did not provide sufficient notice       to the OSCE to allow for the OSCE to monitor the elections,       as is customary.        ``(9) After the August 9, 2020, presidential election, the       Government of Belarus responded to the peaceful opposition       protests, which are the largest in Belarus history, with a       violent crackdown, including, according to the United Nations       Special Rapporteur, the detention of more than 10,000       peaceful protestors as of September 18, 2020.        ``(10) Thousands of employees at Belarusian state-owned       enterprises, who have been seen as Alyaksandr Lukashenka's       traditional base during his 26-year rule, went on strike       across the country to protest Lukashenka's illegitimate       election and the subsequent crackdowns, including at some of       Belarus's largest factories such as the BelAZ truck plant,       the Minsk Tractor Works, and the Minsk Automobile Plant.        ``(11) Women have served as the leading force in       demonstrations across the country, protesting the police       brutality and mass detentions by wearing white, carrying       flowers, forming `solidarity chains', and unmasking       undercover police trying to arrest demonstrators.        ``(12) After the August 9, 2020, presidential election, the       Government of Belarus has sought to stop the work of the       Coordination Council, which was formed by the leading       opposition presidential candidate, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya,       to facilitate a peaceful transition of power by subjecting       the Council's senior members to violence, detention, and       forced exile.        ``(13) After the August 9, 2020, presidential election, the       Government of Belarus restricted the free flow of information       to silence the opposition and to conceal the regime's violent       crackdown on peaceful protestors, including by stripping the       accreditation of journalists from major foreign news outlets,       disrupting internet access, limiting access to social media       and other digital communication platforms, and detaining and       harassing countless journalists.        ``(14) Before the European Parliament on August 25, 2020,       Tsikhanouskaya stressed that a `peaceful revolution' was       underway in Belarus, and that `It is neither a pro-Russian       nor anti-Russian revolution. It is neither an anti-European       Union nor a pro-European Union revolution. It is a democratic       revolution.'.        ``(15) Against the will of the majority of the Belarusian       people, Russian President Vladimir Putin has propped up the       Alyaksandr Lukashenka regime, including by offering security       assistance, providing significant financial support, and       sending Russian propagandists to help disseminate pro-regime       propaganda on Belarus state television.        ``(16) After the August 9, 2020, presidential election, the       United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and       Canada condemned the violent crackdown on peaceful       protestors, refused to accept the results of the fraudulent       election and called for new free and fair elections under       independent observation.        ``(17) On September 8, 2020, Secretary of State Michael R.       Pompeo said, `The United States, in coordination with our       partners and Allies, is considering additional targeted       sanctions to promote accountability for those involved in       human rights abuses and repression in Belarus.'.        ``(18) Following Alyaksandr Lukashenka's September 23,       2020, secret inauguration, the United States, the European       Union, numerous European Union member states, the United       Kingdom, and Canada announced they did not recognize him as       the legitimately elected leader of Belarus.''.       SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         Section 3 of the Belarus Democracy Act of 2004 (Public Law       109-480; 22 U.S.C. 5811 note) is amended to read as follows:       ``SEC. 3.

The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 8438.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to acknowledge my friend, Mr. Smith of New  Jersey, for his hard work on this bill, along with our other colleagues  who helped move this measure forward, Mr. McCaul, Ms. Kaptur, Mr.  Kinzinger, and Mr. Keating.   In Belarus, Lukashenko's illegitimate regime continues his brutal  crackdown on the peaceful protesters of that country that have taken to  the streets in historic numbers to protest the elections he stole back  on August 9, 2020. It was the right thing to do when the United States,  Canada, the United Kingdom, and the EU worked together to impose  sanctions of those responsible. But the people of Belarus still need  our help.   This bipartisan bill makes clear that Congress will stand with the  Belarusian people and against their oppressors, and that they will  support  [[Page H5918]]  their long-term goals of building a freer, more democratic, and more  western-facing Belarus. To support the citizens of that country, this  bill authorizes assistance to promote democracy, human rights, and  civil society. It also calls on the administration to ramp up our  assistance efforts.   And for those trying to stifle the democratic aspiration of the  Belarusian people, this bill imposes stiff new consequences. It expands  the list of Belarusian authorities and complicit Russian officials who  may be targeted by U.S. sanctions.   This bill is more than just words of support. It would make a real  difference for the people of Belarus as they strive to build a better  future for themselves and their country.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.

The Committee on Financial Services takes this action to       forego formal consideration of H.R. 8438 in light of the       mutually agreed changes to provisions within the jurisdiction       of the Committee on Financial Services. We are also doing so       based on our mutual understanding that, by foregoing formal       consideration of H.R. 8438 at this time, we do not waive any       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or       similar legislation, and that our Committee will be       appropriately consulted and involved as this or similar       legislation moves forward with regard to any matters in the       Committee's jurisdiction. The Committee also reserves the       right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or       similar legislation that involves the Committee's       jurisdiction and request your support for any such request.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding, and I would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during Floor consideration of H.R. 8438.            Sincerely,                                                     Maxine Waters,      Chairwoman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                  Washington, DC, November 11, 2020.

Dear Chairman Engel: This is to advise you that the       Committee on the Judiciary has now had an opportunity to       review the provisions in H.R. 8438, the ``Belarus Democracy,       Human Rights, and Sovereignty Act of 2020,'' that fall within       our Rule X jurisdiction. I appreciate your consulting with us       on those provisions. The Judiciary Committee has no objection       to your including them in the bill for consideration on the       House floor, and to expedite that consideration is willing to       forgo action on H.R. 8438, with the understanding that we do       not thereby waive any future jurisdictional claim over those       provisions or their subject matters.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, let me thank Mr. Smith and other  colleagues who have worked so hard on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5408) to oppose violations of religious freedom in Ukraine  by Russia and armed groups commanded by Russia, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5408         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Ukraine Religious Freedom       Support Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) Russia invaded the Crimea region of Ukraine in February       2014, continues to occupy and control that region, and has       exercised control over part of the Donbas region of eastern       Ukraine since April 2014 through non-state armed groups and       illegal entities it has established, instigated, commanded,       and supported, including with military and intelligence       personnel on the ground from Russia.        (2) International humanitarian law, including the Geneva       Conventions, to which Russia is a signatory, requires Russia       to respect and protect the religious freedom of the       inhabitants of the territory it occupies or controls,       including through organized non-state armed groups and       illegal entities it commands and supports, and holds Russia       responsible for violations of religious freedom in this       territory.        (3) According to the Department of State's International       Religious Freedom Reports, and other reporting, violations of       religious freedom in the Crimea region of Ukraine since       Russia invaded and occupied the territory have included       abduction, detention and imprisonment, torture, forced       psychiatric hospitalizations, fines, restrictions on       missionary activities, confiscations of property, including       churches and meeting halls, expulsions and obstructions to       reentry, denying registration of religious groups, vandalism,       fines, and banning peaceful religious groups, and targeted       groups have included Muslim Crimean Tatars, the Orthodox       Church of Ukraine, formerly the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of       the Kyivan Patriarchate, the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church,       Protestant Christians, and Jehovah's Witnesses.        (4) According to the Department of State's International       Religious Freedom Reports, violations of religious freedom in       the part of the Donbas region of Ukraine controlled by armed       groups commanded by Russia have included detention and       imprisonment, torture, confiscation of property, including       churches and meeting halls, physical assaults and threats of       violence, vandalism, fines, restrictions on missionary       activities, religious services, ceremonies, gatherings, and       literature, and banning of peaceful religious groups, and       targeted groups have included the Orthodox Church of Ukraine,       formerly the Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Kyiv Patriarchate, the       Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, Protestant Christians, and       Jehovah's Witnesses.        (5) The International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, as       amended by the Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom       Act, requires the President to--        (A) designate a foreign country as a country of particular       concern for religious freedom when its government has engaged       in or tolerated particularly severe violations of religious       freedom in that country over the previous 12 months;        (B) take one or more of the actions described in paragraphs       (9) through (15) of section 405(a) of the International       Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6445(a)), or       commensurate actions in substitution, not later than 90 days,       or 180 days in case of a delay under paragraph (3), after the       date of the designation of a country as a country of       particular concern for religious freedom; and        (C) designate a foreign country on a ``Special Watch List''       when its government has engaged in or tolerated severe       violations of religious freedom in that country over the       previous 12 months.        (6) On December 18, 2019, the Secretary of State re-      designated Russia for the ``Special Watch List''.        (7) The National Security Strategy of the United States       issued in 2017, 2015, 2006, 2002, 2000, 1999, 1998, and 1997,       committed the United States to promoting international       religious freedom to advance the security, economic, and       other national interests of the United States.       SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States to consider any alien       who, while serving as an official of the Government of       Russia, was responsible for or directly carried out       particularly severe violations of religious freedom in the       sovereign territory of Ukraine that Russia illegally occupies       or controls, including through non-state armed groups and       illegal entities it commands and supports, to have committed       particularly severe violations of religious freedom for       purposes of applying section 212(a)(2)(G) of the Immigration       and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(2)(G)) with respect to       any such alien.       SEC. 4. DESIGNATION OF RUSSIA AS A COUNTRY OF PARTICULAR                     CONCERN FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.         For purposes of making a determination of whether to       designate Russia as a country of particular concern for       religious freedom under section 402 of the International       Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6442), the President       shall consider any particularly severe violation of religious       freedom in the territory of Ukraine that Russia occupies or       controls, including controls through non-state armed groups       and illegal entities it commands and supports, during the       period of time that is the basis for the determination and       designation, to be a particularly severe violation of       religious freedom that the Government of Russia has engaged       in or tolerated.       SEC. 5. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on H.R. 5408.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to my friend from South Carolina (Mr.  Wilson) for bringing forward this bill that shines a light on the  egregious violations of human rights and religious freedom at the hands  of Russian-led forces in Ukraine's sovereign territory.  [[Page H5921]]    We have been saying it for years, but it always bears repeating:  Crimea is Ukraine; the Donbas is Ukraine. Russia must be held  accountable for the brutal violations of human rights and religious  freedoms taking place under their attempted annexation of these areas.   The International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 provides a range of  consequences for governments that persecute people on religious  grounds. From public condemnation to trade sanctions, the  administration has tools to push back on this sort of abuse.   This bill calls for Russia to be held accountable under the law for  the violations of religious freedoms we are seeing in Ukraine.   The bill represents a smart approach to address a specific problem  emanating from Russia. We should move it forward along with other  efforts to push back on Putin's aggression.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                  Washington, DC, November 11, 2020.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       5408, Ukraine Religious Freedom Support Act. I appreciate       your willingness to work cooperatively on this legislation.        I acknowledge that provisions of the bill fall within the       jurisdiction of the House Committee on the Judiciary under       House Rule X, and that your Committee will forgo action on       H.R. 5408 to expedite floor consideration. I further       acknowledge that the inaction of your Committee with respect       to the bill does not waive any future jurisdictional claim       over the matters contained in the bill that fall within your       jurisdiction. I will also support the appointment of       Committee on the Judiciary conferees during any House-Senate       conference convened on this legislation.        Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of letters is       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill. Thank you again for your       cooperation regarding the legislation. I look forward to       continuing to work with you as the measure moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                    Eliot L. Engel,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                  Washington, DC. November 17, 2020.      Hon. Eliot Engel,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Engel: This is to advise you that the       Committee on the Judiciary has now had an opportunity to       review the provisions in R.R. 5408, the ``Ukraine Religious       Freedom Support Act,'' that fall within our Rule X       jurisdiction. I appreciate your consulting with us on those       provisions. The Judiciary Committee has no objection to your       including them in the bill for consideration on the House       floor, and to expedite that consideration is willing to forgo       action on R.R. 5408, with the understanding that we do not       thereby waive any future jurisdictional claim over those       provisions or their subject matters.        I the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.            Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, Russia and Putin are responsible for  illegal and destabilizing actions all around the world. We need a  comprehensive strategy to put a stop to their aggression and impose  tough consequences. It is going to take a lot of different tools, and  this bill will give us one of them.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4802) to amend the State Department Basic Authorities Act of  1956 to authorize rewards under the Department of State's rewards  program relating to information regarding individuals or entities  engaged in activities in contravention of United States or United  Nations sanctions, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4802         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. AMENDMENT TO DEPARTMENT OF STATE REWARDS PROGRAM.         Subsection (b) of section 36 of the State Department Basic       Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 2708) is amended--        (1) in paragraph (11), by striking ``or'' after the       semicolon at the end;        (2) in paragraph (12), by striking the period at the end       and inserting ``; or''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:        ``(13) the identification or location of an individual or       entity that--        ``(A) knowingly, directly or indirectly, imports, exports,       or reexports to, into, or from any country any goods,       services, or technology controlled for export by the United  [[Page H5922]]       States because of the use of such goods, services, or       technology in contravention of a United States or United       Nations sanction; or        ``(B) knowingly, directly or indirectly, provides training,       advice, or other services or assistance, or engages in       significant financial transactions, relating to any such       goods, services, or technology in contravention of such       sanction.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include any extraneous material on H.R. 4802.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure and want to thank the  authors, Mr. Wilson and Mr. Deutch, for their hard work and leadership.   Since its establishment in 1984, the State Department's Rewards for  Justice Program has awarded more than $150 million to those who help  the United States Government bring terrorists and criminals to justice.   Over the years, we have expanded the scope of this effort, offering  rewards related to a wider range of crimes and ensnaring more people  who mean Americans harm. This legislation would add more and more tools  to the toolbox.   This bill was inspired by a former Syrian diplomat and defector named  Bassam Barabandi. As an employee of the Syrian Embassy here in  Washington, D.C., he worked with antiregime activists to provide  passports to critics of Bashar al-Assad, and for years after his  defection, Barabandi supplied the United States Government with  information on Syrian oligarchs close to the Assad regime. This  includes information on Samer Foz, who was ultimately the target of  American sanctions.   We want to incentivize more people like Mr. Barabandi to come forward  with information that will ultimately enhance compliance with the U.S.  and international sanctions, increase confidence in the rule of law,  and bring to justice criminals and rogue regimes seeking to circumvent  U.S. law.   This bill expands the Rewards for Justice Program by authorizing  rewards for individuals who provide information on those who evade the  United States' and the United Nations' sanctions.   This is a smart bill that builds on a successful program. I am  pleased to support it, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, let me again thank Mr. Wilson and Mr.  Deutch for bringing this bill forward. I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7954) to reauthorize the Tropical Forest and Coral Reef  Conservation Act of 1998.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7954         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Tropical Forest and Coral       Reef Conservation Reauthorization Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION.         Section 806(d) of the Tropical Forest and Coral Reef       Conservation Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 2431d(d)) is amended by       adding at the end the following new paragraphs:        ``(9) $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2021.        ``(10) $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2022.        ``(11) $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2023.        ``(12) $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2024.        ``(13) $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2025.''.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include any extraneous material on H.R. 7954.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this measure brought forward by  my friend from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), to provide continued funding for the  Tropical Forest and Coral Reef Conservation Act, what we call the TFCA,  for fiscal years 2021 through 2025.   The purpose of the TFCA is to offer developing countries the option  to direct a portion of their debt payments to local forest and coral  reef conservation activities instead of making those payments to the  U.S. Government.   Since the TFCA was enacted in 1998, it made real differences in  efforts to  [[Page H5923]]  preserve and protect these fragile ecosystems. The State Department has  reached 20 separate bilateral agreements with 14 countries, resulting  in over $339 million in long-term commitment to conserve tropical  forests.   This bipartisan legislation takes significant strides to build  stronger relationships with countries around the world, while ensuring  that irreplaceable tropical forests and coral reefs are protected and  preserved for future generations.   I am pleased to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, once again, I thank Mr. Chabot for his  leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I also would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr.  Eliot Engel, the chair of this committee, for his many years of  distinguished service in Congress ably representing his district, the  State of New York, and our country here in the Halls of Congress while  presiding and leading the Foreign Affairs Committee. Today is a  testament of all the great work that he has done across the aisle with  many Members who have, of course, contributed tremendously to the  dialogue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise  today in remembrance and honor of Cecil Corbin-Mark, whose passing on  the evening of October 15 sent shock waves of grief throughout New  York's political and activist communities.   A Harlem native, a trailblazer in the fight for environmental  justice, and an inspiration to more individuals than he would ever  know, Cecil was a giant in his community and across the Nation, and his  loss is immeasurable.   Cecil led a life dedicated to building sustainable communities and  healthy communities. He worked tirelessly to ensure that people of  color and low-income residents always had a seat at the table.   Cecil's impact on the sustainable future of Harlem, our surrounding  communities, and our Nation cannot be overstated.   Our prayers remain with Cecil's family and the WE ACT community.   May he rest in power.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, today we reconvene our monthly Special  Order hour of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus for the first time,  really, since the COVID-19 pandemic reached America's shores.   As we speak here today, America's staring down the barrel of a third  wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the worst one, perhaps, that we have so  far faced.   We are adding a million cases a week--yes, a million cases every  week. We are approaching a total of 11.5 million cases, more than any  other nation in the world by far, despite many more populous countries  with outbreaks.   Even more grim, we lead the world in the number of confirmed COVID- related deaths and quickly are approaching 1,000 deaths per day, more  than any other nation facing this new wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.   States and cities are careening towards lockdowns.   Just today, Madam Speaker, New York City ordered a shutdown of its  schools. It had attempted to open, partially, the schools, but today  the mayor of the city of New York ordered another shutdown of the  school system. Over 1 million children will stay at home with their  family members.   And so States and cities are locking down as we speak, right now, as  we near the Thanksgiving holiday.   Many States across the country, Governors and mayors have spoken to  their constituencies and asked them not to congregate in their homes  with more than 10 people, family members, during Thanksgiving. It is a  wise recommendation by mayors and Governors.                                time  1830    Show your loved ones that you love them by keeping them alive. Don't  expose them to the COVID-19 virus. As we speak right here, as I said,  New York City has announced that it has indefinitely closed schools.   Madam Speaker, we all know why America is facing such a terrible  outbreak of this virus: The abject failure by this administration to  act and numerous Republican leaders to take this pandemic seriously. It  was minimized, underestimated, yet it was deadly to over 250,000  Americans. The failure of leadership--the failure of leadership to  encourage something as simple as wearing a mask.   The phenomenon of the COVID-19's unbridled spread throughout the  United States is a serious one. But there is even more serious  phenomenon taking place, and that is the alarming disparate impact on  communities of color.   So this pandemic zeroes in on communities of color with high rates of  diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma, and other respiratory diseases,  and cardiovascular problems. Deadly conditions for those that are  infected by the COVID-19 virus.   When my home State and the city of New York became the Nation's first  epicenter of the pandemic, the racial disparities were very clear. The  hardest  [[Page H5928]]  hit ZIP Codes were those with the highest number of minority  population.   My district that has Harlem, East Harlem, Hamilton Heights,  Washington Heights, Inwood, and the Northwest Bronx was devastated by  the pandemic. Some of the ZIP Codes had the highest numbers of deaths  in the country. As the pandemic began to subside in New York, but took  hold in other parts of the country, the disparities continue to go  unabated.   Studies conducted in June bore out statistically what I had seen with  my very own eyes and on the ground. Now, as the U.S. surpasses 250,000  COVID-19 deaths and quickly approaches 12 million confirmed cases,  racial data is more complete, and the trend of this pandemic is crystal  clear, it discriminates. It discriminate poor people, people with  preexisting conditions, with diabetes and high blood pressure. It  discriminates communities of color, disproportionately hurting and  killing individuals every single day.   The system is broken in so many ways that the pandemic has both laid  bare and exacerbated many of these communities. Both African Americans  and Latinos are consistently at higher risks for health conditions both  environmental and inherited that have detrimental effects on quality of  life.   NPR recently did an analysis using information from the COVID  Tracking Project, and it shows how the disparities are consistent State  by State. One key finding is that Hispanics are consistently dying from  COVID-19 at higher rates than their share of State populations, no  matter where they are. In May, this was true in only seven States, but  it has spread now much more.   Latinos also have a disproportionate rate of infection in 45 States  and the District of Columbia. It is, unfortunately, easy to see why  this trend is happening. These communities are often more likely to  face economic hurdles that have kept them from receiving the quality  healthcare that they deserve.   The kinds of preventative treatment that many of us take for granted  are a luxury to those folks who cannot afford health insurance. We made  some major improvements with the Affordable Care Act, lowering costs  and getting millions more Americans insured.   But the Trump administration has done everything in its power to  hamper that law. As the pandemic raged across this country, they went  into court to take away, steal the healthcare for those that need it.  And we have begun to see a decline in the rate of those with insurance  rather than the other way around.   Preventative care is important because it ensures that other  comorbidities are detected early and well-managed. In the absence of  that care, something like an infectious disease can make the difference  between life or death.   Furthermore, things like food deserts leave many low-income families  of color without healthy food options, driving up the rate of problems  like diabetes, heart disease and more.   Heavy air pollution in densely populated urban centers, which many  communities of color call home, means higher rates of asthma and other  chronic respiratory illnesses. So when a highly infectious virus that  attacks the respiratory system comes along, it is more likely to take  its toll on those that already have respiratory illnesses.   And need I mention that Latinos and African Americans make up a  disproportionate share of our frontline workers, putting them at much  higher risk. As all of it piles up, it plays out in an obvious way.  More Black and Brown bodies in the morgue than there should be.   Madam Speaker, it doesn't have to be this way. Not only can we turn  this pandemic around, we can also turn the disparities around. With a  national strategy to contain and combat the virus, we can reduce its  spread. With a targeted campaign to communities of color, we can keep  our fellow Americans safe. And with aid to communities who need it the  most, we can keep families economically stable until finally we are out  of the woods.   Since enacting the CARES Act, Democrats have twice passed the HEROES  Act to get critical aid to our communities. Billions of dollars for  testing, tracing, and treatment. The three Ts. Testing, tracing, and  treatment. Billions of dollars for hospitals and needed personal  protective equipment.   Billions of dollars for small businesses, and the entertainment and  food service industries, which are taking a devastating hit. Billions  of dollars for public transportation and their frontline workers, who  have heroically kept service going despite months of plummeting  ridership because they need to get doctors and nurses and first  responders and supermarket workers to and from work, back home.   Billions of dollars for State and city governments who are facing  dire revenue shortfalls through no fault of their own.   The President has blamed States, divided our country, pointed  fingers. This is a time of leadership in crisis. There are no blue or  red States. There are the United States of America. And many of those  State governments are hurting. They are at the precipice of a fiscal  crisis of unprecedented proportions.   Madam Speaker, billions of dollars directly into the pockets of  fellow Americans through a second stimulus payment, and the $600  unemployment benefits. I have seen with my very own eyes the food lines  getting longer and longer around the block. People need the $600  unemployment benefits. People need another stimulus check for $1,200.  They need the help. America needs the help. But the White House is  silent and Mitch McConnell is Doctor No.   But Republicans in the Senate have refused to even consider the  HEROES Act. The Trump administration has dragged us along as we have  tried to negotiate to get robust help for the American people, as they  should have it in this moment of crisis. It is long past time for them  to come to the table and work with us to get the HEROES Act signed into  law right now. The people need the help.   Finally, Madam Speaker, while we have seen terrible news about the  rise in cases and deaths these past couple of weeks, we have also been  given a light at the end of the tunnel.   But before I speak about that, I also want to highlight that many  families across the country are backed up in their rent payments--2  months, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, and maybe 6 months--and they just  don't know where they are going to get the money to pay their rent at  the end of the road. So we must provide also the rental assistance, the  $100 billion in the HEROES Act for renters across America that can't  sleep at night because they do not know where they are going to get the  money to pay the rent. They are backed up 3, 4, 5, 6 months' worth of  rent. This is a crisis.   However, in just the past few days, we have received the good news  that the COVID-19 vaccine may be more than 90 percent effective at an  incredible rate. It is within our reach. And while it may take time to  produce the doses that we need to treat everybody and stand up the  infrastructure to get the vaccine to those who really need it, we must  make sure from the outset that the vaccine distribution is fair and  equitable. The ethics of the vaccine distribution must be fair and  equitable.   We cannot make the same mistake with the vaccine that we made with  testing. We can't leave States and communities on their own to fight in  the free market to wing it on their own for such a vital public health  resource that is of life and death.   We cannot allow important things like a vaccine that will be in such  limited supply to flow to those who are able to pay the highest prices.  We cannot allow rich folks to muscle in and get the vaccine while poor  people that suffer from preexisting conditions are exposed to the  virus.   We need a comprehensive plan to ensure that the vaccine gets to the  most vulnerable, the quicker the better. And we must make sure that  communities that were hardest hit by the pandemic are attended first.   Communities of color, the African-American community, the Hispanic  community, Native Americans and others were left out of testing and  they were short-changed. We must not do that again. They were left out  of the ICU beds. We must not do that again.   But they must not be left out of the vaccine distribution. They must  be fair  [[Page H5929]]  and equitable. The distribution must be fair and equitable. Given the  disparate way which this virus has hit our communities, they should be  amongst the first to receive the vaccine and get treated.   I thank the Madam Speaker for allowing me to address the House on  this issue of crisis, of imperative action that must be taken  immediately to address the millions and millions of families that are  scared in their homes with this pandemic raging across the country.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Garcia).                                time  1845     Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague Jesus Chuy Garcia  from the State of Illinois. As he clearly said, this pandemic is not  just about health issues and the catastrophe that has set on America  with the number of folks that are COVID-19 positive or dead, but also  has an economic dimension; small businesses must also get another round  of grants and PPP forgivable loans to ensure that they continue to  function, to ensure that they continue to provide jobs and  opportunities for our communities.   Madam Speaker, I thank you for this opportunity to allow the  Congressional Hispanic Caucus to talk about the importance of combating  the disparities laid bare by the COVID-19 pandemic and how we can make  up for the harm that has been wrought.   I want to thank all of my CHC colleagues, including Congressman  Garcia and those that were not here today, that I know are on the  streets every day attending to their districts and their communities to  ensure that we get through this together, for all the hard work that  they have been doing on a day-to-day basis since March to help their  constituents and keep all our communities safe.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
