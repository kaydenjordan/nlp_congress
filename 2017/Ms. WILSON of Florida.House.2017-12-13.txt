 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remind Congress  and the Nation that there are still many questions surrounding the  October ambush  [[Page H9854]]  in Niger during which my constituent, Sergeant La David Johnson and  three members of his unit were killed by Islamist militants.   This week, two news organizations reported disturbing details that  raise questions about the true nature of the unit's mission in Niger.  There also is a question of who exactly was making the decisions on  that fateful night: Was it the soldiers or their commanders back at  base?   According to one report, after being separated from the unit for 48  hours, Africa Command believed that Sergeant Johnson was still alive  and may have been captured, tortured, and executed.   The true story of what happened to Sergeant Johnson may be, in the  end, a source of embarrassment for the Pentagon and this Nation, but  the agency owes his family and the American people the truth, however  ugly it may be.   Mr. Speaker, I am committed to keeping this issue on the front burner  and in everyone's mind until we know what happened to Sergeant La David  Johnson.                            ____________________
