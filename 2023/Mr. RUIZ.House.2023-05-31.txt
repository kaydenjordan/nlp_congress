 Mr. Speaker, let's be clear. This bill is not about fiscal  responsibility. It is about the extreme GOP pushing their extreme  agenda.   Extreme Republicans demanded to cut veterans' healthcare; to zero out  the toxic exposures fund for sick, burn-pit-exposed veterans; to end  protections for our environment and allow polluters to expose workers  and communities to toxic chemicals for corporate profits; to cut  Medicare, childcare, and education; and to repeal efforts to make our  air and water cleaner, especially in vulnerable communities.   If they didn't get their way, they held hostage the American economy  and threatened to send America into default, raising costs for  families, cutting 1 million jobs for workers, and devastating seniors'  retirements.   Mr. Speaker, today, under this Republican-manufactured extreme  crisis, we will take up the bipartisan budget agreement to prevent a  Republican catastrophic default.   President Biden, in this bill, made sure veterans got the care that  they needed by funding the toxic exposures fund for burn pit veterans  and keeping in place the key provisions of the Inflation Reduction  Act's environmental and clean energy protections to stop polluters from  harming people. He was able to protect Medicaid, with no changes to  Medicaid, and maintain healthcare access for millions of families  across the country. He preserved funding for clean energy programs to  clean up our air.                                time  1500    Look, if extreme Republicans were serious about fiscal  responsibility, they would have accepted President Biden's budget that  would have reduced the deficit by $3 trillion. Instead, this bill only  reduces it by $1.5 trillion. Nevertheless, today I will vote for the  bipartisan agreement.
