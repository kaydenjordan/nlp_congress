 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a remarkable  individual from my district, Colonel Ralph Puckett, a 94-year-old  veteran who will soon receive the Nation's highest award, the Medal of  Honor.   Colonel Puckett is a Georgia native and a graduate of West Point.  Soon after graduating, he was deployed to fight in Korea in the 8th  Army Ranger Company. In November of 1950, he heroically led his Ranger  company on a freezing day at the Battle for Hill 205. His platoon was  overcome by an onslaught of Chinese attackers and a barrage of  artillery fire. Colonel Puckett sustained severe injuries during this  attack.   Although his injuries incapacitated him, Colonel Puckett selflessly  ordered Private First Class Billy G. Walls and Private First Class  Davis L. Pollock to leave him on the battlefield. He could see the  Chinese soldiers within yards of attacking his Rangers, but his  comrades returned to carry him to safety, despite the danger.   Colonel Puckett went on to serve honorably in Colombia, Germany, and  Vietnam until his retirement in 1971.  [[Page H2210]]  Though his Active Duty has ended, he continues to serve as Honorary  Colonel of the 75th Ranger Regiment, and he still inspires young people  in his community today.   Colonel Puckett was inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame and  received a Distinguished Service Cross for his actions at Hill 205, in  addition to two Silver Stars, five Purple Hearts, various awards from  Vietnam and Colombia, and a Distinguished Graduate Award from West  Point. His bravery is a testament to his strength and patriotism, and  he is an inspiration to the people of the Third District of Georgia, as  well as our country.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating  Colonel Puckett and extending our sincere appreciation to him and all  of our men and women in uniform. As a nation, we are forever grateful  for their service and their sacrifice.                            ____________________
