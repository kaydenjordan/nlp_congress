 Madam Chair, I just want to express my thanks to the  gentleman from Colorado for offering this refining amendment. I think  he is exactly right. In order to fully engage the American people, we  need to make every effort for them to participate.   And for young people who feel that they really don't have a say,  allowing them to pre-register helps them buy in to our American system  of government.   You know, somebody on the other side of the building said, well, this  is a power grab, to make sure that--H.R. 1 is a power grab. It is. It  is a power grab for the American people, to take the power away from  the special interests and give it to the American people. The  gentleman's amendment helps further that worthy goal, and I thank him  for offering it.    Madam Chair, I congratulate the gentlewoman from Arizona  (Mrs. Kirkpatrick) on this very smart amendment. I am not surprised. It  is typical that she would make this a bipartisan amendment. It is very  helpful. It is very smart. I am glad that she is back here in Congress  to show this leadership.   Just one word on the CBO: It shows that there is indeed no tax money  involved in the freedom from influence fund.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, for 8 years, this Chamber has been silent, a silence  that harms people. We have allowed measures to reduce people's access  to vote, measures that caused the Fourth Circuit to find that African  American voters were targeted with surgical precision, measures that  excluded voters on Indian reservations and that wrongfully tried to  remove 95,000 naturalized Texans from the rolls.   Today that silence ends. This bill is not for its own sake. A Member  of the U.S. Senate said that H.R. 1 is a power grab. He is right. It  grabs power away from the special interests, the elites, and the 1  percent and gives it to the American people.   I tell you plainly what it does: automatic voter registration to  allow 50 million eligible citizens to vote, prohibits deceptive  practices, increases access to polls for voters with disabilities,  helps States replace outdated voting machines, and requires disclosure  of dark money donors, not limiting their speech but simply asking them  to stand by it. These reforms aren't difficult, but they will require  courage to make.   Mr. Frederick Douglass saw what our democracy was and what our  democracy could be and said: ``Where all is plain there is nothing to  be argued.''   For that reason, I do not argue. But I look forward to joining and  doing the will of the people and supporting this bill.   I reserve the balance of my time, Madam Chair.                       Announcement by the Acting Chair     Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes), leader of H.R. 1, the author of the bill.    Madam Chair, may I inquire how much time remains.    Madam Chair, I yield the remainder of my time to the  gentleman from Georgia, the Honorable   John Lewis, hero of the voting  rights and civil rights movement.    I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I claim the time in opposition.    Madam Speaker, H.R. 1 already prevents noncitizens from  voting in Federal elections, whether they are here lawfully or  undocumented. In fact, the motion to recommit notices that. They say:  ``Federal law prohibits noncitizens from voting in Federal elections.''   H.R. 1 utilizes the authority in Article I, Section 4 to extend in  Federal elections the opportunity for every American to vote.   This motion to recommit is an effort to divert us from the mission  that we are on to expand voting rights to every American citizen in  Federal elections. I urge its defeat.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rose).    Madam Speaker, may I ask how much time remains.    At this point, Madam Speaker, I yield the balance of my  time to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis), the hero of the voting  rights movement.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
