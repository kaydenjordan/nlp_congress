 Madam Speaker, I would like to point out to the Members  here tonight once again that California had a very devastating fire  season last year. The whole Western States of America have.   The Dixie fire alone was nearly 1 million acres in my district.  Several other fires add up into the six-digit figures.   What we really need to do is have the United States Forest Service  identify a fire within the first 24 hours of when a fire occurs and  then pounce on it and put the fire out--no more monitoring fire.   Some other colleagues and I will be looking at legislation to put  that in place. We were promised by the Forest Service that would be  their policy. We need to enforce that. We need to have that be the  dedication they have toward taking care of these Federal lands.   Indeed, there are multi-uses for people, for timber, for  preservation. But when they go up in smoke, it just becomes a horrific  environmental problem: first, air quality, and then the ash, the silt  that is going to wash into our streams and oceans and water storage.   The Forest Service needs to get on the job.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise during this Special Order to offer  thoughts on the real State of the Union.   Last night, the President addressed the Nation and attempted to  rewrite the history of his first 14 months in office. The speech was  short on solutions to our everyday challenges: record inflation,  skyrocketing price of gas, and supply chain disruptions that are  affecting everything from food to consumer goods.   This administration owns this energy crisis, which is a direct result  of its crippling domestic production. When we don't produce our own  energy, it makes us more vulnerable to global market fluctuations such  as those caused by the Russian aggressions at Ukraine.   The Biden administration continues to ignore the national emergency  at our southern border with unprecedented illegal immigration, millions  of apprehensions, and limited deportations. It is a serious situation  that continues to threaten our national security.   Let's focus for a moment here on U.S. energy. America's been feeling  the ripple of skyrocketing energy prices. The average gallon of gas in  my home State of California is up 70 percent from this time last year,  and heating our homes is over 30 percent more expensive than winter  last year.   Economic sanctions on Russia and the halting of the Nord Stream  pipeline are sure to help increase the costs of energy, but they are  necessary in order for to us to have independence. This reality will be  a wake-up call for the Biden administration to reverse their current  course and understand that American-produced energy is the best path  forward.   After the President announced further sanctions on Russia due to the  unprovoked attack on Ukraine, he promised to supply energy to our  European allies that depend on Russian natural gas.   Since his first day in office, he has repeatedly stifled U.S. gas and  oil production, increasing our dependence on all things Russian oil.   I am an adamant supporter of domestic oil and gas production,  including building new pipelines. Right under our feet lies the largest  untapped oil supply in the world, more than enough to drive down costs  for American consumers and export liquefied natural gas to our European  allies, removing our adversaries like Russia from their supply chain.   In last night's State of the Union, the President called to make  Russia suffer  [[Page H1263]]  economic consequences for their unprovoked attack. He glossed over that  he has repeatedly stifled U.S. energy production, halting the Keystone  pipeline and suffocating domestic oil and gas leases.   Unfortunately, he did the opposite. Just this week, he announced he  is once again halting all new leases for drilling on our vast Federal  lands, which we know how to do well and ecologically soundly. His  solution? Import more gas from other adversaries such as China and the  Middle East.   Our Nation imports 7 percent of our oil from Russia. Although that  may seem like not much, if they shut it off when we are not ready for  it, that will cause a big ripple.   We can't just flip a switch and turn on our domestic energy supply.  It will take time to do it. We know what we need to do. We need to get  at it, to start now.   The American people are being crushed under the weight of these  economic consequences from failed policies. We know what we need to do.  Let's get after it.
