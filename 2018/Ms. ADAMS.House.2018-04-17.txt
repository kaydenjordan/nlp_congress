 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and legacy of my dear friend,  Congresswoman Louise Slaughter. I didn't know her as long as many of my  colleagues, but our brief association was profound and meaningful.   When I came to Congress 4 years ago, Louise Slaughter was one of the  first to welcome me. She was always genuine, kind, and personally  supportive, always pleasant, and she always made you feel really good.   As a history-making, trailblazing champion of women's rights and the  only microbiologist, as you have heard, in Congress, Louise Slaughter  fought for opportunity for all people. The impact of her years of  advocacy and mentorship and friendship can be seen here today in the  many colleagues who are standing together to honor her life.   Louise was a champion for the people from the great State of New  York, but I like to think of her with Kentucky roots and a Southern  accent, as a fellow Southerner at heart. She left big shoes to fill,  but I know she would be proud to welcome in the next generation of  leaders.   So I join my colleagues this evening in expressing my deepest  sympathies for the family, for the friends, for the staff, and for the  constituents that she leaves behind. She may no longer be with us on  Earth, but her spirit and her passion for life will live on for  generations to come. She clearly made our world much better than she  found it.
