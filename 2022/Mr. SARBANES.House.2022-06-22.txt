 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise today in support of H.R. 7666, the  Restoring Hope for Mental Health and Well-Being Act of 2022.   Our Nation, as you know, is facing a continuing mental health and  substance use crisis that has only been exacerbated by the COVID-19  pandemic. This crisis touches the lives of individuals in each and  every corner of our country and has a particularly acute impact on  children and teens.   Recognizing this, last October, the American Academy of Pediatrics,  the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and the  Children's Hospital Association declared a national emergency in child  and adolescent mental health.   To wrap our arms as a society around children facing mental and  behavioral health challenges, I recently joined in introducing H.R.  7248, the Continuing Systems of Care for Children Act, with my  colleagues Representatives Joyce, Underwood, and Gimenez, a bipartisan  bill that I am proud is included in H.R. 7666 today.   This legislation would reauthorize for 5 years two important grant  programs; one that provides comprehensive community mental health  services for children with serious emotional disturbances, as well as  the Youth and Family TREE Program.   These programs connect children and teenagers to services that meet  their individual needs and have a sustained positive impact on their  well-being.   As we confront the compounding challenges posed by our mental health  and behavioral health crisis and our national gun violence crisis,  Congress must provide our children every resource they need to lead  safe and healthy lives.   That is why it is so important that we pass the Restoring Hope for  Mental Health and Well-Being Act today to bolster mental health  services and better support our communities now and into the future.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this  legislation.
