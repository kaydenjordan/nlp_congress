 Mr. Speaker, every community has peace officers who put  their lives on the line every day to protect their communities, and we  don't say thank you nearly often enough.   Today I rise to recognize four very special school resource deputies  of the Cass County Sheriff's Office who have been given the Model  Agency Award, which is the top honor that is given by the National  Association of School Resource Officers.   This award recognizes the work of law enforcement officers who  promote safer schools and safer children, and they singled out the Cass  County program as ``a shining example of the school resource officers  program.''   The deputies work with students at Kindred, Maple Valley, Central  Cass, Northern Cass, and Mapleton Elementary Schools. Supervised by  Sergeant Tim Briggeman and under the command of Captain Jesse Jahner,  the deputies are Jason Scott, Joe Crawford, Chris Potter, and Dan  Hermann. Cass County Sheriff Paul Laney calls these officers the ``best  of the best.''   On behalf of all North Dakotans, I congratulate them and thank  Sheriff Laney and his entire staff for the high bar of excellence they  deliver in serving all the citizens of Cass County.                            ____________________
