 Mr. Speaker, Federal, State, and local law enforcement  officers put their lives on the line every day to keep our communities  safe. This Police Week, we want to thank the more than 800,000 sworn  law enforcement officers for their service, and we want to thank their  families.   During Police Week, we also remember the sacrifices made by law  enforcement officers. Since 1786, when the first police death was  recorded in the U.S., more than 22,000 officers have been killed in the  line of duty.   In my home State of New Mexico, 160 police officers have died in the  line of duty.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute and let our police officers know  how much we appreciate them and their service to our communities, our  State, and our Nation. We just want to celebrate this Police Week with  them and wish them Godspeed and say a prayer to keep them out of harm's  way.                            ____________________
