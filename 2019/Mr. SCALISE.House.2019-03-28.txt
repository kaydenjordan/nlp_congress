 Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Hoyer) for two important reasons. One is to inquire of the majority  leader the schedule for the coming week, and also to inquire of the  majority leader the score of the LSU-Maryland basketball game from last  week.   I yield to my good friend from Maryland.  [[Page H2901]]         I will be happy to ask both questions again.   I look forward to the Maryland crab dinner. I think, as the gentleman  from Maryland knows, a lot of times when you go to places and they say  it is Maryland crab, it is really Gulf of Mexico crab, because they  want the best quality to offer the patrons.   We were excited to see the buzzer beater. I know both of us were  waiting in those last 12 seconds to see which team would walk away with  the Sweet 16 banner. I am proud that my mighty Fighting Tigers of LSU  were in that number. But we will come to D.C., and, hopefully, the  gentleman will now be rooting for us so that he can say he rooted for  the eventual national champion, LSU Tigers, to win the Final Four.   I yield to the gentleman to hear about the schedule for the coming  week in Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the schedule  update.   I would like to inquire, we know that there are only 7 legislative  days left for Congress to meet its required deadline to provide a  budget, the April 15 deadline. What troubles me is that there has been  no budget brought through the House Budget Committee. In fact, there  have been reports that your majority doesn't plan to bring a budget at  all.   Obviously, the budgets are very important to show the priorities of  our Congress, to show the priorities of each of our majorities, as we  did in 7 of the 8 years we were in the majority, not only doing a  budget, but then, this last year, we were able to reach a 2-year budget  agreement, so we were able to know with certainty what the budget  numbers were that we would actually be working on to draft our  appropriations bills. Again, the bills carry out the priorities of  Congress, to show the country how we are going to properly fund  government at the levels that we, as a Congress, set, which is what the  budget does.   As I have seen, there is no current budget agreement negotiation  going on that is yielding anything. So, without a budget agreement,  does the gentleman plan to at least provide and bring a budget to the  House floor?   I yield to the gentleman.    I will be happy to walk through the last 8 years.    Mr. Speaker, last year, as the gentleman knows, we were  working under a 2-year budget agreement. Typically, we don't have a 2- year budget agreement. You bring one budget, and that is the budget for  that year.   For fiscal year 2012, the House passed a budget. In our majority, we  passed a budget to establish those numbers to then start the  appropriations process.   In 2013, we passed through the House a budget to establish the 2013  budget numbers to work off of.   In 2014, we passed a budget through the House to establish the budget  for that fiscal year.   In 2015, we passed a budget through the House to establish a budget  for that year.   In 2016, we actually got an agreement, both between the House and the  Senate, and passed the budget, of course, through the House and the  Senate.   In fiscal year 2017, we passed a budget through the House and the  Senate and got a full agreement to do an appropriations process.   In fiscal year 2018, as the gentleman knows, we actually agreed to a  2-year budget agreement to not only set the fiscal year numbers for 1  year, but for 2 years, which was tremendously helpful in making sure  that our Nation's defense, which many times had been used as bargaining  chips for other budget negotiations, we took that off the table. We  made sure our men and women in uniform had the certainty of a 2-year  budget agreement, which doesn't happen often. Frankly, it should happen  more often, and we should strive toward that, so we achieved that.   In 2019, as the gentleman knows, we passed a budget out of the House  Budget Committee, but we already had a budget agreement to work through  the appropriations process because we had done a 2-year budget the  prior year.                                time  1115    We don't have even a 1-year budget agreement right now. And as the  gentleman knows, there are no fruitful negotiations to get a 1- or 2- year budget agreement, so there is no budget number to work off of,  which is why you produce a budget.   Last year, we did bring a bill out of committee, but we didn't need  to pass a budget because we already had the budget number agreed to  from the 2-year deal prior.   And so with that, is the gentleman willing to engage in or come to an  agreement on at least a 1- or 2-year budget agreement so that we can  actually have an appropriations process that works for the country and  shows the priorities of this Nation?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.  [[Page H2902]]         Mr. Speaker, I, too, am hopeful that we are able to  start an appropriations process and, ideally, to complete it by  summer--well in advance of the September 30 government funding  deadline--because we shouldn't be operating under deadline after  deadline, where we go until the midnight hour.   But as the gentleman knows, you can't start an appropriations process  until you actually set what are known as the 302 numbers, the 302(a)  and (b) numbers, so that we know what each appropriations bill can  target in terms of its overall spending number, to have that caps  limit.   Ideally, it would be done through a budget with the April 15  deadline, but maybe the gentleman is going to be able to work with the  committee to get a budget passed out of committee before the deadline  and, if not, as the gentleman urges, a hopeful desire to get a caps  deal. I would like to get a caps deal as well.   I supported the last caps deal because it gave us 2 years of  certainty. It was bipartisan. It was an agreement that, while we may  disagree on top-line numbers--and we want more money for defense, and  some on your side might want more for nondefense discretionary--we  finally came to an agreement. That did give tremendous certainty to our  men and women in uniform. So over 70 percent of this Federal Government  was fully funded for the fiscal year.   Clearly, we had a difference on border security, and that remaining  area of our budget wasn't funded. But at least the 70-plus percent of  the people of this country who rely on those services and want a strong  defense were able to see us achieve that. Hopefully, we can do  something like that again well before the deadline. That is the  objective.    Mr. Speaker, I would be happy to yield.     Mr. Speaker, as I pointed out earlier, you have two  methods within which to set those caps: You can do it through the  budget--which 7 of the 8 years we were in the minority we did--or you  can do it through a separate caps deal, which 2 years ago we were able  to do for a 2-year period, which is why we didn't do a budget last  year. We passed it out of committee and at least showed what our  priorities are, but we didn't need to pass a budget to get a caps deal  because we had a caps deal in place from the prior year.   The other 7 years there was no caps deal, so the budget laid out that  number, and the gentleman's majority has done neither. You don't have a  caps deal or a budget, and so at some point you are going to have to  produce the number to show what we are going to start the  appropriations process using.   The other part of the budget, which isn't talked about as much but is  equally important, is the establishment of the priorities for that  majority. How do we get back to a balanced Federal budget, for example?  We laid that out in our budget multiple times.   We have programs like Medicare. Medicare is going bankrupt if we do  nothing. It would be irresponsible for us to let Medicare go to  bankruptcy. Actual reports show it could go bankrupt in the next 8  years, which we  [[Page H2903]]  think is irresponsible. That is why we put, in our budget, a plan to  save Medicare from bankruptcy.   Whatever the gentleman's plan would be to save Medicare from  bankruptcy, I would urge him to show it. Show the American people what  the priorities are. But they haven't done that.   And why? Why haven't they done that? Because they have spent the last  2 years trying to impeach the President, trying to lay out this  foundation that there was collusion.    The gentleman will yield in a moment.   But let's be clear, for the last 2 years we heard this clarion call  that there was some collusion between the President or his family and  Russia. We heard all this talk about impeachment and everything on down  from the highest levels, including, now, the chairman of the House  Intelligence Committee, who went multiple times on national TV and said  there was more than credible evidence of collusion.   Finally, everybody was waiting on the Mueller report. Many were  hanging their hat, saying it is going to show all these things. There  is going to be a list of indictments. Go look at all the tapes from  every national TV show you can imagine of some of the most outlandish  claims that were made. And now the Mueller report comes out, and it is  clear those claims are baseless. There was no collusion.    There was no collusion.    We will see the full Mueller report.    Clearly, we have seen assessments of it. If the  gentleman thinks it is going to show something differently, then please  share it, but they made it clear there was no collusion and there will  be no further indictments.   In fact, the Attorney General of the United States said this: ``But  as noted above, the special counsel did not find that the Trump  campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with  the Russian Government in these efforts, despite multiple offers from  Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign.''   So multiple times they were offered, they never even came close.  There was no collusion.   These conspiracy theories, the witch hunts, it is time for it to end.  There was no collusion.   If you or any of your colleagues have proof of collusion, as your  chairman of the House Intelligence Committee claims, they need to show  that to the Attorney General of the United States, because it  completely contradicts what the Attorney General has now said based on  the findings of the Mueller report.    There was no collusion.   And so when Chairman Schiff says, ``more than circumstantial  evidence''--that he has seen--``that associates of President Trump  colluded with Russia''--in August, ``I think there is plenty of  evidence of collusion or conspiracy in plain sight.''   And even now that the Attorney General makes it very clear there was  no collusion, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee will not  recant his previous statements that have been discounted.   Today, as the gentleman knows, this morning, every member of the  minority party on the House Intelligence Committee called for the  chairman of the Intelligence Committee to step down, every member.   So I would ask the gentleman: Will you call for the chairman of the  Intelligence Committee to step down as chairman after losing so much  credibility in the wild and vicious claims that he has made that have  been disputed by the Attorney General of the United States based on  this Mueller report after 22 months and over $20 million of taxpayer  money that found no collusion?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Crimes of collusion?    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, there are a number of  items that need to be addressed in what the gentleman just said.   First of all, to claim that there was any collusion as you said, ``on  behalf of the President of the United States with Russia'' goes in  complete contradiction to the findings that were delivered to us by the  Attorney General of the United States, and I am going to read it one  more time.         As we noted above, the special counsel did not find that       the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or       coordinated with the Russian Government.    Anyone who would make a claim to the contrary is either being  irresponsible or ought to show the evidence. If there is evidence that  the chairman of the Intelligence Committee has, and  [[Page H2904]]  let's be clear, he has tweeted things out, here is what we know. This  is from Chairman Schiff. In 2017, here is what we know: The Russians  offered help. The campaign accepted help. The Russians gave help. The  President made full use of that help. He has claimed, again, that he  has more than circumstantial evidence that there was collusion.   Yet, the Attorney General of the United States, after reviewing the  entire Mueller report, which we hope we all see, obviously, within the  confines of the law--the law makes it clear how something like that  gets reported--I hope the gentleman understands and wouldn't suggest  that classified information should be disclosed--but the report ought  to be disclosed and show the American people what they have found. But  we have seen the summary of it, and, of course, we are going to look at  the entire thing.   And maybe then after reviewing the entire thing, if the gentleman  does see, as the report summary shows, that there was no collusion with  the President of the United States, then maybe this gentleman and all  of the other people who have made outrageous claims that the President  was in collusion, will maybe acknowledge they were wrong, will maybe  offer an apology. Who knows. We can hold out hope for that.   But let's be clear about the statements that were made and the things  that were alluded to that aren't true, that weren't the case. Maybe it  was wishful thinking and it shouldn't have been. No one should hope  that the President of the United States, any President, conspired with  a foreign government.   But to suggest it over and over again for 2 years, and then for all  of this 22 months of investigation, thorough investigation, multiple  countries visited, over $20 million of taxpayer money, more than our  committees have to run all of their oversight operations to thoroughly  investigate, they found there was no collusion.   Sure, the Russians tried to meddle with elections and they have done  it before, and we ought to make sure that it doesn't happen again, and  we can work together on that. But to suggest that the President of the  United States colluded when he didn't, is irresponsible. And it has  happened over and over, and it continues to this day. It has got to  stop.   This idea that maybe some other attempt to go and harass the  President and his family is going to find something else, it gives  credence to the claims it was a witch hunt. It is time for us to focus  on the real problems of this country.   It is also time for us to hold people in our intelligence agencies  accountable, those who showed up at their job with a partisan agenda.   The FBI, CIA, or any intelligence agency is no place for you to bring  your political agenda. We all have political views. But if someone puts  that badge on and accepts that responsibility, and then uses that  position to abuse power, we all ought to call on it to be rooted out,  and I hope it is rooted out.    If there were abuses of the FISA process, which is a very important  court that has a very narrow focus to protect the national security of  this country, if the FISA court was abused by people in positions of  power because they wanted to carry out a political agenda because they  didn't like the results of the 2016 Presidential election, that is not  the place for it.   The ballot box next year is the place to go carry it out, not wearing  the badge and being a member of law enforcement in this country. So I  hope that is rooted out, because we want to see the integrity of those  institutions like the FBI restored. I want the country to have full  faith and confidence that the people working there are carrying out the  national security interests of the country, not their own political  interests.   There are a lot of questions raised over whether or not that  happened. But in the end, when we review the report--we have seen the  summary. If people are still hoping that there is some mystery  indictment out there--they said there are no further indictments. They  said there was no collusion with the Presidential campaign.   So at what time is the gentleman's side going to acknowledge it  didn't happen? If you want to change the results of the Presidential  election, the results are changed at the ballot box. That is how we  resolve it in America. We don't try to go find something on a President  that doesn't exist.   We have done oversight. You have done oversight. The Mueller  investigation was the ultimate oversight for 22 months and it rooted  out and found there was no collusion between the President and the  Russians. Maybe some people are disappointed to hear it.   We should all celebrate that as a country, but we all ought to be  concerned that no President of the United States is targeted by an  intelligence agency, or by a Congress, or a majority, or a minority  because they don't like the results of the election, so they are going  to abuse power to go and try to take them down. That is not the way we  do it.   I hope we can finally focus on the real problems of this country and  not continue to use these committees even after they didn't find what  they were looking for to keep finding something that is not there.   The former chairman that was alluded to, Mr. Nunes, did a very  impeccable job of carrying out his duties to find the facts. It was  always about the facts. And if you go and look at how he carried  himself and managed his committee, the entire time it was about finding  the facts. They looked and we looked. There was no conclusion that we  found.   If someone has proof of that conclusion that they keep alluding to,  it is time for them to show it. Show the American people what you have.  Don't run around hiding saying you have something when the Attorney  General says it is not there.   If someone knows about collusion, they owe it to the country to show  it. But if it is not there, stop saying it. It is irresponsible, and,  hopefully, everybody heeds those words and we get back to focusing on  what is important for this country. Express our political differences.   Obviously, if there is a political difference that we have with each  other, with the President, with a Cabinet Secretary, we have all kinds  of forums to express that opposition to correct it, to bring  legislation to the floor.   But if we just don't like somebody personally, that is not what we  are here to do. And I hope we can get beyond that.   I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, whether or not there is an ultimate move  towards something like impeachment, which I hope wouldn't come, and  with all the things we know--there are no high crimes or misdemeanors  and there is not even collusion--there are still committee chairmen in  the gentleman's own party who are talking about impeachment. It is not  something made up. There are leaders in the gentleman's party talking  about it.   The chairman of the Judiciary Committee issued more than 80  subpoenas. Again, the majority can keep looking. Look at the summary of  the Mueller report--2,800 subpoenas, more than 500 search warrants, and  interviews of approximately 500 witnesses. So the gentleman can talk  about people who were indicted who have nothing to do with the  collusion and nothing to do with any ties to the President. Maybe  somebody had filed a false tax return, then go throw the book at him.   Mr. Cohen came and lied to Congress, and he deserves to go to jail  for it. What did the majority do? They brought him back as their star  witness, a man who was already guilty of lying to Congress. He came,  swore himself in, and likely lied to Congress again. So, again, throw  the book at him.   But in terms of what the basis of the investigation was, it was to  find collusion, and they found none: no further indictments; no  evidence of collusion; in fact, saw the Trump campaign pushing back and  even offers for help.   Foreign governments like Russia trying to interfere with our  elections clearly happened--not just Russia, other countries too--and  we all ought to be concerned about it. We all want to make sure that  our defenses are as high as we can make them so that they are not able  to collude.   We have seen companies in America that were taken advantage of during  that campaign season, and they have taken corrective actions, too, so  that Russia can't use social media companies in this Nation to try to  take advantage of our electoral system.   But in terms of collusion with the President of the United States and  a foreign government, it didn't happen. If anybody has evidence to the  contrary, then show it to the American people. Stop alluding behind  some cloak-and-dagger conspiracy theory that it happened still to this  day when the Mueller investigation concluded it didn't happen.   We will get the full report. I look forward to reviewing it just as  the gentleman from Maryland is looking forward to reviewing it, and  maybe we will continue this conversation.   But if all of the findings that the Attorney General gave us in his  summary are accurate, which I don't discount they will be--I think they  will be at the highest level of confidence that the Attorney General's  summary is accurate. If it is not, then clearly we will take that up  separately. But if it turns out to be accurate, then I think we all  ought to celebrate, number one, the fact that there was no collusion,  but then move on.   The people who made accusations that turned out to be baseless ought  to apologize and recognize there are people's personal lives and  integrity that were being questioned. If it turned out they were wrong  in making those accusations, then they ought to hold themselves  accountable and to a higher standard. Those are the points that I was  making.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I share the gentleman's concern about  addressing those important issues.   I will say, for the five people whom the gentleman referenced,  anybody who broke the law ought to be held accountable. But after 500  witnesses are interviewed and over 2,800 subpoenas, all looking to find  collusion with the Russian Government, not one of the people the  gentleman mentioned had anything to do with colluding with the Russian  Government.   If they made misstatements or if they didn't pay their taxes, after  2,800 subpoenas, then make sure that they are held accountable for the  things they did, but don't suggest that it had anything to do with  collusion with Russia, because it didn't.   Again, Mr. Speaker, go pull 500 names out of the phonebook, and if  you put the full weight of the United States Government and 2,800  subpoenas into looking into 500 random people, I am sure not one of  them will have done anything wrong--and hopefully not. But if they did  and it had nothing to do with what you were initially looking for,  let's not try to suggest it had anything to do with collusion, because  it didn't.   We will see the full report. We look forward to seeing that. Again,  hopefully, if the full report shows what we have already seen in the  summary, that there was no collusion, then people who have been  claiming there was collusion will also hold themselves accountable and  maybe apologize, maybe recant, but surely stop continuing any kind of  witch hunt and then focus on these important issues like getting our  economy even stronger; working with this President to solve big  problems which we have the opportunity to do to get a real trade  agreement with our neighbors Mexico and Canada, all of whom want to  have better trade relationships with us and help benefit our economy,  create more jobs, and have fairer labor standards; something we have in  front of us, an opportunity to do in a bipartisan way, maybe get a  budget agreement so that we can have, certainly well before the  September 30 deadline, how we are going to fund our government in a  responsible way, make sure our men and women in uniform don't have to  wonder whether or not they are going to get paid while they are  deployed in a foreign country; make sure we can focus on lowering  healthcare costs; and immigration reform that can solve some of the big  problems on border security and some of the other areas.   So, hopefully, we can find agreement on that, and I am sure, in the  coming weeks, we will on some, if not all, those issues. I look forward  to working with the gentleman to do that.   I appreciate, while we go back and forth sometimes, we can have a  little fun with our hobbies, but we also have big, important tasks; and  I know that the gentleman carries out his role in the most responsible  way to promote the agenda that he thinks is best for this country, as  do I, and, ideally, we can find a lot of intersection where we can work  together to get really good things done for the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
