Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings),  my dear friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the purpose of debate only.  [[Page H9270]]                                     time  1245                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I want to start by saying that I would  offer my thanks and collegial admiration and respect to the members of  the Rules Committee who, last night, once again, on an expedited basis,  spent time devoted to the duty that they have not only to their party,  but also to the House of Representatives acting on behalf of the  American people.   The gentlewoman, Ms. Slaughter; the gentleman, Mr. Hastings; the  gentleman, Mr. Polis; and certainly our friend from Worcester,  Massachusetts, the gentleman, Mr. McGovern, conducted themselves not  only in the highest of spirit, but they also produced what I believe  was a fair argument, a product that they could be proud of. Each of the  witnesses that came before us, including Democratic Members of Congress  and Republican Members of Congress, provided, I believe, top-notch  testimony and information on behalf of their ideas.   I personally want to thank Judge Hastings for his time last night,  which was late into the night, and today. My admiration and respect for  his collegial activity is to be respected and appreciated.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule and the underlying  legislation. The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 1, the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act.   Last November, the November which was 1 year ago, the American people  spoke, and they spoke clearly. I believe they stood up and demanded  change and action on our economy. They demanded an increase in  understanding about America's lack in GDP growth, and they saw all  across the country companies that continue to move overseas. They saw  movement in our economy where people moved from one State to another  seeking better opportunities.   I believe that the American people have spoken. We not only heard  that, but we are trying to make decisions now that would not only help  every single area of the country by picking those businesses that might  be in the city, in the town and location that they want to be, but by  infusing them with the opportunity to stay, to stay because they can  not only make a go of it, but they can be competitive in the world  market.   Lowering tax rates in this country will help the middle class of this  country. It will help jobs and job creation. That is why we are here  today. We are here today as a Republican Party where we are trying to  work with the President of the United States, the United States Senate,  and the House of Representatives to speak clearly about not only what  we stand for, but our hopes and dreams for a better opportunity for all  Americans tomorrow and in the future.   Mr. Speaker, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act delivers on those promises  that I just spoke of. This is a bold, progrowth bill that will overhaul  our Tax Code and unleash the free enterprise system not just in my home  State of Texas or in my city of Dallas, but, really, everywhere where  business wants to be, it can flourish in an unfettered way because we  are now going to be competitive. It lowers tax rates on all businesses  of all sizes so job creators can focus on not only their product and  sales, but they can hire more people, increasing paychecks and growth.   Growth actually is the key to what we are talking about today.  Economic growth brings abundant opportunity: opportunity for people not  only to have a job, but to have a career, control their own lives and  make sure they can live where they want to live and so they can make  their community stronger. That is this Republican viewpoint of what we  are trying to get at, Mr. Speaker.   With the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world,  today's broken Tax Code here in America forces many businesses to move  their jobs, research, and headquarters overseas seeking opportunities  in a world environment of competition where they can survive and they  can become more competitive. A corporate tax rate of 20 percent  encourages American companies to bring their jobs back to the United  States, opening up opportunity. This decrease is fundamental to making  the United States more competitive once again.   The number one reason why America is not competitive in the world is  no longer because of energy costs; it is no longer because we have the  highest priced employees, no, sir. It is because Uncle Sam, State, and  local taxes make it noncompetitive, which creates a higher cost as we  compete around the globe.   This legislation will modernize the international Tax Code, also  bringing back opportunities for American companies that want to bring  their profits back home and encourage U.S. businesses to bring foreign  earnings home, unleashing what will be, over some period of time,  trillions of dollars that can come back home.   It reduces the tax burden on all passthrough businesses regardless of  their structure or their sector. This legislation provides tax relief  for job creators and creates capital investments, investments that will  drive growth, once again, of paychecks and opportunities for growth.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is a direct and immediate boost for middle- income Americans who have been struggling to get by, let alone get  ahead.   Mr. Speaker, you will hear today how we are going to have a new tax  bracket. All Americans until they, as individuals, earn $12,000 and two  working people at home earning $24,000 worth of income will not pay tax  on that. It is intended entirely to help the middle class of this  country.   H.R. 1 is about the entrepreneur, the family of four, the small- business owner, and the American people. The United States is already  the greatest place in the world to live. We are proud to be Americans.  But we have to be competitive in the world marketplace.   Mr. Speaker, 70 percent of the tax benefits in this legislation go  directly to the middle class. The American people want and need, I  believe, to learn not only more about this bill, but how it will  incentivize them to Make America Great Again.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's observations. We don't have  4\1/2\ years to work through the process that he talked about. The  American people want and need something done right now.   I say to the gentleman that he is right, the economy is roaring--and  it has been roaring since the day Donald Trump won the election--with  an expectation of performance.   Why are we doing this now? Why at Thanksgiving? Why at the end of the  year?   We are going to see that American business, as it makes plans for the  future, is going to look up and say: We have got a better shot at  keeping jobs here. We have got a better shot at being competitive here.   I think what is going to happen is you are going to see this boom,  this big opportunity that is already well underway, to continue. But it  is up to us to deliver that. It will be one party. It will be those  pesky Republicans that will get it done. We are going to get it done,  Mr. Speaker.  [[Page H9272]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Burgess), a member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Newhouse), a member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Byrne), a gentleman who participated for hours in the  Rules Committee debate last night and is one of our most valuable young  Members.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, what a delight it is for me to stand up and say that,  the work we are going to do today, the President of the United States  will sign. He is encouraging what we are doing today.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter of support from the  National Federation of Independent Business--that is ``The Voice of  Small Business'' in America--and also what is called a Statement of  Administration Policy from the Executive Office of the President of the  United States.                                              National Federation of                                            Independent Business,                                  Washington, DC, November 14, 2017.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the National Federation       of Independent Business (NFIB), the nation's leading small       business advocacy organization, I am writing in support of       H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This legislation will       provide much needed tax relief to America's job-creating       small businesses. H.R. 1 will be considered an NFIB Key Vote       for the 115th Congress.        Small business is the engine of the economy, and tax reform       should provide substantial relief to all small businesses so       they can reinvest their money, grow, and create jobs. Ninety-      nine percent of all American businesses are small businesses;       the average NFIB member has just 10 employees. Taken in sum,       however, small businesses create half of all private-sector       jobs in the U.S. and contribute half the nation's gross       domestic product.        Three-quarters of small employers are structured as pass-      through entities, meaning their owners are taxed at the       individual rate as opposed to the corporate rate. Crucially,       H.R. 1 reduces the tax rate on the smallest pass-through       businesses to 9 percent over five years, without industry       exclusions or restrictions.        NFIB supports passage of H.R. 1 and will consider it an       NFIB Key Vote for the 115th Congress.        Thank you for your consideration. We look forward to       working with you to protect small business.            Sincerely,                                               Juanita D. Duggan,                                              President & CEO, NFIB.                     Statement of Administration Policy      H.R. 1--Tax Cuts and Jobs Act--Rep. Brady, R-TX, and 24 cosponsors         The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R.       1, the Tax Cuts and  [[Page H9274]]       Jobs Act. Passing the bill is an important first step in       achieving comprehensive tax reform that cuts taxes for hard-      working families and puts the Nation's economy on a path of       higher economic growth. The President's priorities for tax       reform have been consistent from day one: (1) cut taxes for       middle-income families; (2) simplify the Nation's complicated       tax system; and (3) reduce business taxes so that American       employers can create jobs, raise wages for their workers, and       better compete with foreign businesses.        H.R. 1 would deliver meaningful tax cuts for middle-income       families by nearly doubling the standard deduction, lowering       tax rates, increasing the child tax credit, and creating a       new Family Flexibility credit. It would simplify tax filing       so that the large majority of Americans could file their       taxes on a single page. The bill would also cut the corporate       tax rate to 20 percent--below the average tax rate in the       Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.       Finally, H.R. 1 would lower taxes for millions of S       corporations, sole proprietors, and partnerships that pay       taxes at individual rates.        Based on a review of more than 100 academic papers, the       White House Council of Economic Advisors (CEA) estimates that       the corporate provisions in H.R. 1 would grow the economy by       between 3 and 5 percent over the next 10 years, which if       applied to 2027 Gross Domestic Product projections, would       result in an additional $700 billion to $1.2 trillion in       economic output per year. CEA also found that the same       provisions would increase average household income by at       least $4,000 annually.        If H.R. 1 were presented to the President, his advisors       would recommend that he sign the bill into law.    Mr. Speaker, the President's priorities and tax reforms  are consistent and have been from day one.   Tax cuts for middle class families, simplifying the Nation's  complicated tax system, and reducing the burden of taxes so that  American employers can create jobs, raise wages, and better compete  with foreign businesses, that is what we are going to do.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am waiting for a speaker, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), a gentleman who serves on the Financial  Services Committee and a distinguished young Member of our majority.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly), from the Ways and Means Committee. At this  time, we are putting the A-team up.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time until the  gentleman has closed.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, the gentleman from  Florida, Judge Hastings, for his exemplary work and the work of his  colleagues on the Rules Committee and my colleagues also on the  Republican side.   Mr. Speaker, our previous speaker, the gentleman from Butler,  Pennsylvania, Mike Kelly, had it best when he said: `` . . . an economy  hampered by restrictive tax rates will never produce enough revenue to  balance our budget, just as it will never produce enough jobs or enough  profits. Only full employment can balance the budget, and tax reduction  can pave the way to that employment.''   What he did not say is--that will be in the record--is that John F.  Kennedy said this on December 14, 1962, 55 years ago, in an address to  the Economic Club of New York.   Mr. Speaker, in fact, there have been a lot of people here who have  given testimony, I think testimony that they intended to sway the  voters and those listening in this country that the Tax Code that we  have works just fine, but then they spoke about the frailties of that  and they talked about jobs going offshore, they talked about jobs and  economic activity going somewhere else.   I, being from Dallas, Texas, hear stories every day about people who  are coming to Texas, coming to north Texas, coming because of the  economic climate that will allow them and their companies to have a  better shot at not only being competitive, but, as Mike Kelly said, to  be winners in this economy, at the very top of the heap rather than at  the bottom of the heap.   What this common denominator is, is that my State of Texas does do  the things that this bill does also. It keeps taxes low, it creates  opportunity.   By the way, how many poor people create jobs?   I don't know.   How many of those who really have incentive and entrepreneurship  create jobs?   A ton of them.   We are going to grow entrepreneurs out of today. We are going to grow  young people getting out of college, veterans leaving the military  coming back and seeing where they can make a go of it. Instead of it  being a 95 percent failure rate of new business--which is what it is,  it is a heavy bar because of rules, regulations, and taxes--we are  going to make it easier.   The White House Council of Economic Advisers based their review, as  they provided the economic outlook to us, on more than 100 academic  papers, estimates that corporate provisions in this tax bill alone will  grow our economy, not leave us in 23rd place, as Mike Kelly said.   Who wants to be in 23rd place?   If you want to be in the top 25 and you are comfortable, sorry.   We want to be at the top. We want to Make America Great Again. We  want to be able to say that businesses all over the United States stand  a chance, and that is what this does.   The Council of Economic Advisers says that this will grow the economy  between 3 and 5 percent.   Whoops. They got comfortable with 1.2 over 8 years. I am not  comfortable and the American people aren't comfortable either.   We are going to add some $700 billion to the economy this next 10  years. That is the guess, that is what Republicans want to do, but it  is based on a lot of factors, it is based on hard work.   America has the best, most innovative workers in the world. We want  to put this together with an opportunity, because we have a great place  to be: the United States of America, any of our States. We have the  best energy policies in the world and we have the best price. We have  the best workers. We have tool kits with our universities. Our industry  will grow back and reinvest in themselves.   We are going to take our Tax Code and take what is $5.6 trillion  worth of tax areas and move that where it will boost our economy. We  will become pro growth again. Yes, we heard that it was John F.  Kennedy, it was Ronald Reagan, and it is going to be making America  great again.   Mr. Speaker, for that reason, I urge my colleagues to support this  rule and the underlying legislation in order to boost middle class  Americans.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
