 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Burgess) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate our Republican colleagues on finally  releasing their big plan to end inflation. What a day.   We have all been home for 2 weeks. We know inflation is a big  problem. We hear about it at the supermarket. We see it in our  communities. It is a global problem impacting every single country.   Now over the last 2 years, Democrats here in the House, alongside  President Biden, have taken aggressive action to fight inflation and  lower prices, and at every step Republicans have voted ``no,'' ``no,''  ``no.''   At every step, they have boasted about their own alternative  comprehensive plan to stop inflation in its tracks. It has got to be  big. It has got to be really big; can't wait to read it. Wow, wait  until you hear about the Republican plan to stop inflation in its  tracks.   Forgive me if I am confused today, because after months of waiting  with bated breath, after all your announcements and after all your  press releases and all your tweets about inflation, we finally find out  what your big plan to stop inflation really is, your big bill to  address the American people's number one concern.   It is a report. More government paperwork. Great.   I mean, will people be able to print out the report and trade it in  for cheaper gas or lower food prices? Because unless they can, and I am  not an economist here, but I don't think this is going to make a  difference.   The bill, and I hesitate to call it a bill, because it might as well  be a tweet or a press release, does nothing. Maybe it should be an  amendment to an actual bill that fights inflation--just a suggestion.  Don't try to pass this off as a real plan. Don't pretend this actually  does anything.   I am embarrassed. I am embarrassed for my Republican colleagues, to  be honest.   Mr. Speaker, it took 2 years to put this together?   The number one issue for the American people and this is what they  come up with?   A book report on inflation.   It reminds me of the time last year when they tried to solve crime  with a report. This is what happens when you  [[Page H926]]  try to write a bill for Twitter instead of a bill that actually helps  everyday people.   The audacity, the sheer audacity of saying all this inflation was  caused by President Biden when the guy before him added nearly $8  trillion to the national debt, when the guy before him presided over a  39 percent increase in the national debt, when the guy before him  accumulated 25 percent of the total debt in American history. The  hypocrisy is incredible.   Now, just contrast that with what Democrats did to rein in inflation  and lower costs for people.   Democrats capped insulin at $35 per month.   Democrats reduced the price of prescription drugs for seniors.   Democrats, for the first time in history, are making sure that Big  Pharma faces penalties for raising their prices faster than inflation.   Democrats are saving families money with special tax credits for  making good investments--all things that Republicans voted against.    Mr. Speaker, 100 percent of Republicans voted against reducing drug  prices; 100 percent of them voted against cheaper insulin for our  senior citizens; 100 percent of them voted against lower gas prices.   I guess we could give them some credit because only 95 percent of  them voted against lower food prices.   Hear me out here. Maybe Republicans don't want to solve inflation.  Maybe they know that addressing inflation takes on greedy CEOs, Big  Oil, and billionaire corporations. Maybe they know it means standing up  to Putin, who is driving up energy prices with his war in Ukraine.   Maybe Republicans are too scared to fight inflation, but Democrats  are ready to go to bat against corporate greed, because we stand with  everyday families who are being hurt by rising costs.   Today, Leader Jeffries is introducing the PRO Act, a bill empowering  workers to unionize and hold their employers accountable for improper  work practices. Because while Republicans continue standing with the  billionaire corporations responsible for price gouging, Democrats stand  with workers hurt by inflation. We support their right to organize for  better wages.   Instead of wasting time writing a bill that only requires a book  report on inflation, we spent the last 2 years taking action to  actually stop inflation in the long term by bringing jobs and  manufacturing back to America.   Democrats secured over $300 billion in investments in U.S.  manufacturing to move supply chains back to America.   We voted to lower food and fuel prices, made the most robust updates  in 70 years to the Buy American Act to boost domestic manufacturing,  and after the Ocean Shipping Reform Act to cut costs for American  families and bring down shipping prices, oversaw the largest 1-year  decrease in the Federal deficit in American history. That is the  Democratic record.   Now, we don't claim its perfect. Prices are still too high. Inflation  is hurting people. I know it. Joe Biden knows it. Democratic leadership  knows it. So there is a difference here. There is a difference here,  and it is a big one.   Democrats are fighting for the families being hurt by inflation and  taking on the greedy corporations who are driving prices up. And  Republicans, their solution is to blame Democrats, blame Biden, and  write a book report.   Now, I guess when you have no plans, when you have no real ideas, you  will do anything to say you did something. That is all this is: a  talking point, a press release, and a total waste of time. Apparently,  the bar is on the ground for this new House majority, and it is a real  shame.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will  offer an amendment to the rule to provide for consideration of a  resolution that affirms the House's unwavering commitment to protect  and strengthen Social Security and Medicare and states that it is the  position of the House to reject any cuts to the programs.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment into the Record along with any extraneous material  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, Social Security and Medicare are the  bedrock of our Nation's social safety net. Yet, as many of my  Republican colleagues demand reckless cuts in exchange for paying our  Nation's bills, these programs are under threat.   Despite recent rhetoric to the contrary, Republicans claim that they  won't cut Social Security and Medicare benefits.   Well, Mr. Speaker, today, Democrats are giving Republicans a chance  to back up that claim with action by providing them a chance to  reassure the American people not just with their words, but with their  votes.   Today, they can vote unequivocally that they won't cut these vital  programs. Anything short of that is an empty promise.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is interesting that none of my fellow  Republican colleagues want to come down and join in with my colleague  from Texas to talk about how great this bill is to fight inflation. I  would be embarrassed to be here defending this measure, as well.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article from The Washington  Post titled, ``What should the White House do to combat inflation?  Experts weighed in with 12 ideas.                 [From the Washington Post, Jan. 26, 2022]  What Should the White House Do To Combat Inflation? Experts Weighed in                               With 12 Ideas                     (By Jeff Stein and Rachel Siegel)         The United States is experiencing its most dramatic burst       of inflation in four decades, as rising prices hit nearly       every sector of the economy and create new political hurdles       for the Biden administration.        As the country frets over inflation and the administration       weighs how to react, The Washington Post asked independent       experts from across the ideological spectrum how they would       respond if they controlled the White House.        Their 12 ideas include using antitrust to break up large       corporations, relaxing the trade war with China, and       massively scaling up U.S. manufacturing production, among       other proposals. Some of the experts blamed President Biden       for increasing economic demand, while others insisted that       concerns about inflation have been overblown. The proposals       are not meant as exhaustive, and many of these economists       support each other's ideas.                        1: make america produce again       We can once again make the United States the world's workshop           for democracy                           (By Robert C. Hockett)         It should have been obvious even in February 2020 that the       coronavirus was going to present the American economy with       both demand-side and supply-side challenges. It should       therefore also have been obvious that measures to boost       demand with government programs--such as stimulus checks and       unemployment benefits--would fuel inflationary pressures if       not accompanied by measures to boost supply and the       availability of goods and products.        Almost two years after our pandemic began, policymakers are       now finally talking about supply chains, as they should have       done early in 2020. But thus far they are talking almost       solely about improving the domestic transport links in those       chains--not the production of what is being consumed.        Attention to truck routes, warehouses and loading docks is       helpful, but it isn't nearly enough in our present       environment--not in a world where we needlessly import so       much of what we used to produce.        This presents all of us with a grand opportunity now--to       reverse inflation in a manner that restores American       production and world leadership in the industries of today       and tomorrow. We can, in other words, make our war on       inflation a war on national decline.        For instance, America invented the semiconductor industry       and then globally dominated it for decades until the turn of       the millennium. Yet since we relinquished our lead over       microchips to insecure sources such as China and Taiwan, the       importance of this ubiquitous input to all modern products       has only grown. That is why so many supply shortage stories       we read about now--from autos to homes to appliances--boil       down to chip shortage stories.        Next, consider electric vehicles and their lithium-ion       batteries, as well as other related forms of high-capacity       power storage, such as the big battery packs used by power       generation stations nationwide. Here, too, production lines       are bottlenecked, slowing  [[Page H927]]       product availability, lengthening product waitlists and       raising product prices.        Similar stories to these can be told about solar power       cells; hydrogen fuel cells; steel, concrete and other housing       materials; essential medical equipment; affordable cutting-      edge pharmaceuticals; rare-earth metals; and a host of other       essential inputs to modern life. If we want to end inflation       and reclaim the mantle of ``workshop of the free world'' in       one stroke, there can be no better way forward than to invest       massively in restoring U.S. productive prowess.        It can be done. When Nazi Germany rolled over France in but       six weeks in 1940, President Franklin D. Roosevelt demanded       that our aircraft industry, which had produced just over       3,000 planes the previous year, produce at least 50,000       planes that year. Roosevelt then directly set about building       the factories, in consultation with public officials and       private-sector industries, to produce U.S. planes, ships,       tanks, trucks, munitions, synthetic rubber and other       materiel. The government then cheaply leased these facilities       to manufacturers with plausible production plans, selling       them once the war had been won.        Roosevelt also built entire neighborhoods for workers       wishing to move near the new factories, schools for their       children, clinics for their health and power lines for their       domestic needs, making the United States the world's       ``arsenal of democracy.''        This massive expansion provided the productive foundation       for America's global economic leadership from the end of the       war to the late 1970s. We lost that edge only when we began       massively ``outsourcing'' in the 1980s and 1990s.        We have all the tools Roosevelt had. The president and       White House Cabinet, in consultation with experts from       industry, should plan a national reindustrialization across       industries in every region of the country, and the Federal       Financing Bank within Treasury can fund projects devised by       all relevant federal agencies.        We can once again make the United States the world's       workshop for democracy. That will reverse not only inflation,       but also four decades of decline.        --Robert C. Hockett is a law professor at Cornell Law       School.                             2: stop the spending       This surge in spending is a key driver of other prices                              (By Brian Riedl)         A year ago, the Federal Reserve forecast that inflation       would increase by 1.8 percent in 2021. Instead, consumer       prices jumped 7 percent--the highest rate since 1982. Some of       this unanticipated inflation was driven by knotty issues such       as supply chain disruptions, rising energy prices, and shifts       in demand to sectors with less capacity to maintain low       prices.        Yet Washington poured gasoline on this fire by enacting the       $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan in March. This surge in       spending is a key driver of higher prices faced by consumers.       To combat it, lawmakers should begin paring back portions of       the remaining $500 billion in scheduled spending from the       rescue plan, put Biden's Build Back Better legislation on the       back burner and resist new spending sprees.        The critics of Biden's rescue plan were ignored, mocked--      and ultimately vindicated. A year ago, the Congressional       Budget Office estimated that the baseline economy would       operate $420 billion below capacity in 2021, and then       gradually close that output gap by 2025. Biden and       congressional Democrats--believing that the Great Recession       had been unnecessarily lengthened by insufficient stimulus--      overlearned their lesson and decided to shoot a $1.9 trillion       bazooka at a $420 billion output gap.        The problem is that once America's output capacity taps       out, any additional stimulus will simply bring inflation       rather than additional production--especially when financed       in part by Federal Reserve bond purchases. Economists on the       left and right warned lawmakers that ARP would accelerate       inflation, with top Clinton and Obama White House economist       Lawrence Summers leading the charge.        With the word ``trillion'' becoming commonplace, it is easy       to downplay the sheer size of the American Rescue Plan. It is       the most expensive spending law of the past 50 years,       including the Cares Act approved under President Donald       Trump.        In its first seven months, ARP spent $1.2 trillion--which       exceeds the entire cost of the 2017 tax cuts from their       enactment through the same late 2021 date. All this spending       is on top of the December 2020 stimulus bill that poured in       $900 billion.        The inflation damage created by Biden's stimulus would be       more justifiable if it was necessary to end the pandemic.       However, just 1 percent of its cost went toward vaccines and       5 percent had any direct relation to health care. Instead,       the law gave state and local governments $350 billion for       budget deficits that did not exist. Schools received $129       billion even as they sat on $50 billion in unused relief       funds from earlier emergency bills. The unemployment bonuses       were so large and self-defeating that 26 states took the rare       step of refusing federal assistance and canceling the bonuses       before they expired. Even the popular relief checks--which,       combined with earlier checks, amounted to $11,400 for a       typical family of four--contributed to the very inflation       that ultimately eroded their value.        Moving forward, combating inflation requires addressing       supply chains, reducing tariffs and gradually tightening       Federal Reserve policy. Yet it makes no sense to push one       foot on the gas and one foot on the brake. Lawmakers should       explore options to pare back the $500 billion in scheduled       ARP spending, such as rescinding extraneous assistance to K-      12 education, businesses and private pension bailouts. They       should also reject BBB legislation that would spend trillions       more upfront, yet delays many of its disinflationary taxes       until later years. BBB's subsidies and regulations would also       drive drastic price increases in child care, and thus should       be rejected.        --Brian Riedl is a senior fellow at the Manhattan       Institute.                        3: Control the covid pandemic       `Covid's fingerprints on inflation are unmistakable`                             (By Claudia Sahm)         Consumer prices rose 7 percent in 2021--the fastest pace in       40 years--and covid deaths doubled to more than 800,000.       These two facts are bound together. The solution to today's       high inflation, as with labor shortages and supply chain       disruptions, is clear: Contain the pandemic.        Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell agrees. Asked at his       reconfirmation hearing by Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-      Nev.) if he believes containing the pandemic is the best way       to fight inflation, Powell said: ``I do. And imagine a world       in which we no longer have to deal with the pandemic. . . . .       We would quickly see the supply-side problems alleviate. We'd       probably see significantly more labor supply. So these issues       are still related to the pandemic.''        The data supports Powell and experts like me who focus on       covid. As one example, economists at the Federal Reserve Bank       of San Francisco estimate that the price increases in the       spending categories most sensitive to covid disruptions       accounted for about half of the total inflation (excluding       food and energy) before the pandemic. Now they account for       three-quarters of it. Of course, what's pandemic-related and       what's not is impossible to know for certain. But covid's       fingerprints on inflation are unmistakable.        We do not have a monetary policy crisis. We have a covid       crisis. In fact, up to this point, fiscal and monetary policy       have been a relatively bright spot in the pandemic and       notably better than after the Great Recession. Yes, inflation       is high. Consumer spending, even with the higher prices, is       strong. The unemployment rate dropped below 4 percent in       December, less than two years after the recession began.       Overall, the economy is moving rapidly in the right       direction. But the pandemic is moving rapidly in the wrong       direction with the omicron variant.        To fight inflation, the Biden White House must end the       pandemic. The goals the administration set in January 2021,       including ``expanding masking, testing, treatment, data,       workforce and clear public health standards'' and       ``protect[ing] those most at risk,'' are the right ones.       Julia Raifman, a public health professor at Boston       University, argues: ``That's what we need to do now that will       help us navigate our way out of this pandemic. If we don't       have that, we will continue to have the virus manage us.''       High inflation and labor shortages will continue too.        The White House must use all its influence to push business       leaders, community organizers, members of Congress, governors       and mayors across the political spectrum to join in these       public health efforts. Instead, administration officials used       their bully pulpit to bust a strike by the Chicago teachers       union over a lack of coronavirus protections, saying that       they ``do not believe people should be sitting at home'' and       should go to unsafe workplaces. That won't solve our economic       problems, but it will kill people.        The Fed is not ``behind the curve'' in fighting inflation.       It's the White House that's behind on ``bending the curve''       of covid cases, and it's falling further behind every day.        --Claudia Sahm is the director of macroeconomic research at       the Jain Family Institute.                           4: Invest in child care       Child-care policies `can boost the capacity, productivity and           the potential of our economy'                            (By Lauren Melodia)          Although the unemployment rate is falling faster than       expected, the pandemic continues to fundamentally disrupt our       economy. Many people are choosing to remain out of the labor       market altogether until public health conditions and       disruptions subside, which in turn limits productive capacity       and can raise prices. One policy that could address many of       these issues across sectors at once has already passed the       House and is waiting for Senate action: public investment in       our child-care system.        Child care is the backbone of our economy and can enable       all parents--who historically have some of the highest labor       force participation rates across all genders, races and       education levels--to get and keep a job. But as of 2018, many       communities across the country are child-care deserts--a       result of our nation's complex history of underfunding,       undervaluing and under-compensating care work and women's       labor more broadly.        The covid pandemic has further decimated this       infrastructure. As of this time last year, 20,000 child-care       providers were estimated to have permanently shut down. And       yet ample evidence exists that access to even part-time day       care and preschool programming has a  [[Page H928]]       dramatic impact on parents' labor force participation.        Private markets and existing policies will not solve these       problems on their own, for many reasons.        First, America's historical and continued reliance on       unpaid care workers drives women's wages down throughout the       economy. This is one of the major dynamics of the gender pay       gap and makes the choice of paying for child care       unaffordable for many families. Because care work       traditionally done by women is unpaid, women are undervalued       in the labor market--where they make 83 cents on the dollar       to men. That disincentivizes them from entering the labor       market. What results is a cycle in which women are unable to       secure jobs that allow them to pay for the cost of child       care, which in turn keeps the pay for child-care providers       low.        Second, because of this dynamic, the child-care industry is       built around low wages and thin, unsustainable profits that       have contributed to the failure of the market to deliver a       greater supply of child-care centers to meet demand.        Lastly, the government's existing consumer subsidies       program, while making child care more affordable for many,       has not resulted in the growth of the supply of child care. A       2021 Government Accountability Office report found that 78       percent of families eligible for child-care subsidies do not       use them, often because there are no available spaces at       local child-care facilities or because they live in a child-      care desert.        By making supply-side child-care investments--building new       child-care centers; offering loans and grants to existing or       recently closed small-business child-care providers; and       offering universal pre-K--we could both enable parents to       reenter the workforce and create new jobs in child care.       Those new jobs would disproportionately go to Black and Brown       women, who have been hit hardest by the pandemic and are       still suffering from some of the lowest employment rates.       Black women, who historically have some of the highest labor       force participation rates in the country, currently       experience the largest gap (3.5 percent) in their employment       rate, comparing December 2021 with pre-pandemic levels.        Many of these policies were passed by the House in the       Build Back Better Act and are now on the table in the Senate.       And once they are passed and implemented, we can boost the       capacity, productivity and the potential of our economy and       reduce future economic disruptions--all of which can be       deflationary and stabilizing.        Insofar as today's inflation--or the fear of future       inflation--is linked to labor market tightness or dynamics,       investment in child care is critical for minimizing ongoing       disruptions and expanding people's ability to work across all       industries in our economy.        --Lauren Melodia is the deputy director of macroeconomic       analysis at the Roosevelt Institute.                           5: Tax wealthy investors       The richest 10 percent consume as much as the bottom 40           percent combined                            (By William Spriggs)         The economy proved far less resilient to the shock of the       global coronavirus crisis than most people had expected. We       need to focus on measures that increase the supply of goods       and target price inflation--particularly in markets where       inequality is helping drive prices--rather than taking       measures that would destroy jobs and weaken growth. One way       to do so would be to raise capital gains taxes on investors       and levy new taxes on income from stock dividends.        Consumption in America is currently extraordinarily ``top-      heavy,'' meaning the wealthy consume far more than most       people. In fact, the richest 10 percent consume as much as       the bottom 40 percent combined, according to the Bureau of       Labor Statistics. Instead of taking measures that would hurt       growth and cost jobs, policymakers could temper demand amid       massive supply chain disruptions by slowing down the       consumption of those at the very top with modest taxes on the       rich.        A tax on short-term capital gains and dividends would       disproportionately target wealthy Americans who are currently       responsible for very high demand. This would alleviate the       pressures on the supply chain without leading to a broader       economic slowdown. Encouraging longer-term savings--and       having companies retain earnings--will keep balance sheets       strong and result in investments that can help the economy       become more resilient.        It's worth stressing the potential danger of alternative       approaches. Using the blunt instrument of raising interest       rates, the tool of the Federal Reserve, would be an attempt       at price controls. But that mechanism for lowering prices       would broadly shrink demand across the income distribution.       Lower demand would lower prices, at the cost of even lower       production. In the case of automobiles, for instance, that       would be disastrous, because the unprecedented spike in used-      car prices is caused by the collapse in the current auto       supply; domestic production in November was at 58 percent of       its February 2020 level. We do not want to solve inflation by       starving the economy and causing production to plummet.        Policymakers should remember that inflationary trends are       caused in part by numerous factors outside higher demand, and       we need to be careful if we are attempting to tame it. We       have seen a rapid recovery in demand for consumer goods, but       weak demand for services. This switch in consumption has       helped protect employment by facilitating the movement of       workers forced out of the service sector, but it comes with       higher prices for some goods. In addition to exacting a       devastating human toll, the lack of protections for workers       has led to millions getting sick, creating disruptions that       lead to supply shocks that drive up prices. And it's not       clear exactly how broad-based inflation is. For instance,       rental costs have been relatively stable--well within the       Federal Reserve's target level for inflation--in another sign       that price pressures have more to do with supply shocks and       demand shifts than an overheating economy.     Mr. Speaker, maybe my friends on the other side of the  aisle should take a look at this article. While I don't agree with all  the ideas in here, at least this article has actual ideas to bring down  inflation, instead of the Republican plan to write a book report on  inflation to Congress.   Mr. Speaker, all I can say is that the American people deserve  better. They deserve more than a book report. They deserve action that  will make a positive difference in their lives.   I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this rule and vote ``no''  on the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article from The Hill titled,  ``Five actions Biden has taken in response to high gas prices.''                       [From The Hill, Apr. 22, 2022]        Five Actions Biden has Taken in Response to High Gas Prices                              (By Zack Budryk)         Gas prices are both a top concern for American consumers       and a consistent drag on President Biden's approval rating,       prompting the administration to take several measures to       counter pain at the pump.        An ABC News/Ipsos poll in March indicated widespread       approval for the president's decision to ban oil imports from       Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, which Biden has warned       could exacerbate energy costs. However, the same poll       indicated 70 percent of respondents disapprove of Biden's       handling of gas prices.        A number of factors impact gas prices, and experts note       many of them are outside the White House's control. Still,       the administration has taken several steps in hopes of       providing some temporary or near-term relief.        Here are five actions the Biden administration has taken so       far on gas prices:                 1. Releasing oil from the strategist reserve         Biden initially announced a release of 50 million barrels       of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in November in       response to rising gas prices.        However, after a further spike around the time of Russia's       invasion of Ukraine earlier this year, Biden announced       another one-time release of 30 million barrels followed by an       average daily release of 1 million barrels over the next six       months--or about 180 million barrels overall.        Biden told reporters in late March that the price of gas       ``could come down fairly significantly'' as a result of the       move.        In the days after, gas prices fell about eight cents,       according to AAA, although they have since crept up. However,       during the same period, some regions of China imposed       lockdowns in response to new COVID-19 outbreaks, which       reduced overall demand.        ``This is a wartime bridge to increase oil supply until       production ramps up later this year. And it is by far the       largest release from our national reserve in our history,''       Biden said as he announced the release. ``It will provide a       historic amount of supply for a historic amount of time--a       six-month bridge to the fall.''           2. Removing restrictions on sale of higher-ethanol fuel         In an executive order last week, Biden removed restrictions       on the sale of E15, or fuel that is 15 percent ethanol,       between June and September of this year.        Ethanol-heavy fuel is sold at a limited number of stations       concentrated in corn-producing states, and sales are normally       restricted during the summer months due to concerns that       another mix, E10, could contribute to increased air       pollution. Ethanol and renewable fuel industries, however,       maintain that tailpipe emissions, rather than fuel       volatility, is a bigger contributor to smog, and that E15 is       less of a contributor than E10.        Biden administration officials projected at the time that       the availability of E15 could save a family about 10 cents       per gallon on average.        ``This will also help us bridge towards real energy       independence and implementing the emergency fuel waiver the       [Environmental Protection Agency] EPA will work with states       across the country to ensure there are no significant air       quality impacts in the summer driving season,'' an official       said on a call with reporters. ``EPA is also considering       additional action to facilitate the use of E15 year-round,       including continued discussions with states who have       expressed interest in allowing year-round use of E15.''            3. Asking oil-producing nations to increase production         The U.S. has appealed to members of OPEC to step up       production and exports to cover demand, including Saudi       Arabia in particular.  [[Page H929]]         However, this plan has encountered difficulties due to the       rocky Washington-Riyadh relationship.        The Biden administration has faced tensions with the Saudis       due to America's vocal criticism of the Gulf kingdom's human       rights record, particularly the Yemen civil war and the 2018       killing of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi.        Meanwhile, human rights advocates have called it       inconsistent to seek closer ties with Saudi Arabia while       seeking to isolate Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.        ``I hate that the Biden administration has to figure out       how to leverage our relationship with Saudi Arabia to get       them to do that so that my constituents aren't being squeezed       at the pump,'' Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.) told reporters in       March.        Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who numerous       intelligence agencies have concluded ordered Khashoggi's       killing, reportedly refused a call from Biden soon after the       Russian invasion. White House press secretary Jen Psaki has       denied the report.                       4. Pressuring U.S. oil companies         Republicans have vocally blamed the Biden administration's       energy policies, in particular an executive order freezing       new oil and gas leasing on public lands, for gas prices and       insufficient supply.        That pause has been in limbo since a court order halting it       last summer, and the Biden administration last Friday       officially announced a forthcoming lease sale.        In the meantime, however, the administration has sought to       shift the blame to oil companies and accused them of gouging       customers, pointing to the industry's numerous currently       unused leases, which include some 9,000 approved drilling       permits.        Biden has called for Congress to enact a ``use it or lose       it'' policy that would impose fees on companies that do not       make use of their leased land.        ``I have no problem with corporations turning a good       profit. But companies have an obligation that goes beyond       just their shareholders to their customers, their communities       and their country,'' Biden told reporters in late March. ``No       American company should take advantage of a pandemic or       [Russian President] Vladimir Putin's actions to enrich       themselves at the expense of American families.''               5. Promoting the transition to renewable energy         Amid concrete steps to bring down consumer prices, the       Biden administration has emphasized the necessity for       increased support and infrastructure for renewable fuels,       saying the current market illustrates the need for less       volatile resources.        In a fact sheet distributed to reporters, the       administration presented its steps to increase access to       clean energy as a key tenet of its response to gas prices.        Specifically, officials pointed to sales of offshore wind       leases, with a goal of 30 gigawatts of offshore wind       installed by the end of the decade. Officials further cited       the Interior Department's road map this week that sets a       target of doubling clean energy permits, with a goal of 25       gigawatts installed by 2025.    Mr. Speaker, President Biden has taken steps to lower  prices at the pump for the American people. Since prices began to rise,  President Biden released 50 million barrels of oil from the Strategic  Petroleum Reserve, removed restrictions on the sale of higher ethanol  fuel, and called out oil companies for taking advantage of their  customers, communities, and their country. He also continues to promote  a transition to renewable energy.   So President Biden has acted to try to lower prices. My Republican  colleagues cannot do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I will say finally that we have some serious challenges  in this country. Inflation is one of them. The idea that after all the  buildup, after all the talk of, We have a comprehensive plan to fight  inflation. This is it? This is it?   This is an embarrassment, Mr. Speaker. There are things that we can  do together to lower costs for the American people. A book report  doesn't lower the cost for anybody.                                time  1230    By the way, under this bill, the book report that is required for  executive orders, it is not even required to be published. They could  write a book report, and no one gets to see it.   I mean, this is not what the American people had hoped for. They had  hoped we would come together and kind of rally around ideas that would  actually make a difference in their lives.   So, yeah. You can pass this and say, we just passed this big plan to  fight inflation and then hope that nobody realizes that you did  nothing.   I will say, Mr. Speaker, this is a missed opportunity. This was a  time, quite frankly, where committees of jurisdiction should have come  together, done hearings, heard ideas, Republican ideas and Democratic  ideas, and taken the best of them and brought them to the floor; ideas  that would have made a difference in people's lives. This does nothing.  This does nothing.   So I guess you can tweet out that you voted for a book report on  inflation and hope that your constituents will think that somehow you  accomplished something big, but I would say that my constituents  certainly would not be satisfied with this.   Mr. Speaker, all this talk about bringing down the deficit--and do I  need to remind everybody that the first Republican bill passed this  year when we came into the majority, their first bill added $114  billion to the national debt. I mean, come on.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article from The Hill titled,  ``CBO: GOP's IRS bill will add $114 billion to deficit.''                       [From The Hill, Jan. 9, 2023]               CBO: GOP's IRS Bill Will Add $114B to Deficit                      (By Mike Lillis and Aris Folley)         The Republican proposal to eliminate billions of dollars in       IRS funding will pile more than $100 billion onto federal       deficits, according to a new estimate from Congress's       official budget scorekeeper.        The bill, which is slated to hit the House floor Monday       night as the first legislative act of the new GOP majority,       would claw back most of the almost $80 billion in new IRS       funding provided under the Democrats' massive climate, health       and tax package, which was signed by President Biden last       year.        Almost $46 billion of that spending would go toward agency       enforcement efforts designed to prevent certain taxpayers--      largely corporations and wealthy individuals--from paying       less than they owe.        The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated Monday that       the legislation would cut federal spending by $71 billion,       but would reduce tax revenue to the tune of almost $186       billion. The net effect would be a $114 billion increase in       deficits over the next decade.        The numbers were not overlooked by Democrats, who wasted no       time hammering Republicans for vowing to rein in deficit       spending, then defying that promise in their first act of       business.        ``It's a giant tax cut for rich tax cheats,'' White House       chief of staff Ron Klain tweeted on Monday. ``Bill #1 from       the new House GOP. Adds to the deficit.''        Republicans had made the IRS funding cut a top promise on       the midterm campaign trail, warning that the money would lead       to the hiring of 87,000 new tax collectors to target middle-      income Americans. Some Republicans said those agents would be       armed.        Those claims were highly misleading, however, as much of       the funding will go to hire thousands of customer service       agents and other employees with no auditing responsibilities.       And the 87,000 figure is a reference to the total number of       employees--not just auditors--the IRS hopes to hire over the       next decade, when 52,000 workers are expected to retire.        Additionally, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said       that, while the new funding is crucial to streamline       processing and eliminate the backlog of returns, the agency       will not increase audit rates for those taxpayers making less       than $400,000.        Still, few government agencies are less popular than the       IRS, and the Republican message appeared to resonate with the       GOP base.        ``On our very first bill, we're going to repeal 87,000 IRS       agents,'' Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who was newly       elected as Speaker, said last year as he unveiled the       Republicans' agenda. ``Our job is to work for you, not go       after you.''        Zach Moller, who previously worked as a Senate Democratic       budget aide, says the GOP's bill would violate previous House       rules targeting legislation that would add to the deficit,       known as PAYGO, that were in effect when Democrats held       control.        Under the prior rules, Moller explained, it wouldn't be in       order for lawmakers to ``have a bill on the floor that       increases the deficit over the first five or seven or first       10 years.'' The PAYGO rules were often waived, but aimed at       fiscal responsibility, Moller said.        The Republican majority is expected on Monday to pass a new       set of rules governing the new Congress, to include a so-      called ``CUTGO'' rule that exempts tax cuts from the deficit       spending prohibitions.    So anyway, look, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on  the previous question, and again, I want to repeat that.   The reason why you want to vote ``no'' is because the previous  question basically would allow us to bring up an amendment that  basically says it is not the intention of this House to do anything to  cut Social Security or Medicare.   My friends, they are all upset, notwithstanding their rhetoric, that  they want to go after Social Security and Medicare.   Yeah, they were all upset that they were being called out on their  words. Well, here is an opportunity to put  [[Page H930]]  that to rest; very, very simple. We are not going to cut Social  Security. We are not going to cut Medicare.   So if you vote ``no'' on the previous question, we can do that. I  urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this rule, ``no'' on the  underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
