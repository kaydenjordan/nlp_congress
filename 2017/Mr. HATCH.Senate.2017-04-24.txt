 Mr. President, last week, I had the opportunity to return  home to visit the recently declared Bears Ears National Monument. This  Federal designation encompasses roughly 1.35 million acres in Utah, and  it is located in one of our country's most remote communities--Juan  County.   For decades, this quiet county remained largely untouched by the  tensions of modern life and the taint of  [[Page S2476]]  Washington politics, but no more. San Juan County is now the epicenter  of a brutal battle over public lands, the outcome of which will have  long-lasting consequences not only for Utah but for the entire Nation.   In geographical terms, San Juan County is massive. It is the largest  county in the State of Utah and the second largest county in the United  States. To put the size of San Juan County in perspective, consider  that the county itself is larger than several States, including  Connecticut, Delaware, and Rhode Island.   San Juan County alone accounts for nearly 10 percent of all the land  in Utah. Yet Utahns have had very little to say about what actually  goes on there. That is because the Federal Government administers the  vast majority of San Juan County. Incredibly, just 8 percent of the  county's land is under private ownership while an area of more than 2  million acres is controlled by the Bureau of Land Management.   This means that for years, my constituents who depend on the land's  resources, have been at the mercy of out-of-touch bureaucrats who have  little knowledge or personal connection to the land. President Obama  only made matters worse when he spurned the men and women of San Juan  County by declaring the Bears Ears National Monument last December. In  doing so, he defied the will of the State legislature, the Governor,  and the entire Utah congressional delegation. President Obama's  midnight monument designation imposed even greater land use  restrictions on a region that is already predominantly controlled by  the Federal Government.   This last-minute monument designation was a case study in  Presidential hubris. In making this unilateral decision, our former  President either failed to heed the concerns of San Juan County  residents or ignored them completely. As evidence of his disdain,  President Obama issued this declaration with no open debate, no public  hearing, and no vote in Congress. Utahns are now suffering the  consequences of his recklessness.   When I visited the Bears Ears region last week, I met with small  business owners and local officials who admitted the fact that the  Obama administration never even gave them the courtesy of a simple  phone call. President Obama knew his last-minute decision would impact  the livelihoods of thousands in my State, but he was clearly more  concerned with appeasing far-left interest groups than helping the men  and women who depend on this land for their very survival.   I wish to be clear. In opposing the Bears Ears Monument designation,  I am in no way opposing the protection of lands that need to be  protected. Indeed, there are many cultural sites in San Juan County  that deserve special care, and I am committed to working with the  President and with Congress and with the people in that county to  preserve these sacred sites.   I believe it is both unlawful and undemocratic for any President to  seize millions upon millions of acres of land through the Antiquities  Act--a law that was meant to give the President a narrow authority to  designate special landmarks, such as a unique natural arch or the site  of old cliff dwellings.   We desperately need a more sensible approach to protecting public  lands--an approach that adheres more closely to the original intent of  the Antiquities Act. Under this bill, Presidents were to exercise their  authority to designate only the smallest area necessary to protect  objects of antiquity. Instead, past Presidents have abused their power  under the Antiquities Act to seize entire swaths of land.   In the case of Bears Ears, President Obama cited his authority under  the Antiquities Act to lock away an entire quarter of San Juan County-- an action that undermines local autonomy and clearly violates the  spirit of the law. In my view, land use decisions should not be decreed  by executive fiat. They should be made only through a collaborative  process that involves those who actually live there, live on the land,  and know how to manage it.   For example, had President Obama worked with--rather than around-- Congress to protect public lands, Utah's schoolchildren would be better  off today. That is because there are more than 100,000 acres of school  trust land that lie within the 1.3 million-acre Bears Ears National  Monument. The land is a significant source of revenue for schools  across our State, providing children with the instruction and resources  they need to succeed well into adulthood. But with President Obama's  unilateral monument designation, this land was effectively rendered  useless, eroding our State's ability to raise much needed funding for  Utah's schools. Had a more responsible legislative approach been taken  to protect Bears Ears, we could have preserved our school trust lands  and protected the revenue they generate to benefit Utah's  schoolchildren.   I wish to emphasize again that I am fully committed to protecting the  vast stretches of red rock, desert, and rolling prairie that dot our  western landscape, but the Antiquities Act is not the means to that  end. Monumental land use decisions affecting thousands of westerners  should be made by the men and women on the ground and their duly  elected representatives, not just the President and his advisers.  Congress--not the President alone--should have a say in decisions that  restrict access to millions of acres of federally owned land.   In making such decisions, the voice of the people is paramount. That  is why last week I visited the people of San Juan County. There, I  spoke with Native Americans who rely upon this land and its resources  for their very livelihood. I met with members of the San Juan School  District who depend on the school trust lands to keep their classrooms  lit and their schools up and running, and I met with members of the San  Juan County Commission who are dealing firsthand with the negative  consequences of the Bears Ears designation.   I traveled to San Juan County to listen to the people who feel  abandoned by their very own government. My trip only reaffirmed my  concern for the Bears Ears National Monument, which I have long held is  not in the best interest of San Juan County.   The men and women of San Juan County are a strong and hardy people.  They share a deep connection and history with the land. But San Juan  County isn't without its struggles. For decades, it has been listed  among the most persistently poor counties in the Nation. With the vast  majority of the land owned and operated by the Federal Government, the  fate of San Juan County rests almost entirely with beltway bureaucrats  making politically motivated decisions more than 2,000 miles away. The  families of Southern Utah should not be at the mercy of a Federal  bureaucracy so completely out of touch with the western way of life.   Enough is enough. Under the Constitution, Congress has the sole  authority to manage public lands. The only reason the executive branch  has any say in the management of Federal lands is because Congress  granted the President limited authority to participate in this process.  We entrusted the executive branch to exercise reasonable authority  through bills such as the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. At  the heart of these policies was the principle of multiple use and  sustainable yield--a mandate that Congress gave the executive branch  when granting it this authority.   The mandate of multiple use was meant to preserve the ability of  areas like San Juan County to live and grow, even when inundated with  federally owned public lands. But President Obama betrayed this mandate  through his Bears Ears designation when he declared much more than the  smallest acreage possible as required by the Antiquities Act.   When I spoke with the leadership of the San Juan School District,  they told me how prosperous the county had been when they were able to  strike a balance with multiple land use. But the county's schools have  been strapped for cash ever since the Bears Ears National Monument  designation rendered these lands useless.   After speaking with school officials, we then met with local county  commissioners and Navajo from San Juan County and drove together to the  heart of Bears Ears, Bears Ears Meadow--behind me, the actual Bears  Ears split of the mountains. We discussed how the monument could be  altered so that the lands that deserve protection can remain protected  but in a way that is consistent with the language of the Antiquities  Act.   I believe there will be changes made to Bears Ears. These beautiful  lands  [[Page S2477]]  deserve protection, but so too do the people of San Juan County. They  should not be trampled on by their own government. As long as I am a  U.S. Senator, I will not stop fighting to make sure that Utahns have a  voice in the management of public lands. For years, I have fought to  check the abuse of executive power under the Antiquities Act. That is  why I have been working closely with the Trump administration from day  one to right the wrongs of previous administrations.   In the opening weeks of his Presidency, I met personally with  President Trump in the Oval Office to discuss the national monument  issue at length. He listened intently as I relayed the fears and  frustrations of thousands in our State who have been personally hurt by  the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase monument designations. I explained  the urgency of addressing the harm caused by these devastating  measures, and I asked for his help in doing so. I was encouraged that,  unlike his predecessor, President Trump actually took the time to  listen and understand the heavy toll of such overreaching activities.  Our President even assured me that he stands ready to work with us to  undo the damage wrought by previous Presidents under the Antiquities  Act, and I believe he will do so.   As details emerge, I understand the President even stands ready to  issue an Executive order reining in the abuse of authority under the  Antiquities Act. Now, this action would direct the Department of the  Interior ``to review prior monument designations and suggest  legislative changes or modifications to [these] proclamations.''   In President Trump, we have a leader who is committed to defending  the western way of life. I am deeply grateful for his willingness to  work with us to undo the harm caused by the overreach of his  predecessors.   In protecting our public lands, I look forward to working with the  Trump administration to establish a new precedent of collaboration and  trust between States and the Federal Government.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize TechNet for its  indispensable role in promoting the innovation economy and to  congratulate the organization on its 20th anniversary.   TechNet is a national, bipartisan network of technology CEOs and  senior executives that represents more than 2 million employees in the  fields of information technology, e-commerce, advanced energy,  biotechnology, venture capital, and finance. Over the last two decades,  TechNet has advanced public policies and private sector initiatives  that have helped to strengthen our Nation's position as the global  technology leader and to create jobs and opportunities for millions of  Americans. TechNet has been at the forefront of championing research  and development, broadband connectivity, entrepreneurship, cyber  security, tax reform, education reform, high-skilled immigration, and  many other issues.   TechNet was founded in 1997 by two giants in the technology industry:  John Doerr and John Chambers.   John Doerr's technology career began in 1974 at Intel, where he held  roles in engineering, marketing, management, and sales. He later  founded Silicon Compilers, a VLSI CAD software company, and cofounded  @Home, a nationwide broadband cable Internet service. In 1980, John  joined Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, KPCB, and has since supported  some of the world's most successful entrepreneurs, including Google's  Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt; Amazon's Jeff Bezos; and  Inuit's Scott Cook and Bill Campbell. John avidly supports  entrepreneurs seeking to create the ``next big thing'' in mobile and  social networks, education, and economic development. Ventures  sponsored by John have created more than 300,000 new jobs. Outside of  KPCB, John also supports entrepreneurs who focus on the environment,  public education, and alleviating global poverty. John serves on the  boards of Amyris, Google, and Zynga, as well as several private  technology ventures.   John Chambers spent 8 years with Wang Laboratories and 6 years with  IBM before joining Cisco in 1991 as senior vice president, worldwide  sales and operations. Over the course of 20 years at Cisco, he helped  grow the company from $70 million, when he joined, to $1.2 billion when  he assumed the role of CEO, to $47 billion when he stepped down as CEO  in 2015. He is now executive chairman of the board for Cisco, where he  counsels Cisco's leadership on company strategy, digital  transformation, and strategic partnerships. John has received numerous  awards for his leadership, including being named one of the Best- Performing CEOs in the World in 2015 by Harvard Business Review and  receiving the Edison Achievement Award for Innovation. John has also  been named one of Barron's' World's Best CEOs, one of Time Magazine's  100 Most Influential People, and the Best Boss in America by 20/20. In  addition, John has been widely recognized for his philanthropic  leadership and his active role in corporate social responsibility  initiatives. He served on President Bill Clinton's Trade Policy  Committee and on President George W. Bush's National Infrastructure  Advisory Council, Transition Team, and Education Committee.   As chairman of the Senate Republican High-Tech Task Force, I commend  John Doerr and John Chambers for their continuing efforts to keep  America's technology industry at the forefront of the global economy. I  honor them for their significant contributions to the tech industry.   In February of this year, I unveiled my innovation agenda for the  115th Congress and discussed several priorities to strengthen and  secure America's place as the global leader in innovation. TechNet  shares many of these priorities, including spurring high-tech  investment and enhancing America's competitive workforce.   Our Nation is in need of workers with training in science,  technology, engineering, and math--or STEM disciplines. We need to  encourage our rising generation to focus on hard science and  quantitative skills and to provide opportunities for Americans already  in the workforce to develop expertise in these fields. Enhancing our  competitive workforce also means improving the process by which high- skilled individuals in other countries come to the United States to  fill crucial positions for which there is a shortage of American labor.  As we endeavor to reform our high-skilled immigration system, we need  to ensure that this system is not manipulated to undercut domestic  wages or displace American workers. We need to reward good actors who  use the system as it was intended and close off the ability of bad  actors to profit by sending American jobs overseas.   TechNet provides our Nation an invaluable service as it continues to  champion policies that promote the innovation economy. As a leader on  tech and innovation issues here in the Senate, I look forward to  working with TechNet and the rest of the tech community to ensure that  the United States remains the global technology leader. I congratulate  TechNet on its first 20 years and wish the organization the best of  luck in its next 20 years.                            ____________________
