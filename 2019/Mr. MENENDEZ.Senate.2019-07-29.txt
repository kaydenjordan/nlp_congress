 Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to join me  in voting to override the President's veto of three resolutions of  disapproval on arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.   As we all know, several weeks ago, the Secretary of State attempted  to bypass this body and the entire Congress on 22 separate arms sales  to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates--all on the pretext of an  urgent physical threat from Iran that was, at best, ill-defined and, at  worst, completely false.   Let me be clear. Iran has and will continue to pose a threat to U.S.  interests and allies in the region, and I have and will continue to  approve arms sales to partners and allies that address legitimate  security threats and advance American interests.   From the start, this administration has failed to demonstrate what  kind of national security threat or ``emergency'' from Iran warranted  fast-tracking the sale of these weapons to Saudi Arabia and the UAE.   Indeed, Secretary Pompeo's own May 24 justification for the sales  lacked any persuasive information explaining how these sales would  address an Iranian threat so serious that it justified bypassing  Congress on an ``emergency'' basis.   That is why I introduced resolutions to disapprove these sales, and  that is why 6 weeks ago, this body came together in a bipartisan way to  reassert the role of Congress in reviewing arms sales and passed 22  separate resolutions of disapproval.   Today I ask that we come together again. In fact, not even President  Trump's own veto messages mention the word ``emergency.'' It is clear  this administration has had other motives from the start. We continue  to hear officials invent new reasons for pushing through these sales.  We heard these sales are necessary for ``sustaining the global supply  chain,'' for preventing ``loss of sale to peer competitors,'' for  maintaining U.S. ``credibility as an arms supplier,'' and so on.   So, look, many of us expected the President to use his veto powers.  That is his right, but the constitutional, strategic, and moral  imperatives that led the Senate to reject the sale of these arms 6  weeks ago still stand today.   Let me review three main reasons I hope we can unite today to  override the President's veto.   First is how these weapons are being used. By now, we are well  acquainted with what has been, at best, the incompetent, and, at worst,  criminal actions of Saudi Arabia's airstrikes in Yemen. All evidence  suggests that the Saudis have intentionally targeted hospitals,  bridges, power stations, apartment buildings, weddings, schools, and,  yes, even a schoolbus filled with children, leaving thousands of Yemeni  civilians killed or maimed.   Over the years, Congress has received many assurances about how U.S.  arms sales, advice, and assistance would supposedly help the Saudi Air  Force and command authority better identify military targets and  thereby reduce the risk to civilians. Those assurances no longer stand.  We cannot brand the sale of precision-guided munitions as humanitarian  weapons if the Saudis are intentionally targeting civilians in the  first place.   That is why, last year, I placed an informal hold on the sale of  60,000 precision-guided munitions, or PGMs, to Saudi Arabia, requesting  the administration explain how they would enhance efforts to reduce  civilian casualties. They failed to do so in a fulsome and convincing  way, and, believe me, I would like to be convinced.   After the slaughter of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in  October of last year, the Trump administration apparently flatout gave  up trying to convince anyone that the Saudis have any regard whatsoever  for human rights at home, in Yemen, or at their diplomatic consulates  abroad.   Last week, recognizing the abject failures of the Yemeni campaign,  the United Arab Emirates announced it was ceasing its support and  largely withdrawing from Yemen. I commend that as the right decision.   I do not doubt that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are  concerned about Iranian threats, but the indisputable reality is that  these precision-guided weapon kits were always headed for this  disastrous air war in Yemen. So, again, let's not delude ourselves.  These sales will in no way support Saudi Arabia or the United Arab  Emirates or the United States from an imminent Iranian threat. Full  stop.   Second, if we fail to override the President's veto, we will allow  this administration to transfer American jobs and sensitive military  technology to  [[Page S5131]]  the Saudis. That is right. With this sale, the Trump administration has  authorized Raytheon to allow the Saudis to begin manufacturing part of  the electronic guidance system for these precision-guided munitions. In  other words, the administration is not only selling the Saudis these  weapons but also portions of the blueprints for building these weapons.   This work has always and always should be done by American workers  right here in the United States. America's defense industry produces  the most sophisticated systems in the world. Yet the Trump  administration is opening the door for the Saudis to manufacture their  own similar weapons in the future or transfer our American-made  technical know-how to other countries.   Disturbingly, we also know that if the Trump administration gets its  way, this transfer will not be a one-time thing. State Department  officials have actually admitted to the Foreign Relations Committee  staff that this will be the first of many sales authorizing the Saudis  to manufacture even larger, more sensitive portions of these highly  advanced weapons.   My colleagues, that is simply madness. Not only is this sale a Saudi  jobs program, but it is also a giveaway of sensitive U.S. military  technology. The President's own veto message claims that not giving  away American jobs and sensitive military technology to Saudi Arabia  would ``abandon'' them. I am guessing by ``them,'' he means the royal  family the President is intent on praising and courting.   I ask my colleagues who oppose stopping this sale or are thinking of  allowing the President's veto to stand: Do you want to be on record  supporting a Saudi jobs program? Do you want to be on the record as  aiding and abetting the transfer of sensitive U.S. military technology  to Saudi Arabia, a source of extremism and bloodshed in the world?   S.J. Res. 37 disapproves a sale of precision-guided munitions to the  UAE at a time when the UAE is pulling its military forces out of Yemen.  Yet the President's veto message says that stopping this sale would  somehow prolong the suffering in Yemen, which goes against any logic  with which I am familiar.   S.J. Res. 38 disapproves a sale of fuzes for Saudi bombs. Yet the  President argues that stopping this sale will again prolong the  suffering of the innocent in Yemen, presumably by denying the Saudis  the ability to target them indiscriminately. It doesn't make sense.   Finally, I think all of my colleagues can agree that the United  States and Saudi Arabia need a course correction. The brutal murder of  Jamal Khashoggi, an American resident and journalist in a Saudi  consulate, may have been the final, violent straw that broke the  camel's back, but we must reexamine this relationship. Beyond the  Khashoggi killing and the atrocities in Yemen, the Saudi-led blockade  of Qatar and the ongoing rift within the GCC are not in the interests  of the United States. The Saudis kidnapping of the Lebanese Prime  Minister is not in the interest of the United States.   Finally, Saudi Arabia's detention and torture of human rights  activists calling for the same exact rights the Crown Prince himself  pretends to support--its suppression of dissent and speech--this  behavior does not reflect American values or our long-term interests.   My colleagues, America is better than this. This Senate and this  Congress must continue to stand up for reason, for decency, and for the  actual foreign policy and national security interests of the United  States--not the personal interests of the Trump family and their  misguided willingness to put profit over principle and profit over  people.   This administration's willingness to turn a blind eye to the  wholesale slaughter of civilians and the murder of journalists and move  forward with the sale of these weapons will have a lasting implication  for America's moral leadership on the world stage.   That is why, 6 weeks ago, in a bipartisan fashion, the Senate came  together to approve an unprecedented 22 separate bipartisan resolutions  of disapproval. That is why 5 weeks ago, the Committee on Foreign  Relations approved my bipartisan bill--the Saudi Arabia False  Emergencies, or SAFE Act--to prevent similar abuses of emergency  authority in the future.   That is why, 3 weeks ago, the House passed several amendments to  their National Defense Authorization Act to stop these same arms sales,  and, 2 weeks ago, the House passed three of the Senate joint  resolutions of disapproval and sent them to the President. It is the  first time, since 1988, that any such resolution has passed the  Congress, and it is the first time multiple resolutions of disapproval  had done so.   Finally, just last week, the Foreign Relations Committee approved on  a bipartisan vote the Saudi Arabia Accountability and Yemen Act,  legislation I introduced with Senators Young, Murphy, Graham, Reed,  Collins, and Shaheen that would finally impose real sanctions,  including on arms sales, on Saudi Arabia for its atrocities-- legislation I hope Senator McConnell will swiftly bring to the floor.   I hope this administration appreciates the gravity of these actions  and those to come.   Today we have an opportunity to again demonstrate to the President,  the Secretary of State, and to the butchers of Saudi Arabia that the  U.S. Senate will stand up for our values, will stand up for our long- term national security interests, and will put country over short-term  business interests.   I urge my colleagues to take this stand today, override these vetoes,  and stop the Saudi arms sales.   There are few days in this body where we can say that our votes will  save lives. Today is such a day.    Mr. President, I rise today to address an important  issue, that the Secretary of State did not comply with the law when he  made an emergency declaration on May 24 to bypass the Congress and  issue export permission for 22 separate arms sales to Saudi Arabia and  the United Arab Emirates. Because of this, a case can be made that some  or all of the export licenses and the letters of offer are not valid  because they did not comply with the Arms Export Control Act.   We have made clear in this body that there is strong bipartisan  opposition to the President and Secretary of State's reckless disregard  for the law, for common sense, for human rights, for basic human  decency, and even for our national security, when it comes to matters  involving Saudi Arabia. We voted to disapprove each and every one of  these 22 ``emergency'' sales, and I have no doubt, we will continue to  attempt to correct the President's self-serving myopia on Saudi Arabia  and its murderous leadership.   But the Secretary of State's failure to comply with statutory  obligations is a serious matter that we cannot allow to get lost in the  bipartisan outcry over the Secretary's incredible contentions that  these sales respond to an Iranian emergency. At the risk of losing some  in the minutia, let me briefly lay out how the Secretary's  ``emergency'' declaration fails to comply with the basic requirements  of the emergency provisions in Arms Export Control Act and degrades  congressional prerogatives.   The Secretary's failure to comply with the statute materially and  adversely impacts the Senate's institutional interests. It undermines  the clear and intentional statutory balance between Congress and the  executive branch designed to govern individual arms sales, and it  impedes the Senate's ability to understand, conduct oversight, and  respond to each sale. As laid out below, in this instance, the blanket  approach taken with regard to these 22 sales demonstrates precisely why  a generalized determination and certification is insufficient to  protect the Senate's role in arms sales.   Mr. President, allow me to explain further. The Secretary indicated  that he determined that, pursuant to sections 36(b)(1), (c)(2), and  (d)(2), an emergency exists that requires the immediate sale of defense  articles and services to Saudi Arabia and UAE and thereby purported to  waive the congressional review requirements for the 22 certifications.  In support of this action, the Secretary submitted only one  determination and one memorandum of justification. The emergency  authorities cited above and upon which the Secretary relies, however,  do not allow  [[Page S5132]]  for a blanket determination and justification covering multiple  certifications. Rather, these provisions require submission of a  separate determination and justification for each individual emergency  certification.   This requirement is clear from both the structure and text of  sections 36 (b), (c), and (d). For example, subsection (b)(l) mandates  that the President submit an individual certification for each letter  of offer--``before such letter of offer is issued, the President shall  submit . . . a numbered certification with respect to such offer . . .  .''. The emergency authority available to the President in (b)(1) is  similarly limited and may be exercised only in relation to a specific  letter of offer covering a specific sale, with a justification and  determination required in each instance such authority is exercised.  The relevant statutory references are only in the singular, and not in  the plural, leaving no doubt as to what the law requires.   ``If the President states in his certification that an emergency  exists which requires the proposed sale in the national security  interest of the United States, thus waiving the congressional review  requirements of this subsection, he shall set forth in the  certification a detailed justification for his determination, including  a description of the emergency circumstances which necessitate the  immediate issuance of the letter of offer and a discussion of the  national security interests involved.''   The structure and text of 36(c)(2) and (d)(1) are analogous in  requiring a specific determination and justification to accompany each  emergency certification.   Mr. President, given the extraordinary nature of the emergency  authority and the national security sensitivities involved in arms  sales, it is not surprising that Congress did not give the President  blanket authority to invoke an emergency and bypass Congress. The  requirement for a case-by-case exercise of such authority protects  congressional interests by ensuring that the Senate has sufficient  information on each sale to understand the sale, conduct oversight,  assess whether use of the emergency authority is consistent with the  AECA, and determine whether a resolution of disapproval is warranted.   The case-by-case approach set out in the statute was designed to  protect against the very situation the Senate faced as a result of the  Secretary's blanket use of the emergency authority to cover 22 sales at  once. The Secretary was abusing the emergency authority by invoking it  to cover sales for which there is no actual emergency need, e.g., the  manufacture of F-18 fighter aircraft side panels in Saudi Arabia for  export outside the region, when Saudi Araba doesn't even own the F-18.  Further, the senior State Department official responsible for arms  sales, Assistant Secretary of State R. Clarke Cooper, reinforced this  concern in a briefings to Senate staff when he cited justifications  other than Iran for the 22 sales, including the possible loss of arms  sales to China and Russia, the need for ``interoperability'' of weapons  systems, maintaining credibility as a reliable arms supplier, and  supporting the global supply chain for weapons sales.   By lumping all 22 certifications together with only one determination  and justification, the Secretary sought to mask obvious deficiencies in  his position that there is an actual and articulable emergency  applicable to each of the 22 sales. This tactic runs directly counter  to senators' ability to conduct oversight and the body's ability to  consider resolutions of disapproval in an informed manner.  Unfortunately, we must conclude that the Secretary intentionally took  this approach, given that he and the Department were not forthcoming  with the Senate as a general matter in relation to the 22 sales. For  example, just 2 days prior to the submission of the certifications, the  Secretary briefed all Senators on the enhanced threat from Iran and the  steps the United States is taking to counter that threat, yet did not  mention the arms sales or pending emergency certifications, which he  now justifies as necessary due to the Iran threat. Other Iran briefings  by the administration similarly omitted this issue. The view that the  omissions were purposeful is bolstered by official confirmation from  State that the decision to bypass Congress had been in the works for  months.    The Secretary's failure to comply with the statutory requirement for  individualized justifications materially and adversely impacted the  Senate's institutional interests. It undermined the clear and  intentional statutory balance between Congress and the executive branch  designed to govern individual arms sales, and it impedes the Senate's  ability to understand, conduct oversight, and respond to each sale.   Second, Mr. President, one of the statutory provisions that the  Secretary purports to use for these ``emergency'' sales does not  provide the Secretary the very emergency authority he claims. Article  36(c) of the Arms Export Control Act, which covers the direct  commercial sales at issue in 13 of the 22 sales, allows for emergency  sales in very limited situations that do not include sales to Saudi  Arabia or the UAE.   So let me be clear: To proceed under an emergency basis for 13 of the  22 sales, the Secretary had to ignore the plain language of the Arms  Export Control Act and simply assume he had the power to do so. I have  asked the State Department on multiple occasions their legal analysis  of this provision--any legal analysis at all that would support the  Secretary's authority. To date, I have received none, not even  verbally. They simply do not want to talk about it. It therefore seems  clear that they know that the Secretary did not have the authority that  he claimed to use.   Mr. President, let me explain in further detail. Section 36(c)(2)  does not provide statutory authority for emergency certifications to  Saudi Arabia and the UAE. As a result, in each instance in which the  Secretary relies solely on that subsection as the legal basis for  waiving congressional review, the certification in question is invalid.   The Department has notified several of the arms sales at issue  pursuant to section 36(c)(2). That subsection clearly allows the  President to bypass Congress upon certification of an emergency if the  sale is to a NATO or other close ally--NATO + 5: Australia, New  Zealand, Israel, Japan, and South Korea, section 36(c)(2)(A)--or in  relation to certain launches of commercial communication satellites,  section 36(c)(2)(B). That authority does not extend to 36(c)(2)(C), a  ``catch-all'' provision that covers sales to all other countries  including Saudi Arabia and UAE. In fact, while the statute explicitly  references the NATO + 5 and satellite launch emergency authority, it  omits (c)(2)(C), the catchall from the scope of the emergency  authority.   ``If the President states in his certification that an emergency  exists which requires the proposed export in the national security  interests of the United States, thus waiving the requirements of  subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph, he shall set forth in the  certification a detailed justification for his determination, including  a description of the emergency circumstances which necessitate the  immediate issuance of the export license and a discussion of the  national security interests involved.''   Interpretation and application of section 36(c)(2) should hew closely  to the plain text of the statute and give effect to the omission of  subsection (c)(2)(C). Doing otherwise would entail reading an  extraordinary emergency power into the text for subsection (c)(2)(C)  where none exists, which would be a departure from traditional canons  of statutory construction and would significantly expand the  President's authority under the AECA at the expense of Congress. The  statute should be interpreted and applied to afford extraordinary  emergency powers to the President only where the text clearly provides  for such authority, and subsection (c)(2)(C) does not do so.   We note that, prior to a 2000 amendment, section 36(c)(2) previously  allowed for emergency certifications in relation to NATO + 5 and the  catchall/any other country category. The 2000 amendment added the  provision dealing with commercial satellites, new 36(c)(2)(B) and, at  the same time, removed the emergency authority from the catchall,  (formerly subsection (c)(2)(B) and, post-2000, renumbered as (c)(2)(C).   There is a strong policy rationale for Congress to have acted in this  manner.  [[Page S5133]]  Section 36(c) governs direct commercial sales, e.g., Raytheon to Saudi  Arabia, as opposed to government to government sales under 36(b)(1). In  the case of direct commercial sales, the executive branch has less  insight and control over the transaction than it would if the U.S.  Government were the seller and engaged directly with a foreign  government. It follows, then, that Congress would be willing to allow  extraordinary emergency authority with regard to NATO and a small set  of our closest allies and partners, as well as in certain highly  limited situations where there is a direct commercial need--satellite  launches. Given that level of control does not exist for direct  commercial sales, however, it also follows that Congress had a powerful  incentive to narrow the scope of the emergency authority so that it no  longer authorized the President to bypass congressional review via a  catchall applicable to almost every country in the world.   We have heard through the grapevine that the Secretary's position may  be that Congress screwed up in the 2000 amendment and neglected to  clarify that the emergency authorities continued to apply to the catch  11 category. This counterargument is problematic for several reasons.  It ignores the plain language of the statute; it presumes congressional  error where the presumption should be that Congress knew what it was  doing and intended the result absent clear evidence of an error; there  is no contemporaneous documentation or statements of intent of which we  are aware that would corroborate this counterargument; and it serves  only the interest of the executive branch at the expense and  diminishment of Congress' role in arms sales. Furthermore, the  Secretary has never even made this argument to us, indicating that even  he does not believe it.   We are in dangerous territory, my friends. The Secretary has moved  forward, seeking to eliminate Congress's role in arms sales, based on  an extraordinary emergency power that arguably does not exist in  statute and for which he and his team have been unable or unwilling to  provide a serious legal rationale or any legal justification  whatsoever. While his position may pass muster with or even have been  blessed by the self-serving opinions we have seen from the current  Justice Department, it is nothing more than an executive power grab at  the expense of Congress and unmoored from the law. It is our  responsibility, through these resolutions, to send the clear message  that the United States Senate rejects this lawless approach.    I yield the floor.                          Vote on S.J. Res. 36--Veto
