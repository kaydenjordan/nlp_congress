 Mr. President, earlier this year, this Chamber was full  of conversation about immigration. We had four bipartisan proposals  that all came to this floor. All four of them had votes. All four of  them had some engagement from different Members. All four of them  failed. While we didn't succeed in getting something passed and  resolved on immigration, I will note that over 70 Senators voted for at  least 1 of the 4 options that included wall funding, increased border  security, and naturalization for those students who are in DACA or  DACA-eligible. At least 70-plus Senators voted for those three options.  They were written in different ways in each bill, but they all had the  same basis. I was one of those.   Like many of my friends on both sides of the aisle, during the  debate, I said that Americans don't hold children accountable for the  actions of their parents. It has been a basic principle we have held  for a long time. We believe in the protection of children and the unity  of families. That is what we have been about. We have some debate about  that because some of this body believes a child is not a child until  you can see them, and some believe a child is a child even when they  are in the womb. But we do have unity about those individuals--that  when we can see them and know them as a child, that we keep them as a  family. Although you could strongly put me on the side of saying I  think a child is a child even when they are in the womb.   It is right for us to focus on families. Quite frankly, it is also  right for us focus on immigration law and to believe that we are a  nation of laws.   We have a great dilemma at this point happening around our border.  Let me set some context for this that I think is important, and I want  to make sure people understand.   We are a very open nation for immigration. We have been before, and  we are now.  [[Page S3977]]    Last Friday, I had the wonderful opportunity to speak at a  naturalization ceremony in Oklahoma City and watch people from all over  the world take the oath, set aside their old country and become  citizens of the United States. I dare anyone to go to one of those  events and try to keep a dry eye. It is incredibly moving to watch  people have this event happen in their life that they will never  forget--they become an American. They didn't just come to America; they  are Americans. They have the exact same rights as anyone else in this  Chamber and live under the same law.   Now, 1.1 million people a year become naturalized citizens of the  United States. Each day, 500,000 people legally cross the border from  Mexico into the United States. We still have a debate on what happens  with those other individuals who aren't the 1.1 million who legally go  through the process to become U.S. citizens or the half a million  people a day who legally cross into the United States. What do we do  with those individuals who choose not to do it legally? It is a much  smaller number, but it is exceptionally contentious for us because we  are a compassionate nation, but we are also a nation that believes in  following the law--rightfully so. In fact, many people are fleeing from  countries where the law is ignored to come to a country like ours.   How did we get here? When a family is detained for illegally crossing  the border, the Department of Homeland Security has a longstanding  policy. It is not just for this administration; it is longstanding  policy not to separate children from their parents unless there is one  of three things that occur: DHS can't establish that the adult  traveling with the child is actually the guardian of the child or the  parent of the child. The second one is that they believe the child is  in danger--for instance, if there is a belief that the child has been  trafficked or abused. The third one is that the individual who is  traveling with the child--parent or guardian assumed--is being  prosecuted for a crime. Those are the three instances in which you  separate children from their families.   Throughout the last administration to this one, those individuals  were prosecuted, but the difference is, this administration has now  determined that they are going to prosecute more individuals when they  cross the border. The previous administrations would look the other  way. They would see individuals crossing the border, and they would  say: If they haven't committed some other crime besides crossing the  border--they would look the other way and allow them to come in, or  they would say: Here is what is called a notice to appear, and you can  go into the interior of the country and live in the United States, but  show up for a court hearing a year or two from now in someplace that  you want to go to.   The problem is, as the Trump Administration has noted, that the vast  majority of those individuals who were given a notice to appear at a  future court date never show up for that court date and they live  illegally in the United States.   Again, they are not one of the half a million people who each day  cross legally into the country; they are the small group of individuals  who chose to illegally cross into the country. They are given the  notice to appear and then don't appear.   The Trump administration is struggling with this right now and trying  to figure out what to do in that situation. Well, their decision was to  say: Zero tolerance. We are going to prosecute those individuals who  come. Rather than just give them a ticket to, in the future, come to a  court date, let's do the date right now.   The problem with that is, as soon as you press charges on that  individual, you get one of those three criteria that kicks in  immediately. As soon as charges are filed on the adult--not on the  child but on the adult--the adult is taken to have charges filed on  them and start going through the legal process. There is a requirement  to separate the children then, and the children go to what is called  the least restrictive environment. Usually that is with a family member  somewhere in the country, but it is usually 2 months or so before we  can get that child to someone else in order to help them go with a  family member.   That is a mess. It is something that occurred based on the decision  of the adult who brought the child and the decision of the adult to  illegally cross the border, but it is still a mess. We as compassionate  Americans absolutely detest watching families being pulled apart.   As I have said, the Department of Homeland Security--our default  every time should be to keep families together unless there is  absolutely no way to do it. Families should stay together. These are  individuals who are fleeing from whatever country or are coming for  economic benefit. They should face the consequences of illegally  crossing the border rather than doing it the right way--legally--as  hundreds of thousands of people do every single day, doing it the right  way. But we should try to keep families together if at all possible.   The question becomes, Now what? Since the policy change of May 5,  there are about 2,200 families who have crossed the border since May 5  who have been picked up. About 2,200 adults have been taken one way,  and their children taken the other way. It is very difficult for our  Nation to watch. As a father, I absolutely believe in every fiber of my  being that children should be safe and kept with their own families in  a loving and healthy environment. Yet now we are in a tough spot so let  me try to review and make some recommendations of what we can do about  this.    In 1997, there was an agreement called the Flores settlement. The  Flores settlement was an agreement between the Department of Justice  and a group of immigrant minors. It stated the Federal Government must  release to their parents or guardians, without unnecessary delay,  migrant children who are being held in Federal custody. In this case,  the parent or guardian is under criminal prosecution, so the Federal  Government can't do that. The next thing they have to do is to find the  least restrictive environment in which to release this child, which is  based on this 1997 agreement.   This is not a new issue. Every administration since 1997 has tried to  figure out what to do with it. The previous administration, as I  mentioned, just released people--adults and children--into the interior  of the country because it didn't know what to do with this agreement.  There is a way to resolve this and help keep families together no  matter what their statuses are as they are working through this  process.   In fact, I believe in it enough that in one of the proposals I  brought to this body to vote on in February, when we were dealing with  immigration as a whole, there was an agreement to resolve Flores. We  have voted on this already. I had folks as recently as today say to  bring a piece of legislation to fix this. I smiled at them and said I  did 4 months ago and that we voted on it as a body. This is not a new  issue. It has not just popped up since May 5, as the Trump  administration has focused on prosecution. This has been an issue for a  couple of decades.   Solving the Flores loophole is exceptionally important to us in our  immigration conversation because there are no simple answers to it  until we resolve this issue. When the Court requires us to separate  children from families while they are under prosecution and to find the  least restrictive environment to ship children, it makes for this  convoluted, bureaucratic, painful separation of families. I don't think  that was the Court's intention, but it has clearly been the result of  that since 1997, and now it is happening more. It has happened before  in the past, and it will continue to happen until we solve this. In  February, we brought up the need to continue to debate and get this  done. We have tried this before. Let's keep focusing on solving this.   In the meantime, it is my recommendation to this administration that  before there is prosecution, it offer to families the opportunity to do  volunteer returns. Currently, if you are from Mexico or if you are from  Canada and you illegally cross the border, you have the opportunity to  have what is called a voluntary return, meaning that you don't go  through all of the prosecution. You know you are in the country  illegally, but you are not quite at the point of having charges filed  against you. You have that opportunity, and you take that opportunity.   I think, before it files charges, the administration should offer to  every  [[Page S3978]]  family who comes across the border the opportunity to keep its family  together instead of going through this painful separation from any kind  of prosecution that would happen regardless of that prosecution  occurring. Give families the opportunity to stay together, make a  decision on what they are going to do together, and get this done. That  is something the administration can do.   Short of that, I absolutely believe Kirstjen Nielsen, who is our  Secretary of Homeland Security, is exactly correct when she says this  is Congress's fault. Congress has had the opportunity for a couple of  decades now to fix this, and Congress, for a couple of decades, has  said that it is not a problem, it is not a problem, it is not a  problem.   I and several other Senators and quite a few House Members have  continued to weigh this issue and say it is a problem no matter how it  is used. Whether it has been used with heavy prosecution or light  prosecution in previous administrations, it has always been a problem.  Congress has had the ability to fix it, but Congress has been unwilling  to do it. It is time for Congress to step up and do the job it is  supposed to do--take the votes it is supposed to take.   I am very aware these issues are difficult and technical and  emotional, but these are real lives that are mixed into this-- individuals who were created in the image of God. They have value and  worth. Families are affected by this. Congress needs to step up, take  the votes, and actually do the task that needs to be done. The  administration is right in that this is Congress's problem and that it  is Congress's responsibility to fix it. We shouldn't leave the  administration hanging out there.   I also say to the administration: You have other options and other  tools, in the meantime, to keep families together. Use them. For the  sake of all of those kids and all of those families, use them. In the  meantime, in the middle of this intolerable position, let's step up,  and let's take the votes.   We all know we need border security. In this body, border security  was an overwhelming bipartisan-supported measure in 2006, when the  Secure Fence Act was passed. We believe there needs to be border  security. Let's vote for it. Let's get it done. Let's not just talk  about doing it someday. Let's actually do it. Let's add more  immigration judges. Our backlog of a year and a half before one can get  to an immigration court is absurd. Catch and release is absurd. No one  would do that or should do that. We have ways to fix that.   I have stated over and over in this body that I think it is absurd we  have individuals who are in this country, due to no fault of their own,  and have grown up in this country whom we have just ignored and  pretended have not been there. Those people who are in DACA or who are  DACA-eligible deserve an answer. This Congress should vote on it rather  than just keep them in limbo.   Publically, I believe they should have a shot at naturalization. The  reasonable thing is to give us 10 years to get the border security  done. At the same time, those individuals in DACA will have a 10-year  path headed toward their naturalization. That should not be  unreasonable. In the meantime, give those individuals the opportunity  to travel and work and go to school and be full participants in our  society.   I think the diversity lottery is absurd. Other than salvation in  Christ, I think one of the greatest gifts you can possibly have on this  Earth is American citizenship. We just put it out there and say: You  don't have to have any qualifications. If you want to come, come. I  think we should actually extend it to people who are going to engage in  the economy and be productive parts of our society, who have gifts and  abilities that will help us as a culture. Let's make that the  extension. Let's keep the diversity lottery. I am grateful to have  people here who are from all over the world. Let's just make sure they  are bringing the skills we need. I don't think it is that unreasonable.   There are things we can do that we agree on and that we should move  on rather than just say: Someday, let's do. Someday is today. Someday  is right now. It is time for Congress to step up and take the lead and  stop blaming everybody else. It is time for us to do our job and vote  on this for a result.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S.
