 Madam President, I rise to speak about an  overwhelming and urgent need to reform the way our country approaches  policing. The death of Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Breonna Taylor,  George Floyd, Tony McDade, Andrew Kearse, and countless others are  deeply disturbing and, most unfortunately, nothing new.   The truth is, for every name we know, there are countless more that  we don't. This type of oppression and brutality has been part of Black- American lives for far too long. It should not happen, and in the  horrific instances when it does, it should not take a viral video  [[Page S2997]]  and a nationwide protest to get some measure of justice.   We are at a moment of moral reckoning in this country, and we must  take action. Our country needs bold reforms to address the systemic and  institutional racism that plagues our criminal justice system. The  Justice in Policing Act of 2020, introduced by my colleagues Senators  Booker and Harris, would make crucial and much needed changes to  address our Nation's policing practices and policies. We should pass  this bill as soon as possible.   We were reminded, sadly, of the urgency of this legislation on  Friday, when Rayshard Brooks was shot in the back by police in Atlanta.  It is clear that we don't have time to waste. Lives are on the line  today. We need reform now. We need accountability, and we need it to  happen now.   The Justice in Policing Act of 2020 would ban the no-knock warrant  police used to enter Breonna Taylor's apartment before killing her. It  would prevent unnecessary deaths like Rayshard Brooks by requiring that  officers use deescalation techniques and resort to deadly force only as  the last resort.   It also includes a provision that I worked on with Congressman Hakeem  Jeffries, the Eric Garner Excessive Force Prevention Act. It would ban  the types of choke holds and carotid holds that killed George Floyd and  Eric Garner by making the use of these dangerous maneuvers a Federal  civil rights violation.   Black Americans are killed by police at more than twice the rate of  White Americans, despite accounting for less than 13 percent of our  population. This legislation would not only end racial and religious  profiling, but it would mandate training on racial bias and on an  officer's duty to intervene.   The bill would also improve accountability by requiring Federal  uniform police officers to wear body cameras and require State and  local law enforcement to use existing Federal funding to ensure their  officers use body cameras as well.   Too often, after these unthinkable incidents of brutality, we learn  that law enforcement officers responsible had a history of misconduct.  This bill would collect better and more accurate data on police  misconduct and the use of force and create a national registry that  would track officers' complaint records throughout their careers. And  it would improve the use of pattern and practice investigations into  unconstitutional and discriminatory policing practice at the Federal,  State, and local levels.   The fact is that 99 percent of killings by police do not result in  any charges. Convictions on those charges are even rarer. This bill  would amend the Federal criminal statute that has made it extremely  difficult to prosecute law enforcement officers.   Finally, the bill would take the long overdue step of making lynching  a Federal crime. After the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, it is clear that  this problem must be addressed. We can never bring back those who we  have been lost in these horrific killings or even begin to make these  families whole. But we can and must take steps toward making sure that  these tragedies never happen again.   An Executive order that merely restates the law that Congress passed  in 1994 is clearly not enough. Establishing justice is at the heart of  the preamble of our Constitution, and we must deliver on the promise  that we made as a nation. We must match the efforts of those working to  change the system from the outside with the efforts of those who are  changing the system from the inside, with efforts to change it for  good. We have a lot of work ahead of us, and this bill will ensure that  we start on the right foot.   I would like to read a passage of Scripture that informs me on this  issue. Matthew 25, verse 44:         They also will answer: Lord, when did we see you hungry or       thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in       prison, and did not help you?        He will reply: Truly, I tell you, whatever you did not do       for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.        Then, they will go away to eternal punishment but the       righteous to eternal life.    We have a moral obligation. We have an obligation given our shared  commitment to upholding the Constitution. We have a moral  responsibility to not let this moment pass.   Who are we? What defines us? What kind of people are we? If we refuse  to act now when the country is raging--rightfully so--we decline to do  what is right.   I yield the floor.
