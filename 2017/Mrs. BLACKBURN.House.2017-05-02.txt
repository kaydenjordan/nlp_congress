 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Foxx and Chairman Roby  for the outstanding job that they have done on this.   Listening to my colleagues, you would think that there is a lack of  understanding, if you will, to that old saying that women want more  time.   As one of my constituents asked me today: If you pass this bill, is  it going to mean that I can bank my time during tax season, take time  and a half and use it to take a field trip or a school trip with my  child?   I said: Absolutely. Because this is a bill that puts you in charge of  how you want to be compensated for overtime work. Do you want the  money? Do you want the added time so that you have control of your  schedule?   Yes, this is about empowering the employee.   It is so interesting, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 put in  place something for the public sector. They forgot about the private  sector. You could look at this and say, well, it is a correction within  the law so that not only public sector employees, but also private  sector employees have the ability to say: I choose to have more time at  this point in my career. I want the flexibility.
