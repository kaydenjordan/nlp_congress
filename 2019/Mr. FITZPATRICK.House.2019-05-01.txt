 Mr. Speaker, as we approach Teacher Appreciation  Week, I would like to recognize an extraordinary educator in Bucks  County, Pennsylvania, who is making a difference in the lives of our  community's young people.   George Daka, a U.S. history teacher at Bensalem High School, was  recently selected as an honoree for the 13th annual Teacher as Hero  Awards. Later this month, George will receive his award at the National  Liberty Museum in Philadelphia alongside 11 other outstanding educators  from Pennsylvania and Delaware.   George sees his job as more than just teaching his students about  history, and he seeks to inspire them about our Nation's rich  traditions. We applaud George on this well-deserved award, and we wish  him and his family all the best.   We would also like to thank Kathryn Hinshaw, an English teacher at  Bensalem High School, for nominating George for this well-deserved  honor.              Celebrating the 100th Birthday of Marjorie Burtis     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 100th  birthday of a Bucks County resident who is sharing her talent and  creativity with others.   Last month, Langhorne resident Marjorie Burtis celebrated her  incredible milestone with more than 100 family members and friends.   This was no ordinary birthday celebration, however. It also served as  the unveiling of Marjorie's new art exhibit at the Bucks County Visitor  Center.   Despite her many life experiences, Marjorie discovered her passion  for watercolor painting merely 12 years ago after taking an art class.  Since that  [[Page H3346]]  time, she has sharpened her skills, with one fine arts professional  saying Marjorie paints ``as a realist.''   Mr. Speaker, we wish Marjorie a very happy belated 100th birthday,  and we congratulate her on her exhibit.   We thank Marjorie and her family for all that they do in our  community.                Recognizing the Bensalem High School Jazz Band     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a talented  group of young musicians from Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who were  recently honored for their performances.   Last month, the Bensalem High School Jazz Band traveled to perform in  the Cavalcade of Bands Jazz Championships. Bensalem High School Jazz  Band, well-known for their outstanding performances, was the only band  given the superior rating at the event and was also named grand  champion.   This is the third time that Bensalem High School Jazz Band has been  named grand champion over the past 11 years, a testament to the band's  skills, dedication, and work ethic.   Critical to the success of these young people is the director of the  Bensalem High School Jazz Band, Michael Zimmerman. We extend our  gratitude to him for working with our community's youth and students to  sharpen their musical abilities, and we congratulate all performers in  the Bensalem High School Jazz Band for their earned distinctions.                            ____________________
