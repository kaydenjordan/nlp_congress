 Mr. Speaker, when we talk about unity, let's remember  we were united last October when the House came together almost  unanimously to condemn QAnon in a resolution that I had introduced. We  said that QAnon was fanning the flames of anti-Semitism, that the  looney lies it was spreading online would lead to people being killed  in the real world.   But then yesterday, Mr. McCarthy, the minority leader, said something  that mystified me. He cited that resolution as a reason not to remove  Representative Greene from her committee. We had already condemned  QAnon, he suggested, so why would we need to do anything else?   It is like saying: We condemned bank robbery last year. We don't need  to actually stop any bank robbers this year.   How could almost 400 of us say that QAnon is a threat and then when  we see someone who has spent years spreading the same conspiracy  theories, the same anti-Semitism, the same calls for violence, someone  who 3 days ago called her critics pedophiles--not 2 years ago; 3 days  ago--then say that person should be given all the privileges of a  Member of the House?   Mr. Speaker, if you condemn QAnon, that means you have to fight it.  If you believe that these conspiracy theories are dangerous, you have  to separate yourself from the people who are spreading them.   If even a substantial number of us stand with Representative Greene  today, violent extremists will see it as another sign that they have a  legitimate place in our national debate, that respectable leaders in  our society either embrace them or fear them too much to stand in their  way.   I ask you, do not send this message. Let's unite against extremism,  not with it.
