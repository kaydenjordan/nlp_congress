 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  Child Care Is Essential Act.   Childcare is one of the most urgent and stressful issues facing  families during this pandemic and stabilizing it will be a key factor  in opening our communities safely.   I recently spoke about this issue with Oregonians who are struggling,  parents, early child educators, and small business owners. I released a  report urging support for the childcare industry. As one mom told me:  ``if childcare crumbles, if it even gets a fraction more difficult to  find, then our collective ability to work crumbles too.''   The childcare crisis disproportionately affects women, who, because  of entrenched gender roles, continue to take on the majority of  childcare and household responsibilities.   A lack of affordable childcare reduces the ability of women to work  outside the home and extends the gender pay gap. This is also an issue  of racial justice. Many childcare workers are women of color.   I am grateful for previous stimulus efforts, but it is not enough.  The Child Care Is Essential Act will provide immediate relief through  $50 billion, which I will note is less than the amount that went to the  Nation's airlines in coronavirus legislation. This is in direct grant  funding to help childcare providers cover operating expenses, purchase  PPE and cleaning supplies, pay providers through the pandemic and  beyond, and importantly, give parents the relief they need from high  copayments and tuition.   Investing in our children now has long-term benefits for our  families, for our communities, and for our economy.   I thank Congresswoman DeLauro and Chairman Scott for their  leadership, and I urge all my colleagues to support this bill.
