 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding, and I  thank the chairman and the Appropriations Committee for bringing  forward this extremely important legislation, which includes important  FEMA reforms which were approved unanimously by the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee partially in response to this year's historic  hurricane season.   The bipartisan, bicameral Disaster Recovery Reform Act addresses the  rising costs of disasters in the United States. It reforms Federal  disaster programs to ensure our communities are more resilient and  better prepared for the next hurricane, flood, earthquake, wildfire, or  other disaster.   It focuses on predisaster planning and mitigation and creates  incentives for communities to build better and smarter to speed  recovery when disaster does strike. This will save lives, and it will  also save money.   Putting our focus on mitigation is good government and is fiscally  responsible. For every dollar we spend on mitigation, between $4 and $8  is saved in avoided disaster recovery costs later. This is good policy  that will benefit every single congressional district across the  country.   I want to thank many Members who contributed, but especially to my  Democratic colleagues who contributed to this effort: Congressmen  Johnson, DeFazio, Huffman, Wilson, Maloney, Ruiz, Sinema, Frankel, and  Nadler. And again, many, many others contributed to this important  reform legislation.    Many Americans are still recovering from hurricane damage, and  California is in the middle of fighting massive wildfires. This is  extremely important legislation. I would urge all my colleagues to  support it.
