 Madam Speaker, on November 7, 12 lives  were stolen from us during the shooting at the Borderline Bar & Grill  in my district. As our community began to reckon with this tragedy, I  said: ``Today we mourn. Tomorrow we work to end the senseless gun  violence ravaging our Nation.''   But we didn't even have time to recover from our shock before  wildfires raged through our community. Our trauma was made unthinkably  worse, but we were also united by these dual tragedies, united in  reflection and healing.   My community knows that there is no single solution to ending mass  shootings, but we also know that to do nothing, to not even try, would  be unimaginable. We cannot bring back those lives lost, but we can take  sensible action to find solutions that will make the lives of our  constituents better and safer.   One very obvious, commonsense solution that more than 90 percent of  this country supports is universal background checks. H.R. 8 will not  solve all of the gun violence that is ripping our Nation apart, but it  will help. That is  [[Page H279]]  what we are here to do. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 8.                            ____________________
