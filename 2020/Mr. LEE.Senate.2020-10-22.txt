 Mr. President, today I offer my recognition of the  great service of Dean A. Collett to countless Utah students. His  service has spanned over six decades, starting in the fall of 1956 when  he first walked through the doors of Highland High School. Today, at  the age of 92, even through the difficulties of COVID-19, Dean sits at  his desk making personal phone calls to each of his students, ensuring  nothing less than their academic success. He is a true servant of the  people of Utah and one who deserves the highest of honors.   Dean Ashton Collett was born on September 30, 1928, to Richard G.  Collett and Amy Ashton Collett in Salt Lake City, UT. Richard Collett  was a successful banker, but due to the economic turmoil of the Great  Depression, the Collett family, with all five of their children, would  move frequently around Salt Lake City looking for work, a hardship that  would follow Richard and Amy for much of their lives. From those  moments as a child, Dean would dedicate his entire life helping to  support his family, working to keep food on the table and later taking  care of his mother until her passing. Dean spent his youth working as a  paper boy, doing yard work for hire, and later working as a grocery  store cashier at Table Supply in the avenues of Salt Lake City.   As the family kept relocating in search of work, Dean attended  Emerson Elementary School, Ensign Elementary School, and Washington  Elementary School. He progressed through  [[Page S6400]]  his educational pursuits, graduating from East High School in 1945 and  later from the University of Utah in 1956. Before completing his time  at the University of Utah, Dean served a 3-year mission in Sweden for  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Upon his return, he  was drafted into the Korean war and stationed in Germany due to his  knowledge of both Swedish and German. Once he graduated from the  University of Utah, Dean was given his first teaching job at a then  brandnew school called Highland High School in Salt Lake City. Little  did he know at the time that serving this school would end up being his  whole life's mission.   During Dean's time at Highland High School, he has taught the  subjects of math, English, yearbook, student government, German, and  Russian; acted as a cheerleading adviser; and is now a school  counselor. His time at Highland has spanned more than 63 graduating  classes and more than 30,000 students. He is an avid football fan and  has yet to miss a single Highland High football game in the school's  entire history. You will often see him selling tickets for sporting  events, dances, plays, and any other community events at the school. He  has been a father figure to thousands and helped students in need of  clothing, food, and financial assistance, including for those serving a  church mission. Dean never married or had children of his own, but  instead dedicated his life to the children of Highland High School.   My own staffer, Matt Holton, was a student of Dean's in the early  2000s and got to experience Dean's extraordinary dedication to his  students firsthand. While Matt was a freshman, his father was deployed  with the U.S. Army in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Dean saw a student in  need of additional care and so took Matt under his wing, becoming a  crucial mentor and father figure in his life. To this day, they remain  close friends.   Dean was also a teacher of a dear friend of mine, former Governor of  the State of Utah, U.S. Ambassador to China, and U.S. Ambassador to  Russia Jon Huntsman. Dean often teaches the students of Highland High  School that failure is a critical ingredient to success, using the  example that Jon Huntsman, who ran and lost for student body president,  later achieved the highest offices of public service.   Dean is an undeniable institution not only at Highland High School,  but throughout the entire State of Utah. He is a Utahn from the  Greatest Generation, embodying the best of the American spirit; and it  is my privilege to honor him today.                            ____________________
