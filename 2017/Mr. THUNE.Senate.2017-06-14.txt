 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                   Congressional Baseball Practice Shooting     Mr. President, like all of us here on Capitol Hill, I am  still reeling from the attack on our colleagues this morning. My  thoughts and prayers are with everyone who was injured, and with their  families.   My friend and colleague Steve Scalise remains in critical condition  right now, and I am praying for a full and swift recovery.   I am grateful to hear that the young congressional staffer who was  shot--a legislative correspondent for Representative Roger Williams--is  expected to make a complete recovery.   Legislative correspondents and the other young staffers who work in  our offices don't get a lot of media attention, but not one of us could  do our jobs serving our constituents without them. We are grateful for  their work and dedication.   In the Gospel of John, Jesus says: ``Greater love has no man than  this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.''   Most of us have never been in a situation where we have a need to  consider such a great sacrifice. But, every day, the men and women of  the United States Capitol Police, and every police force in this  country, get up and go about their jobs, knowing that they may have to  lay down their lives, and they do so willingly. When others run from  danger, they run into it. When bullets fly, they advance.   Today, violence threatened, and officers of the Capitol Police  stepped up to meet it. Had it not been for the efforts of the heroic  officers who were on site, today's attack could have been much, much  worse. As it is, their actions have brought many safely home to their  families tonight.   Events like today remind us that there is evil in the world, but they  also remind us that there is good. Around every act of evil and  violence, 100 acts of good spring up. The officers who risked their  lives to defend those at the scene, the colleagues who hurried to  provide medical care to Steve Scalise, the Alexandria police officers  who came running to help, the Democratic congressional baseball team  who united in prayer for their colleagues, the injured officer who went  to check on the Member he was protecting before he thought of seeking  treatment for himself--these are the things that endure.   Good endures. Sacrifice endures. Heroism endures. Long after the  names of evildoers are forgotten, these things remain.  [[Page S3482]]    Again, my thoughts and prayers are with the injured and with their  families. And, as always, my gratitude is with the Capitol police  officers who defend us every single day.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
