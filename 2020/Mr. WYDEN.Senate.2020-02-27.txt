 Mr. President, reserving the right to object.    Mr. President, the majority party's anti-women healthcare  agenda has certainly been on display in the last few days here in the  U.S. Senate: two votes on Tuesday, more votes and debate today. Every  time it is the same basic proposition on offer: legislation that  squeezes Republican politicians in between women and their doctors.   I have said the old GOP slogan used to be ``a chicken in every pot.''  These days it is ``a Republican in every exam room.''   Not only does this legislation discount the fact that reproductive  healthcare, including abortion, is healthcare; it would make women's  healthcare services more expensive. This would head this country back  to the days when the healthcare system was just for the healthy and the  wealthy.   My view is decisions about the healthcare of women, especially  reproductive healthcare--including abortion--are enormously personal.  They ought to be decisions made between women and their physicians.  Politicians ought to stay away. They ought to stay out of it all. That  is what the Roe v. Wade case is all about, and it is the law of the  land.   So because I believe in keeping politicians out of the medical exam  room, I object.    Mr. President, 9 years ago this month, citizens of Bahrain  took up banners to demand a greater role in their society and political  process.   Bahrain's ruling monarchy cracked down on the peaceful protestors;  State police and security forces arrested hundreds and killed more than  a dozen, according to press reports at the time. Bahrain's leaders  promised accountability and reforms in response to international  condemnation, but they would implement hardly any of them, and they  rolled back some of the few they did implement.   Indeed, the situation in Bahrain has only grown worse. Americans for  Democracy and Human Rights in Bahrain wrote last year that ``since  2017, the government has intensified the repression through the arrest,  detention, and conviction of individuals who draw attention to the  kingdom's human rights record or criticise the government.''   Last month, Human Rights Watch wrote, ``Bahrain's human rights record  worsened in 2019, as the government carried out executions, convicted  critics for peaceful expression, and threatened social media  activists.''   It gives me no great pleasure to point out the monarchy's increasing  repression. I have no personal animosity toward Bahrain, which remains  an important U.S. ally.   But the U.S. Government has a duty--an obligation--to be honest with  friends and allies and to hold them to a high standard. I regret to say  that the Obama administration did not do nearly enough to hold Bahrain  to that high standard, as I repeatedly came to this floor to discuss.  The Trump administration has, for its part, been even more callously  indifferent to the regime's abuses, despite Secretary of State Mike  Pompeo speaking many times about the importance of human rights.  [[Page S1213]]    Just last year, Secretary Pompeo said America can effect change  ``[b]y articulating abuses and pressuring noncompliant regimes.''   I agree.   So where is Secretary Pompeo when it comes to articulating Bahrain's  abuses and pressuring Bahrain's rulers to do better? The Secretary,  like his boss, is missing in action.   I urge my colleagues to take a hard look at Bahrain's human rights  record, to talk with victims of the regime and hear their stories of  persecution.   As I do every year, I renew my call on Bahrain's rulers to change  course and open space for dialogue, for free thought, and for peaceful  expression and protest.                            ____________________
