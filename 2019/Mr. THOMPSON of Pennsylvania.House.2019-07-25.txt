 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  today, July 25, as National Hire A Veteran Day.   In 2017, the nonprofit Hire Our Heroes established the day to  highlight the many talented men and women who served our country and  are now seeking civilian employment.   Hire Our Heroes serves as a resource bank for veterans to seek  professional advice, discover new training opportunities, and search  for new job opportunities.   Our Nation's veterans are some of the most dedicated and selfless  individuals who call this great Nation home. While we may never be able  to repay them for their sacrifice fully, the very least we can do is to  help ease the transition back into civilian life.   A big part of that transition is ensuring there are well-paying,  family-sustaining jobs available for our men and women in uniform when  they return home.   The most recent numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show  veteran unemployment at 3.2 percent, the lowest rate since 2011. That  is great news, but that does not mean our work here is done.   As a proud father of an Army infantryman, I am proud to have  supported legislation throughout my time in Congress that ensures our  Active Duty servicemembers and their spouses have the tools they need  to defend our country successfully. But it is critical that we also  support legislation that prepares our veterans for adjusting to life  after combat.   There are more than 7 million open jobs across the country. Our  veterans want to work, and service is in their veins.                                time  1015    They want to make an honest living and provide for their families.  They  [[Page H7383]]  want to learn new skills and be proud of the work that they do. It is  important that we do our part to ensure these opportunities are  available.   We can bolster veteran employment opportunities with career and  technical education. Many of the men and women seeking civilian  employment are already highly skilled, highly trained. They are  experienced, literally, under fire.   The skills that come with CTE training can help expand our veterans'  existing skill sets and prepare them for careers in STEM disciplines,  nursing, construction, information technology, energy, cybersecurity,  and many more.   Mr. Speaker, our veterans are a huge part of what makes this country  so great. They have chosen to risk their lives to protect our Nation.  We have the opportunity, no, the responsibility to provide them with  the best possible care and to empower them with the necessary tools to  make smart career decisions when we welcome them home.   Hire Our Heroes says the best way to thank a veteran is to hire one.  We should all keep this in mind as we celebrate our Nation's veterans  today and for many more days to come.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to applaud  the bravery, dedication, and sacrifice of two of Centre County's finest  law enforcement officers.   Each year, the Centre County District Attorney's Office accepts  nominations from the public, law enforcement agencies, and government  agencies for the Centre County Law Enforcement Officers of the Year  award.   Earlier this month, State College Police Officer John Aston and  Pennsylvania State Trooper Jeffrey Ebeck were recognized as this year's  recipients.   Aston has been a part of the borough police department for yearly 25  years and was promoted to detective in 2003. His experience in  cellphone, computer, and internet forensics has been critical in a  variety of high-profile cases in Centre County.   Ebeck became a state trooper in 2002 and has been described as a man  of strong character and integrity.   First responders like Aston and Ebeck certainly deserve to be  recognized for their work. But the men and women who choose these  careers don't do so for the accolades. They do so because of their  commitment to service and to safety.                            ____________________
