 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the need for further transparency and accountability in military  housing.   The most critical asset in the defense of our Nation are the men and  women who choose to serve. Therefore, our personnel and families  deserve to have their most basic needs addressed, and this starts with  housing.   For several years now, military housing has been plagued with  widespread complaints of neglect, unsafe conditions, and careless  repairs.   Recently, I introduced the Military Housing Transparency and  Accountability Act, which would expand the assessment tool created in  the 2020 NDAA to include all military housing, as well as enhancing the  reporting requirements to ensure accountability.   As an Army dad, I know firsthand the challenges our servicemen and  women  [[Page H2486]]  face when finding safe and comfortable housing.   They should feel confident if an issue arises it will be resolved and  in a timely manner. This bipartisan bill is a step in the right  direction and will improve transparency and oversight with the goal of  fixing a system that has serious issues.    Given the ongoing recruitment and retention challenges in our Armed  Forces, ensuring adequate housing for servicemembers and their families  is an important and necessary part of the solution.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, the Endangered Species Act  was drafted with the best of intentions, but it has simply failed to  live up to its noble mission.   Since the ESA was passed in 1973, only 3 percent of species protected  by the law have recovered to the point where they can be delisted. This  is an abysmal recovery rate.   Burdensome and outdated regulations like the Endangered Species Act  negatively impact our Nation's farmers, ranchers, and foresters, create  frivolous lawsuits, halt critical infrastructure projects, stifle  economic growth, and do not help the species in question. It fails to  do that.   Just consider the northern long-eared bat. It is declining due to a  disease with no cure, and the ESA will only further restrict our  ability to help the species recover. It is an inflexible and outdated  approach to species conservation.   America's working lands play a vital role in protecting threatened  and endangered species, Mr. Speaker.   Voluntary, locally led conservation programs should be a model for  the Federal Government rather than a top-down sledgehammer of red tape,  or what I prefer to call, green tape.   It is high past time to modernize the Endangered Species Act to  better protect species and to treat property owners, farmers, ranchers,  and States as partners rather than obstacles.   The ESA should be amended to empower local stakeholders, incentivize  voluntary conservation programs, and should emphasize actually  recovering species, not simply leaving them on life support for years  to come.   The simple truth is the programs that we have in the Agriculture  Committee under a conservation title which are locally led, voluntary  conservation programs, have led to the delisting of far more species  that were either listed originally as endangered or threatened.   We know that works, and we know the Endangered Species Act in its  current form does not.    Well, that and the fact I like to eat.
