 Madam Speaker, we are in the middle of a global pandemic.  This isn't a Republican virus or Democratic virus. It doesn't recognize  the color of your skin or the country of your origin. It doesn't know  what god you worship.   We are in this together, not just as a city, a State, a country. We  are in this together--all of us--and we will get out of this together.  Let's find our human kindness and our better nature. We will persevere.  We will be more resilient. And we will come out stronger and kinder and  gentler.                                time  1315
