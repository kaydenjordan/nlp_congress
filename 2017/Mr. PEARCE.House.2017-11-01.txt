(g) Arbitration Pilot Program Resolution.--        (1) In general.--An objection or protest to a forest       management activity carried out pursuant to this section       shall be addressed through the arbitration program       established under section 311.        (2) Limitation on number of arbitrations.--An arbitration       described in paragraph (1) shall not be counted towards the       limitation on number of arbitrations under section 311(a)(3).        (h) Termination.--The authority to carry out this section       shall terminate on the date that is 7 years after the date of       the enactment of this section.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 595, the gentleman  from New Mexico (Mr. Pearce) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Mexico.    Mr. Chairman, our national forests are overgrown, and the  thinning projects which would restore them to health are delayed by  lengthy and costly regulations and litigations. In New Mexico, it takes  a look like this: the top picture is a picture of one of our national  forests, and the bottom picture is a picture from an area that has been  thinned.   Now, take, for example, the Lincoln National Forest near Ruidoso, the  Mescalero Forest is butted right up against it, so we are able to get a  good comparison.   Now, typically, the forests in the West look like this: widely spaced  trees and mostly grass in between, so when the fires came, they were  grass fires. The tree rings show us that every 8 years a fire occurred,  and it would keep the small underbrush and the small diameter trees,  the small, unhealthy ones, it would keep those burned out and our  forests, again, looked like this.   But because all of the thinning projects and all of the timber  projects have been canceled for decades now, our forests, instead, look  like this. When wildfires happen, they burn catastrophically and burn  everything in their sight.   So my amendment today simply allows the Forest Service to move  forward on balanced thinning programs in large scale. Typically, they  do all of the paperwork, all of the studies for small acreage, maybe 30  acres or 50 acres. Since the forests are about a million acres, you  would never get through and never get the forest restored to its  health, and that is the problem.   The Forest Service has been working with me on the language for this  amendment and submitted almost exact language that we have put here on  the floor today. They agree with us that they should restore the forest  to its health, but the environmental groups and the outside litigation  have stopped the programs completely.   Now, in New Mexico, this means jobs, but it also means the health of  our environment, and it means the destruction of endangered species,  because when the fires burn through, we get the effect on the next  page; again, this is that same Lincoln National Forest that we were  looking at just a second ago. This is after the Little Bear fire, which  burned 255 homes and almost 40,000 acres.   We almost lost the entire town of Ruidoso. If the fire had just  capped over the mountain, it would have burned straight down the side.  The winds were exactly the direction which would have caused that.   So the Forest Service is agreeing with us that we need to do some  thinning, and we are not going to be able to do it without legislative  language, so this amendment is being offered here today.                                time  1700    We used to have 123 mills working in New Mexico clearing timber,  processing it. We have got vast national  [[Page H8355]]  forests, and all of those have been shut down. The spotted owl came  along in 1993, and the findings from the Fish and Wildlife Service was  that logging was the reason that the spotted owl was going extinct.   Over 20 years later, Dan Ashe, the head of Fish and Wildlife Service,  said: Oops, we made a mistake and we burned down the West, and we have  ruined our forests over a mistake. There was actually another predator  out there. We still have the problem to go in and clean up these  forests before they burn and before they look like this.   Another real problem that exists is when we burn our national  forests, then the watersheds are going to be choked up with mud, with  ash, and with everything else.   This is Bonita Lake there in that same Lincoln National Forest near  Ruidoso. It provides the drinking water for several major communities  in the southern part of the State. That lake was about 75 feet deep,  pristine water, had fish in there. It was a recreational area right in  the middle of the national forest.   The Forest Service was alarmed at how much damage was going to occur  to this lake if they didn't log above it, so they put in a project.  They were sued and work grounded to a halt. They did not get to thin  that area above the lake. A fire occurred, this fire that you just saw  in the previous slide. Now, that 75-feet-deep lake is filled with 50- feet of mud and ash. It killed all of the fish. It is not suitable for  drinking. The community does not have the money in order to drain that  lake and to refill it.   So that is what we find in the West because of these forest  management processes. My amendment would simply allow the Forest  Service to move forward on large-scale projects. They would still have  to do all of the studies, everything. They would just be expedited.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the problem we are trying to solve--the  gentleman asked the question--is that we are burning our forests down.  We are burning up the habitat. We are burning up the endangered  species. This was 40,000 acres. We had another fire in the Second  District of New Mexico that was over 300,000 acres and they burned  without regard. They burned human life. They burned animal life. They  burned habitat and they contaminate our waterways.   Those are the problems that we are trying to solve. The Forest  Service agrees with us that the restrictions are too great, and they  have worked with us on the language, understanding that they must go  through the studies, they must do the work that is required, but we can  expedite those in order to do larger-scale thinning projects.  Otherwise, we will never get the forests in the West cleared up.   Mr. Chairman, this amendment is a good amendment. I urge its passage,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
