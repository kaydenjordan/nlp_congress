 BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, after 12 months of  death and despair, the American recovery begins tonight. Mr. Speaker,  this is a big and bold plan, one of the largest bills in the history of  Congress. It is exactly the sort of bold plan that is needed to meet  the crisis of this moment.   And unlike some on the other side, the American people understand it.  That is why this plan is more popular than any economic package in my  lifetime. A majority of Democrats, a majority of Independents, and even  a majority of Republicans support this plan.   Mr. Speaker, the time to act is now. Let us begin the great American  recovery and pass this plan.
