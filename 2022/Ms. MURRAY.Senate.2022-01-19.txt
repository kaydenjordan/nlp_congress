 Mr. President, we are here today to talk about our  democracy, and here is what I know about how a democracy actually  works. I come out here to the Senate floor every day, just like every  Member of this Chamber, and I fight for what I believe in. And I use my  voice to do that, and I use my vote to do that.   The same is true for every citizen of this country. They use their  vote to say what they want the future of our democracy to look like.  But, right now, States across the country are taking away that right.  They are taking away their voice.   We have to make sure that every vote is never taken away, that no  voice is taken away, or we are going to lose the democracy in the  future.   And here is what is happening right now. Republican legislatures are  making it hard to vote for certain groups of people--primarily Black  Americans, Native Americans, young people, and people with  disabilities, just because they might vote for a Democrat.   This is a national coordinated effort to keep Republicans in power at  every level of government by keeping Americans away from the ballot  box, by keeping Americans from being able to use their voice and their  vote. Specifically, Republican legislatures are passing legislation to  make it harder for people to vote by mail; drastically eliminating the  availability of secure drop boxes so people can safely drop off their  ballot; and reducing early voting hours or days.   And it is all done to demoralize and discourage people--working  people--from making their voices heard and to make the democratic  process so much more cumbersome. That is a mom who is juggling  childcare and schooling during the pandemic, who is going to look for  options to get that ballot in, to get her voice in, to get her vote in,  and she won't able to find a way to do that with all of her  responsibilities.   Maybe there is not a drop box near her, or maybe early voting hours  have been cut short, or maybe the new rules about voting by mail are  just too complicated.   Because of those barriers that are being erected in Republican  legislatures, that mom will not get to advocate for her kids or her  community with her vote. And too many Republicans want it to work  exactly like that.   And those far-right politicians also want to pick their own voters-- literally drawing lines between communities to reinforce partisan  divides.   Congressional Democrats are working to do the opposite. Instead of  letting politicians draw maps to rig the outcomes in favor of one party  or another, we just want to end partisan gerrymandering.   Because--let's be clear--people should pick their representatives in  the United States of America, not the other way around. And what we are  seeing happening across the country is undemocratic, and in no  uncertain terms, it is a threat to this democracy.   And if you don't believe me, look at what the former President said  just  [[Page S292]]  this past weekend. Donald Trump, the leader of the Republican Party,  continues as we know to spread the lie that the 2020 election was  stolen from him. He is working hard, out in the open, to convince every  American that he can that our free, fair election in 2020 was  illegitimate.   But even more concerning is the former President's explicit stated  determination to rig the outcome of future elections. In a recent  recorded message Donald Trump said:         We have to be a lot sharper the next time when it comes to       counting the vote. . . . Sometimes the vote counter is more       important than the candidate.    More important than the candidate? And what Donald Trump means in  this case was clear. He wants his loyalists to oversee our elections to  make sure the outcome is always in his favor. I mean, just sit with  that. We are not talking about hypotheticals here. The leader of the  Republican Party wants to toss democracy out the window and change the  outcome of any election results he doesn't like.   History is sitting on our shoulders right now. The American people  are looking to us for a way to move forward and protect the right to  vote, and this is it. And all that is standing in our way is Senate  procedure--Senate procedure that a majority of us voted last month to  change.   Now, I understand the reluctance around reforming the filibuster. I  do. I understand we want this institution to work, to be bipartisan  when it comes to tackling big challenges. But here is the deal: I don't  think that carving out a path to pass voting rights on a simple  majority precludes that.   In fact, I think it is past time that we reform the filibuster to  make sure the world's greatest deliberative body actually deliberates  the issues and challenges that are facing the American people.   But today's Senate procedure keeps us from that kind of deliberation.  Senate rules not unlike the partisan gerrymandering we are seeing in  States across the country push Democrats and Republicans further into  their corners, rather than toward collaboration, making it unbelievably  easy to block legislative action and nearly impossible to start it.   And that means Americans do not get to see where elected officials  stand on issues as consequential as protecting the right to vote. To  even have the debate we are having right now, we had to dig through  Senate rules and quite literally repurpose a bill that allows NASA to  lease its property. Otherwise, we wouldn't even be standing here on the  floor today to have this discussion about voting rights. That does not  make sense.   It should not be so difficult to make it so the public can see where  each of us stands. And let's remember that these voter suppression laws  are all being passed mainly on a partisan basis with simple majorities.   Now, some have suggested that if we believe these laws are  unconstitutional we should fight them in the courts, take our arguments  all the way to the Supreme Court. But remember, there are three Supreme  Court Justices all appointed by a simple majority of this Senate  without the filibuster.   So let's recap. Republicans want to appoint judges without a  filibuster standing in their way. They want Republican State lawmakers  to be able to pass voter suppression laws without a filibuster. But  Democrats can't protect the basic right to vote on a simple majority.   That is what we are talking about here today: making election day a  Federal holiday, making sure everyone can vote by mail, ending  gerrymandering so voters can pick their politicians and not the other  way around. These are simple, straightforward reforms, with tremendous  significance for our country's future as a democracy.   And the path to getting them done is simple and straight forward too.  What each of us has to do is decide that our democracy comes before  Senate procedure and then cast our votes.   I have made my decision, and here is what I believe: We cannot let  the filibuster stop us from protecting every American's right to vote.  If it is the filibuster or democracy, I will choose democracy. If it is  the Senate rules or a Senate that works for the American people, I will  choose a Senate that works.   And I urge my colleagues with all of my heart, for the sake of this  democracy, to do the same.   I yield the floor.
