 Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the people of Pennsylvania's  12th Congressional District, congratulations to the Greater Susquehanna  Valley Chamber of Commerce on being named the Chamber of the Year by  the Pennsylvania Association of Chamber Professionals.   Located in Shamokin Dam, the Greater Susquehanna Valley Chamber has  been in operation for 99 years and is a conglomeration of other local  chambers, some of which are older than the main organization. It was  named Chamber of the Year based upon its organizational strengths,  including programs that encourage networking and a chamber ambassador  program.   The chamber's most recent success is in attracting Luzerne County  Community College to open a branch campus in Watsontown, Pennsylvania.  Chamber officials credit its success to the work of its members and  staff working together to achieve positive economic outcomes for the  people of the Greater Susquehanna Valley.   Again, congratulations to the Greater Susquehanna Valley Chamber of  Commerce and to president and CEO Bob Garrett on receiving the Chamber  of the Year award.                            ____________________
