 Mr. President, I am extremely pleased that the Senate  will be voting shortly to confirm Ambassador Richard Verma to be the  Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources at the  Department of State. This role is one of the most critical positions at  the Department of State.   DMR, as it is known, has wide-ranging responsibility for overseeing  personnel and ensuring the Department is sufficiently resourced to  carry out effective U.S. diplomacy.   And there are no shortages of challenges. As we reorient our foreign  policy toward strategic competition with China, as we counter malign  influence by Russia across the globe, as we work to address global  health, food insecurity, and climate crisis, it is imperative that our  diplomatic corps has the tools they need to address the challenges  ahead.   Ambassador Verma is superbly qualified to lead this part of the  Department in confronting these challenges. His long public sector  career, which includes service in the Air Force, the Senate, and the  State Department, will help him be an effective leader who can advance  the Department's modernization agenda.   And as our first-ever Indian-American Ambassador to New Delhi, he has  firsthand experience leading a major U.S. Embassy and a deep  understanding of the strategic advantage of cultivating and retaining a  diverse and expert workforce.   I have full confidence that Ambassador Verma will be a constructive  partner with Congress and work to make sure the Department has the  support, the resources, and the leadership it needs to succeed.   Given the challenges ahead, I am pleased that we are finally voting  to confirm Ambassador Verma today, and I urge all of my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle to support this nomination.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to yield back  all time.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                     Washington, DC.
