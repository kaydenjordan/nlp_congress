 Mr. President.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we have  discussed this before on the floor, and I will not go through that  entirely in my part of the discussion here.   Four months ago with the CARES Act, we came together and unanimously  passed a package that provided historic support, significant support,  in the rental markets, as this request focuses on. I believe that in  the coming days, we can come to that same kind of consensus and deal  with this important issue. Because of that, I object.
