 Mr. Speaker, today, I join the Representatives of New  Mexico to honor the legendary Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico.   I want to highlight what his work means for the Latino community.  Bill's lasting legacy of advocacy for millions of Latinos and his work  on the national political stage has made all the difference in all of  our lives.   As one of the most influential Mexican Americans in history, Bill  devoted his life to improving the lives of New Mexicans, Latinos, and  Americans at home and abroad. His unwavering commitment to the  betterment of the Latino community and the Nation has left an  undeniable impact. As one of the most powerful Latinos in politics this  Nation has seen, he has made many of our pathways to public service  possible. This year, we are celebrating the largest number of members  in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.   We thank Bill for his work for New Mexico, the United States, and the  world. As Members of the U.S. House of Representatives, we will honor  his commitment to public service every day.   ``Go with God, Bill''; ``Que estes con Dios, Bill.''                            ____________________
