 Mr. President, before my friend from Washington State  leaves, I want to thank her for her advocacy on water infrastructure,  and I agree with her that this is a great bipartisan bill. The  distinguished Senator from Washington State mentioned Flint, MI, and I  just want to thank her one more time. No one stood stronger with me and  Senator Peters in trying to help the people in Flint, and I greatly  appreciate her help, support, and advocacy.
