 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1388) to take lands in Sonoma County, California, into trust  as part of the reservation of the Lytton Rancheria of California, and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1388         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Lytton Rancheria Homelands       Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The Lytton Rancheria of California is a federally       recognized Indian tribe that lost its homeland after its       relationship to the United States was unjustly and unlawfully       terminated in 1958. The Tribe was restored to Federal       recognition in 1991, but the conditions of its restoration       have prevented it from regaining a homeland on its original       lands.        (2) Congress needs to take action to reverse historic       injustices that befell the Tribe and that have prevented it       from regaining a viable homeland for its people.        (3) Prior to European contact there were as many as 350,000       Indians living in what is now the State of California. By the       turn of the 19th century, that number had been reduced to       approximately 15,000 individuals, many of them homeless and       living in scattered bands and communities.        (4) The Lytton Rancheria's original homeland was purchased       by the United States in 1926 pursuant to congressional       authority designed to remedy the unique tragedy that befell       the Indians of California and provide them with reservations       called Rancherias to be held in trust by the United States.        (5) After the Lytton Rancheria lands were purchased by the       United States, the Tribe settled on the land and sustained       itself for several decades by farming and ranching.        (6) By the mid-1950s, Federal Indian policy had shifted       back towards a policy of terminating the Federal relationship       with Indian tribes. In 1958, Congress enacted the Rancheria       Act of 1958 (72 Stat. 619), which slated 41 Rancherias in       California, including the Lytton Rancheria, for termination       after certain conditions were met.        (7) On August 1, 1961, the Federal Government terminated       its relationship with the Lytton Rancheria. This termination       was illegal because the conditions for termination under the       Rancheria Act had never been met. After termination was       implemented, the Tribe lost its lands and was left without       any means of supporting itself.        (8) In 1987, the Tribe joined three other tribes in a       lawsuit against the United States challenging the illegal       termination of their Rancherias. A Stipulated Judgment in the       case, Scotts Valley Band of Pomo Indians of the Sugar Bowl       Rancheria v. United States, No. C-86-3660 (N.D.Cal. March 22,       1991), restored the Lytton Rancheria to its status as a       federally recognized Indian tribe.        (9) The Stipulated Judgment provides that the Lytton       Rancheria would have the ``individual and collective status       and rights'' which it had prior to its termination and       expressly contemplated the acquisition of trust lands for the       Lytton Rancheria.        (10) The Stipulated Judgment contains provisions, included       at the request of the local county governments and       neighboring landowners, that prohibit the Lytton Rancheria       from exercising its full Federal rights on its original       homeland in the Alexander Valley.        (11) In 2000, approximately 9.5 acres of land in San Pablo,       California, was placed in trust status for the Lytton       Rancheria for economic development purposes.        (12) The Tribe has since acquired, from willing sellers at       fair market value, property in Sonoma County near the Tribe's       historic Rancheria. This property, which the Tribe holds in       fee status, is suitable for a new homeland for the Tribe.        (13) On a portion of the land to be taken into trust, which       portion totals approximately 124.12 acres, the Tribe plans to       build housing for its members and governmental and community       facilities.        (14) A portion of the land to be taken into trust is being       used for viniculture, and the Tribe intends to develop more       of the lands to be taken into trust for viniculture. The       Tribe's investment in the ongoing viniculture operation has       reinvigorated the vineyards, which are producing high-quality       wines. The Tribe is operating its vineyards on a sustainable       basis and is working toward certification of sustainability.        (15) No gaming shall be conducted on the lands to be taken       into trust by this Act.        (16) No gaming shall be conducted on any lands taken into       trust on behalf of the Tribe in Sonoma County after the date       of the enactment of this Act.        (17) By directing that these lands be taken into trust, the       United States will ensure that the Lytton Rancheria will       finally have a permanently protected homeland on which the       Tribe can once again live communally and plan for future       generations. This action is necessary to fully restore the       Tribe to the status it had before it was wrongfully       terminated in 1961.        (18) The Tribe and County of Sonoma have entered into a       Memorandum of Agreement as amended in 2018 in which the       County agrees to the lands in the County being taken into       trust for the benefit of the Tribe in consideration for       commitments made by the Tribe.       SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.         For the purpose of this Act, the following definitions       apply:        (1) County.--The term ``County'' means Sonoma County,       California.        (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of the Interior.        (3) Tribe.--The term ``Tribe'' means the Lytton Rancheria       of California.       SEC. 4. LANDS TO BE TAKEN INTO TRUST.         (a) In General.--The land owned by the Tribe and generally       depicted on the map titled ``Lytton Fee Owned Property to be       Taken into Trust'' and dated May 1, 2015, is hereby taken       into trust for the benefit of the Tribe, subject to valid       existing rights, contracts, and management agreements related       to easements and rights-of-way.        (b) Lands To Be Made Part of the Reservation.--Lands taken       into trust under subsection (a) shall be part of the Tribe's       reservation and shall be administered in accordance with the       laws and regulations generally applicable to property held in       trust by the United States for an Indian tribe.  [[Page H2813]]            SEC. 5. GAMING.         (a) Lands Taken Into Trust Under This Act.--Lands taken       into trust for the benefit of the Tribe under section 4 shall       not be eligible for gaming under the Indian Gaming Regulatory       Act (25 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.).        (b) Other Lands Taken Into Trust.--Lands taken into trust       for the benefit of the Tribe in Sonoma County after the date       of the enactment of this Act shall not be eligible for gaming       under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2710 et       seq.).       SEC. 6. APPLICABILITY OF CERTAIN LAW.         Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Memorandum       of Agreement entered into by the Tribe and the County       concerning taking land in the County into trust for the       benefit of the Tribe, which was approved by the County Board       of Supervisors on March 10, 2015, and any addenda and       supplement or amendment thereto, is not subject to review or       approval of the Secretary in order to be effective, including       review or approval under section 2103 of the Revised Statutes       (25 U.S.C. 81).     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Along with dozens of other California Tribes, the Lytton Band of Pomo  Indians had its relationship with the Federal Government terminated in  1958, resulting in the loss of its Federal status and all of its Tribal  lands.   The Tribe's federally recognized status was eventually restored, but  its reservation lands were not. As a result, with the exception of a  small parcel of land that Congress provided for gaming in San Pablo,  the Tribe has been left essentially landless and without a reservation  since it was terminated.   H.R. 1388 will address that issue by taking approximately 511 acres  in Sonoma County, California, into trust as part of the reservation of  the Lytton Rancheria. On 124 acres of the land, the Tribe plans to  build housing for its members, as well as governmental and community  facilities. Another portion of the land is currently being used for  viniculture, and the Tribe intends to develop more of the lands for the  same purpose.   In response to local concerns, the Tribe has agreed that the lands  will not be used for gaming. This is provided in the text of the  legislation as well as in a binding memorandum of agreement with the  Sonoma County Board of Supervisors.   In addition to the memorandum of agreement with the County of Sonoma,  the Tribe has also entered into agreements with the local school  district and the local fire department. Additionally, the Tribe is  working with the city of Windsor to ensure appropriate water and sewer  hookup.                                time  1330    By directing that these lands be taken into trust, the United States  will ensure that the Lytton Rancheria will finally have a permanently  protected homeland on which they can once again live as a community and  plan for the future.   An identical bill passed the House last Congress by voice vote, and I  urge quick adoption of this legislation as well.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 297) to extend the Federal recognition to the Little Shell  Tribe of Chippewa Indians of Montana, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 297         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Little Shell Tribe of       Chippewa Indians Restoration Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Member.--The term ``member'' means an individual who is       enrolled in the Tribe pursuant to section 6.        (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of the Interior.        (3) Tribe.--The term ``Tribe'' means the Little Shell Tribe       of Chippewa Indians of  Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 297 will extend Federal recognition to the Little  Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians of Montana.   Federal recognition of Native American Tribes is critical to  protecting their tribal sovereignty and restoring a tribe's ability to  control its land, its water, and its resources, as well as the ability  to govern and to protect the health, safety, and welfare of its  members.   The Little Shell Tribe has resided in Montana for well over a century  and has long been recognized as a tribe by the State of Montana.   The Little Shell Tribe is a political successor to the signatories of  the Pembina Treaty of 1863, under which a large area of the land in the  State of North Dakota was ceded to the United States. While the Federal  Government has federally recognized the two other Tribes that are  successors to the signatories of the treaty, the Little Shell have  inexplicably been left in limbo.   The Little Shell Tribe has repeatedly petitioned the Federal  Government for Federal recognition, first in the 1930s and 1940s under  the Indian Reorganization Act, and later, starting in 1978, through the  Department of the Interior's recognition process. However, despite  their long and well-documented history, they were deprived of their  rightful Federal recognition each time.   H.R. 297 finally extends recognition to the Little Shell Tribe,  making all Federal laws and regulations of general applicability to  Indians and Indian Tribes applicable to Little Shell and its members.   Federal recognition of the Little Shell Tribe enjoys broad support in  Montana, including support from the Governor's office, the Montana  State Legislature, the surrounding counties and cities, and from all  the other federally recognized Montana Tribes.   Recognition of the Little Shell is long overdue.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 297, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and  I want to extend our appreciation for his work to the sponsor of the  legislation. It passed unanimously, as he indicated, and there is no  reason why we can't do that again today.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
