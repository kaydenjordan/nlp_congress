 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, we are on the brink of passing meaningful  gun safety legislation, and it is regrettable that it took the deaths  of 31 people, including 19 children, in the recent Buffalo and Uvalde  mass shootings to provide the needed momentum to break the hold that  the National Rifle Association and the gun lobby has had over Congress.   I commend my colleagues on both sides who have stepped forward to  reach a compromise. This bill is a big accomplishment that can save  lives, but I feel an inescapable dread that we will face the horror of  another mass shooting if we do not take further steps.   As a veteran, I have shot many of the weapons we have heard debated  on the floor this week. I know their power, and I know they were  designed for killing people.   Now, I know that some of my colleagues hold the view that more  firearms in the hands of more people is the antidote to gun violence,  but I have to ask: Will more and more guns and more and more people  carrying guns in public make our schools, our churches, or our streets  safer? Is that really a vision for this country? I don't think so.   According to an academic study by the Council on Foreign Relations,  the United States, with less than 5 percent of the world's population,  has 46 percent of the world's civilian-owned guns, and it has the  highest homicide-by-firearm rate of the world's most developed  countries.   Indeed, Americans kill each other with guns at a rate 25 times higher  than other high-income countries. In addition, Americans use firearms  to harm themselves in alarming numbers. According to the CDC, in 2020,  there were more than 45,000 firearm-related deaths in the United  States, and roughly half of those deaths were suicides.   That is the academic data. But what grips me and so many other Rhode  Islanders are the mass killings of Americans, particularly children,  over the last quarter century: Columbine, Sandy Hook, Parkland, and now  Uvalde. Hospitals, concert venues, houses of worship, and military  installations have also been targeted. People have been targeted based  on race, sexual orientation, and religious beliefs. Innocent lives have  been taken again and again, and many more lives have been shattered.  The common element  [[Page S3118]]  is a firearm; and while correlation isn't necessarily causation, these  mass killings have become more and more common as more and more guns  have been marketed and sold.   Roughly two-thirds of Americans do not own a gun, and the majority of  Americans agree on a commonsense solution like expanding background  checks. But groups like the NRA have lined up to block these efforts  even in the face of devastating loss.   The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act before us today represents  progress. It represents a momentary break in the NRA's stranglehold on  reform. This bill will establish a 10-day waiting period for firearms  purchases for individuals under 21 years of age. It will close the  ``boyfriend'' loophole that allows abusers to access guns. It will  strengthen requirements for gun sellers to obtain a Federal firearms  license. It will establish clear penalties for straw purchases and gun  trafficking, and it will invest in violence intervention programs and  mental health solutions in communities across the country. Those are  real changes that are worthy of support on their own.   I am also encouraged that the bill includes incentives for States to  adopt extreme risk protection orders, or a red flag system, similar to  the legislation I have introduced. State red flag laws have proven  effective in keeping guns away from individuals who have demonstrated  clear warning signs of danger to themselves and others, and we should  be encouraging every State to adopt a red flag system.   I would also like to talk about the mental health aspects of the  bill. First, it needs to be repeated that a person with a mental health  condition is more likely to be a victim of violent crime, not the  perpetrator. The most reliable predictor of future violence is actually  a history of violent behavior, not a diagnosis of mental illness.   That being said, we do have a mental health crisis in this country  that demands attention. In Rhode Island, families and providers have  been asking for more resources for treatment and more training for  mental health workers, particularly resources dedicated to children  with mental health needs. I am pleased that the negotiations over the  gun control package so far include new resources for mental health  care, including a national expansion of the certified community  behavioral health clinic model, which would provide sustainable funding  to expand mental health and substance abuse treatment and services at  the community level. I have worked with my colleagues Senator Stabenow  and Senator Blunt for over a decade to move this provision forward.   I am also pleased that this agreement invests new funding in a  National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Next month, the Lifeline will be  making the switch to an easy to remember three-digit number: 988. We  need to make sure that call centers have the staff and capacity to  handle call volume and make sure people who reach out for help get  appropriate follow-up care. As I mentioned earlier, half of all gun  deaths each year are suicides, and firearms are the most lethal method  of suicide. In addition to keeping guns out of the hands of people in  crisis, we need to make sure we have well-funded and organized systems  in place for people who reach out for help in these times of crisis,  like the Lifeline. Again, I would hope every American, and particularly  those who face these mental health challenges, remember 988. It could  be a lifesaver.    I hope we are able to consider bipartisan efforts to strengthen our  mental health care system over the coming weeks and months. For  example, we should pass the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline  Improvement Act, which I introduced with Senator Moran last year. The  HELP Committee reported the bill out of the committee unanimously  nearly a year ago, but this bipartisan bill still has not yet come  before the Senate.   The bill also includes critical resources for schools, not only to  implement measures to address physical safety, but also to ensure that  schools have the resources to address the social, emotional, and mental  health needs of students and staff. Our educators have not just been on  the frontlines of the pandemic. Too often--much too often--they are on  the frontlines of the gun violence epidemic. And they are also on the  frontlines of our mental health crisis. Finally, because of this  legislation, some help is on the way.   The gun violence bill we are debating will hopefully prevent some  tragedies going forward. Though we cannot help but celebrate any  progress on gun violence, we should not lose sight of the fact that we  need more comprehensive action than this bill if we are really  committed to preventing gun violence in our Nation.   There is no single law or regulation that we can pass that would have  stopped every single one of these tragedies we have seen over the past  few decades. But in my view, Congress should do more, including  reinstating the assault weapons ban, cracking down on illicit ghost  guns, and, most importantly, eliminating the near total immunity of the  gun industry, which has an unparalleled level of liability protection.   The gunman in Buffalo bought a semiautomatic weapon, but he was able  to ``illegally'' transform it into a fully automatic weapon. If you go  to your cell phone and get YouTube, put in something like ``transform  AR-15 to fully automatic,'' you will have a host of videos. One of them  lasts 1 minute and 38 seconds. Why is this happening? Well, when you  have no liability for the consequences of building a weapon that can be  easily transformed from semi to fully automatic and you can wink-wink  to your potential market and say, ``Yes, this is semiautomatic,'' we  need legislation to get that immunity removed.   Now, I am proud that in the days following the tragedy, my home State  of Rhode Island took the decisive action of banning magazines that hold  more than 10 rounds, raising the minimum age for buying shotguns and  rifles from 18 to 21, and prohibiting loaded rifles and shotguns from  being carried in public. Congress should do the same by passing the  bill before us and then pressing on with additional reforms.   I will vote for this bipartisan bill. It is a significant step, but  it cannot be the last step.                  50th Anniversary of the Pell Grant Program    Madam President, I rise to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the  enactment of the Pell grant, which was named in honor of its author and  my predecessor, Senator Claiborne Pell--I might add, a mentor, a  friend, and a remarkable example to me.   Senator Pell believed in the power of education to transform  individuals, communities, and our Nation. He worked to put the power of  education in the hands of the people.   When Senator Pell introduced the legislation to create what would  become the Pell grant, he said:         There is no greater investment this country can make than       in the education of its youth. Our young people, who are       simultaneously our responsibility, our legacy, and our key to       problem-solving in the future, must be enabled to pass easily       into the realm of postsecondary education, and our       institutions of higher education must be equipped to       accommodate and train them.    His words were prophetic and profound. The Pell grant became the  cornerstone for broadening access to postsecondary education. Because  of the Pell grant, over 80 million students and counting have been able  to attend college. In 1972, before the Pell grant, less than half of  high school graduates immediately enrolled in college. Today, two- thirds make that transition. Since the establishment of the Pell grant,  the percentage of people ages 25 to 30 with a bachelor's degree has  doubled.   Today, the Pell grant supports nearly 7 million students across the  Nation, including nearly 24,000 in Rhode Island. It remains one of the  most effective Federal programs in assisting low-income families, with  most recipients coming from families with annual incomes of $40,000 or  less. It is one of our greatest tools to promote equity and opportunity  in the United States. Yet, despite this success, today we find  ourselves at a crossroads when it comes to fulfilling the promise of  the Pell grant.   We have seen declining enrollment over the past 5 years. Even more  alarming is that the institutions that enroll the lion's share of low- income and first generation college students--our community colleges  and public 4-year colleges--have seen some of the most significant  declines.  [[Page S3119]]    We have seen an explosion of student loan debt, now standing at more  than $1.7 trillion--debt that threatens to foreclose on educational  opportunity for this generation of Americans. We need to correct  course.   We have made a start with the bipartisan, $400 increase to the  maximum Pell grant in the fiscal year 2022 appropriations act, but we  need to do much more. The Pell grant used to cover over three-quarters  of the cost of a public 4-year college. Today, it covers less than a  third.   When I was growing up and later with the passage of the Pell grant,  it was relatively--I wouldn't say easy--but less challenging to go  ahead and work your way through college with a summer job and a Pell  grant, graduating with very little debt and moving on in the community  and this society and this economy. Today, it is much, much more  difficult. So it is time to double the grant.   We also need States and institutions to step up. Affordability is a  shared responsibility. Fifty years ago, Senator Pell led the effort to  ensure costs did not keep talented and committed students from pursuing  a college education. In his farewell speech in the Senate, he called on  us to continue his commitment to educational opportunity. He said:         In education, I want us to be known as the nation that       continually expanded educational opportunities, [the nation]       that brought every child into the education mainstream, and       [the nation] that brought the dream of a college education       within the reach of every student who has the drive, talent,       and desire. We should always remember that public support for       education is the best possible investment we can make in our       Nation's future. It should be accorded the highest priority.    So, as we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Pell grant, it is  time to renew our commitment to college access and affordability. Let's  work together to double the Pell grant, rein in college costs, and  reduce the burden of student loan debt. Let's do our part to realize  Senator Pell's vision for a country that continually expands  opportunity.   One final point: Getting to know Senator Pell, it always impressed me  that, I think, one of the formative periods in his life was the  beginning of World War II. Senator Pell came from an old family.  Pelham, NY, was named after his family. I was once with him when he  informed me that his family once owned Fort Ticonderoga, but then they  donated it to the State of New York.   He could have very easily, in 1941, gotten a promotion, gotten a  rank, and served comfortably in some office. He chose not to.   He enlisted in the Coast Guard as a cook and sailed across the  Atlantic in multiple convoys in dangerous waters. I think there, he  learned the potential of the American people--those other cooks who  would never be able to go to college because they didn't have the  money, but they had talent and, in some cases, more talent perhaps than  the Senator himself. I think that image, that impression, drove him in  many respects to make the Pell grant a reality.   Now, of course, it is quite a tribute to a gentleman who could have  avoided the difficulties and dangers of war and chose, just like other  Americans, to go into the fight. And we have to have that same spirit  as we address the Pell grant.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today I am introducing the Historic  Lighthouse Resiliency Act with Senator King. This legislation would  authorize the Army Corps of Engineers to partner with State, local, and  nonprofit organizations, which own and operate historic light stations,  to improve lighthouse resiliency and ensure continued public access to  these valuable landmarks.   Our Nation's historic lighthouses are important parts of communities  across the country and our maritime history. They serve as beacons of  history, education, recreation, and often are associated with the  unique character and identity of a community. Yet these historic  structures are facing increased risk for catastrophic damage due to sea  level rise, flooding, and aging infrastructure.   Indeed, in my State of Rhode Island, these historic lighthouses are  interwoven in the fabric of our communities and our State's history.  Rhode Island was home to perhaps the most famous lighthouse keeper in  history, Ida Lewis. During her tenure as the Keeper of Lime Rock  Lighthouse, Ida Lewis rescued at least 18 people and earned the title  of ``Bravest Woman in America.'' Beavertail, Watch Hill, and Castle  Hill Lighthouses, just to name a few of the 21 lighthouses remaining in  my State, are iconic structures dotting the Rhode Island shoreline.   These historic landmarks must be protected and preserved for future  generations. This bill would allow the Army Corps of Engineers to  conduct projects that restore damaged lighthouses and increase their  future resiliency to the adverse effects of climate change, including  sea level rise and severe weather events. To conduct repairs and other  improvements, the Army Corps would partner with public or nonprofit  entities that have acquired light stations through conveyance under the  National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act. Additionally, it would  require the Army Corps to conduct an assessment and maintain a database  of all lighthouses nationwide.   Congress has already recognized the importance of preserving these  structures and ensuring public access in the National Historic  Lighthouse Preservation Act of 2000. However, these historic light  stations must not only have the appropriate caretakers but must also  have the appropriate funding to invest in infrastructure needs. Federal  investment in lighthouse resiliency requirements will ensure they are  maintained and accessible for future generations.   I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this commonsense  legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Ms. Warren, Mr.          Blumenthal, Mr. Booker, Mr. Sanders, Ms. Cortez Masto, Mr.          Wyden, Mr. Van Hollen, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Brown, and Mr.          Markey):   S. 4480. A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to  provide increased labor law protections for agricultural workers, and  for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions.
