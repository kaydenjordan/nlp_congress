 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize the  small business, Seasonal Shoppe of Salyersville, KY, as the Senate  Small Business of the Week.   Bekah Frazier Rudd, owner of Seasonal Shoppe, will tell you herself  that retail runs in her blood. Bekah inherited her knack for running a  business from her mother and father, who owned Frazier's Prater Drug  Store, the longest continuously operating business in Salyersville.  Bekah's mother, Patricia Frazier, started off with a little corner in  her husband's store selling arts and crafts items. Throughout the years  in the drug store, the popularity of Patricia's corner eventually led  her to start a business of her own, just a few doors down from her  husband's pharmacy. Thus, Seasonal Shoppe was born and has been  operating since 1997. Eight years later, when Patricia left to take  over Frazier's Prater Drug Store, Bekah stepped in to fill her mother's  shoes as owner and operator of Seasonal Shoppe.   Though Seasonal Shoppe has since shifted towards selling more clothes  and general home goods than arts and  [[Page S1252]]  crafts, little else about the store or its quality of service has  changed. Bekah continues the same friendly atmosphere created by her  mother, by bringing her family around to lend a hand in the store.  Bekah works alongside her sister-in-law, as well two full-time staff  and two local high school students who work part-time for Seasonal  Shoppe. And just how Bekah used to work inside her father's drug store,  her two children are common faces at Seasonal Shoppe, helping out with  merchandise sales and with seasonal events.   Bekah not only perpetuates the same family-friendly atmosphere  created by her mother, she pays mind to the traditions passed down to  her by her father. Mr. Frazier always said that it was their duty as  Main Street mainstays to support the community. Bekah continues this  tradition by sponsoring the local high school sports teams, community  churches, and most recently helping out the local fire department with  their annual fundraiser. This charitable spirit instilled in her by her  parents comes in addition to the good business sense she inherited from  them, and it is this special combination of devotion to the community  and to the livelihood of the store that has kept Seasonal Shoppe  running these past 25 years.   Small businesses like Seasonal Shoppe are the lifeblood of small  towns across Kentucky, and they serve as an inspiring example of how  the entrepreneurial spirit transcends multiple generations. Moreover,  the story of Seasonal Shoppe illustrates that sometimes it takes an  existing business to start a new business, in that Patricia reached her  customer base through her husband's drug store. Seasonal Shoppe and  their role in the Salyersville community demonstrates how small  businesses are an integral part of the daily life of small towns across  the country, and I am thankful for the chance to honor these  entrepreneurs and what they represent.   Congratulations to Bekah and the entire Seasonal Shoppe team. I wish  them the best of luck and look forward to watching their continued  growth and success in Kentucky.                            ____________________
