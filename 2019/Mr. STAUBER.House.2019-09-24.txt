 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Bruce Stender  for his exceptional contributions to the State of Minnesota as an  educator, businessman, and community leader.   From 1975 to 1981, Bruce worked as the first lay President of the  College of St. Scholastica in Duluth, Minnesota. At the time of his  appointment, he was the youngest president of any Catholic college in  the United States.   Following his tenure at St. Scholastica, Bruce joined Labovitz  Enterprises, serving 25 years as president and CEO. His hard work and  success eventually earned him title of Businessperson of the Year in  2005 from the University of Minnesota, Duluth, Labovitz School of  Business and Economics.   Committed to the betterment of his community, Bruce has also served  on a number of healthcare, business, and statewide boards.   Mr. Speaker, this next month, the College of St. Scholastica will  publicly honor Bruce's illustrious career through the naming of the  Stender School of Business and Technology. The naming of this  department after Bruce will ensure generations to come will remember  his service and generosity.   Mr. Speaker, I am happy to see Bruce receive this recognition, and  cannot think of a better way to celebrate his life's work.                            ____________________
