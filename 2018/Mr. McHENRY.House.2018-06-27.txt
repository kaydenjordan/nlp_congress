 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the opioid  crisis that is devastating families and communities all across our  country, including my fair State of North Carolina and my district in  western North Carolina.   Like the rest of the country, North Carolina has not escaped the  opioid epidemic. My State has seen a terrifying rise in the number of  opioid-related deaths. From 1999 to 2016, the number of deaths tied to  opioids grew more than 800 percent.   In 2016 alone, there were are almost 2,000 opioid deaths in North  Carolina. In just one of the counties I represent, Gaston County, the  number of dispensed opioid pills rose to more than 20.5 million pills.  That is in a county of just over 200,000 people. That same county  experienced a thirteenfold jump in heroin deaths, as well.   While I can list facts all day, it is only by talking to the loved  ones who have lost family members due to opioid addiction or those who  have come through addiction and are on the other side that you can  truly understand the devastating effects of this crisis. Take, for  example, one of my constituents, Jennifer Kline.   Jennifer lost her brother, Jake, to opioid addiction. Before Jake  became an addict, Jennifer and her brother shared a very, very close  relationship. But opioid addiction turned him into a person she barely  knew. Even though Jake went to rehab and had a family who supported him  through this whole process throughout his addiction, he still lost the  battle against opioids.   I had the honor of meeting with Jennifer. She helped me and my staff  host a workshop for local law enforcement in my district, where she  shared the heartbreaking story of Jake's addiction. Jake's and her  story is a powerful reminder that we must do more to address this  epidemic. We are not doing enough. The human toll of this crisis is  very, very real, indeed.   Like Jennifer, I have been working hard to help raise awareness in my  district, the 10th District of North Carolina, against the dangers of  opioid addiction. I have been working with local businesses, law  enforcement officials, and other community leaders to combat this  crisis: I have hosted roundtables and helped facilitate discussions  between community leaders on different ways we can work together to  combat this crisis and this epidemic; I have been there as local  municipalities have received funds for tools that enable safe disposal  of unused prescriptions, as well.   Over the past 2 years, there have been dozens of bills passed in the  House that will help people like Jake and provide support for family  members like Jennifer. These bills address this issue from all sides.  Some of these bills help with the prevention of addiction; others  ensure everyone has access to treatment and help facilitate their  recovery; still, others provide important support to communities  affected so that they can have the tools and resources they need to  combat this epidemic.   Last Friday, these bills were passed in the House of Representatives  together in a bill, H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities  Act. It is now headed to the United States Senate and, hopefully, to  the President's desk for signature.   This is an important, holistic step that this Chamber has taken on a  bipartisan basis to help combat the opioid epidemic and help prevent  the tragedy experienced by the Kline family from happening to other  families in this country.   We all have stories. We all have loved ones who have been affected by  this crisis. Congress must do more. We will continue this fight until  we eradicate this epidemic once and for all.
