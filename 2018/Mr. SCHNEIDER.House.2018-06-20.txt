 Mr. Speaker, the Trump administration's abhorrent  immigration policy that is tearing families apart and separating  children from their parents is a shameful betrayal of our values. It  needs to end immediately.   Americans of all political stripes are contacting our office,  heartbroken and outraged by the images and stories of the treatment of  these vulnerable young people by our Nation.   The President and his Attorney General have created this crisis. The  President has the power to immediately stop this cruelty, but so far,  Mr. Speaker, he refuses to do so. That is why today I am proud to join  more than 190 colleagues introducing legislation to stop this inhumane  treatment of children at our border.   The Keep Families Together Act prohibits the Department of Homeland  Security from separating children from their parents, except in  extraordinary circumstances. The bill also limits criminal prosecution  of asylum seekers fleeing persecution, increases child welfare  training, and creates a policy preference for family reunification.   I urge my fellow Members of Congress to join us on this bill. Let's  fix this stain on the character of our Nation and swiftly end this  policy.                            ____________________
