 Mr. Speaker, over the past year, we have  seen a troubling rise in anti-Semitic crimes and activity across the  United States and the world.   In 2019, 229 anti-Semitic hate crimes were reported in New York City.  There was a 46 percent increase in anti-Semitic hate crimes in Chicago.  From January to October, there were 58 reported anti-Semitic crimes in  Los Angeles.   The facts are indisputable. These heinous acts of violence were not  the result of random, isolated incidents. These acts were deliberately  orchestrated with a clear intent to target and harm the Jewish  community.   Attacks of any kind on communities of faith are unacceptable. Simply  broaching the issue of anti-Semitic crime is not enough to protect  these communities. Those responsible for committing these senseless  acts of violence must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.  We must foster engagement between law enforcement and targeted  communities, and we must all work together to confront this issue.                            ____________________
