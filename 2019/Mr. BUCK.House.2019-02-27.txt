 Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the critical role  that brewers and beer importers play in our Nation's economy.   American beverage companies and brewers employ more than 2.2 million  people nationwide, providing more than $103 billion in wages and  benefits. In my home State of Colorado, breweries have become a  significant component of my State's culture and economy.   But in order to compete, American beverage companies and brewers need  a fair and transparent pricing system for aluminum. That is why I along  with my friend, Mr. Lawson from Florida, are introducing legislation  this week giving the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission  oversight authority of the aluminum market. These unfair market  practices have not only cost the beverage and brewing industries  hundreds of millions of dollars, they have also had harmful effects on  consumers.   With the help of the CFTC, I hope we can resolve these pricing  irregularities that have been plaguing the market so our Nation's  beverage companies and brewers can continue to produce some of  America's most popular beverages.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for  yielding to me.   Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose H.R. 8, a bill that criminalizes gun  transfers between law-abiding citizens who have no criminal record and  no criminal intent.   The bill includes several flawed and unworkable exceptions. Take the  law enforcement exception. It allows the police to transfer a firearm,  but criminalizes transfers to law enforcement.   Under this bill, a parent whose child finds a gun in a park commits a  Federal crime if the parent surrenders the gun to police.   Under this bill, a citizen commits a Federal crime if they  participate in a local gun buy-back program.   Under this bill, an attorney commits a Federal crime when they turn a  client's gun over to the police to clear the client through ballistics  testing.   Will criminalizing cooperation with law enforcement make us safer?  The majority apparently thinks so, and I think it is crazy.   The Democrats' bill gives special privileges to the bodyguards of the  wealthy elite, like former Mayor Bloomberg, who is funding the special  interest advocacy for this bill. He can afford to hire bodyguards. But  average Americans, who rely on the Second Amendment as their source of  personal protection, are not given similar protections.   Nothing should be more offensive to this body than a bill that denies  citizens their endowed rights while giving wealthy elites special  protections, privileges, and dispensations. But that is H.R. 8.   Take the family exception; the rule allows a vote on an amendment to  ensure that transfers between parent and child include stepparents and  stepchildren. What about transfers between a foster parent and foster  child? This bill says foster relationships are not worthy of the same  respect and equal treatment. Every Member of this body should be  ashamed to vote for this bill that reflects such terrible policy and  discrimination.   Take the Good Samaritan exception, allowing transfers where a threat  of death or harm is imminent. Imminent means death is menacingly near,  a standard so strict that it is, frankly, too late to transfer a gun  once it is obvious a gun is needed for protection.   Under this standard, it is illegal to loan a gun to a victim of  domestic violence for her protection until the transferor is  practically witnessing a murder in progress.   This standard would also prevent a gun owner who has intermittent  suicidal thoughts, a known side-effect of certain prescription  medications, from legally transferring a gun--his own gun--to a friend  for safekeeping.   Because this bill criminalizes transfers between law-abiding  Americans, while doing nothing to curb criminals' access to guns, this  bill provides the American public with a false sense of security.   Because this bill includes unworkable exceptions that will mislead  people  [[Page H2246]]  into thinking a gun transfer is legal when it is not, this bill  provides law-abiding gun owners with a false sense of immunity.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote on this totally and completely  unconstitutional legislation that would deprive people of their  constitutional rights to keep and bear arms.
