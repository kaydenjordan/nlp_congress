 Madam Speaker, I rise today to put a spotlight on rural  America and urge Congress to pass my bill, the Rebuild Rural America  Act.   Rural America is being left behind. In my district, the eighth most  rural in the country, we are still fighting for broadband access and  consistent cell service.   With so much of the private market focusing on population density in  order to achieve high returns on capital investment, many of our less  populated communities are left to their own devices.   Here, at the Federal level, where the public good is contemplated, we  must ensure that no community is boxed out of the future. That is why I  introduced the Rebuild Rural America Act, which creates the rural  future partnership fund and provides $50 billion for noncompetitive, 5- year, renewable block grants to certified rural regions to implement  locally developed revitalization plans.   This bill helps communities that don't have the resources to navigate  the complex Federal grants process to secure Federal funding for  important projects, and it would move the Federal Government away from  being complicated, siloed, and top-down into a more responsive and  effective partner for our rural communities.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass the Rebuild Rural America  Act.                            ____________________
