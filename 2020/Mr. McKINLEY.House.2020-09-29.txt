 Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Davis for yielding.   I rise tonight to honor my friend,   John Shimkus. Ten years ago,  John took me under his wing and was my mentor to get started in this,  and I can't tell you how much I have learned from being around John.   Now, in Scotland, ``McKinley'' means ``stubborn'' in Gaelic.   I have wondered, what does ``Shimkus'' mean in Lithuanian? Now, I  have got to think, the only thing I can think of, trying to shake this  out, is it must mean ``persistence,'' because I have never met a person  as persistent as   John Shimkus. He personifies the trait.   Think about what he has done in his 24 years here in Congress. Just  most recently, his relentless focus in leading on the Brownfields  legislation, or the fly ash legislation, or his love of TSCA.   So, John, you have made a difference. You have impacted many of us in  our careers. You will never know how many lives you have touched and  the hundreds of thousands of jobs that through your legislation you  have helped create in America. I think we all owe you a debt of  gratitude for that.   So thank you for being a friend, thank you for being a great  American.   Thank you, Karen, for sharing him with us.   It has been an honor to work with you, and I wish you the best in the  years to come.   God bless you.
