 Mr. Speaker, I am here to support House Resolution 480  that allows for consideration of the Veterans Choice Act.   For a while there, I was confused. I wasn't sure what we were talking  about there. I thought we were here talking about the Veterans Choice  Act.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support the Veterans Choice Act. Our  veterans selflessly answer the call to protect our families, our  communities, and all that we hold dear. We can never repay our veterans  for that sacrifice. But our country, this government, made our veterans  a promise to care for them. Mr. Speaker, if we do not act today, we  will breach that promise by denying healthcare benefits to those  veterans who access it through the Choice Program.   This bill will provide $2 billion for the Choice Program. Without  this step, the Choice fund will be depleted by mid-August. VA Secretary  Shulkin has made it clear that community programs are unable to care  for veterans who need them if the Choice Program is eliminated.   Sometimes it astonishes me how it is that we wait until the last  minute here to address problems like this.   Millions of America's veterans rely on the Choice Program. That is  millions of promises we break if we fail to pass this legislation  today. We cannot allow these funds to run out and leave our veterans  without access to care.   Contrary to critics, today's debate is not about whether to privatize  the VA. Secretary Shulkin has openly said numerous times that he has no  plans to privatize the Veterans Administration.   Beyond that, today's debate is about people. It is about veterans who  already use the Choice Program who would lose access to care if we do  not pass this legislation. It is about allowing veterans choice.                                time  0930    Let's not play politics with our veterans. Over the course of the  week, the VA Choice and Quality Employment Act has been improved with  amendments. It would improve the hiring at the VA by enhancing  recruitment, retention, and training of the VA workforce, but to those  who continue to have concerns about veterans' choice, I ask we not let  perfect be the enemy of good.   I have learned in life nothing is ever perfect. Lord knows I have  learned that in business. I have certainly found that to be true about  legislation during my short time here in Congress.   Mr. Speaker, the clock is ticking. We must not allow it to run out  and default on the promises we made to veterans. We need to act today.
