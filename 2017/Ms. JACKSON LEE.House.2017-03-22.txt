 Mr. Speaker, this morning I came in contact with two  mothers of two young boys who are homebound with catastrophic  illnesses. My heart broke as I listened to them say: The only way that  I survive to see their happy face and I can work is because they have  insurance through extensive Medicaid.   And so I come today to ask my friends on the other side of the aisle  not to worry about threats about losing your office or your job. This  is about patriotism and being an American. Vote against this horrible  TrumpCare debacle that will create higher cost, less coverage, and an  age tax that will hurt the old and devastate the young.   This is a time for the flag to be waved and for patriots to stand and  to be heard across America. Vote down TrumpCare not for self and  selfishness, but really to be able to stand with those who cannot help  themselves.   I wanted to embrace those mothers as a mother, as a grandmother,  because we are giving life to those beautiful children, now 9 and 10,  living because they got health care under the Affordable Care Act.  Stand as a patriot against TrumpCare.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the House  Committee on Homeland Security I rise in support of H.R. 1302,  Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel Exercise Act of 2017 to require an  exercise to terrorist and foreign fighter travel.   This bipartisan bill would expand the scope of the Federal Emergency  Management Agency's National Exercise Program by requiring additional  scenarios to address emerging terrorist threats.   Among the scenarios to be included are those involving U.S. citizens  enlisting with or providing support to terrorists organizations abroad,  as well as terrorist infiltration in the United States.   A nationwide exercise would be held within a year of enactment to  evaluate the threat of individuals traveling from the United States to  join a terrorist organization.   The exercise would also test scenarios involving terrorist  infiltration into the U.S. by United States citizens and foreign  nationals.   DHS would coordinate with other federal departments, foreign  governments, state and local governments, and the private sector to  conduct the exercise.   The growing complexity of the threat may be creating unseen gaps in  our defenses, yet it has been years since any large-scale ``stress  test'' has been conducted against terrorist travel.   Federal officials suspect that Todd Wolfe, an American citizen from  Texas, planned to fly his family to Europe where he would meet up with  an ISIS handler and take them all to Syria.   In March of 2014, Hanad Abdullahi Mohallim, an American from  Minnesota, entered Syria at Tel Abyad and recruited other fellow  Somali-Americans in Minnesota to leave the United States and join ISIS.   Also in 2014, Abdi Nur left the U.S. for Syria to join ISIS. He was  later reported to have attempted to recruit other men here in the U.S.  to join the terrorist organization.   We need to be gravely concerned about Americans leaving the country  to train overseas with terrorist organizations who then return to the  United States as foreign fighters.   I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1302.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1238,  ``Securing Our Agriculture and Food Act.''   This bipartisan bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to make  the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security for Health Affairs  responsible for coordinating the efforts for the DHS related to food,  agriculture, and veterinary defense against terrorism.   The coordination program under the measure would include:   1. Overseeing and managing DHS's responsibilities under the  presidential directive;   2. Integrating activities related to veterinary public health, food  and agriculture security;   3. Leading the department's policy initiatives relating to food,  animal, and agriculture incidents, as well as domestic preparedness for  and collective response to agricultural terrorism; and   4. Coordinating with other parts of the federal government.   Agro-terrorism is defined as the deliberate introduction of an animal  or plant disease for the purpose of generating fear, causing economic  losses, or undermining social stability.   Killing livestock and plants or contaminating food can help  terrorists cause economic crises in the agriculture and food  industries.   Agriculture comprises the largest single sector in U.S. economy,  making agro-terrorism an attractive opportunity for many terrorist  organizations.   Attacks directed against the cattle, pork, or poultry industries or  via the food chain pose the most serious danger for latent, ongoing  effects and general socioeconomic and political disruption.   Food availability becomes a matter of immediate life and death in  such circumstances, and significant national and global resources need  to be dedicated to emergency relief efforts.   Any attacks of agro-terrorism would be particularly devastating for  the citizens of Texas.   In Texas, the largest source of agricultural revenue comes from the  sale of beef cattle.   Texas produces roughly 20 percent of the nation's cattle and ranks  first in the country in the value of cattle raised.   It is crucial that we have preparedness policies in place to quickly  respond to events  [[Page H2307]]  threatening U.S. agriculture or food production systems.   I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1238.    Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland  Security Committee, I rise in support of H.R. 1365, the ``Department of  Homeland Security Acquisition Innovation Act'' which authorizes the DHS  to expand the use of acquisition innovation.   This bipartisan bill will guarantee new acquisition methods and  practices are considered to ensure taxpayers get the most for their  money.   This bill would permit DHS's undersecretary for management to:   1. Designate an official to manage acquisition innovation;   2. Test and develop best practices that are consistent with  acquisition rules and directives;   3. Measure how innovation in acquisition processes have affected  cost, operational efficiency, the timeframe for executing contracts,  and collaboration with small businesses and other private-sector  companies; and   4. Obtain and incorporate feedback from the private sector.   From fiscal 2018 through 2022, DHS would provide Congress with  information on acquisition innovation activities during the previous  fiscal year, including:   1. Best practices that were tested, used and distributed, including  through web-based seminars, trainings and forums;   2. Effects on the private sector, including small businesses;   3. Criteria to indemnify acquisition programs that would be  appropriate for innovation; and   4. Recommendations for enhancing innovation at DHS.   Innovation is the American way and this bill makes sure the  Department of Homeland Security finds new ways to do its job  effectively and efficiently.   At the Tenth Annual Border Security Expo in Texas, officials from the  Department of Homeland Security observed some of the latest innovations  that can help to protect our border. This included 3D holographic  images, portable biometric testing kits, and underground seismic signal  detectors.   In Texas, U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents deter, detect,  and interdict smuggling along the Texas/Mexico border through the  deployment of an integrated network of detection and communication  technologies.   In 2016, the Texas of Department of Public Safety provided direct  assistance to U.S. Customs and Border Protection in the arrest of over  37,000 criminals deemed a high threat risk.   Frontline personnel securing our borders, protecting our airports,  and defending our shores must have the tools to successfully accomplish  their mission.   I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1365.    Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to join the  Congressional Progressive Caucus, on which I serve as a vice chair. I  remember this experience less than a decade ago when we worked so hard  to have the Affordable Care Act.   For many, you are seeing this poster for the first time. I think I  need to give you a little journey down memory lane as we talk about why  we are so vigorously opposing what would seem to be new and fresh  ideas.   First of all, let me say the good thing about the Affordable Care Act  is that it is not a respecter of economic standing as relates to the  benefits of health insurance. We were able to grant every American the  right to have insurance that did not penalize you for being a woman,  penalize you for having a preexisting condition. In fact, it did lower  premiums.   We realize that in certain areas that is one of the beginning aspects  of a bill that is only 7 years old, but one of the important points is  that we have given you insurance that has more benefits than it ever  had 10 years ago, 15 years ago. More importantly, working people who  happen to be of low income and who are no less able or dignified or  equal in this Nation now have insurance.   It is insurance. The underpinning of it is Medicaid, but it is  insurance. It allows families, pregnant women, and children to have  insurance, people who are working. Then, on the other side, it has help  for the blind, the disabled, as well for those in nursing homes.  Remember, people in nursing homes have worked. We give them the ability  to live in dignity.   Unfortunately, to the contrary, what I am seeing now, just coming out  of the Cloakroom, is a hustle and bustle of negotiations and meetings,  going in and out of meetings, going to the White House, trying to  corral these last votes. Some of these individuals want it to be made  worse, and they are holding their ground.   But I tell you what is missing in all of this. What is missing is  that what we did almost 10 years ago was have hundreds, maybe  thousands, of hearings or townhall meetings in our districts. We had 79  bipartisan hearings in the House, 453 hearings in the Senate. In the  House, we had over 181 witnesses  [[Page H2338]]  and 239 considered amendments. We believed in listening to the American  people, many of whom did not understand, but we wanted to get it out.   In the dark of night, this bill has come. There are amendments coming  by the day. I will be leaving here and going to the Rules Committee to  try to understand what is in the bill.   To the American people, what you can clearly see that is in the bill  right now is that we are paying more for less. You are getting $880  billion taken out of the Medicaid that is used to keep people whole  after they have worked--those in nursing homes, the blind, the  disabled, or other things that may have occurred--as well as those who  are taking care of children and who are pregnant women. Twenty-four  million will lose their insurance right now, today, as that bill is  passed. Overall, in 2026, 52 million Americans will be uninsured. You  can't be plainer than that.   Then what saddens me the most, besides the $880 billion coming out of  your insurance, they give a $600 billion tax cut to 1 percent of the  richest Americans, whom I would venture to say, getting $57,000 per  family, they would say to you: Take it back and help all of America.   The age tax, if you are 50 to 64, you are paying a penalty--not 85,  but 50 to 64. They can't get rid of that. How are you going to pass a  bill that penalizes?   I have indicated about $880 billion for Medicaid. Then, of course,  the tax relief for people who do not want it.   I say that your patriotism today is letting this see the light of  day. Let's debate it and discuss it. Let's talk to States like Kentucky  and West Virginia and those States that have taken expanded Medicaid.  Let's talk to families, like I have just done today, with children who  are only being taken care of with their catastrophic illnesses, with  smiles on their face, and homebound, because they have Medicaid as  their insurance.   That is why we oppose the TrumpCare bill. No matter how many backdoor  meetings President 45 can take care of--I wish, maybe, it started  earlier, before he attacked President Obama. But, in any event, with  all of these meetings, we are still at a point where we don't know what  the bill is doing for people that is good, but we do know what it is  taking away from people. I just ask that we stop and do this right to  save lives.   I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership.
