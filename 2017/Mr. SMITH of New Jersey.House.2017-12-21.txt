 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for  yielding time to me and for his tremendous bill. It is a great  bipartisan piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, after Superstorm Sandy, I and others saw how leaders and  volunteers of churches, synagogues, and other religious centers helped  feed, clothe, and shelter tens of thousands of victims, yet they were  left out and left behind when it came to repairs of their own  facilities.   The FEMA policy was and is unfair, unjustified, and discriminatory.  Over 4 years ago, the House came together in the wake of Superstorm  Sandy and passed legislation that I authored by 354-72. Surprise,  surprise, the Senate never acted, so the policy continues to this day.   I want to thank the chairman for including a provision in this bill  that will ensure that houses of worship, churches, and synagogues get  the kind of help they need on an equal basis with other nonprofits. I  also want to thank him for including language that will get rid of this  misnamed duplication of benefits clause.   Imagine this: men and women who are victimized by Superstorm Sandy or  any other storm, they go to FEMA, they are advised to take out an SBA  loan, then a little later in the recovery time, they are told that  there is a HUD grant available, and they are precluded from getting  that grant to even pay off the SBA loan.
