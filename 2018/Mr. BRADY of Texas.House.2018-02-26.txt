 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Mitchell and  Congresswoman Mimi Walters for arranging this Special Order to  highlight the benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. I am excited to be  joined by our Texas colleagues.   Texas is a big winner, like many States, because of the Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act. They estimate it will create 81,000 new, good-paying jobs in  our State alone. But that is not just our State. You see huge job gains  in California, New York, throughout the Southern States, throughout our  Midwest area, and throughout our manufacturing regions.   This historic tax reform is making a real difference for our families  and our workers. We all know about tax relief for our small businesses,  the first ever 20 percent small business deduction in history. The bill  will be a write-off on day one in new investment in plants, equipment,  software, and technology.   People know that we made our companies more competitive so they can  compete and win all around the world, especially here at home.   I get excited about what we did for families, lowering the tax rates  at every level. So whether you made $20,000 or $520,000, you keep more  of what you earn. We doubled the standard deduction so few people have  to itemize. We doubled the child credit and quadrupled how many  Americans can actually use it. For the first time, all middle class  Americans are going to get help raising children. We are doing away  with the AMT except for households up to $1 million. What that means  next year is, instead of 5 million Americans getting caught up with  that double tax, it is about 200,000, a fraction of what it is today.    What I really love are the stories. I was in Home Depot the other  day, on Sunday. Apparently, we are redoing our bathroom. So my wife was  looking at samples, and a woman came up and introduced herself. Her  name is Pam. She is a small-business person. She redoes furniture,  repaints, and all that, but she works at Home Depot to make ends meet.  She introduced herself and said:         Thank you. I get $184 more every paycheck. Maybe that       couple thousand dollars doesn't mean much in Washington, but       for my family, it really means a lot. Thank you for that.    Donald from Willis, Texas, saw the benefits of this law in his pay  stub. He said:         My Federal tax deducted from my paycheck went from 12 to 9       percent. Yes, I am very happy.    Mr. Speaker, because of tax reform, Texans are excited for a strong  and growing economy.   Larry from Spring, Texas, said:         As a 78-year-old retiree working part time, even a small       difference in take-home pay is  [[Page H1258]]       welcome. I am delighted to see the spur to overall economic       activity that should benefit all, locally and nationally.                                time  2045    Every day, I hear stories like this: people receiving raises and  bigger benefits at work. And we did, simply, the Code. As Congressman  Mitchell pointed out, under the new Tax Code, next year, nearly 90  percent of Americans will be able to file their taxes using a simple  postcard-style system. That is fairness. That is growth. That is  increasing jobs and paychecks.   I want to thank my colleagues from Texas joining us here tonight for  their critical role in passing this historic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  Without this support, it wouldn't have happened.   I also thank Congressman Mitchell and Congresswoman Walters for  arranging this Special Order and continuing, as they did during the  debates, informing people of the tax reform plan. I thank them for  playing such a leadership role.
