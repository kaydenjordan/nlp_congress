 Mr. Speaker, as the people of New Mexico and the world  are grieving Governor Richardson, I rise today here in the House, where  he served, to honor his life and legacy.   Governor Richardson has left an indelible mark on New Mexico politics  and public service. Throughout his career as a Governor, Member of  Congress, U.N. Ambassador, Secretary of Energy, and working in  international diplomacy, anyone who knew Governor Richardson knows that  he lived big, he laughed big, and he loved big.   He mentored a generation of leaders in New Mexico and served our  great State and Nation to the very end. I personally met Governor  Richardson as a young person when he was my Congressman and, like so  many others, was catalyzed onto a path of public service on behalf of  our State and our communities.   Governor Richardson's loss will be felt deeply across our State and  across the planet, and today, my prayers go to his family and to  everyone in New Mexico who is remembering and grieving his loss and the  loss of this giant in New Mexico politics.   Rest in peace, Governor. Today, we honor your legacy here in your  home in the U.S. House of Representatives.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition today to this rule.  What we should be focusing on is actually funding the government, which  is our constitutional duty. Instead, we are here debating a ridiculous  rule on the eve of a Republican shutdown manufactured by extremists in  the GOP. I remind everyone that the last time the government was shut  down, it cost the American people $11 billion.   Now, the very same people who tried to tank our economy just months  ago over the debt ceiling are threatening a government shutdown that  would cost our country billions of dollars and threaten the economies,  the livelihoods, and the people of my State, in New Mexico, with far- reaching consequences.   Mr. Speaker, thousands of New Mexicans, Federal employees, Active- Duty military, and others would go unpaid, and it is shameful. I urge  my colleagues to oppose this rule.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the amazing Mr. Ian Fluellen, a  dedicated member of my team over the last 2 years.   Since June of 2021, Ian has fiercely and loyally served the people of  New Mexico's First Congressional District. He has served as a dedicated  legislative staffer for nearly a decade, serving in the offices of  Congressmen   Jim Costa, G.K. Butterfield, Mark DeSaulnier, and myself.   He was raised in Las Vegas and received his bachelor's degree in  political science and government at the University of Nevada, Reno. His  love for government and making the world a better place is what  propelled him into a career in public service.   During Ian's time in my office, he has proven to be a talented,  brilliant, and truly extraordinary staffer. He has been instrumental in  guiding my office, leading our legislative team, serving the  constituents of our State, managing our D.C. office, mentoring young  staffers, and helping them to thrive.    Mr. Speaker, on behalf of New Mexico's First  Congressional District, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring and  thanking Ian for his nearly 9 years of service on Capitol Hill.   His quick wit and constant support will be missed every single day in  our office. I wish him all the best. We will miss him very much.
