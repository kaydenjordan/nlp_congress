 Person Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry.    This rule provides for debate on H.R. 3110,  which, as you know, is entitled the PUMP For Nursing Mothers Act, and I  am very concerned this majority doesn't seem to be concerned about the  men around the country who identify as nursing mothers.   Does not the title of this act violate the rules of this 117th  Congress because it recognizes distinction between men and women in  biological terms? Would not this act be required to be called the pump  for nursing persons act or the pump for nursing birthing persons act? I  am very concerned that we are not concerned about the men around the  [[Page H5618]]  country who identify as nursing mothers and how we would allow a debate  on this bill or this act as presented.    Well, I am just very concerned that we would  have this kind of debate that is inconsistent with the apparent rules  of the 117th House, and Person Speaker, I just don't think it should be  permitted that we would have this kind of debate.
