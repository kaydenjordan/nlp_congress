 Mr. Speaker, Tuesday was a media alarm.  The biased Washington Post reported accidentally in The State newspaper  that ``Joe Biden's free spending could ignite inflation that would  outstrip wage gains.'' The President's $6 trillion spending spree of  borrowing and taxing will burden the youth of America with debt and  threaten the savings of older Americans with a worthless dollar.   Already, The Post and Courier of Charleston reprinted how lumber  costs in the average house have skyrocketed $36,000 this year,  undermining homeownership. The Wall Street Journal revealed used cars  have hit a record of over $25,000 which denies many the ability to  purchase a car.   The New York Stock Exchange suffered a staggering loss of nearly 500  points as inflation was clearly being pushed by the outrageous spending  schemes of President Biden destroying jobs.   I appreciate the courageous leaders, like Ambassador Nikki Haley, who  are standing up for America. She has sent me a symbol of the  consequence of borrowing and taxing which we see in Venezuela: the 100  Bolivar note which is now worth less than a dime.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
