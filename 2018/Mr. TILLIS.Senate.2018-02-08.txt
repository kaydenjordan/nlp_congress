 Mr. President, I was talking with the pages earlier  asking if they knew what was going on. I am not sure if people watching  the debate know what is going on. Let's talk about the mechanics of  what is happening right now.   We have a measure before the Senate right now that cures at 1 a.m.  tonight. At 1 a.m. tonight, we are going to vote on something we could  vote on right now. The outcome is going to be something my friend from  Kentucky will oppose, but it is going to happen because the majority of  Republicans believe that funding the government is a pretty important  thing to do.   I am in a club. I am in a club that says we need to keep the  government open. I am in a club that says we don't need to be telling  people they are going to be furloughed tomorrow when we know darn well  that at 1 a.m. tonight, we will be back open for business. I am in a  club that tells everybody we obligated ourselves to pay our bills, and  we are going to pay our bills.   I don't like this. I served as speaker of the house for 4 years. We  paid our bills on time and got our budgets done on time. We had regular  order. I agree with all that stuff.   Right now, we are in a position to where this is very simple. We can,  right now, provide certainty to the thousands of people who expect the  government to be open or we can play this game until 1 a.m. I, for one,  think we should do it right now. If we want to go through the theater,  and we want to go until 1 a.m., that is going to be the end result.   Employees out there, I apologize on behalf of people who can't give  you certainty right now at 9 p.m. At 1 a.m., you will have it. I am  sorry we have to go through this process. We seem to go through it far  too often.   I will also tell you something else I have to speak briefly on, and I  am going to offer a motion.   This whole idea about this concept of let's just withdraw from  Afghanistan--I have been to Baghdad. I have been to the Kurdish region  in Iraq, and I have been to Afghanistan. I have heard people in Iraq  say the worst thing we did was a precipitous withdrawal from Iraq. We  can debate whether we should have gone in there, but we are in there,  and now we have to figure out a way to exit that doesn't put Iraqis at  risk and American men and women who are serving this country. You don't  do it through a precipitous withdrawal. It is irresponsible, and I will  guarantee you, there is not a single person in uniform who would agree  with you that is the  [[Page S832]]  right way to protect our troops and protect the people of Afghanistan  and the many allies we have there trying to take the fight to the  Taliban and al-Qaida. It is irresponsible. So I am a member of that  club.   I am a member of a club that says when the United States said we are  going to protect a country and try to get it on the right path, we stay  there until we get it done and do everything we can while there to keep  our men and women safe. If that is the wrong club to be in, so be it. I  happen to think it is the club that every single one of us should be  in.   This is not the sort of discussion we should be having tonight.  Tonight is about funding the government. Tonight is about actually  having a great discussion about regular order, getting appropriations  bills on the floor, having a debate like we are going to have on  immigration next week--but now is not the time to have this discussion.   We have to decide, what do you want to be as a Senator? Do you want  to be a Senator who wants to make a point or do you want to make a  difference? Do you know what? I don't see how points alone make a  change in America. What makes a change in America is when we ratify a  bill or get a bill out of here, we send it to the President, and it  becomes law. If all we do is a speech on the floor, and it doesn't  produce an outcome, time after time, then you may want to rethink how  you are trying to get your point across.   What happens when you don't produce an outcome here? You haven't  convinced 50 or 51 Senators your idea is good enough to support. Go to  work. Build a coalition. Make a difference. You can make a point all  you want. Points are forgotten. There are not a whole lot of history  books about the great points of the American Senate. There are history  books about the great results of the American Senate--the great bills,  like the tax reform bill, and the other things we have done in this  session but not points.   People aren't here to talk about a good point. They are here to talk  about a good outcome. How do good outcomes happen? When we take votes  like the vote we should be taking at 9 p.m. tonight. We may take it at  1 a.m. I am a night person. I am all right with that, but we should be  taking it now.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule  XXII, at 9 p.m. today, the Senate vote on the motion to invoke cloture  on the motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment  to H.R. 1892 with a further amendment; further, that if cloture is  invoked, all postcloture time be yielded back and the Senate vote on  the motion to concur.    Mr. President, regular order.    Mr. President, again, I have the motion before us. I  believe the Senator from Kentucky did object to the motion.   Just one brief comment. And I thank the Senator from Louisiana for  presiding. I know I was supposed to be in the chair 30 minutes ago, and  I will be there in a couple of minutes.   I also wanted to take a moment to talk about the great opportunity we  have next week to pass immigration reform, the great opportunity that  we have to fulfill the promise to the DACA population of some 1.8  million that the President has proposed to provide a path to  citizenship. It is a proposal that has $25 billion allocated over 10  years, with maybe $2.5 billion to $5 billion appropriated in the bill  that we will take up or in various amendments that we will take up next  week.   The first pillar is DACA, and we have satisfied that, and I believe  we have broad consensus. There may be a few things around the edges,  but we are pretty close to done.   On border security, we are done because the President himself has  said it is not a monolithic wall over 2,300 miles. It is not even a  wall over half that territory. It is about maybe 1,000 miles. And 1,000  miles of wall includes some walls that are secondary. So when you see a  mile-long wall, it is actually two walls because there is a secondary  barrier.   We are also talking about technology and infrastructure so that we  can start working on the opioid epidemic. Tons and tons, millions of  doses of heroin, fentanyl, and other drugs come across our border every  month. By implementing border security--a lot of people think this is  just about preventing people from crossing the border. This is about  securing our Nation. Fortunately, many of my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle recognize that.   Some think that the proposal--many of them; I don't know that all of  them do--many of them believe the Department of Homeland Security and  the Border Patrol have put together a great strategy that makes sense.  I have always said--I got criticized last year--I said there is no way  we are going to build a wall. We don't need a wall across all 2,300  miles, but we need security. We need it so that we know what is coming  into this country, whether they are people crossing the border  illegally or whether they are pumping hundreds and hundreds and  millions of doses of poison into the thousands of people who die every  year from opioids. In my State of North Carolina, more people die from  opioid overdoses every year than interstate accidents--over 1,400.   So I am glad to know that pillar one--a path to citizenship for some  1.8 million DACA recipients--has an opportunity to become law, to make  that difference I was talking about, and then $25 billion to secure the  border.   Now we are having a great discussion about what is called the  diversity lottery. It involves about 50,000 visas every year that are  allocated in a random way today that makes no sense. We want to do it  in a way that actually makes sure that underrepresented countries have  an opportunity to come here, maybe some 15,000 a year, many from Sub- Saharan Africa, and the other ones can be used to draw down a backlog  of people who have been trying to get to this country for as long as 17  years.   We talk about how we want more people immigrating, but the reality  is, if you get in line today through the legal process, it can take you  10 to 17 years to get through the process. We are trying to figure out  a way, through that allocation of the diversity lottery, to make that  half the time. So we can clear out the queue for people waiting for 17  years, and others in the queue will never have to wait that long--about  9 years in total. I think we are making great progress.   The last thing we have to work on is chain migration or family  reunification. Today, about 72 percent of the 1 million to 1.1 million  people who come to this country every year are through what they call a  family petition. So there are people who may have some  [[Page S833]]  relationship here--it could be a brother, a sister, a mother, or a  father. That is important to do, but it is also important for us to  take a look at what our economy needs, what America needs, to make sure  we have the resources and the people who best provide a great platform  for the Americans whom we have to fight for--for all of the Americans  whom we have to fight hard for in this country.    So there would be simple provisions, such as if you have an advanced  degree--maybe we should allocate some of what is going into purely  family reunification into getting engineers, doctors, scientists,  highly educated people who want to come to live in this country.   At the other end of the spectrum, we need people of various skills,  with a community college certification, maybe--a welder, a technical  drawer. There are a number of things you can get at a community  college. I know this because I went to a community college--actually  two of them. There are a number of skills that you get over 2 years  that you may have gained in a foreign country, or you may want to come  here and complete the degree and then stay here.   That is all we are talking about in terms of adding a merit component  to what right now is purely random or purely family-based immigration.  I think there is a way to bridge that gap. I know people are kind of  drawing their swords on certain issues, but let's look at what we are  trying to do: No. 1, promote immigration to this country; and No. 2,  make sure that it is very much focused on the kinds of needs we have in  this Nation to help the economy grow.   By the way, if the economy is growing, there is going to be a lot of  resources and people to support that growing economy. So I think that  at the end of the day, if we do this, it could have the effect of  actually promoting a case for more legal immigration over time.   I want to thank Senator Durbin and Senator Graham and a number of  people who have spent years trying to solve this problem. By the same  token, I would tell them, you have spent years trying to solve the  problem with a single solution, and it hasn't worked. It hasn't worked  in a Republican administration, and it didn't worked when President  Obama was in power. It didn't even work when you didn't need a single  Republican to vote for comprehensive immigration reform.   There was a time here--because no Republican voted for ObamaCare, so  there was clearly a time here that the table should have been set for  whatever immigration solution you wanted, in the same way the table was  set for whatever healthcare solution President Obama wanted. I don't  begrudge him for taking advantage of the opportunity, whether or not I  disagree with the policy. But it is very telling, if that solution,  which started back in 2001, couldn't make it through a sympathetic  Republican President's administration, if that legislation couldn't  make it through after 2008, with President Obama's clearly sympathetic  administration, why on Earth would we simply propose the same thing  that has failed for 17 years when we are so close to coming up with  something that is balanced and compassionate?   I have had all kinds of people mad at me because I support a path to  immigration for 1.8 million people. I wear that as a badge of honor  because it is the right thing to do. It is also the right thing to do  to secure the border, to fix the visa lottery, and to work on migration  here that still maintains roughly the same numbers but does it in a  responsible way that also protects the interests of the American  people, the people who are here today, and creates a better environment  for the people who want to move here tomorrow.   I thank the Presiding Officer for standing in my place for a moment.   I will yield the floor and come to the Chair.   (Mr. TILLIS assumed the Chair.)    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, at 9:30 p.m. today, the Senate vote on the  motion to invoke cloture on the motion to concur in the House amendment  to the Senate amendment to H.R. 1892 with a further amendment; further,  that if cloture is invoked, all postcloture time be yielded back and  the Senate vote on the motion to concur.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H. Con. Res. 102, which was  received from the House.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  concurrent resolution be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  recess until 12:01 a.m. on Friday, February 9.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 10:54 p.m., recessed until  Friday, February 9, 2018, at 12:01 a.m.                            ____________________
