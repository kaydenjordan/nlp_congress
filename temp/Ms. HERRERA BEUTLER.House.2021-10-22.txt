 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of our  bipartisan bill, the PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act.   Honestly, the whole goal of this legislation is to protect a nursing  mother's ability to provide for her infant by pumping at work.   And let me be clear, this is a business-friendly bill. This is  current law. For those who are thinking we are shaking the Earth and  doing something brand-new, it actually is current law. There were  problems with the way the current law was written; it was actually put  in the wrong place in code, and we are fixing that.   So the way it is currently, you could be a mom who gets into working  and  [[Page H5802]]  you have worked your way up into a career where you are salaried and  you make a decent amount of money, but you were excluded from this  legislation. You didn't have the right to expect this, even though  other workers did.   We are simply making some of those changes to make sure that folks  who were not eligible for overtime, like that working mom, would be  covered under current law.   This bill gives businesses clarity and predictability and allows  small businesses to claim undue hardship exemptions in recognition of  the unique challenges that they face.   Making sure our economy works is a huge priority to me, but we have  to also recognize that working moms make up a significant portion--and  should--of the workforce, and it is going to grow.   I thank my colleagues for improving this bill to reflect its original  intent with regard to businesses, namely, differentiating between large  corporations and mom-and-pop operations.   As a mom of three young kids myself, I understand finding the balance  of raising kids, going to work, and just simply finding a place to pump  while working.   My first child was a 28-week preemie. It was imperative for her to  have breast milk; we were told this by her doctors. She could not  handle formula, and they said it is imperative that you do what you can  to breastfeed her. And I joke I am going to write a book called, Oh,  the places I have pumped. I have pumped in trains, on planes, in  automobiles, in some poor low-ranking officer's office at the Pentagon,  at a kibbutz in Israel on a codel; I mean, everywhere. And I can tell  you, there are places that are clean and helpful, and it doesn't have  to be like the Taj Mahal; you just need something that is not crammed  in a public toilet where people are flushing over you.   So on a really serious note, this is a critical piece of legislation  that is going to empower women in the workforce to continue to provide  for their families.   Imagine a single mother not having that choice, she has to work, and  maybe she wants to provide breast milk for her child or maybe she has  to in a circumstance like mine. Making sure that mothers of infants and  toddlers can continue to do this in the workforce and continue to join  the workforce is absolutely vital.   With women making up over half of our Nation's workforce, it is  crucial that moms aren't forced to choose between going to their job or  breastfeeding their child.   With the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's endorsement of this legislation,  this bill seeks to help, not hinder, an employer's ability to provide a  safe space for moms to pump.   I am proud to help lead this bipartisan legislation with my  colleague, Congresswoman Maloney, so moms in southwest Washington and  across this country can feel secure.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record letters  of support from the United States Chamber of Commerce and the National  Retail Federation.                                                 Chamber of Commerce                                                             of the                                        United States of America,                                 Washington, DC, September 28, 2021.        To the Members of the U.S. House of Representative: The       U.S. Chamber of Commerce strongly supports H.R. 3110, the       Providing Urgent Maternal Protections (PUMP) for Nursing       Mothers Act, as reported from the Education and Labor       Committee and as anticipated to be be improved via manager's       amendment. We hope this legislation will be further refined       as the legislative process continues to address the unique       issues related to the air travel sector.        This legislation would update the Break Time for Nursing       Mothers Act, which became law in 2010. This law amended the       Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) to require employers with       more than 50 employees to provide a space for mothers to       either nurse or, more likely, to express breast milk. It also       requires employers to provide reasonable breaks for workers       to nurse. Because the legislation amended the FLSA's overtime       provision, it did not cover workers exempt from overtime. It       also lacks an enforcement mechanism.        The PUMP Act would expand coverage to those workers       currently exempt and would provide workers with a remedy if       employers fail to provide accommodation or reasonable breaks.       The bill as passed by the Education and Labor Committee and       the manager's amendment would improve upon the introduced       version of H.R. 3110 in several key areas:        Employers would be allowed 10 days to improve space       allocated for nursing mothers before employees could proceed       with seeking relief from the courts. This provision would       assure that more employees can get the accommodations they       need in a timely manner rather than triggering a drawn out,       costly, and uncertain litigation process.        Department of Labor would be required to issue guidance       that is consistent with the existing information from the       Office on Women's Health of the Department of Health and       Human Services' website in order to assist employers with       compliance.        The number of employees necessary for employers to be       eligible for the hardship exemption would be made consistent       with other provisions of law.        This legislation should be improved to provide a reasonable       exemption for the air travel sector. The limitations on space       on airplanes would make compliance with this legislation       impractical and in some cases impossible. We hope this issue       is addressed as the bill makes its way through the       legislative process.        The PUMP Act is a win-win for nursing mothers and the       companies that employ them. Employers would get clarity and a       way to avoid litigation, and nursing mothers would be able to       remain in the workforce. The bill as reported by the       Education and Labor Committee and augmented by the manager's       amendment is the product of collaborative negotiations       between employers and advocates for this bill. The Chamber is       pleased to strongly support this legislation.            Sincerely,      Neil L. Bradley.                                   ____                                       National Retail Federation,                                   Washington, DC, October 12, 2021.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi: On behalf of the National Retail       Federation, I write to express our support for and urge the       passage of H.R. 3110, the Providing Urgent Maternal       Protections for Nursing Mothers (PUMP) Act.        NRF, the world's largest retail trade association,       passionately advocates for the people, brands, policies and       ideas that help retail thrive. From its headquarters in       Washington, D.C., NRF empowers the industry that powers the       economy. Retail is the nation's largest private-sector       employer, contributing $3.9 trillion to annual GDP and       supporting one in four U.S. jobs--52 million working       Americans. For over a century, NRF has been a voice for every       retailer and every retail job, educating, inspiring and       communicating the powerful impact retail has on local       communities and global economies.        For over a decade, federal law has required employers to       provide nursing mothers with reasonable break times to       express breast milk. Further, employers must designate a       facility in which to do so, that is shielded from view and       ``free from intrusion from coworkers and the public.'' As       enacted, only nursing mothers who are non-exempt from the       Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) were covered by the new       requirements. The PUMP Act would expand coverage to all       nursing mothers. This legislation also includes important       provisions that will ensure that employers are properly       notified if it is alleged that they are not providing       appropriate facilities for nursing, including a 10-calendar-      day time period for employers to provide such facilities       before any litigation can commence.        The PUMP Act is a sound piece of bipartisan legislation       that will allow nursing mothers to maintain their vital role       the American workplace.            Sincerely,                                                      David French,                        Senior Vice President Government Relations.     Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote  ``yes'' on this bill.
