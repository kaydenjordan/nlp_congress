 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I want to talk about two topics today. One  topic I was reminded of when I was in St. Joseph and Joplin, MO, over  the weekend, talking to healthcare providers and volunteers of all  kinds who are trying to do what they can to help us emerge from this  pandemic stronger than we were to start with.   Certainly, what first comes to mind is the healthcare workers  themselves--the medical workers, doctors, nurses, and support staff  whom we have relied on from the very first moments that we began to  realize that this virus was bigger than any health issue we have dealt  with in a long time. We are still depending on them today. At some  point someone can run out of some of the capacity and steam that you  have to do the job that needs to be done, but we see these heroes  continuing to step up, and some giving their lives.   Billy Birmingham, in Kansas City, was an emergency medical  technician. He was with the Kansas City Fire Department, and he died of  coronavirus in April. His son described Billy as selfless. He said  Billy had decided he wanted to find new ways to help people. So he  reinvented himself as an EMT when he was in his 40s so he could help  others. He was an EMT for about 22 years.   We see the emergency medical technicians and first responders out  there saving lives, bringing people into the hospital who are in a  desperate situation, infectious, as many of them can be, and at sort of  the height of suffering and unable to do much to help you help them,  but we see that happening. We are benefited by it, and we see a lot of  sacrifice in the community.   There are people such as Heather Black at the Harry S. Truman  Memorial Hospital in Columbia, MO. She donated 623 hand-sewn masks for  her colleagues and the veterans at the facility whom they care for. She  brought her sewing machine to work so that she could make masks during  her free time before and after her shift and during her breaks. One of  her colleagues said: You have to be just literally awed by somebody  that dedicated to helping people. Remember that she is making masks,  and between the breaks she is helping care for the patients at the  veterans hospital.   We see people finding different ways of being heroes in their  communities. Dozens of people in Cape Girardeau, in May, decided to put  a parade together for residents of the veterans home who were unable to  have visitors. The veterans got to the windows and the dozens of people  came by doing what they could to present a Memorial Day kind of parade.  There are groups in St. Louis and other places, but particularly the  one I was thinking about in St. Louis. They went around and collected  food and personal care items, and they took those to people who had  lost their jobs, who were suffering from the pandemic, who were  isolated in their efforts.   I talked today to a number of people in the behavioral health area  who understand that, at moments like this, people who have behavioral  health issues have logical reasons for those issues to begin to pile up  on them. You are isolated. You are sick or somebody in your family is  sick. You have lost a job or somebody you know has lost a job. And  those issues get bigger.   Then we see businesses who figure out how to use their unique set of  resources, whatever that might be, to make things happen. When we find  it hard to get hand sanitizers, a number of distilleries went into the  hand sanitizer business. Anheuser-Busch, which is not a distillery but  a brewery, used their brewery facilities to produce more than a half- million bottles of hand sanitizer and then they used their distribution  system to get those half million bottles in the communities and places  around the country where they would do the most good.   Bass Pro Shops, in my hometown of Springfield, donated 1 million face  masks to healthcare workers on the frontlines. From delivering  truckloads of critical supplies to simply checking on our neighbors,  there are thousands of stories to tell in towns across Missouri and in  towns in Georgia, where the Presiding Officer lives. There are people  doing all they can to make this terrible situation less terrible and  this challenging situation less challenging. We are grateful to them.   I know a number of people have come to the floor today to talk about  those heroes and how they serve us                            ____________________     Mr. President, the second topic I wanted to talk about is  that we spend lots of time discussing what to do in this next phase of  dealing with the coronavirus legislation. I want to talk about  something we did earlier and the results it has produced.   In April, Senator Alexander and I proposed that the National  Institutes of Health create a ``Shark Tank'' program for scientists to  develop new technologies for COVID-19 testing. NIH set up that program  very quickly. We gave them the authority and money to do it, but they  did in a week what they normally would have done in 6 months. They have  been working overtime ever since with the private sector and with  BARDA, or the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority,  to meet the tremendous need for quicker and earlier tests.   The Presiding Officer and I talked about this just the other day. The  President is right in his view that some of these tests only tell us  information that gives us more data. We need tests that are quicker and  have an immediate response. When you go get a test and you don't have a  response for 5 days, that really doesn't do anybody a whole lot of  good. You have been moving around for 5 days, maybe without symptoms,  and you don't know that you are continuing to spread the virus. If you  had known in 5 minutes or 15 minutes what it took you 5 days to find  out, how many less people would have gotten the disease if you had  known what you needed to know when you needed to know it?   We need tests that give accurate results in minutes, that are easy to  take, and are inexpensive--tests that may cost from a $1 to $5 or $6,  that give you an immediate response. So that is what we asked of this  program at the National Institutes of Health to work on, to put  together scientists, researchers, and engineers to come up with their  boldest ideas.   So far, since April 29, 650 applications have been submitted with  ideas from single individuals or businesses who say: I think this would  work. That would be sort of the starting point. By the way, a lot more  than 650 people had ``this will work'' ideas, but when NIH sat down and  looked, they came up with 650 applicants they thought needed a careful  look.   Thirty-one of those projects have gone into phase 1 testing. They go  through a process of validation, seeing if the likelihood that this  will work is as great as what the scientists, engineers, and  technologists who populate the shark tank thought it would be.   NIH announced that 20 of those projects would be considered even more  closely over a few weeks in phase 2, and just last week, NIH selected 7  companies that would start scaling up production of their technology.  Taxpayers are investing about $250 million to help those tests get out  there quickly. These tests could be available as early  [[Page S4896]]  as next month. Some of them are the type of rapid tests that give a  result on site.   One test uses a handheld device that can detect the virus within 30  minutes. Another test company has developed a way to speed up lab  testing so that labs that now handle hundreds of tests can handle tens  of thousands in the same period of time. These kinds of technologies  and others are essential if we want to get our society fully reopened.   In early April, there was an average of 145,000 tests a day. Today,  we are running about 800,000 tests, but often they are not the kind of  tests we need, and they are not the numbers we need. We need tests that  millions of people can take dozens of times. We need tests for every  person who walks into an office or a factory or a nursing home or a  school or a childcare center so that there is confidence in knowing  they are not bringing the virus into that center. It is a high hurdle,  but I think it is one that we are going to clear.   The HEALS Act includes another $15 billion for testing to help in our  priorities, which are nursing homes and daycare centers, childcare  centers, elementary and secondary schools, colleges and universities.  Those are areas where we think the government itself has an  extraordinary obligation to make the difference. That $16 billion,  added to the $9 billion of money for this purpose that hasn't been  spent up until now, means that we have that kind of big investment to  see that people have tests that work for them and work quickly.   For this to happen, Congress has to act. Congress has to move. We  have to be supportive of efforts that get our society back to school,  back to work, back to childcare, and back to better health.   I yield the floor.
