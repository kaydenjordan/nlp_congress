 Mr. Speaker, this is a great day for children, for  vulnerable populations, and caregivers in my home State of Wisconsin  and across this country.                                time  1800    H. Res. 443 recognizes the importance of trauma-informed care to  individual wellness, the efficacy of care, and improved quality of life  for those who have experienced trauma. Passage of this resolution  demonstrates that this body believes in the power that trauma-informed  care can have in helping children, families, and adults overcome trauma  and lead healthy lives.   From veterans reintegrating into society to survivors of childhood  abuse, individuals from across the population can benefit from the  simple but effective principles of trauma-informed care. By recognizing  and sensitively addressing the impacts of traumatic experiences, we can  build stronger and more resilient communities.   We all want to address major public health issues like addiction,  mental health issues, and obesity, and this resolution moves the ball  forward by raising awareness and building momentum behind evidence- based best practices and solutions.   Rigorous study and academic review have shown benefits for  organizations, communities, and governments that implement trauma- informed care.   I am proud to announce that my home State of Wisconsin, under the  leadership of our first lady, Tonette Walker, is on track to becoming  the first fully trauma-informed State in the Nation. In Illinois, home  to our colleague and the colead of this resolution, Congressman  Danny  Davis, experts have come together to make this material more accessible  to policymakers and the public.   Exciting innovation in mental healthcare is happening across this  country, and this resolution recognizes that hard work.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I express my sincere thanks to my colleague,  Congressman Davis, for his commitment to this resolution. I also thank  Tonette Walker, first lady of Wisconsin, for her dedication and service  and leadership in this important cause.   Mr. Speaker, additionally, I thank the chairman and the ranking  member of the committee for their hard work on this issue as well.   H. Res. 443 is an important step in breaking down the stigma  surrounding mental healthcare and building more inclusive communities,  more resilient communities, more strong communities that take care of  each other. I encourage all of my colleagues to support its passage.
