 Mr. Speaker, I rise to remember the late U.S.  Army Captain Antoine Lewis of Matteson, Illinois, in the Second  Congressional District.   I was shocked and saddened to learn that Captain Lewis was among the  157 people killed in the tragic plane crash in Ethiopia on March 10.  His funeral was November 9 because his family just received his  remains.   This incredible young man had so much more to give the world and  constantly gave of himself to others. He possessed an irrepressible  curiosity and a desire to make the world a better place.   Captain Lewis was a man of passionate commitment to his family, to  the Matteson community, to our country, and to his faith. He was a one- man recruitment team when it came to getting so many in his own family  to enlist. An honorable man, he represented the very best of America  whenever he served in uniform or wherever he traveled in the world.   Captain Lewis was a patriot who proudly served his country. He had  been stationed in Afghanistan, South Korea, and Canada.    He had an adventuresome and free spirit and was filled with wonder  and curiosity about other people and cultures. While he was raised in  Matteson, he belonged to the world.   He, like many others, went to Africa to offer hope and opportunity to  others through mission work. As called to do by St. James, he put his  faith into actions and deeds that uplifted others and worked to build a  better world.   As we grieve with his family and friends, we are comforted by the  knowledge that he did fulfill his desire to make the world a better  place by the love he gave to every person and mission that he  encountered.                            ____________________
