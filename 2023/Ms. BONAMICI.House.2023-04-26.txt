 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this  regressive, shortsighted, and cruel default on America act that would  devastate programs that are critical to Oregonians and Americans.   We have a housing affordability and homelessness crisis, but this  bill would eliminate affordable housing assistance for many families  and seniors.   Our constituents can't find or afford childcare, but this bill would  take away access to Head Start.   The cost of higher education keeps rising, but this bill would cut  Pell grants and slash additional funding to support millions of  disabled and low-income students.   Instead of addressing the climate crisis, this legislation would  entrench reliance on fossil fuels; undermine renewable, sustainable  energy options; and raise taxes for middle-class Americans.  [[Page H2019]]    This bill could cause millions of low-income seniors and veterans to  lose access to nutrition assistance, and up to 10 million people could  lose Medicaid coverage.   There is a simple solution to prevent these harmful outcomes: Bring a  clean debt ceiling bill to the floor so we can end this MAGA  Republican-created manufactured crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a report from the Center on  Budget and Policy Priorities on how up to 10 million people could be at  significant risk of losing health coverage under Speaker McCarthy's  bad, backward bill.      [From the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Apr. 21, 2023]  McCarthy Medicaid Proposal Puts Millions of People in Expansion States                     at Risk of Losing Health Coverage                             (By Gideon Lukens)         A Republican proposal led by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy       would take Medicaid coverage away from people who do not meet       new work-reporting requirements. The McCarthy proposal would       apply to all states, but in practice it would heavily impact       people covered by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid       expansion. Of this group, more than 10 million people in       Medicaid expansion states would be at significant risk of       losing coverage under the McCarthy proposal. This group would       be subject to the new Medicaid requirement, and they are not       part of a group that states could readily identify in       existing data sources and exclude from burdensome reporting.       The McCarthy proposal could jeopardize coverage for millions       more, by prompting some states to drop the ACA Medicaid       expansion or dissuading states that have not yet taken the       expansion from adopting it.        Nationwide, we estimate that over 10 million Medicaid       expansion enrollees--more than 1 in 5 of all Medicaid       enrollees in expansion states--would be at risk of losing       Medicaid coverage under the policy in McCarthy's debt limit       bill, using 2019 (pre-pandemic) data. Some 74 percent of all       expansion enrollees and 21 percent of all Medicaid       beneficiaries in the states that have adopted the expansion       would be subject to the new requirements and, thus, at risk       of losing coverage.        People in every expansion state would be affected, with the       share of total Medicaid enrollees at risk ranging from 15 to       37 percent. (See Table 1 and Methodology.) Because we use       2019 data, the national estimate does not include the nine       states that expanded coverage after that date and therefore       very likely understates the number of enrollees at risk. If       those states were included, it would likely add upward of 1       million more enrollees at risk of losing coverage.        While not all of those at risk under McCarthy's proposal       would lose coverage, many would, including people who are       working or are eligible for an exemption but would be       disenrolled due to administrative burdens and red tape. This       was the experience in Arkansas, which is the only state that       briefly took people's Medicaid coverage away for not meeting       work-reporting requirements, until a federal court halted the       program following massive coverage losses. In just seven       months of implementation, some 18,000 people--1 in 4 subject       to the requirements--lost coverage. Moreover, research found       that the new requirements had no impact on employment       outcomes. The McCarthy Medicaid provision draws heavily from       the failed Arkansas experiment but is harsher in some       respects, applying to somewhat older adults, for example.        The more than 10 million estimate (looking just at the       states that had expanded Medicaid prior to 2019) does not       fully account for the sweeping impact the Medicaid work-      reporting requirement could have. For example, while the bill       directs states ``whenever possible'' to use electronic data       sources to verify whether people meet the criteria for       continued Medicaid coverage, the extent to which this would       protect people from losing coverage or from onerous reporting       would depend on implementation decisions at both the federal       and state level.        Proponents of the new requirements argue that they give       states an option to take Medicaid coverage away from people       who don't comply with the new work-reporting requirement.       This is misdirection at best.        The bill terminates federally funded Medicaid coverage for       those who don't meet the work-reporting requirements. In       theory, states could provide fully state-funded coverage to       those whose federal Medicaid coverage is taken away, but with       the federal government currently covering 90 percent of the       cost of coverage for expansion enrollees, states are       exceedingly unlikely to continue coverage for large numbers       of people who don't meet the requirement. (It is worth noting       that states did not provide state-funded coverage for this       group prior to the ACA's expansion, though they were able to       do so.)        Moreover, administering these new requirements would be       complicated for state and local governments, which would have       to pick up a significant portion of the costs associated with       implementing the complex systems to verify work, determine       who meets automatic exemption criteria (such as those with       children), and assess applications for exemptions based on       criteria, such as an illness, that the state doesn't know       through its eligibility system.        States also would have to absorb the costs associated with       higher caseload churn--that is, people losing coverage and       then having to reapply or seek to have their coverage       reinstated, all processes that require caseworker staff time.       And uncompensated care costs would increase because people       have lost coverage, adding further to the costs that states       and safety net health care providers would have to pick up.        Without a doubt, adding work-reporting requirements to       Medicaid would cause many low-income adults to lose coverage       due to bureaucratic hurdles and would leave people without       the health care they need, including life-saving medications,       treatment to manage chronic conditions, and care for acute       illnesses. People's access to health care and other basic       supports, such as housing, food, or child care, should not       hinge on whether they meet a work-reporting requirement or       successfully navigate a complicated system to either report       work hours or claim an exemption.       McCarthy Medicaid Provision Builds on Failed Arkansas Experiment         The Arkansas plan, implemented in 2018, required that       Medicaid expansion enrollees aged 19-49 document at least 80       hours of work or other qualifying activities (e.g. job       training, volunteering) per month. Exemptions were available       for various groups including pregnant people, certain types       of caregivers, and people with certain health conditions, but       qualifying for these exemptions required that enrollees       successfully navigate the reporting system or that the state       use available data to determine exemption status. As a       result, more than 18,000 people (about one-quarter of those       subject to the requirements) lost coverage in just seven       months, before a federal court blocked the policy.        The McCarthy plan is similar to Arkansas' but applies to a       broader set of Medicaid enrollees. First, it applies to       enrollees aged 19-55, a wider age range that includes more       older adults. Second, it is not explicitly limited to       Medicaid expansion enrollees, unlike the Arkansas policy.       While all states would have to set up new processes to       validate exemptions, we assume that because existing state       data sources could readily be used to exempt the bulk of       Medicaid enrollees who are not part of the expansion group,       the impact would be largely on expansion enrollees. Third,       some groups exempt under the Arkansas plan, including       postpartum people, people identified as ``medically frail,''       and people receiving unemployment benefits, are not exempt       under the McCarthy plan.        A KFF study estimated that under a nationwide Medicaid       work-reporting requirements policy similar to policies       implemented in Arkansas and proposed by other states, most       people losing coverage would be complying with or exempt from       the requirements but would be disenrolled due to       administrative burdens and red tape. Using conservative       assumptions about disenrollment based on a survey of the       research literature, the study found that 62 to 91 percent of       those losing coverage would be people who qualify as eligible       under the policy. Coverage losses would be concentrated among       those eligible because the overwhelming majority of Medicaid       enrollees already meet the requirements or an exemption       criterion, yet they would still be at risk due to the       bureaucratic complexity of reporting and proving exemption       status.        Overall, between 1.4 and 4 million people would have lost       Medicaid coverage if Medicaid work-requirements were imposed       in 2016, the KFF study estimated. This estimate is roughly in       line with the Congressional Budget Office's projection that a       nationwide policy similar to Arkansas' would result in a       reduction in Medicaid enrollment of 2.2 million adults per       year for the 2023-2031 period.        Our analysis is not a projection of the number of people       who will lose coverage, but rather shows that more than 10       million people would be subject to these requirements and,       thus, at risk of losing coverage from a policy that would       erect burdensome requirements to report work or claim       exemptions. A large share of the 10 million people subject to       the requirements would have to navigate complex work-      reporting and verification systems each month while others       would have to navigate the exemption process periodically to       retain coverage.        Research suggests that some populations would be especially       harmed by these work-reporting requirements, including people       with disabilities, women, people who are experiencing       homelessness, and people with mental health conditions or       substance use disorders. Even though exemptions would apply       to some in these groups, states often lack the capacity to       hire sufficient staff to respond to people's questions or       manage work-reporting systems and the exemption process.       People who have fewer transportation options or live in rural       areas, face language or literacy barriers, are in poor health       or have limited mobility, or have limited internet access       would face particular barriers to understanding the new       requirements and navigating reporting systems, applying for       exemptions, and collecting the verification needed to prove       that they meet an exemption criterion.        There is no upside to Medicaid work-reporting requirements.       Research has not found any impact of the requirements on       employment, and data from Arkansas show that few enrollees       engaged in new work-related activities. Instead, work-      reporting requirements strip health coverage from people with       low incomes--most of whom are already meeting or exempt from       the requirements--  [[Page H2020]]       leading to gaps in care that damage their health and       financial security and make it harder for them to find or       keep a job.        In this paper, we estimate the number of Medicaid expansion       group enrollees at risk of losing coverage using       administrative data on Medicaid expansion enrollment for       2019, combined with American Community Survey (ACS) data and       state enrollment policies.        We use 2019 Medicaid expansion group enrollment to avoid       including the large increase in Medicaid enrollment that       began in 2020 as a result of the requirement that Medicaid       provide continuous coverage during the public health       emergency. This continuous coverage requirement ended on       March 31, 2023, and while estimates of coverage loss during       the unwinding of the requirement are highly uncertain,       enrollment declines are potentially large. By using 2019       data, we avoid overstating our estimates of expansion       enrollees at risk in each state once unwinding is complete.                                 Methodology         As stated above, our estimates are based on a combination       of administrative data on Medicaid expansion enrollment, ACS       data, and state enrollment policies.        Because our data are based on 2019 (pre-pandemic) Medicaid       expansion enrollment, they do not include expansion enrollees       at risk in states that expanded in 2019 or later, including       Idaho, Maine, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Utah, and       Virginia. We also cannot produce expansion group estimates       for North Carolina and South Dakota, which have enacted but       not yet implemented expansion. Our national total estimate is       therefore likely to understate the number of enrollees at       risk. Finally, by shifting costs to states, the McCarthy       proposal could result in some states deciding to drop the ACA       Medicaid expansion, jeopardizing coverage for millions more.       Similarly, these new requirements could dissuade some states       that have not yet adopted the expansion from doing so.        We consider Medicaid expansion enrollees aged 19-55 and       exclude from this group people who live with dependent       children aged 0-17. States should be able to exclude this       group automatically (without requiring them to apply for an       exemption) using existing administrative data, so they are       less likely to be at risk.        We do not estimate other exemptions or work status because       these individuals would be more likely than parents to have       to report their employment or earnings monthly or to apply       for and submit documentation to receive an exemption.       Research indicates that most people who would lose coverage       under work-reporting requirements would be disenrolled       despite working or qualifying for an exemption due to the       complexities of proving that they are working or meet an       exemption criterion.        Publicly available administrative data on Medicaid       expansion enrollees do not include detailed enrollee       characteristics. We therefore use data from the U.S. Census       Bureau's American Community Survey as well as state-level       eligibility rules to estimate the share of expansion       enrollees who are aged 19-55 and who do not have dependent       children in each state.
