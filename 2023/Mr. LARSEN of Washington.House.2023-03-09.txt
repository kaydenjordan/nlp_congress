 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Clean water is a human right, and the health and safety of our  communities and the success of our economy depend upon it.   House Democrats stand for clean water, and today, I rise to oppose  H.J. Res. 27.   Last Congress, we passed a bipartisan, once-in-a-generation  investment in our Nation's infrastructure through the bipartisan  infrastructure law, investing almost $13 billion in clean water  infrastructure upgrades and creating jobs in communities across this  country.   The BIL showed what Congress can do when we focus on the needs of  American families. Yet, instead of putting people over pollution, this  CRA does the opposite.   Now, my State of Washington is defined by its clean water, including  the health of the Puget Sound and the hundreds of lakes and thousands  of miles of rivers and streams throughout the State.   My constituents know that rivers, streams, and wetlands, are  intrinsically connected. Pollution that starts in one body of water  does not stay put.   House Democrats believe we can protect clean water, while providing  certainty to businesses, to farmers, to Americans who depend upon clean  water for their lives and livelihoods.   This is especially true for the 117 million Americans who depend on  smaller streams as a source of their drinking water at a time when many  States are facing historic droughts.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle say they want clean  water rules that are simple, clear and easy to follow. I want that,  too.   The Biden administration's Clean Water Restoration Rule does exactly  that; following the law and the science of protecting clean water and  providing regulatory certainty and stability to the implementation of  the Clean Water Act.   This resolution does the opposite. This resolution will not bring  back the previous administration's Navigable Waters Protection Rule,  which removed Federal protections on roughly half of the Nation's  wetlands and 70 percent of its rivers and streams.   That rule was rightly rejected by a Federal court in 2021, as  ``fundamentally flawed'' and likely to cause ``serious environmental  harm'' every day it remained in effect. It is off the table entirely.   This resolution before us today will also not eliminate the use of  the ``significant nexus'' test because that test was mandated by the  U.S. Supreme Court. It has been in effect since the Bush administration  and remains in place today.                                time  1245    However, this resolution will adversely impact farmers, ranchers, and  developers by creating regulatory chaos and eliminating important  exclusions that have been codified in the new rule to help water- dependent businesses and farmers to understand and comply with the law.   Now, despite fear-mongering on this issue, the truth is simple. The  Biden proposal will have no impact on the average family farmer in this  country. Why? That is because farmers are, by law, largely exempt from  the Clean Water Act permitting requirements where less than 1 percent  of all annual wetlands permits relate to agricultural activities  nationwide.   Therefore, if your farm is engaged in normal farming, forestry, and  ranching activity, or undertakes the construction or maintenance of a  farm, stock pond, or irrigation ditch, you are exempt from the  permitting requirements of the act, and the current proposal does not  change that exemption.   Finally, for those waiting to see whether the Supreme Court will  somehow fix this issue in the upcoming Sackett case, this resolution  will actually hinder the ability of the Corps and the EPA to respond to  the Supreme Court's potential recommendations later this year.   That is why this resolution before us makes no sense. It would  invalidate the Biden rule and all the clarifications and exceptions for  business it contains in favor of a similarly structured but much less  clear regulatory framework. That is a recipe for uncertainty, legal  battles, and continued gridlock, the opposite of what proponents say  they are looking for. It would also tie the hands of Federal agencies  seeking to help individuals comply with the law, unless Congress acts  again.   This shortsighted action will lessen, not increase, certainty. It is  a big mistake. I support the administration's efforts to efficiently  implement the critical water infrastructure investments included in the  BIL so we can begin to realize the public health, economic, and  environmental benefits that come with clean water.   This resolution represents a giant step backward for clean water,  increases uncertainty for farmers, homebuilders, roadbuilders, and all  American families, and doubles down on the infighting and chaos.   I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing H.J. Res. 27 and move  together toward a future with predictability for those that need it and  clean water for communities that cannot survive without it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Stansbury).

Open Letter to Congress on Congressional Review of the Waters of the                             United States Rule         Dear Member of Congress: As alumni of the Environmental       Protection Agency (EPA), we are writing to share our       perspectives on congressional review of the Clean Water Act       ``Waters of the United States'' rule. The Environmental       Protection Network (EPN) taps the bipartisan expertise of       more than 550 former EPA staff who volunteer their unique       perspectives as scientists and former regulators, permit       issuers, and grant providers with decades of historical       knowledge and subject matter expertise.         A Constructive Framework for Assessing EPA Rules Using the                          Congressional Review Act         Congress has an important responsibility to ensure that EPA       and other federal agencies are faithful to congressional       intent  [[Page H1224]]       when issuing rules. Congress' congressional review       responsibilities are laid out in law, commonly referred to as       the ``Congressional Review Act'' (CRA).        Rulemaking, when done appropriately, is a methodical       process built upon deep understanding of complex and       technical information and informed by a wide range of       stakeholders with different perspectives. The bipartisan       drafters of the CRA recognized the vital roles agencies play       in implementing laws, and they strove to strike a balance       between ``reclaiming for Congress some of its policymaking       authority, without at the same time requiring Congress to       become a super regulatory agency.''        The drafters of the CRA shined a light on how to navigate       this balance, recommending that Congress intervene where       rules are ``surprisingly different from the expectations of       Congress or the public.''        In addition to avoiding taking on the role of ``super       regulatory agency,'' Congress must consider the full       ramifications of a resolution of disapproval, which prohibits       agencies from taking substantially similar action. The CRA       acts like a sledgehammer, not a scalpel. A CRA disapproval       resolution can leave a chaotic tangle of regulatory       uncertainty and confusion in its wake, resulting in       significant harm to the public, regulated entities, and the       environment. According to the Congressional Research Service,       Congressional disapproval:        ``creates uncertainty and could restrict the agency's       ability to act going forward. This can potentially create a       difficult situation for an agency if Congress uses the CRA to       disapprove rules that were specifically required by law . .       .''        Historically, members of Congress from both parties have       cited the ``bluntness'' of the CRA tool as the reason they       rejected congressional disapproval even when they did not       agree with the underlying rule.        EPN suggests a constructive framework of four key questions       that Congress should consider when determining whether a rule       is ``surprisingly different from the expectations of       Congress,'' without venturing into the territory of becoming       a ``super regulatory agency'':        1. Follow the Law: Did the agency follow the law, as       directed by Congress and the courts?        2. Follow the Science: Did the agency follow the science,       including adequately explaining its factual basis and       reasoning?        3. Listen to Stakeholders: Did the agency meaningfully       engage with and respond to all major stakeholders, taking       different perspectives meaningfully into account?        4. Do No Harm: Would congressional disapproval worsen or       improve outcomes for public health, the environment, and       stakeholders, including regulated entities?        In pursuing this framework, members of Congress can provide       meaningful oversight of actions, while minimizing the harm       created by the CRA. In today's climate, with cyclical swings       of the political pendulum, there is already significant       regulatory whiplash and chaos. Congress should do everything       in its power to lessen this confusion, not add to it.        Applying the Framework to the Waters of the United States Rule         EPN believes that Congress should support the ``Revised       Definition of `Waters of the United States' '' rule published       by EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers on January 18, 2023.       This rule protects waters that are critical to the health and       welfare of the American people. The rule is not       ``surprisingly different from the expectations of Congress or       the public.'' In fact, the rule conforms to the Supreme       Court's instructions and largely reverts to the long-existing       rule that pre-dates the regulatory confusion that has       prevailed for too long.        Further, a congressional resolution of disapproval in this       case risks a prolonged and perhaps permanent state of       regulatory confusion that will create more uncertainty for       landowners and others who deserve clear answers on how to       comply with the Clean Water Act.        A thoughtful exploration of the four framing CRA questions       we pose above will demonstrate that EPA has in fact done its       job and done it well.        (1) EPA Followed the Law: The rule is consistent with the       objectives of the federal Clean Water Act to ``restore and       maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of       the nation's waters,'' which are largely interconnected and       which flow over and between state lines. The agencies are       interpreting ``waters of the United States'' to mean the       waters defined by the familiar pre-2015 regulations, with       amendments to reflect the agencies' determination of the       statutory limits on the scope informed by Supreme Court       precedent, the best available science, and the agencies'       experience and technical expertise. In response to both the       case law and the science, the 2023 rule only includes       upstream waters and wetlands as waters of the U.S. when they       significantly affect the integrity of waters for which       federal interest is indisputable (traditional navigable       waters, territorial seas, and interstate waters).        EPA has also clearly recognized Supreme Court precedent,       which, of course, could change with the expected decision in       Sackett v. United States.        (2) EPA Followed the Science: The agency incorporates well-      established science and protects waters that are critical to       the health and welfare of the American people, particularly       given the extreme weather challenges from climate change and       the disproportionate impact on environmental justice       communities. For the first time, the 2023 rule provides a       detailed definition of the functions that must be assessed       and the specific factors that must be considered in       determining whether a water has a significant nexus to a       water for which federal interest is indisputable. This       definition is well supported by scientific evidence and is       consistent with the factors the Supreme Court recently       identified as critical for determining whether a discharge is       jurisdictional in Country of Maui, Hawaii v. Hawaii Wildlife       Fund.        (3) EPA Responded to Stakeholders Concerns: EPA is to be       commended on a particularly thorough and far-reaching       stakeholder engagement process, ultimately choosing a middle       road that supports public health, environmental protection,       agricultural activity, and economic growth. It covers less       than the Obama administration proposed in 2015 but more than       the Trump administration's rule. The agency conducted       regional roundtables throughout the country, as well as       solicited input from small businesses, tribes, and the public       through multiple channels. In response to farmers concerns,       the 2023 rule expands the number of waters exempted from CWA       jurisdiction, exempting certain types of ditches, irrigated       areas, farm ponds, and water-filled depressions in dry land,       and erosional features such as gullies and rills.        (4) Congressional Disapproval Would Create a Chaotic Mess:       A congressional vote of disapproval would create prolonged       uncertainty and confusion for stakeholders that need to know       what waters are protected by the Clean Water Act. Such an       action would also endanger the drinking water, fisheries, and       flood control for communities throughout the nation.        Congress should support this rulemaking process as it moves       through the courts, and refrain from adding more confusion to       the situation. Allowing EPA and the Army Corps to complete       their job as defined in the law and overseen by the courts       will create the kind of clarity stakeholders need.        We are happy to make EPN experts available to you to       discuss this further.            Sincerely,                                                  Michelle Roos,                                                 Executive Director,                                  Environmental Protection Network.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Napolitano), the ranking member of  the Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Sykes).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I just want to make a note that the argument that this is like a  taking does not hold any water--excuse the pun--because a 1992 case in  the Supreme Court determined that rules like this actually do not  qualify as a taking under the U.S. Constitution or under U.S. law.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume just to go back to an argument a previous speaker made  about the Democrats having the majority in the House, the Senate, and  the Presidency.    It also should be on the Record that the other side of the aisle had  the majority in the House, the Senate, and the Presidency in 2017 and  2018 and also did nothing on this rule. It wasn't important enough for  them to do anything.   Then the President's rule at the time moved forward, and it was  tossed by two different courts. It was rejected by the courts, which  leaves us in this position where we are today of playing ping-pong with  the waters of the U.S. rule.   Our argument today is: Let's bring certainty to the Clean Water Act,  bring certainty to the waters of the U.S., reject H.J. Res. 27, and  move forward with the existing rule from the current administration.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to be clear that I do agree with some of the  comments made by the previous speaker that this has been a ping-pong  match among administrations over the last 10 years where all Americans  have lived under various definitions of this rule.   I, too, want to end that ping-pong match which is why I am calling on  the House of Representatives to vote ``no'' on this resolution and get  on with the certainty that the current administration's rule provides.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   This debate we are having today is only about clean water, and we  need to put people and clean water above pollution. The administration  has a rule that provides certainty, and we should move forward on that.  But this debate is about clean water.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1330     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I do have to address the comment about who cares about  rural America. I am not making an argument today that any one party or  any one person cares more about rural America.   However, if we are going to support rural America, keep implementing  the bipartisan infrastructure law, which puts $65 billion into  broadband, including billions of dollars to expand broadband into rural  areas--something happening in my State and States around the country.   Pass comprehensive immigration reform so there is a supply of workers  in this country, including farmworkers.   Open up trade agreements. Open up trade for agriculture, including ag  in my State, in my own district for the milk producers, the potato  producers, the raspberry and blueberry producers, who are exporting  product all over the country.   That is what it means--at least on my side of the State--to support  rural America.   I support rural America, and a lot of folks in this Chamber on both  sides support our farmers and rural America. Let's take action to do  just that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I will note that in the current administration's rule  the agencies added six additional exclusions to the regulatory text for  generally nonjurisdictional features under the pre-2015 regulatory  effort and continues the agencies' two longstanding exclusions for  wastewater treatment systems and prior converted farmland.   In addition, the final rule continues the agencies' longstanding  regulatory definition of wetlands, as well. Now, that changed a  longstanding definition of wetlands, something that again adds to the  certainty of the rule as well as with the six additional exclusions  creates more exclusions than in the Bush-era rule.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time to close.   Last year, this Congress came together to provide historic  investments in our Nation's infrastructure through the bipartisan  infrastructure law, providing communities with almost $13 billion in  clean water infrastructure upgrades and creating jobs.   These clean water investments help areas like Skagit County, where I  am from, which has used the Clean Water State Revolving Fund money to  protect the water quality of Gilligan Creek, the drinking water source  for many in that county.   Every day, more and more American families are realizing the public  health, economic, and environmental benefits of the bipartisan  infrastructure law, benefits that will continue as additional BIL  resources are made available and implemented across the country.   The BIL is what Congress can do at its best. This resolution is not.   This resolution provides no benefits to public health. It seeks to  eliminate protections for rivers, streams, and wetlands, many of which  serve as a source of drinking water for hundreds of millions of  Americans.   This resolution provides no benefits to our economy as a whole. It  not only casts aside a time-tested, scientifically based tool to  implement the Clean Water Act, but then further blocks the Corps of  Engineers and the EPA from providing any additional clarity to  businesses, farmers, and homebuilders going forward.   In short, this resolution is a recipe for uncertainty, for  litigation, for continued gridlock, the very things that my friends on  the other side of the aisle are really trying to avoid, as we are as  well.  [[Page H1230]]    This resolution is a step backward for clean water. It is a step  backward for certainty. I urge my colleagues to see this resolution for  what it is. It is not for clean water. It is an attack on our clean  water future. It fails to provide clarity. It fails to provide  consistency for our businesses, our farmers, and for many in our  communities who rely on clean water who are not businesses, who are not  farmers, who are not ranchers. Many of those folks look to Congress to  ensure clean water, as well.   Mr. Speaker, I am urging my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.J. Res.  27, and I yield back the balance of my time.
