 Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk about the life of a  hero of mine, Maurice A. Ferre. He is a Puerto Rican-born public  servant who is a former six-term mayor of the city of Miami and the  first Hispanic mayor of any major American city, serving from 1973 to  1985.   He has served as the chair of the Miami-Dade County Expressway  Authority and served for 8 years on the Florida Transportation  Commission.   As mayor, Ferre provided leadership and vision when Miami took its  place as one of the world's most vibrant cities, eclectic and diverse  and international in nature.   Throughout his years in office, he focused on economic development,  job creation, and a visionary approach to improving south Florida's  transportation and public infrastructure, as well as transforming the  area into a center of inter-American trade, banking, and commerce.   He remains active in business, commentary on current events,  teaching, and public service.   In 2006, he explored issues concerning Puerto Rico in a book on  political status, ``Where is Puerto Rico Headed?''--``Hacia Donde Va  Puerto Rico?''   His career has been marked by a style of public service that  encourages people from widely different views and philosophies to work  together in the name of common good and progress.   Ferre embarked on that journey early on as a Florida House member,  then a commissioner, later the mayor of the city of Miami, and as vice  chairman of the Dade County Board of Commissioners.   Ferre has served on numerous boards, as well as on President Ford's  commission on immigration and President Carter's ambassadorial  nominating commission.   Ferre credits his wife of 64 years, Mercedes Malaussena Ferre, as his  north star, and his loving family, including 6 children and 13  grandchildren, as his anchor.                            ____________________
