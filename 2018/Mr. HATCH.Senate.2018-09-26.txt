 Mr. President, I wish to enter a few remarks into the  Record  [[Page S6335]]  regarding section 103(a) of the Music Modernization Act, which the  Senate recently passed.   By striking current sections 114(f)(1) and (2) of title 17 and  substituting a new section 114(f)(1) based on current section  114(f)(2), section 103(a) of the bill creates a uniform ``willing  buyer/willing seller'' rate standard in section 114. This fair standard  requires that performing artists and copyright owners be appropriately  compensated for the use of their works under the statutory license  because rates under this standard are to be set at a level that best  approximates the rates that artists and copyright owners would have  been able to negotiate in a free market. It has long been a goal of  Congress to move toward a free market standard for the statutory  license and to move away from the 801(b) standard that permits the  copyright royalty judges to set a nonmarket rate for satellite digital  audio radio services, (SDARS), and preexisting subscription services,  (PSS). Discounted nonmarket rates harm artists and copyright owners, as  well as the competitors of SDARS and PSS. As a transitional matter,  however, the bill amends section 804(b)(3)(B) of the Copyright Act to  continue, through 2027, 2018-2022 statutory royalty rates for PSS that  are finally determined in the rate proceeding currently pending before  the copyright royalty judges.   The bill also continues through 2027 the statutory royalty rates for  SDARS set forth by the copyright royalty judges on December 14, 2017,  in their initial determination for the rate period ending on December  31, 2022. The remainder of my statement today will address the PSS  category.   After 2027, the PSS will remain a distinct category of service under  section 114. We have chosen to retain the PSS category as a distinct  category because, over the last 20 years, the PSS have been treated  distinctly from other types of services for purposes other than the  rate standard, such as in the statutory license reporting regulations  in 37 C.F.R. 370.3. We express no view as to the merits of those  particular provisions or as to whether it makes sense to continue to  treat the PSS differently from other types of services as to reporting  requirements or any other matter besides the rate standard.   One consequence of retaining the PSS category after 2027 is that, so  long as there continue to be PSS in operation, statutory royalty rates  for PSS will continue to be set in proceedings separate from those in  which rates are set for similar ``new subscription services'' that also  provide music channels delivered over cable and satellite networks as  part of cable and satellite subscription packages. Statutory royalty  rates for such new subscription services have always been subject to  the willing buyer/willing seller rate standard and are currently found  at 37 C.F.R. part 383. The difference in the timing of rate proceedings  for PSS and similar new subscription services is simply the result of  keeping each service on the same 5-year cycle of rate-setting  proceedings that has applied to the service in the past and does not  reflect a judgment that the royalty rates for PSS and similar new  subscription services should be different. The intent of this  legislation is to eliminate the rate-setting preference that the PSS  and SDARS previously enjoyed under section 114(f)(1) and require all  services to pay statutory royalties reflecting the fair market value of  the recordings they use without regard to regulatory categories or the  schedule of rate-setting proceedings. We expect that similar services  will pay similar market rates.   During the period through 2027, when the PSS may continue to pay  statutory royalty rates that have been set at below-market levels  depending on the outcome of the pending rate proceeding--eligibility  for the PSS rates will continue to be limited to the category of  services eligible for grandfathering under the old rate standard when  the PSS category was created, so as to protect pre-1998 investments in  the particular service offerings at issue.   Mr. President, I now wish to enter into the Record a few remarks  regarding section 105 of the Music Modernization Act, or MMA, which the  Senate recently passed.   An important policy objective of the MMA is to bring legal certainty  to areas of the music licensing marketplace where it is lacking today  in order to benefit songwriters, recording artists, music users, and  ultimately listeners. In the market for the public performance of  musical works, where no governing statutory framework exists, that  certainty has long been provided by the Department of Justice, DOJ,  consent decrees with ASCAP and BMI.   To ensure that certainty remains in that market, section 105 of the  MMA creates a process that will enable Congress to exercise an ongoing  oversight role over decisions by DOJ to review, modify, or terminate  the ASCAP or BMI consent decree. Terminating either of these decrees  without a viable legislative alternative in place would create the very  market uncertainty that the MMA seeks to remedy.   For that reason, in the event DOJ elects to undertake a review of the  ASCAP or BMI consent decree, the MMA instructs DOJ to consult with and  report to Congress throughout that review. Such a process will enable  Congress to act on any needed legislative improvements or replacement  of the consent decree framework as a precursor to DOJ action to  terminate the decrees.   Importantly, in the event that DOJ decides to move to terminate  either the ASCAP or BMI consent decree, including through a motion to  sunset the decree after a specified period of time, the MMA requires  DOJ to notify the House and Senate Committees on the Judiciary of its  intent to file such a motion ``a reasonable time before'' filing the  motion. The purpose of this provision is to provide adequate time for  congressional consultation and any legislative action that may be  necessary as the result of a motion to terminate the decree. The bill's  sponsors believe that such notification is required under section 105  and that ``a reasonable time'' means at least 90 days before a motion  to terminate is filed, in order to provide adequate notice to Congress.                            ____________________
