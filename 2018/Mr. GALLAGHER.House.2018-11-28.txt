 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on  this bipartisan legislation spearheaded by my distinguished colleague  from Wisconsin.  [[Page H9678]]    As a Gallagher in good standing, I am glad this bill will strengthen  our Nation's ties with Ireland. But just as importantly, I take a  minute to recognize the value of the underlying E-3 visa program to the  U.S.-Australia alliance.   The E-3 visa program was negotiated in 2005 following the conclusion  of the U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement. The visa is designed to  give highly skilled and professional Australians access to U.S.  employment in fields and trades that require specialized education and  training.   It is good for both the United States and Australia. About 82,000  Americans are employed by Australian businesses in the United States,  for example, with an average salary of $98,000.   In just one example, the very first employee of the Movember  Foundation in the United States was an Australian who came over on an  E-3 visa. Movember is now one of the largest nongovernment investors in  prostate cancer research and services in the world, growing its  footprint here in the United States as it has created jobs while doing  good.   This program is a tangible recognition of the close and enduring  partnership, or mateship, as we say, between the United States and  Australia, which we are celebrating the 100-year anniversary of this  year.   Our alliance remains one that not only drives our prosperity but our  security as well. As a pillar of a free and open Indo-Pacific,  Australia is an indispensable ally in an increasingly contested region,  and we would be wise to continue exploring new avenues to further  strengthen our relationship.   This legislation is an important opportunity to expand our  partnership with Ireland, while preserving the original intent of the  E-3 visa program with Australia, and I urge my colleagues to support  this bill.                                time  1715
