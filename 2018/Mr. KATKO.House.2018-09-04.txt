Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5869, the Maritime  Border Security Review Act, sponsored by the gentlewoman from Puerto  Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon), my friend and colleague.   With increasing focus on the threats at the southwest border, we must  be mindful that our adversaries can and will adapt as they seek to gain  entry into our homeland. As illicit pathways are squeezed on the  southwest border, the Nation's maritime border is a likely alternative  route for our adversaries to utilize.   The brave men and women of the United States Coast Guard are  responsible for patrolling our Nation's maritime border, conducting  counter-drug and migrant interdiction operations, as well as search and  rescue missions to ensure the safety and legitimacy of travel and trade  in the maritime environment.   The Coast Guard also interdicts and often rescues migrants who are  attempting to reach the United States not only from the Caribbean and  Latin American region but, as recent cases have indicated, from  countries outside the Western Hemisphere, including China, India,  Pakistan, and Jordan.   Cocaine is one of the most highly trafficked drugs throughout the  maritime border, especially in the transit zone, a 7-million-square- mile area that includes the sea corridors of the western Atlantic  Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the eastern Pacific  Ocean. I know that firsthand from the time I spent for 2 years in the  mid-nineties prosecuting international drug organizations in San Juan,  Puerto Rico.   The Coast Guard interdicts thousands of pounds of cocaine every year;  though, according to the DHS Office of Inspector General, only about  8.2 percent of the total cocaine flow through the transit zone was  interdicted in fiscal year 2017.   Unfortunately, we currently do not have the resources to turn back or  interdict all the threats in the maritime environment. To make matters  worse, the devastating effects of the 2017 hurricane season diminished  local law enforcement operational capabilities and resources available  to combat maritime-based threats in the U.S. territories, putting  further strain on our Federal law enforcement agents and officers.   Many of the hurricane-affected areas are still not back to pre- hurricane conditions. Under this environment, by the time a threat  reaches our coastal waters, it is too easy to slip into the country and  often too late, from a law enforcement standpoint, to intercept that  threat.   H.R. 5869 requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to conduct a  threat analysis of the greater U.S. maritime border, to include the  territorial waters of Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands  as well as the transit zone. The bill requires the examination of  terrorist and criminal threats posed by individuals and groups seeking  to enter the U.S. through the maritime border.   The bill also requires the Secretary to identify vulnerabilities in  law, policy, and cooperation between State, territorial, and local law  enforcement, and it asks the Secretary to review the impact of the  geographic challenges of the maritime border and of Hurricanes Harvey,  Irma, Maria, and Nate on general border security activities related to  the maritime border.   The Maritime Border Security Review Act is a necessary and timely  piece of legislation, and I want to thank the gentlewoman from Puerto  Rico for introducing it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting H.R. 5869,  and I reserve the balance of my time.

Sincerely,                                                      Bill Shuster,      Chairman.                                   ____                                     Committee on Homeland Security,                                        House of Representatives,                                  Washington, DC, September 4, 2018.      Hon. Bill Shuster,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Shuster: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 5869, the ``Maritime Border Security Review Act.'' I       appreciate your support in bringing this legislation before       the House of Representatives, and accordingly, understand       that the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will       not seek a sequential referral on the bill, to the extent it       may have a jurisdictional claim.        The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual       understanding that by foregoing a sequential referral of this       bill, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure does       not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained       in this bill or similar legislation in the future. In       addition, should a conference on this bill be necessary, I       would support a request by the Committee on Transportation       and Infrastructure for conferees on those provisions       determined to be within its jurisdiction.        I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional       Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor.       I thank you for your cooperation in this matter.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,                                                          Chairman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon).   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman  Katko for leading this effort today. I want to thank the chairman of  the committee and Ranking Member Thompson for supporting this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on behalf of my bill, H.R. 5869,  the Maritime Border Security Review Act.   As we move to secure our borders, it is imperative that we confront  the threats posed by criminal and drug trafficking organizations  seeking to enter the Nation through our maritime frontier. Illicit  trafficking through the transit zone, a 7-million-square-mile area,  includes the sea corridors of the western Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean  Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the eastern Pacific Ocean. This is the  transit zone.   According to the Coast Guard, the total known flow of undocumented  migrants attempting to enter the U.S. by maritime routes in 2017 was  almost 4,800 individuals. The known cocaine flow throughout the transit  zone reached about 2,700 metric tons in 2017.   This bill also addresses the public safety challenges faced by Puerto  Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, the only two U.S. territories located  geographically within the transit zone.   The United States' Caribbean border has long been exploited as both a  destination and a transshipment point for illicit drugs shipped to the  mainland, endangering the lives of Americans in the two territories,  but also in the continental U.S. About two-thirds of the cocaine  transiting the Caribbean in early 2016 was destined for the U.S., most  of it being smuggled through Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.   In 2017, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers seized about  66,000 pounds of narcotics in and around Puerto Rico from drug cartels  and smugglers. And let me tell you something: The CBP, or the Customs  and Border Patrol, is outside the mainland. So this is the only CBP  office outside the mainland operating not just in Puerto Rico and the  U.S. Virgin Islands, but our frontier with Venezuela and the whole  Caribbean. The year 2017 was a record high for drug smugglers over the  previous year.   Last year's devastating hurricane season disrupted interdiction  efforts in the United States' maritime border. According to the 2019  Threat Assessment from the Puerto Rico/U.S. Virgin Islands High  Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, the damage inflicted by the storms  severely diminished the operational capabilities of local and Federal  law enforcement on both islands.   The U.S. Coast Guard recently testified before the U.S. Senate that  responding in force to the hurricanes meant fewer resources for drug  interdiction and border protection. They also admitted that, despite  their best efforts, they have struggled to keep up with the volume of  illicit traffic due to a shortage of planes, ships, helicopters, and  resources, further highlighting the needs at our maritime border.   H.R. 5869 would help us better understand these and other challenges  the United States faces along its maritime border by requiring the  Secretary of Homeland Security to conduct a detailed threat analysis of  the region. These assessments must include the terrorism and criminal  threats posed by those seeking to enter the U.S. throughout the  maritime border; improvements needed at all U.S. seaports to reduce  criminal activity; and all vulnerabilities in law that prevent  effective border security, similar to those recently released in the  Northern Border Threat Analysis of 2017 that were approved by the House  of Representatives.   The Secretary of Homeland Security must consider technology and  personnel needs, the role of State and local enforcement in border  security activities, the geographic challenges of the region, and the  impact of last year's hurricanes on general border security activities.  [[Page H7798]]    Protecting and ensuring the safety of the American people both on the  mainland and in the territories is very important not just for me, but  for all of us, and should be one of our priorities. An assessment of  the threats posed at our Nation's maritime border will help us achieve  just that. The reason behind this bill is to promote that kind of  analysis.    I want to thank Chairman McCaul, Ranking Member Thompson, and  Congressmen Katko and Perry for their leadership in assisting and  moving forward this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support  H.R. 5869.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I will be prepared to close in a moment, but I do want  to follow up on a couple of remarks from my colleague from Puerto Rico.   I served there as a Federal organized crime prosecutor in the mid- 1990s in San Juan, and during that time I saw firsthand how much of a  vulnerability the maritime areas have of the United States in general,  but Puerto Rico in particular.   The HIDTA report, which refers to the high intensity drug trafficking  report, talks about severely diminished capabilities for law  enforcement post-hurricane. But that doesn't begin to describe what  really goes on down there.   When I first walked into the U.S. Attorney's Office in 1996 in Puerto  Rico, there were about five or six major fast boats lined up in a  parking lot that had been seized. They were seized because of large  shipments of cocaine coming across the water directly from Colombia,  which is only about 500 nautical miles away. These boats could go  anywhere within Puerto Rico. It doesn't have to come to a port. It can  pull up to shore anywhere and offload whatever contraband they are  trafficking.   Certainly any one of those boats carried millions upon millions of  dollars of poison that were going into drug users in this country, but  they could easily be carrying terrorists. Once they get into Puerto  Rico, you are in the United States. That is what people have to  understand. Once you are in the United States, there is more customs  scrutiny.   So getting it into Puerto Rico, St. Thomas, or the Virgin Islands, or  other territories of the United States, and not knowing what those  vulnerabilities are is a serious gap in our security in this Nation.   We did a similar threat assessment of the northern border, and it was  very illuminating to see how much the northern border is wide open and  how much of a threat it actually is. I would venture to guess that what  we will see from this report when it is issued is much more eye- opening. It is a vulnerability in the world where people don't want us  to survive as a democracy and, instead, want to impose terroristic  views on our society. It is incumbent we pass this bill to get the full  scope of the extent of the threat.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent to reclaim the balance of my time.      The online version has been corrected to read: has created  should not absolve him from responsibility for the grave  humanitarian situation in Puerto Rico. Mr. THOMPSON of  Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to reclaim the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5869,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 6374) to require the Department of Homeland Security to  streamline Federal contractor fitness determinations, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6374         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 6374, the Fitness  Information Transparency Act of 2018, otherwise known as the FIT Act.  This legislation seeks to improve how the Department of Homeland  Security vets the character and conduct of contractor employees, known  as a fitness determination.   Homeland Security relies on thousands of contractor employees every  day to achieve its missions. From IT work to construction and  janitorial services, Homeland Security and contractor employees work  hand in hand to secure our Nation. With the department's unique mission  of protecting the homeland, it is vital that everyone working for  Homeland Security, be it a Federal employee or a contractor employee,  is appropriately vetted to ensure that he or she will uphold the  integrity of the department. However, Homeland Security's fitness  determination process is bureaucratic in the worst ways: inefficient,  inconsistent, and lacking transparency.   Currently, the Office of Personnel Management sets minimum fitness  standards for all Federal contractors. However, each Homeland Security  component can apply the criteria differently, creating disparate  standards across the department. For example, a contractor employee who  has been deemed fit to work for the Federal Emergency Management  Agency, or FEMA, may not automatically be deemed fit to work for  Customs and Border Protection.   Many contract personnel support a variety of Homeland Security  components and may be required to receive separate fitness  determinations from each component, creating duplicity and  inefficiency. Such inefficiency not only delays the time a contractor  employee can start providing necessary services to Homeland Security,  but because the contracting company builds the lag time into the bid  price, this process also increases the cost to Homeland Security and,  ultimately, to the United States taxpayers.   This legislation will require Homeland Security to consolidate its  varying fitness standards by creating uniform fitness requirements for  each position risk level. By doing so, Homeland Security will achieve  department-wide uniformity and reciprocity of fitness standards,  therefore eliminating the need for one contractor to undergo multiple  fitness investigations.   The FIT Act also reduces bureaucratic redundancies by allowing, when  appropriate, the Secretary of Homeland Security to deem someone who  possesses a security clearance to also be considered fit to work for  Homeland Security.   Moreover, this legislation increases transparency into the fitness  determination process by requiring Homeland Security to publish the  uniform fitness standards, provide monthly status updates to contractor  representatives, and report certain information to Congress.   It is important that Homeland Security vet each and every contractor  employee prior to working for the department. The FIT Act provides  Homeland Security the flexibility it needs to vet contract workers for  its diverse missions, while also making the process to do so more  efficient and more transparent.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting H.R. 6374,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I echo the sentiments of my good friend and  colleague from New Jersey. I once again urge my colleagues to support  H.R. 6374, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 6447) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to establish the  position of Chief Data Officer of the Department of Homeland Security,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6447         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Homeland       Security Chief Data Officer Authorization Act''.       SEC. 2. CHIEF DATA OFFICER OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND                     SECURITY.         Section 703 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C.       343) is amended by adding at the end the following new       subsection:        ``(c) Chief Data Officer.--        ``(1) In general.--The Secretary, in consultation with the       Chief Information Officer, shall designate a career appointee       (as such term is defined in section 3132 of title 5, United       States Code) of the Department as the Chief Data Officer of       the Department.        ``(2) Qualifications.--The Chief Data Officer shall possess       demonstrated training and experience in the management,       governance, generation, collection, protection, analysis,       use, and sharing of data, including the protection and de-      identification of personally identifiable information.        ``(3) Functions.--The Chief Data Officer shall be       responsible for the following:        ``(A) Ensuring that the Department conforms with data       management best practices recognized across industry and the       Federal Government.        ``(B) Coordinating the organization and integration of data       across the Department for improved interoperability,       analysis, and decision-making.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6447, the Department of  Homeland Security Chief Data Officer Authorization Act, sponsored by my  colleague, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Carter).   In today's data-driven world, organizations like the Department of  Homeland Security generate, collect, and maintain enormous quantities  of data in carrying out their day-to-day operations. Unfortunately,  data continues to be underutilized as an asset by organizations,  especially in the Federal Government, largely as a result of poor  internal data management and governance practices.   To address these shortcomings, the private sector and Federal, State,  and local entities have increasingly begun appointing the position of  chief data officer to their management teams. Such a position would  work to improve data management and governance at an organization in  order to format data for better analysis and use.   The work conducted by chief data officers can help organizations  achieve operational efficiencies, improve policy insight and  decisionmaking, achieve data interoperability across legacy IT systems,  and increase transparency.   To date, several entities within Homeland Security, including  Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, have designated chief data  officers. Recognizing this growing trend, H.R. 6447 authorizes the  Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with Homeland  Security's chief information officer, to designate a Homeland Security- wide chief data officer.   The chief data officer is tasked with overseeing policies to manage,  organize, and format Homeland Security data in order to better carry  out data analysis for use in departmental operations.   Additionally, H.R. 6447 requires the heads of all Homeland Security  operational components, in consultation with the chief data officer and  component chief information officers, to appoint component-level chief  data officers.   Homeland Security is charged with the responsibility of keeping our  homeland and its citizens safe. As such, it is imperative that Homeland  Security possess the capability and capacity and tools to make informed  decisions in today's rapidly evolving threat environment. The  appointment of chief data officers at the department and its components  is integral to providing Homeland Security with the tools to make data- driven decisions in the 21st century.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers. If the gentlewoman  from New Jersey has no other speakers, I am prepared to close once she  does.    Mr. Speaker, I agree with my colleague and friend from New  Jersey. It is always a pleasure to work on bills with her because there  is always very good bipartisan spirit. I think that is something that  is lost often in this Chamber.   I am happy to support this bill. It is commonsense legislation, and I  urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 6265) to ensure that only travelers who are members of a trusted  traveler program use Transportation Security Administration security  screening lanes designated for trusted travelers, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6265         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 6265, the  PreCheck is PreCheck Act of 2018. The name of this bipartisan  legislation demonstrates my belief that the Transportation Security  Administration should use its PreCheck screening lanes at airport  checkpoints as they were originally intended.   This bipartisan bill codifies a solution to a longstanding  frustration that I and others have reiterated to TSA on many occasions:  PreCheck lanes should not be used as tools to manage congestion for  passengers in an airport. Instead of employing a one-size-fits-all  approach to passenger security screening, the concept underlying TSA's  PreCheck program is one of risk-based security.   This should, when applied as intended, save taxpayer dollars and  result in an enhanced security checkpoint experience for all travelers.  However, the stated benefits of the PreCheck program have been  consistently undermined by TSA's practice of moving unvetted passengers  into PreCheck lanes for the sake of expediency.   I have said it before and I will say it again: Security cannot be  sacrificed for expediency.   This legislation will require TSA to ensure that only travelers who  are members of trusted traveler programs are permitted to use PreCheck  security screening lanes at TSA checkpoints throughout the country.   To address the issue of passenger throughput, H.R. 6265 also provides  a framework for TSA to expedite screening for passengers who have been  determined to pose a lower risk to aviation security.   The effects of this legislation will be far-reaching. By restoring  the PreCheck program to its original purpose, passengers who have  elected to participate will experience a shorter checkpoint process  they were promised when they first enrolled in the program.  Additionally, passengers will be more incentivized to enroll in a  trusted traveler program when it is working as it should.   To achieve TSA's stated goal of enrolling 25 million passengers by  the end of 2019, restricting PreCheck expedited screening lanes to  vetted, enrolled passengers is a necessity.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member of the subcommittee, my  friend, the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman), for  cosponsoring this bill and for her leadership on this issue. I also  thank my good friend Congressman Keating for his bipartisan support of  this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this act, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to echo the sentiments of my colleague from New  Jersey, the gentlewoman, Mrs. Watson Coleman. She is exactly right.  This program is not being used like it is supposed to be used.   The idea of PreCheck was to have a known, trusted traveler program, a  traveler program where someone walks through and gets a different level  of scrutiny because you know enough about them in advance. When you put  people through that same lane and they get a different level of  scrutiny that they shouldn't have because you don't know about them, it  entirely defeats the purpose of the bill. With terrorism what it is  today and the zest to try to attack our aviation industry, it is not a  time we should be cutting corners to manage traffic.   Mrs. Watson Coleman is exactly right. We need to have more people  staffing these lanes, and we need to have a better running of the  PreCheck program itself. If they did those two things, then we would be  okay; but we cannot cut corners when it comes to security, especially  in the aviation sector.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6265, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 6461) to amend title 49, United States Code, to establish in the  Transportation Security Administration a National Deployment Office,  and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6461, the TSA National  Deployment Force Act, sponsored by my good friend and the ranking  member of the Subcommittee on Transportation and Protective Security,  Mrs. Watson Coleman.   TSA security operations happen 365 days per year at nearly 440  federalized airports. Our Nation depends on the professionals at TSA  who are on the front lines every single day to keep our transportation  systems moving and secure.   In testimony before the committee, Administrator Pekoske has stated  that TSA's greatest assets are its people, and I could not agree more.  Transportation security officers are tasked with a zero-fail mission,  and their dedication to duty is what helps keep traveling Americans  secure when they fly within our civil aviation system.   With a strengthening economy, passenger volume has surged over the  past few years and is expected to go much higher in the years to come,  and TSA has often struggled to accommodate massive traveler volume  increases at checkpoints. However, one of the most practical, useful,  and helpful tools in TSA's toolbox, the National Deployment Force,  helps TSA alleviate long lines at airport checkpoints, providing both a  national security value by minimizing public area security risk and  providing efficiency by reducing passenger wait times.   This legislation authorizes the National Deployment Force, or NDF,  within TSA to provide rapid and efficient response capabilities.   The NDF is comprised of transportation security officers who may be  deployed across the country to supplement existing TSA staffing during  periods of high seasonal demand, natural disasters, national special  security events, or other scenarios requiring additional security  screening support.   Recently, the NDF has provided critical screening support for large- scale events requiring additional security, such as the Super Bowl and  in the wake of Hurricane Harvey. Given the anticipated increases in  passenger growth, this bipartisan legislation will help ensure that TSA  has the resources  [[Page H7810]]  it needs to quickly respond to influxes in passenger volume at specific  airports.   I am proud to cosponsor this bipartisan legislation with my good  friend and colleague from New Jersey to authorize a National Deployment  Force and help make TSA the agile agency the American people expect and  deserve.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6461.   I agree with the comments of my colleague from New Jersey, and I  think that this commonsense legislation will give TSA more flexibility  and more elasticity in facing the ongoing challenges with staffing  issues at airports, especially during peak travel times.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
