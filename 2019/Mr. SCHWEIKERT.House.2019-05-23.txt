 Madam Speaker, to the committee chairman and, in my  world, the chairman for life, you have done great.   It has been an interesting experience being in the minority, but we  are blessed. We have freaky-smart people on the committee. It works.  Even when we disagree, at least the debate and the discussion is fairly  highbrow.   I, too, am concerned on the 529, more so because of the flexibility  and, being the daddy of a 3\1/2\-year-old, not completely knowing if  there are going to be any special needs coming, that choice. We should  love and embrace the concept of that flexibility to take care of our  little people.   I am very encouraged that there is movement towards incentivizing it  and  [[Page H4140]]  making it easier, particularly for smaller businesses, to offer access  into retirement accounts.   We need to have the conversation--and it is uncomfortable for all of  us--go a bit further.   The amount of our society that is now in independent-contractor  relationships, should we be allowed to use technology so that  population also starts to have more and more savings for the future? We  just need to deal with it. That is where much of the economy, in a  demand economy, is going.   My last caveat--and I am voting for the bill. We have come a long  ways. I do worry a little bit about the special agreement on  newspapers, only because if we are truly worried about protecting  workers into their retirement years, do we want to create more even  special, special, special small cutouts where we are allowing the  underfunding of a pension system?   We just need to think that through a little more from an ethical  standpoint. Do we keep creating carve-out after carve-out after carve- out that creates a fragility for that retired population?   Even though we think we are helping the businesses survive, we  actually hurt the future chances of those retirees getting their  checks. We need to be careful on that.
