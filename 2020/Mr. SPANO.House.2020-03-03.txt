 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the great State of  Florida.   On this day in 1845, Florida became the 27th State to join our Union  and has had a strong impact on our Nation ever since.   From producing 70 percent of our Nation's citrus, to ranking number 2  in vegetables harvested, Florida, as an agricultural powerhouse, has  long been critical in feeding hungry Americans. Our State's importance  to our national security also can't be understated.   Florida is home to 3 of 11 unified combatant commands--Central  Command, Southern Command, and Special Operations Command. I am so  honored to represent a district home to 57,000 veterans, part of the  1.5 million who call the Sunshine State home.   Florida is also a major tourism destination as millions from around  the world flock to our shores to enjoy our beaches, food, culture, and  theme parks.   I am grateful to have been born and raised in Florida and to  represent the 15th District. I look forward to working with the Florida  delegation to continue bettering the lives of all our State residents  for generations to come.                            ____________________
