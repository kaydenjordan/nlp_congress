 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  to include any extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, for years, the Congressional  Progressive Caucus has fought to give working families the dignity they  deserve for the work they perform for our communities and our economy.  The increase of the minimum wage to $15 an hour is an important step to  accomplish this goal.   Our caucus is pleased that 14 years after Congress last increased the  minimum wage, we are finally close to seeing an increase become law.  The American Rescue Plan is intended to help those most impacted by the  pandemic's financial hardships. The increase in the minimum wage will  help those most vulnerable essential workers. It will put money into  the economy and into our local businesses. It will help jump-start our  recovery.   This is also about the dignity of work. This is a bill that will  grant people the dignity of work with a living wage. When we don't  provide a living minimum wage to American workers, they have to work  several jobs or rely on food stamps or other government subsidies to  put a roof over their head or food on the table.   Rather than subsidizing corporations who pay their workers poverty  wage, let's invest in families. Our workers put value and love into the  work they do day in and day out. But Congress hasn't raised the minimum  wage in over a decade. It is set so low, it is unsustainable for  anyone. It was unsustainable before the pandemic, and now it is  impossible for anyone to survive off the minimum wage alone.   If we don't raise the wage, we will be turning our backs on the  essential workers, on the same workers who have been keeping our  country running for the last year. We will be turning our backs on  working families.   Everybody--we hear it all the time--is thanking our essential  workers. Thank you, essential workers. We recognize now that those who  work in our grocery stores, who care for our elderly, who pick our  foods, who keep our schools and hospitals clean are maintaining our  country through this pandemic.   So while we are thanking them, we are thanking them for putting their  lives at stake every time they go to work. You know what? That thank  you is hollow if we don't back it up with action. That thank you is  meaningless unless we say we are willing to not only thank you, but to  actually pay you a wage that will allow you to live and pay your rent  and buy your food and take care of your children.   Finally, we are going to put that thank you into action. We are going  to do that tomorrow because tomorrow we are going to fulfill our  commitment to workers and we are going to include the minimum wage in  the American Rescue Plan.   So let's not lose sight either of the fact that this minimum wage is  about our values, but it is also about family values because this is a  bill, the American Rescue Act, that includes the minimum wage, that  values families.                                time  1945    And why? Because we have all heard the stories of those families,  those parents--whether they are a single parent or two parents, or two  parents and their kids--are working. We have all heard those stories,  that the minimum wage we have now set at $7 in many places, that that  is not enough to pay the rent.   And so what do people need to do? They need to take a second job.  They need to work longer hours. They need to do overtime.   And what happens when you are working two jobs or overtime? Do you  then have time to coach Little League, to coach your daughter's soccer  team, to spend that extra time reading to your kids? The reality is you  don't.  [[Page H711]]    So if we value families, we will pay the parents enough so that they  have enough time to spend with their families.   Mr. Speaker, this is about taking families out of poverty. This is  about taking children out of poverty. And this is about allowing them  to come out of poverty through their employment.   Now, there are criticisms out there that raising the wage will close  businesses and that people will lose their jobs. I am here to tell you  from experience that that won't happen. We have had many economists who  have talked about the fact that that won't happen.   But let me tell you, I have got experience. Because in 2002, Santa Fe  increased the minimum wage. We called it back then--and that is why I  will sometimes fall into saying, ``a living wage.'' We increased the  minimum wage, and we did it because we wanted to help people. We wanted  to take the first step to bring people out of poverty.   So the living-wage effort that we did in Santa Fe was a broad  coalition that included businesses, it included grassroots activists,  it included governments, it also included the faith community and the  Catholic Church.   This faith community and the Catholic Church, they saw it as a  Christian value, that people deserve to earn a living wage for their  hard work. And the first 5 years after passage, not only were  businesses not harmed, but the number of establishments, the number of  small businesses in Santa Fe grew.   From 2012 to 2017, both the number of small businesses and the number  of people employed by small businesses in Santa Fe increased, all while  seeing higher wages every single year. Because what we did in Santa Fe  was, we said we need to make this decision now, and then do what we are  doing in our bill, which is index it so that we don't have to have this  fight all the time, and so that we don't set a minimum wage, which is  then a poverty wage, if we don't act.   So in Santa Fe, we did that. And it didn't kill job growth. It didn't  harm businesses, but it did help families. It helped stimulate our  economy. It made our communities stronger. It was so successful that  the county then adopted a similar living wage. And it was so successful  in the city and the county that the State of New Mexico raised the  minimum wage as well.   Here in the House, we will do what we did in Santa Fe and New Mexico.  We will do our job to provide workers across the Nation with a wage  that reflects the hard work that they do for us. We will thank them  with our legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to also urge the Senate to lead with the kind  of empathy and compassion that our citizens and our constituents and  our communities expect of us. And if you lead with empathy and  compassion, you will also pass an American Rescue Plan that includes  the minimum wage.   Mr. Speaker, I am glad to be on the floor today with my Progressive  Caucus colleagues this evening.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin).    Congressman Levin, I think you raised exactly  the points that we have been talking about.   This minimum wage, it should be a floor. And it is something that  everybody supports. Everybody supports it, whether you are a  Republican, whether you are a Democrat, and it is time to get it done.    Congressman Levin, I love the way you describe  this as a ``floor of decency.'' And it is our moral compass that tells  us that we must vote for this and we must vote for families now. And so  we have heard what is happening in your State.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms.  Adams), so she can explain why this is supported in her district and  her State.                                time  2000     Congresswoman Adams, that was such a forceful  description of why it is so necessary for us to act, to act on this  moral imperative, which we are facing in this moment.   We have to remember this is a historic moment, so this is our time to  take historic action. When we say thank you to those essential workers,  we must express our gratitude in things like the minimum wage because  without that, then they are just words.    Working hard enough is not enough if you can't  make ends meet. Those are wonderful words.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from  Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).    Mr. Speaker, Congresswoman Tlaib talked about  the fact that now is the time. There is a call and an urgency for us to  do this because it is the time of the pandemic. It is the time of such  great suffering.   My father had a saying that when it was time to get important stuff  done, he would say, ``Ahora es cuando,'' it is time now. His saying is  ringing through your words, and it is calling upon us to say what we  need to say so that we do what we need to do and raise the wage. So,  ahora es cuando. It is, indeed, time now.   Thank you for explaining the urgency of what it is like to have to  boil your water because you can't afford the utility bill. That should  break all of our hearts, and it should urge us each to act and to act  now with the power that we have been given by our constituents.   I would now like to turn to one of my colleagues, one of our freshman  class from New York City, Congressman Torres.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Torres).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Torres.   What he has told us today is about the fact that there are districts  in the country, including mine, including so many that we have heard  about, where the minimum wage is too low. What we can't do is we can't  have a United States of America where what you earn depends on where  you live. That is what we are trying to do today, is say that where you  live does not impact what you earn or where you work.   Today, at a Senate hearing, Costco announced that it would begin  paying their workers a $16-an-hour minimum wage. They have already  recognized that that $15 level is too low, and they want to keep their  workers.   The reality is, we know that when people are paid well, then the  turnover is less. The commitment is better, and paying a minimum wage,  paying something where somebody can go home to their children, can put  that food on the table without relying on SNAP benefits, that they can  then say: I have done it. I can go work. I can come home.   And it doesn't matter whether I live in your district, whether I live  in Seattle, or whether I live in Coronado. It doesn't matter because  there is a floor that is the same across the country, and it is not a  poverty wage.                                time  2015    What we have now is a poverty wage. That is very clear. If you cannot  use the minimum wage that we have now to pay your rent, to buy your  food, and to pay your utilities, then that is the equivalent of a  poverty wage. We know that. We know that because of the wages we have  across our country.   We have all worked. Congressman Torres, you have worked and looked to  see: When does the Community Development Block Grant come in? Does it  look like we are a distressed community or not? They look at what that  median income is, and if you are earning the median wage, you are in  poverty, right?    Mr. Speaker, earlier we spoke about the fact  that to say thank you to these essential workers regularly and over and  over again but to refuse to pay a living wage, a minimum wage of at  least what we are asking for in this bill, is really not saying thank  you at all, is it? It rings hollow.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.
