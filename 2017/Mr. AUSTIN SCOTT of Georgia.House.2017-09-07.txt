 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment would  increase the appropriations for the Western Hemisphere regional  security cooperation account by $10 million and reduce the  appropriation for contributions to the international organizations  account by $10 million.   These funds will be appropriated to the International Narcotics and  Law Enforcement Affairs account and are available for 2 years. Thus,  the State Department would have to obligate the funds within that  timeframe.   Mr. Chairman, we lose between 4,000 and 5,000 of our fellow Americans  to drug overdoses every month. This amendment reallocates $10 million  to the International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs account at  the State Department. This will provide additional resources to combat  the dangerous and illegal actions of transnational criminal  organizations by supporting the efforts of the Government of Colombia  in enhancing regional security capabilities to provide training and  technical assistance to partners in Central and South America.   Over the years, Colombia has made continuous progress in abating  narcotics trafficking through various eradication operations and law  enforcement efforts. Between 2009 and 2013, Colombia trained more than  22,000 military and law enforcement officers from Central America and  the Caribbean countries in security operations and human and drug  trafficking interdiction.   By increasing funding for training and assistance activities  conducted by Colombian police and military forces, we enable Colombia  to train even more regional police forces to function independently.   As it is here in the U.S., local law enforcement serves as the  foundation for interdiction and counter-drug operations in Central  American and Caribbean countries. Our strategic partnership with  Colombia is aimed at producing both short- and long-term results in  regional security.   Over time, Colombian training and expertise provided to  underdeveloped regional police forces will decrease reliance on U.S.  funding. Part of this progress includes the development of Colombia's  rural police force, where a vast majority of narcotics are grown,  produced, and prepped for export to the United States.   Just a few months ago, I had the opportunity to visit the Joint  Interagency Task Force South and SOUTHCOM's headquarters in Florida to  hear and see firsthand the challenges that migrant and drug  interdiction within the Caribbean region pose on homeland and national  security.   I can tell you that it was an eye-opening experience, and I  appreciate even more the work our Federal and local enforcement  agencies are doing in interdiction and intervention.   When it comes to stemming the flow of narcotics to the United States,  a big part of overcoming the challenges we face is ensuring that our  strategic partners have the support they need to continue their efforts  to tackle these threats head-on.   We must continue to support these efforts. They play a critical role  in not only reducing the drug flow over our borders, but promoting  stability and peace throughout Central and South America.   It is no secret that the United States faces a drug epidemic that  touches all corners of our Nation. This amendment is just one more  contribution to a multieffort, multinational approach to all law  enforcement personnel involved in these efforts, as well as our allies  in the region. I thank them for the important work they do in reducing  the flow of drugs into the United States.   Mr. Chairman, I encourage adoption of the amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would just reiterate  that it removes less than 1 percent of the account. So 99 percent of  the account remains in place.   It will help reduce the flow of drugs into the United States. We will  lose between 4,000 and 5,000 Americans not next year, but next month.   Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Rogers).                                time  1545     Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance  of my time.
