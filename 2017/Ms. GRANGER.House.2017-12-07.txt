 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this continuing  resolution.   Our most solemn responsibility as Members of Congress is to provide  for our Nation's security.   The world is more dangerous and unstable than at any time in recent  history. The threat from North Korea grows each day. Russia continues  to create instability in Ukraine, the Baltics, and the Balkans. Chinese  is militarizing the South China Sea and modernizing their military at  an alarming pace.   Meanwhile, ISIS and al-Qaida continue to spread their perverted  version of Islam across Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.   We must send a clear message to our adversaries that our military is  prepared to confront anyone who threatens us at any time.   A shutdown in the Department of Defense will only embolden our  adversaries and threaten our national security. Our military needs  stable, predictable, and timely funding to ensure it is prepared to  meet the threats we face now and in the future.   Members demonstrated their commitment to rebuilding our military this  past summer by passing the Make America Secure Appropriations Act,  which included the defense appropriations bill for fiscal year 2018.  Only a budget agreement that gives our men and women in uniform the  funding they need and removes the threat of sequestration will provide  them that certainty.   The House must pass this continuing resolution to allow time for an  agreement to be reached that will fully fund our Nation's defense.  Shutting down the government is not an option.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this very important  legislation.
