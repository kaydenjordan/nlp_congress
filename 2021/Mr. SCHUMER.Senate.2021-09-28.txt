 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Now, Mr. President, last night was a low point in the  recent history of this Chamber. With the government shutdown only days  away and a default crisis coming in a matter of weeks, the Senate was  faced with a simple and urgent question: Shall the Members of this  Chamber allow the Federal Government to pay its debt and stay open, or  will its Members accelerate our country toward a shutdown and a first- ever default?   Yesterday, we got our answer. Republicans voted unanimously-- unanimously--to block legislation to keep the government open and  prevent an unnecessary default on our debt.   Republicans are now the official party of default, the party that  says America doesn't pay its debts; the party that runs up the balance  on the credit card, receives an invoice in the mail, and sends the bill  straight to the shredder.   No average family could get away with what the Republicans are trying  to do; that is for sure. But Republicans here shrug their shoulders and  say: We incurred the debt, but we don't have to pay it. Republicans  would let the country default for the first time in history, and it  will be the American people who pay the price.   Now, Republicans have said for weeks--for weeks--that the United  States must never be allowed to default. They said the debt ceiling, of  course, needed to be raised. They said to do so otherwise was to play  with fire. But when given the chance to actually put the fire out,  Republicans chose to spray it with gasoline instead. And now our  country is staring down the barrel of two Republican-manufactured  crises: a government shutdown and a default on the national debt.    But, fortunately, there is an easy way to stave off disaster. Last  night, the Republican leader--I believe he did again this morning--last  night and this morning, the Republican leader cited an example from the  2000s, during which Republicans held unified control of government and  provided the votes to increase the debt limit. The Republican leader  said that example was ``exactly the situation we are in now.''   What Leader McConnell conveniently left out is that back then, there  was a consent agreement, requested by the Republican majority leader,  that cleared the path for the Senate to vote to increase the debt limit  at a majority threshold--only one party--allowing the minority party to  vote no but also preventing a catastrophic default.   Let me be clear: I am still of the belief that addressing the debt  limit, which includes debts incurred by both parties, should be done in  a bipartisan way. But let's see if Leader McConnell truly wants what he  is asking for, truly wants what he favorably looked upon as happening  in the early 2000s to allow to happen again.   Later this afternoon, I will ask unanimous consent for the Senate to  hold a vote to increase the debt limit at a majority threshold. In  other words, we would get consent that you only need 50 votes, not 60,  on this vote to increase the debt limit. And that is what happened in  the past.   It would be very similar to the process that Leader McConnell cited  yesterday, favorably, which allowed for  [[Page S6713]]  the debt limit to be increased without the minority party providing any  of the votes needed to do so.   So if Republicans want to abscond from their responsibilities, not  vote to pay the debt they incurred, so be it. That is a bad thing. It  is a bad precedent. But this is the way out. It is a way out. It is a  straightforward proposition: If Republicans really want to see the debt  ceiling raised without providing a single vote, I am prepared to hold  that vote. I can't imagine the Republican leader would object to his  own request--his own request.    Mr. President, last night, Senate Republicans voted  unanimously to make a default and a shutdown far more likely and in  doing so, solidified themselves as the party of default, the party that  says America does not pay its debts.   Now, despite yesterday's stunning display of obstruction, the fact  remains  [[Page S6719]]  that we need to raise the debt ceiling, and in a few moments, I will  offer a way forward for us to avoid causing unnecessary and  catastrophic default on the debt.   Over the last 2 days, the Republican leader has repeatedly cited an  instance in the mid-2000s during which Republicans held full control of  the government and voted by themselves to increase the debt limit. Here  is what he said: That is ``exactly the same situation we're in now.''  That is ``exactly the same situation we're in now.''   The Senate was able to raise the debt ceiling at that time because  the then-Republican majority leader made a consent request to this body  that cleared the way for the Senate to increase the debt limit by a  majority threshold instead of requiring 60 votes to break a filibuster.  The minority party, under this agreement, was able to vote no, which is  what they claim they want to do, and the majority party was able to  approve a debt limit extension and prevent a catastrophe.   So we are proposing the same thing today, the same thing the leader  cited and said the situation is exactly the same. Simply allow for a  simple majority threshold to raise the debt ceiling and avoid this  needless catastrophe that Republicans have steered us toward. We are  simply asking Senator McConnell to live by his own example.   We have given the Republicans what they want, and now the ball is in  their court. Let's see if Republicans truly want what they say they  want. We are not asking them to vote yes. If Republicans want to vote  to not pay the debts they helped incur, they can all vote no. We are  just asking Republicans to get out of the way. Get out of the way when  you are risking the full faith and credit of the United States to play  a nasty political game.   We can bring this to a resolution today. Using the drawn-out and  convoluted reconciliation process is far too risky--far too risky. Too  many American families are at stake. Far better for us to solve this  problem right here and right now.   Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that, at a time to be determined by the majority leader following  consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate proceed to the  consideration of S. 2868, a bill to suspend the debt limit, which was  introduced earlier today; that there be 2 hours for debate equally  divided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees; that  upon the use or yielding back of time, the bill be considered read a  third time and the Senate vote on the passage of the bill with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the  Republican leader has offered virtually nothing. He keeps the same  risky process in place. He is totally doing a 180-degree turn from what  he has offered time and again. The Democrats vote yes without any  Republican help, but he refuses to do that. He refuses to do that. Our  proposal is fair. Our proposal is not risky, the way the Republican  leader's is, and his doesn't change a darned thing.   Therefore, I object.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 354.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 293.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum calls  for the cloture motions filed today, September 28, be waived.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session to be in a period of morning business  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 392, submitted  earlier today.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 393, submitted earlier today.    Madam President, I know of no further debate on the  resolution.    I ask unanimous consent that the preamble be agreed to  and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table with no intervening action or debate.    Madam President, I understand that there are three bills  at the desk, and I ask for their first reading en bloc.    I now ask for a second reading, and I object to my own  request, all en bloc.    Finally, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30  a.m., Wednesday, September 29; that following the prayer and pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their  use later in the day, and morning business be closed; that upon the  conclusion of morning business, the Senate proceed to executive session  to resume consideration of the Lewis nomination and that, at 10:30  a.m., the Senate vote on the confirmation of the nomination; further,  that upon disposition of the Lewis nomination, the Senate resume  consideration of the Anderson nomination; that the cloture motions  filed during yesterday's session ripen at 2:30 p.m.; and that the  cloture vote on the Meyer nomination occur immediately after the  cloture vote on the Anderson nomination; finally, that if any  nominations are confirmed on Wednesday, the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Madam President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:52 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, September 29, 2021, at 9:30 a.m.                            ____________________
