 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that each Member  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, I have said it before and I will say it  again: The greatest threat that this pandemic has imposed on the  American people is growing government control over their lives.   A stalled supply chain, exploding inflation, and a crisis at our  southern border are all issues that require immediate attention. Yet,  the Biden administration is not addressing any of these issues.   Instead, President Biden thinks it is a good idea to ignore the  crisis he created and impose a crushing Federal vaccine mandate on  businesses that will affect more than 80 million Americans and decimate  our workforce.   My colleagues and I have had enough with President Biden's tone-deaf  mandates.   Today, I was joined by all 50 Republican Senators and 107 Members in  the House in introducing a Congressional Review Act to nullify  President Biden's vaccine mandate on America's workers and businesses.   This mandate is illegal, and we are fighting to stop it. I am joined  by my colleagues this evening to explain why we need to stop this.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs.  Miller).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr.  Mann).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Allen).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin  (Mr. Grothman).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Oklahoma  (Mr. Hern).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Carter).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr.  Carl).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan  (Mr. Walberg).                                time  1845     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Michigan.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms.  Foxx), a great mentor, an outstanding person, my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.  Burchett), my friend and colleague.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   Madam Speaker, I yield to gentleman from Texas (Mr. Pfluger).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for those  remarks.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Moore).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for those comments.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Estes), my  good friend and colleague.    Madam Speaker, I thank the good gentleman from Kansas.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Smucker), my good friend and fellow Pennsylvanian.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  LaMalfa), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the remarks from the  gentleman of California and all the Members who stood here today. I  thank my colleagues in both the House and the Senate for standing with  the American people in opposition to this blatant overreach by  President Biden.   Our Congressional Review Act resolution puts every Member of Congress  on record. You are either for this blatant government overreach and  control, or you are against it. You are either with this kind of  control, or you are with the American people.   Well, I will tell you right now, my colleagues who spoke here today,  the people who are helping with this Congressional Review Act, my  colleagues in the Senate, we are with the people for whom we work. We  are with the American people, saying they know best.   It is not government that runs things here in America. It is we the  people. We stand with the people in opposing this overreach by the  Biden administration.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
