 Madam President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export  Control Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of  certain proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such  notification, the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale  may be reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   [[Page S6687]]                                                     Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                     Washington, DC.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION     Switzerland--PATRIOT Advanced Capability (PAC) 3 Missile Segment                          Enhanced (MSE) Missiles         The Government of Switzerland has requested to buy up to       seventy-two (72) PATRIOT Advanced Capability (PAC) 3 Missile       Segment Enhanced (MSE) missiles. Also included are telemetry       kits; PAC-3 MSE missile round trainers; PAC-3 MSE empty round       trainers; PAC-3 missile skid kits; launcher stations heater       controls; classified missile repair and return; classified       PAC-3 concurrent spare parts; unclassified PAC-3 concurrent       spare parts; PAC-3 MSE canister consumables; quality       assurance; Field Surveillance Program; U.S. Government and       contractor technical, engineering, and logistics technical       assistance; flight test support; flight test targets; and       other related elements of logistics and program support. The       total estimated cost is $700 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States by helping       to improve the security of a friendly European nation that       continues to be an important force for political stability       and economic progress within Europe.        The proposed sale of the PAC-3 MSE missiles will enhance       the capability of Switzerland's PATRIOT missile defense       system. Switzerland will use the PATRIOT system and missiles       to defend its territorial integrity and for regional       stability. The proposed sale supports Switzerland's goal of       improving national and territorial defense as well as       interoperability with U.S. and NATO forces. Switzerland will       have no difficulty absorbing this equipment into its armed       forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The prime contractor will be Lockheed-Martin, Dallas,       Texas. The purchaser typically requests offsets. Any offset       agreement will be defined in negotiations between the       purchaser and the contractor.        Implementation of this proposed sale will require       approximately five (5) U.S. Government and five (5)       contractor representatives to travel to Switzerland for an       extended period for equipment de-processing/fielding, and       technical and logistics support.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 22-69       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The PATRIOT Advanced Capability (PAC) 3 Missile Segment       Enhanced missile is a small, highly agile, kinetic kill       interceptor for defense against tactical ballistic missiles,       cruise missiles and air-breathing threats. The MSE variant of       the PAC-3 missile represents the next generation in hit-to-      kill interceptors and provides expanded battlespace against       evolving threats. The PAC-3 MSE improves upon the original       PAC-3 capability with a higher performance solid rocket       motor, modified lethality enhancer, more responsible control       surfaces, upgraded guidance software, and insensitive       munitions improvements.        2. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures or       equivalent systems, which might reduce system effectiveness       or be used in the development of a system with similar or       advanced capabilities.        4. A determination has been made that Switzerland can       provide substantially the same degree of protection for the       sensitive technology being released as the U.S. Government.       This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign       policy and national security objectives outlined in the       Policy Justification.        5. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Government of Switzerland.                            ____________________
