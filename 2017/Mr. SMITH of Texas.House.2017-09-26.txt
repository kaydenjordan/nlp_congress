 Mr. Speaker, the President is doing what he was  elected to do--call it shaking up the system, putting the brakes on the  bureaucracy, or creative deconstruction.   Our country simply cannot continue on the same course: where the  government increases the debt by hundreds of billions of dollars every  year; where hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants cross our  border annually, insulting those who play by the rules and wait their  turn in line; where political correctness limits freedom of speech,  especially for conservatives.   The liberal media is trying to shut down this Presidency because they  oppose everything President Trump is trying to do. Mr. Speaker, in this  great conflict, the American people and our democracy could be the  casualties.                            ____________________
