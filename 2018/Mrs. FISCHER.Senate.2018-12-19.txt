 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the service of  my longtime staff member and dear friend, Dusty Vaughan.   After 14 years of service, he is turning a new page in what has been  an impressive and dedicated career of service to the people of  Nebraska.   Dusty was the first person I hired after I was elected to represent  District 43 in the Nebraska State Legislature in 2004. He served in my  legislative office for my entire time in the unicameral, first as my  legislative aide and then as legal counsel of the Transportation and  Telecommunication Committee, which I chaired for 6 years. As a state  senator, I relied on Dusty's expertise to make the best possible  decisions that improved our State and helped Nebraska's families.   Together we accomplished a lot. We got results and Dusty worked  tirelessly to get the ``big stuff' done. Our proudest achievement from  our legislative days was securing the passage of LB 84, the Build  Nebraska Act, which dedicated a quarter cent of every sales tax dollar  to a new highway fund in the State of Nebraska. This was a policy  change for the State and is viewed as a major policy accomplishment in  the last 40 years.   In 2012, after I was elected by the people of Nebraska to serve in  this Chamber, one of my first decisions was to make Dusty my State  director. In the years that followed, when I wasn't here in Washington,  I was likely travelling on the road with him across Nebraska. From  Scottsbluff to Omaha, we visited countless families, organizations,  schools, hospitals, and small businesses. I always enjoyed our many  lunches, ice cream breaks, and discussions about everything from policy  issues to our families. And we have certainly had a lot of laughs--and  a few tears--over these many years.   Each and every day Dusty brought unmatched integrity and heart to  work with him. He is a wonderful example of the true goodness of the  State of Nebraska. I want to thank Dusty's family, his wife, Julie, two  sons Gabe and Kellen, and his two beautiful daughters, Tatum and Zoe,  who lent much of his time, including some busy weekends. I know they  are proud of him, as I am.   Dusty has shown them what it means to be a true humble servant of our  State.   Dusty, I thank you for your positivity, your loyalty, your  friendship, and your faith in Nebraskans. I wish you the very best on  this next chapter of your career, and I know you will continue to get  the big stuff done and make us proud.                            ____________________
