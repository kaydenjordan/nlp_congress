 Mr. Speaker, first I want to thank Chair DeLauro for her  diligent work to bring this CR to the floor in order to fund the  essential services of the federal government at a time when our Nation  needs stable governance.   As Chair of the House Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, I  am pleased that this bill provides $20 million in emergency funding to  the Corps of Engineers for previously authorized water and wastewater  infrastructure improvements, which can be used in Jackson, Mississippi.   I also appreciate the inclusion of $1 billion for the Low-Income Home  Energy Assistance Program to help address pressure on low-income  households' pocketbooks due to inflation caused by pandemic-related  supply chain backups and global energy disruption due to Russia's war  on Ukraine.   As Co-Chair of the bipartisan Congressional Ukraine Caucus, I am  grateful for the inclusion of a new U.S. funding package that will  deliver urgently-needed weapons, equipment, aid, and support to  America's friend and ally Ukraine in her valiant battle for Liberty  against Putin's tyranny.   We have more work ahead of us to pass the full slate of  appropriations bills--including our Energy and Water bill to invest in  American progress, American jobs, American families, and the future of  American communities.   Today, we take a responsible step forward to keep the government  open--and we continue our work to deliver for the American people.
