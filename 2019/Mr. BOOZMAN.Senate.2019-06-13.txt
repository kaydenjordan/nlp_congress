 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and  congratulate Jo McDougall for receiving the Porter Fund's Lifetime  Achievement Award. The Porter Fund's Lifetime Achievement Award is  presented every 5 years to an Arkansas writer with a substantial and  recognized body of work. Jo is just the fourth person to receive this  honor.   Raised on her family's rice farm near DeWitt, Jo discovered her love  for writing and language at a young age when her mother would read to  her each night. She wrote her first poem at just 12 years old, and her  father proudly displayed it on his desk. This inspired her to continue  writing. Jo received an undergraduate degree in home economics from the  University of Arkansas at Fayetteville before returning in 1980 to  pursue her master of fine arts in creative writing.   After earning her MFA, Jo taught at Pittsburg State University in  Kansas for over a decade, codirecting the university's creative writing  department and guiding the writing center and distinguished visiting  writers program. She has taught in Arkansas at Hendrix College in  Conway, AR, and at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock.   Jo's success stretches beyond the classroom. In April of 2018,  Governor Asa Hutchinson appointed her Poet Laureate of Arkansas. She  has published six poetry collections and a memoir, ``Daddy's Money: A  Memoir of  [[Page S3472]]  Farm and Family.'' In 2015, the University of Arkansas Press published  a compilation of Jo's poetry, ``In the Home of the Famous Dead:  Collected Poems.'' Her work is influenced by her Arkansas heritage and  often portrays the lives of rural families and the struggles,  hardships, and everyday challenges they face.   Jo McDougall has earned nationwide recognition throughout her career.  She has been awarded a fellowship from the Arkansas Arts Council and  was inducted into the Arkansas Writers Hall of Fame in 2006. She has  won numerous awards, including the DeWitt Wallace/Reader's Digest  Foundation Award, the Porter Prize, and the Academy of American Poets  Prize.   I congratulate Jo for receiving the Porter Fund's Lifetime  Achievement Award. Her enduring voice, observances on small-town life,  and outstanding accomplishments and contributions in poetry for the  last 40 years have made her more than deserving of this  recognition.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of  long-time journalist and community leader, Linda Seubold, of Fort  Smith, AR who passed away on June 5, 2019.   Linda was an award-winning journalist, magazine editor, and supporter  of Fort Smith. Through constant coverage and commentary, she was a  vocal advocate for the region's historical, educational and cultural  assets such as music, art, and entertainment. Her support was crucial  for the advancement of vital institutions and attractions including the  U.S. Marshals Museum, the area's public libraries, the Elvis Presley  Barbershop Museum, Chaffee Crossing, and the Bass Reeves Statue.   During her 15 years at the Southwest Times Record, Linda was a news  reporter and columnist, a role model, and ``newsroom mom'' to countless  young reporters. She developed an incredible level of trust with local  officials. Everyone knew she would be fair and thorough. Everyone knew  she cared about truth and the good of the community.   Linda was also a trusted professional among her peers. One of her  most difficult assignments was covering an execution by lethal  injection. She was one of two reporters elected to be eyewitnesses as  ``pool'' reporters, who then had to give their notes to the rest of the  media. It was her assignment, and she did it with professional  excellence, according to colleagues present that day who had to rely on  her notes.   Her popular column was a must-read and provided an outlet for her to  share her love of the community and highlight the local music and  entertainment scene. This passion eventually led to her partnership  with Lynn Wasson to create ``Entertainment Fort Smith.'' When the  popular magazine first launched, Linda would say that they started the  publication because she got tired of hearing people say there was  nothing to do. As co-owner and editor, she set out to prove people  wrong by publishing a monthly magazine filled with every imaginable  event. Entertainment Fort Smith grew quickly to become a local staple  for information on the culture, people, and attractions in the region.  It also provided an outlet for her and Lynn to share their passion for  education that was evident in the magazine's commitment to Fort Smith  Partners in Education and all local public schools.   The last 7 years tested Linda in new ways as she fought against  cancer. Her legendary smile, deep faith, and the love of those around  her carried her through and she volunteered for numerous medical trials  that she hoped would benefit future patients.   Linda was born in Fort Smith on October 24, 1942, graduated from Fort  Smith High School in 1960, and attended Fort Smith Junior College. She  was preceded in death by her husband of 55 years, Frank. They were  proud parents of five children, with 12 grandchildren and three great- children.   She will be missed as a cherished mother, grandmother, friend,  community advocate, and professional who truly made a difference for  generations to come.                            ____________________
