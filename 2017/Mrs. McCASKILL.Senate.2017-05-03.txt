 Mr. President, there is a question Americans should  be asking all of us every day: Who are you fighting for? We should be  asking ourselves that. Who are we fighting for?   Here is who Joe Manchin is fighting for--Senator Manchin, my  colleague from West Virginia, and my other colleagues who are here on  the floor: Billy Hull. He is a retired coal miner with 30 years of  working at the Peabody Coal Mine near Montrose, MO. He wrote me a  letter earlier, about 6 months ago, saying in part:         My wife and I, married 59 years fall under the Patriot Coal       Companies Voluntary Employees Beneficial Association. My wife       Earlene is a 2 time cancer survivor and I suffered a stroke       in 2012. If we lose our benefits it will be hard for us to       afford our medicine cost.    So these folks were made a promise by--I am accused of being a fan  girl of this guy, and I am a fan girl of Harry Truman. I think he was  plain-spoken. I think he was earnest, honest, and kept people like  Billy Hull in the front of his mind 24/7--good, salt-of-the-earth,  hard-working people who play by the rules. Mr. Hull played by the  rules. Thousands of coal miners in our State played by the rules, and  their widows played by the rules.   The promise made by Harry Truman deserved to be kept. The promise  deserved to be kept. So my friend, Senator Joe Manchin, decided he  wasn't going to go with the flow around here. He was going--I think he  said at one point on the floor, I think his quote was: If you don't  stand up for something, we don't stand for anything. And he decided  that he was going to get this done.   Now, I have to tell you the truth. For about 2 years, everywhere you  went, you would walk behind Joe, and Joe would be trying to talk to  somebody about the miners. After he would walk off, people would  whisper: You know, it is never going to happen. We are never going to  get this done. It is not going to happen.   I can't tell you how fun it is to celebrate getting something done.   We bail out everybody around here. We bail out Wall Street. We bail  out banks. We bail out corporations. We are busy figuring out how we  can cut the wealthiest's taxes, as we speak. It is all about making it  easier for folks who have plenty. Why is it so hard to help the people  who don't have anything--who depended on a promise, just to have the  basics in their lives, and put in long days of work for years as their  part of that bargain?   I am so proud of Joe Manchin. I can't imagine how proud the coal  miners in his State must be of him. I am glad we had an opportunity to  stand with him as he stood for something. I am proud that we got it  done.   Now we have another big task because there is another bunch of people  out there; really, we are running roughshod over them, and that is a  bunch of truck drivers, truck drivers in my State who have driven  trucks for 35, 40, 45 years, understanding that at the end of that long  period of time, they would have a pension. It is not their fault that  the pension is not there for them.   I have to tell Joe that I have to sign him up. I want Senator Manchin  as the captain of the team as we now go on to fight for the pensions  these people have earned.   If we can bail out everybody we are bailing out, if we can cut taxes  by $7 trillion, surely, we can find the money to make good on these  promises.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.
