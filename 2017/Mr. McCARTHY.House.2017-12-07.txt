 Mr. Speaker, I rise today for the purpose of making a  scheduling announcement.   Mr. Speaker, I first want to thank all the Members for their  flexibility in coming back to town this past Monday. As such, Members  are advised that votes are no longer expected in the House tomorrow,  Friday, December 8.   Members are further advised to be prepared for the House to be in  session the week of December 18. First votes of that week will be  expected at 6:30 p.m. on Monday, December 18.   We all know we have important work to do, including passing the  historic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act for the American people. I think that  will be an excellent Christmas present.  [[Page H9744]]    If there are any further changes to our schedule, I will be sure to  let all Members know.    I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, I will miss the colloquy tomorrow. I  always look forward to speaking with my friend.   Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman knows, the Rules Committee has met, so  we will see a Financial Services bill that they met on. Members will  also get a list of all the suspensions. That will be by close of  business tomorrow.   But the gentleman is right. There is a lot of work to be done. We  have passed CHIP going forward. As the gentleman knows, in this bill  that we just voted on, for those who voted yes, it continues funding  for them for the rest of this year.   Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman knows, this House has passed all 12  appropriations bills, but we have more work to get done.   Knowing my friend is concerned, coming from the Appropriations  Committee as well, I would hope you join with us. We would like to see  the Senate take some actions. I know leadership from both sides of the  aisle has just visited with the President. I hope we can come to an  agreement so we can finish this out.   I also hope the gentleman would join with me in encouraging the  Senate, not just on the appropriations bills, but the 352 bills that we  have out of this House sitting over there.   Mr. Speaker, the part that the American people must know, most of  those bills have very broad bipartisan support.   I am looking forward to a busy 9 days. It will not come up next week,  but if it could, I would bring it up as soon as we come out of  conference because I do believe the American people are waiting for the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to continue what we have gone through.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is right, we have a great  amount of work to do. We just voted on a bill that, I will guarantee  you, 221 Members on this side who carried it, was not the bill they  were seeking. They do not want to look at the troops and say they are  not funded and they are not getting their pay raise that we voted on  earlier.   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman, my friend, has told me, time and again,  funding government is not a game. There was nothing in the bill that we  just passed that both sides could not say that it was a bipartisan  bill. There was nothing on our side of the aisle that we put into that  bill that would give anybody on either side heartache.   But it was not a bill that we should have to have voted on, on this  floor. We did 12 appropriations bills. We should not be voting for  continuing resolutions. That is not why we are elected.   So let's do this. As we make our travel plans back, knowing that we  will be back next week, let's make a commitment to one another, let's  make a commitment to this country, that we will get our work done, that  we will find the common ground, that we will not whip against a bill  just to try to shut a government down, but will find the very best that  this body could come to conclusion with, and that means funding our  troops, and I look forward to working with all of you in the coming  weeks.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, not to continue a debate, because I know  people have places to go, but you said we needed 218 to show it. We  just showed 221. But the one thing I will tell you, when you talk about  bipartisan, when you talked about that CR, 133 on this side voted for  it; more than the majority of the majority. That is where  bipartisanship comes.   I can sit back and we can rehash how many times we met about SCHIP.  We can rehash coming to you and saying: Tell me where you want to go  with that at the end of the day.   We can rehash where your ranking member asked us to pull back on the  markup, and we did. But they still never came. I don't need to rewrite  history and I don't need to walk away from where we tried to get to.   I am proud of the fact that we were able to pass it, with or without  you. But we wanted you with us. You made the decision not to be with  us, and that is okay. That is your decision. But, today, when you  talked and bragged about all of the other times you were there, my only  question is: What is different today?   Let's not make today continue for the future. Let's find the way that  we work together. But at the end of the day, when they look back in  history, there will be 221 on this side and there will be 175 on the  other side that said government should shut down; and I don't think  that is right.   I hope you have a good weekend.
