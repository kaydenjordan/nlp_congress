 Madam President, we are in the same spot in the Senate  we have been at five times before in the past 12 months. My Senate  colleagues are bringing up a bill on voting to federalize our  elections.   This time is different. This time their demands have changed. It is  not just, ``Vote for my bill or take a vote.'' It is, ``If you don't do  this, we will blow up the Senate permanently.'' Oh, that is a different  thing. So let me set some context on this because this requires some  conversation about where we are, what this conversation is all about,  and what this really means for the future.   So first let me begin with the bill itself. There is no question 100  Senators here have all been through an election process. We are all  experts on elections. We have walked through it in a way that most  Americans have never walked through before. We are passionate about  fair elections. We are passionate about the people who actually vote  because those are the people who are actually engaged in our society.  As we have millions of people who check out, don't care, and don't  vote, we encourage people to vote, to pay attention.   The laws in our States are a little bit different on voting because  each State is a little bit different. That is not something new. That  is actually written into the U.S. Constitution. It has been that way  since 1789. They have always been a little bit different.   In 1965, our Nation took a strong, bold step to be able to make sure  that we protected the rights of every single individual to be able to  vote because there was a season in American history where Black  Americans were being pushed out. There were poll taxes. There were Jim  Crow laws. There were things that actually pushed people away from  voting.   So, in 1965, our Nation passed the Voting Rights Act. I will talk a  little bit more about that in a moment. That Voting Rights Act still  stands today to be able to protect the right of every individual in  America to vote. If a single person or group of people are suppressed  in their voting, are prohibited from voting, Federal courts today have  the right to be able to step in on any jurisdiction, any State in  America, to be able to protect the rights of individuals to be able to  vote.   I bring that to this body as a reminder because, for some reason, an  enormous portion of this body on the left side of this room is running  around the Nation and saying, ``If we don't do something right now,  there will be voter suppression in America, and we have to change  that,'' when they all know, in 1965, we passed the Voting Rights Act,  and that act still stands today to be able to protect the rights of  individuals.   I hear people wander around the Nation and get on news channels and  say the Voting Rights Act has been kicked out by the Supreme Court,  when they know that is a lie. They know it is. One section of the  Voting Rights Act the Supreme Court took out several years ago. It was  the section that required what is called preclearance. It created a  formula for States that had done a lot of oppression against Black  Americans. It created a certain formula for them. If they made any  changes in their voting laws, they had to get preclearance for that.   It stayed in place for decades. Even though their State had cleaned  up their voting laws and had changed, for decades it stayed there,  until the Supreme Court looked at it and said: You can't hold this over  these States a generation later for something that a previous  generation did.   And so the Supreme Court kicked that one section out but kept  everything else, including protecting the rights of every single  American from voter suppression. Every law in every State in America  could be challenged in a Federal district court, circuit court, and to  the Supreme Court to make sure the rights of individuals are protected.   Now, people here may not know that that still exists based on the way  that the news has talked about voting of late and based on all the  conversation about voting, but that is the law of the land right now.   So what is being brought to this body to vote on then? Well, here is  what has been brought to this body to be able to vote on: a long list  of things that they  [[Page S153]]  want to be able to address and to be able to say they want to change  voting in America to be able to remake it in their image, except it is  not in the image of their States because many of my Democratic  colleagues don't actually have, in their own State, the things that  they are actually putting into this Federal legislation; meaning,  literally, they are taking over from officials in their own State,  telling their own Governor, their own legislature that they are wrong  and that they are going to set them straight.   We have a disagreement on some of these issues. I will grant you  that. Some of these areas in the bill we go: Let's talk about it. Most  of the areas in their bill we look at and go: Are you kidding me? We  just disagree on this--things like same-day voter registration, where a  person could literally walk in and say, ``I never registered to vote  before,'' tell them their name, and then vote on the spot. Honestly, I  have a problem with that because there is no way to be able to validate  they didn't vote in Oklahoma City, then vote in Tulsa, then vote in  Muskogee, OK. There is no way to know. They just voted, and they did  same-day registration, so there is no way to verify that person is  actually that person.   Interestingly enough, they also include in their bill undermining  State voter ID laws, so the combination of the two is pretty powerful.  You can't call for ID, but you can register on the spot. That is a  formula for fraud.   It is not just my opinion; it is the State of New York's opinion. The  State of New York does not have same-day voter registration. In fact,  this last November, it was on the ballot in the State of New York, and  the people of the State of New York overwhelmingly said that is a  terrible idea and voted it down. Yet Senator Schumer stands right over  there and tells every State, including his that just voted this down:  No, you have to do this. We are going to require it because some people  in this body think it should be required.   We have a disagreement on that. That is a real disagreement we should  be able to debate and talk about. Instead, my Democratic colleagues are  saying: If you disagree with me on this, I will blow up the rules of  the Senate, and we will get what I want no matter what.   Can we not have a disagreement that same-day voter registration may  be a bad idea, when even the State of New York and the people of New  York think it is a bad idea?   They have a mandate for using ballot drop boxes. I don't have a  problem with ballot drop boxes, but their ballot drop box issue is you  can't provide security. If you have any kind of security setting for it  or any kind of chain-of-custody requirement, then that is going to be  oppressive and suppressive.   You know, I think it is a good idea, when dealing with a ballot, that  you actually know where it went and if anyone changed it; if people  dropped off multiple ballots, when it is only legal to drop off one. I  think it may be important to know if you are going to verify an  election. We have a disagreement on that.   We have a disagreement on the issue of felons voting. Now, each State  makes that decision whether they are going to allow felons to vote, but  in this piece of legislation Democrats are bringing, they are saying:  No, felons have to be given the right to vote when they get out of  prison.   Now, I understand we may disagree on that, but I want you to  understand what they are saying. My Democratic colleagues are saying: I  will blow up the rules of the Senate and change 250 years of history in  the Senate to get my way if you don't allow rapists, convicted  murderers, and convicted sex offenders to be able to vote. They are so  determined that sex offenders get the right to vote, they are willing  to blow up the rules of the Senate to get it.   Can we not have a disagreement on if we are going to force States to  mandate that convicted murders, sex offenders, and rapists get to vote  again?   In this piece of legislation, they provide government funding,  taxpayer funding, for Members of the House of Representatives just down  the hall over there. Here is the way they set it up: If you are running  for the House of Representatives and you raise small-dollar donations,  then taxpayers will fund your campaign on a 6-to-1 match. It gets even  better because you, as a candidate, could actually take a salary from  that as well and actually be paid by the taxpayer to be able to run for  office if you are running in the House of Representatives. Can we not  have a disagreement on that?   I don't meet many people in Oklahoma who say they want to fund House  Members running in New York State or California or Illinois or even in  Oklahoma. They don't want to fund them with their tax dollars. If their  tax dollars are going to education or roads or national defense or  border security, they are all in, but if they are funding a political  campaign with their tax dollars, I just don't meet many people who are  very excited about that. But my Democratic colleagues are saying: If  you don't support that, I will blow up the Senate, and I will destroy  200 years of history in the functioning of the Senate to get my way  because, to them, having Federal funding for elections is so important,  they are willing to blow the Senate tradition up so they can get their  way.    There is a general counsel who works for the Federal Election  Commission. You never met him. You don't know his name. He is an  attorney who works with the Federal Election Commission. Their bill  gives that attorney a tremendous amount of power to oversee elections  in America. Do you know who he is? I don't either. But if this bill  passes, it is a pretty powerful individual. Can we have a disagreement  about that or is this about, if I don't allow someone no one even knows  their name, a Federal Election Commission attorney, to be able to run  elections in the country, I will blow the Senate up.   There is a section of it in this bill that talks about preclearance.  We actually don't know how many States would fall into preclearance on  this. Many of my Democratic colleagues say: Well, it is not very many.  You have to have some sort of violation in the past to be able to get  it. But, actually, if you read the fine print in the bill, it says if  there has been a consent or out-of-court settlement on things related  to an election any time in the last 25 years, you would suddenly now be  in preclearance.   So, literally, 20 years ago, if your State made some agreement on  elections, if there was some settlement that was done with DOJ during  that time period, didn't even go to court; you just settled it to  resolve it--said, yes, that was a mistake that was done--now that is  going to come back to haunt a future generation.   And States will get drawn into preclearance, which--let me describe  what that means. Preclearance means your State legislature can no  longer pass legislation on elections until you contact the Attorney  General of the United States and ask permission first. So now your  State legislature works for the Attorney General of the United States,  whoever that person may be in the future. It actually gives them the  ability to be able to control anything on election law in your State,  even though we don't even know who that is, and we don't know how many  States are actually included.   What I have heard over and over again from my Democratic colleagues  is, well, if we don't do this right now, our elections are destroyed in  the future because have you seen the things that Republicans are doing  all over the country? Have you seen the terrible laws that have been  passed since 2020?   Actually, I have. My State is one of them. And I was surprised when I  saw my State on the list of 34 different laws that are out there that  have been passed that are terrible for America so we have to be able to  federalize all elections. I was surprised to see my State on the list.  When I looked on the list to see what was the terrible thing that  passed in my State, here is what I discovered: Our State passed HB  2663. HB 2663 did a couple of things. It added an extra day of early  voting for the general elections. They added an extra day of in-person  early voting.   And it said, if you request an absentee ballot, you have to do that  15 days prior to the election. Do you know why we did that? Because the  U.S. Postal Service contacted every State and asked them to do that  because the Postal Service said: We can no longer guarantee we can get  something mailed to a person and give them time to get it actually  mailed back in time for the election. So to make sure people's votes  actually count, we did what the  [[Page S154]]  U.S. Postal Service actually recommended to us. We moved our request  for an absentee ballot to 15 days before the election to make sure  every vote would count.   You want to know something fun? So did the State of New York. They  made the exact same change. So, apparently, the State of New York is  also into voter suppression the same as the State of Oklahoma is.    Do you know what is really happening? My Democratic colleagues are  running around the Nation getting on the news and saying there are 34  new laws passed by Republicans; they are destroying the right to vote.  And apparently no one in the media is saying, ``List one,'' because if  they would have listed one, they would have listed the State of  Oklahoma added--added--an extra day of in-person voting and did what  the U.S. Postal Service asked us to do, the exact same thing that the  State of New York did.   Let me give you some other things that have happened in other States.  In Florida, there is a requirement that voters provide the last four  digits of their Social Security number or their driver's license number  or their Florida ID number when they request a mail-in ballot to make  sure it is actually them. It is pretty straightforward. That doesn't  sound like voter suppression; that sounds like just verifying that a  person who is asking to vote by absentee is actually the person voting.   They made it very simple. You can just do any number. They are not  even showing ID. They are saying you can just give the last four digits  of your Social Security number, which everyone has. All they are just  trying to make sure is that person is actually there and is actually  who they say they are, but they are listed as being voter suppression  there.   Arizona is requiring a voter signature on early ballots, as do a lot  of States already. That has not been a big issue on that.   In Louisiana--this is a really big one in Louisiana. Louisiana and  Utah--now, I understand why Democrats are challenging this. In  Louisiana and Utah, they required that deceased voters be taken off the  voter rolls. Those who are decreased, they are taken off the voter  rolls. That is being listed as voter suppression.   I have to tell you. I have a friend of mine who said to me: When I  die, would you make sure that I am buried in a blue State because I  want to make sure I can continue to vote. It is a running old joke  about ``I want to keep voting when I am dead.''   The State of Louisiana and the State of Utah, all they did was say:  We want to be able to clean up our voter rolls to be able to take off  the names of people we know and have verified that they are actually  dead. But that is considered voter suppression, and my Democratic  colleagues are running around the Nation saying there are 34 new laws  that are suppressing the right to vote, when this is the kind of stuff  that has actually been passed around the country.   Now, they will say: Oh, you can list those; I understand those. But  there are a couple of them that are really egregious. I have heard  several folks say: Do you realize that the State of Georgia--the State  of Georgia and the law that they passed won't allow people to be able  to pass out water to people in line? That is voter suppression.   Well, did you know that new law in Georgia has been the old law in  the State of New York for years so that you couldn't campaign in line?  People who are actual poll workers, who are volunteers there, they can  pass out food and water. But the State of Georgia did a law just like  the State of New York already has. I haven't heard Senator Schumer say  that is voter suppression in New York, but he declared that to be voter  suppression in Georgia. In fact, even Georgia Senators here stood up to  be able to protest that they were playing baseball in Georgia because  of it. The State of New York already has it.   I have also heard folks say: Well, there are some of the things that  these States have passed that they are actually removing the ability of  the State chief election official to administer elections. That is  dangerous because then just a legislature can declare whoever they want  to declare. That sounds horrible. If true, that would be terrible. It  just doesn't happen to be factually true, but it is just getting spun  like crazy that Republican States are out there taking away the rights  of their people to be able to vote and their vote be counted. It is  just not factually true.   They will go to Georgia and say they stripped the Secretary of  State's authority to oversee elections. Here is what Georgia actually  did. The Georgia secretary of state is still the chief election  official for the State of Georgia.   They still oversee all election activities in the State, nothing  changed on that. But Georgia did replace the secretary of state on the  State election board with a nonpartisan chair, making the secretary of  state a nonvoting member. That did happen. The law did provide new  authority to the board to suspend county or municipal election  superintendents and to appoint superintendents to oversee the  jurisdiction. Yep, that is part of the law, but that would only happen  after an investigation by a performance review board, a hearing by the  State election board.   The board then must determine that the election administrator in the  jurisdictions committed at least three violations of State election law  or as demonstrated nonfeasance, malfeasance, gross negligence, and the  administration of elections. It also prohibits the board from  suspending more than four superintendents. It allows for a suspended  superintendent to petition the State for reinstatement.   It adds a whole process of due process that actually gets carried  out. Why do they do this? Well, because there were actual examples in  the election of election workers that were fired by the county  elections directors for shredding voter registration applications. That  is a crime.   So they set up a process with full due process not to overturn  elections, but to make sure county election officials actually are  following the law. That doesn't sound like voter suppression to me.  That just sounds like running free and fair elections.   Oh, but Arizona--Arizona has a new law that provides the attorney  general to have the authority to defend the State's election laws in  courts rather than the secretary of state, so they just shifted their  responsibility of who defends State election laws.   The secretary of state is still the chief election officer in Arizona  but actually doesn't go to court. Their State attorney general does.  That kind of makes sense to me, but, apparently, my Democratic  colleagues don't agree. They have spun this whole web of myth and said,  We have to federalize every election in America. We have to take over  every State voting system in America. Washington, DC, needs to be the  one to be able to run everything--or else if we don't, we'll destroy  the traditions of the Senate and get our way no matter what.   Could I just read to you from the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the law  that is still in place in America?   It says:         No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or       standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied       by any State or political subdivision to deny or abridge the       right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account       of race or color.    The Voting Rights Act of 1965, still the law of the land, and it  should be.   So what is happening now with this? Well, there are two big issues  here. One is this fight over voting, whether States make decisions on  voting or whether Washington, DC, Democrats make decisions on voting  for their States, even if it is a Democrat State.   And then the next big issue is, are the Democrats in this room  actually going to destroy the filibuster and silence the rights of the  minority in America? Now, if you would have asked me 4 years ago, I  would have said: No way, that is not going to happen, because a group  of Democrats and a group of Republicans joined together and said: We  are committed to not destroying the legislative filibuster. Why?  Because it is what makes the House and the Senate different.   The House and the Senate are not just one is bigger and one is  smaller. The House and the Senate operate differently. And the Senate  has been the place for two and a half centuries where the debate occurs  and there are rights of individual Senators to be able to debate the  issues, defend their State, and talk about the rights of Americans.  This happens in the Senate.   The majority rules the show in the House. If they have 218 of 435,  they  [[Page S155]]  don't care what the other side thinks. People who always talk about  bipartisanship never bring up the House of Representatives--they just  don't. Bipartisanship doesn't happen in the House of Representatives  the way it happens in the Senate, but the reason it happens in the  Senate is because of this thing called the filibuster.    It was interesting, when I was first elected to the Senate in 2014,  the people that called me between my election and when I came were  almost all Democrats--almost all of them. They wanted to introduce  themselves. They wanted to say: What are you interested in? Because in  the Senate we have to work together to be able to get things done.   And so I had all these Democrats that reached out to me to say: Let's  find areas of common ground. We are going to disagree on lots of  things, but let's find the things we are going to agree on because we  have to come to consensus, because we are the U.S. Senate.   That is commonly understood by Senators, which is why in 2017, in the  middle of the year, a group of Republicans and Senators wrote a  letter--this letter--to Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer. In that  letter--I am going to read it right here from this paragraph, it says:         We are mindful of the unique role the Senate plays in the       legislative process, and we are steadfastly committed to       ensuring that this great American institution continues to       serve as the world's greatest deliberative body. Therefore--    Here's their request.         Therefore, we are asking you to join us in opposing any       effort to curtail the existing rights and prerogatives of       Senators to engage in full, robust, and extended debate as we       consider legislation before this body in the future.    This group of Senators in 2017 wrote to Mitch McConnell and Chuck  Schumer and said: Do not allow any changes. We are fully committed to  making no changes in the filibuster. Don't allow it to happen for  legislation. Don't allow it. Here were those that signed this document  and said: This is what we believe.   Kamala Harris, now Vice President of the United States; Chris Coons,  who led the letter among all Democrats; Patrick Leahy is the person who  has held this institution together; Dianne Feinstein; Amy Klobuchar;  Kirsten Gillibrand; Cory Booker; Michael Bennet; Joe Manchin; Angus  King; Mark Warner; Bob Casey; Martin Heinrich; Jeanne Shaheen; Sherrod  Brown; Brian Schatz; Maria Cantwell; Mazie Hirono; Jon Tester; Tom  Carper; Maggie Hassan; Tammy Duckworth; Tim Kaine; Jack Reed; Ed  Markey; Debbie Stabenow; Sheldon Whitehouse; Bob Menendez--all said  don't change the legislative filibuster.   In fact, they asked me, along with everyone else, to join them in  opposing any efforts to make changes to the filibuster. It didn't just  stop there. There were lots of other conversations that happened during  that time period. There were lots of interviews and dialogue about it.  Let me just read some of the comments that were made during that time  period.   George Stephanopoulos on ABC's program asked of Dick Durbin, the No.  2 leader for Democrats--asked Dick Durbin, ``What do you think about  doing away with the filibuster?''   Dick Durbin replied this in 2018:         Well, I can tell you that would be the end of the Senate as       it was originally devised and created going back to our       Founding Fathers. We have to acknowledge our respect for the       minority, and that is what the Senate tries to do in its       composition and in its procedure.    That is Dick Durbin in 2018.   Jon Tester was asked in 2019 about the legislative filibuster, and he  said:         I don't want to see the Senate become the House.    He then said:         If you're asking about the filibuster changes, I am a no.       That would be a mistake.    Senator Angus King made this comment in 2020. He said:         I know it can be frustrating, but I think legislation is       better when it has some bipartisan support.    Senator Dianne Feinstein in 2020 said:         I think it's a part of Senate tradition, which creates a       sobering effect on the body, which is healthy.    One more comment from Angus King. Angus King was asked about it on  CNN, about the filibuster, and he replied back he is 100 percent  opposed to killing the filibuster--100 percent.   Senator Cory Booker responded about the filibuster. He said:         My colleagues and I, everybody I've talked to, believe the       legislative filibuster should stay there, and I will       personally resist efforts to get rid of it.    Senator Chris Coons, when asked about this in 2018, he replied:         I am committed to never voting to change the legislative       filibuster.    Never.   Senator Jacky Rosen in 2019 was asked about this, and she replied:         I think we should keep the [legislative] filibuster. It's       one of the few things that we have left in order to let all       of the voices be heard here in the Senate. . . .    She also said:         We have to look not at just when you're in the majority,       but what does it do when you're in the minority? You have to       be mindful of that.    Jeanne Shaheen was asked on CNN about the legislative filibuster in  2021, and she answered just simply:         No, I would not support eliminating the 60-vote threshold.    Would not do it.   Senator Jack Reed was asked in 2017, during the same time period this  letter came out, which he was a signatory for, and he said:         The filibuster is not in the Constitution nor the original       Senate rules, but we have a bicameral system for a reason and       this legislative tool serves a critical purpose in ensuring       the functioning of our democratic republic. Yes, it sometimes       slows the process down, and some have abused or subverted it.       But it remains an important part in our system of checks and       balances.    I agree. I agree with that Jack Reed.   Senator Bernie Sanders even was asked about the filibuster in 2019,  and he just replied:         No, I am not crazy about getting rid of the filibuster.    Senator Mazie Hirono from Hawaii said:         I'm not particularly in favor of getting rid of the       filibuster because that just means majority rule. That's what       happens in the House.    Senator Bob Casey was asked in 2019 about the filibuster, and he just  replied:         I'm a yes [on keeping the filibuster].    One of my favorites, Senator Sherrod Brown was asked about this in  2019, and he replied:         I think there are ways of getting things through Congress       with the legislative filibuster still in place. . . . it       takes a chief executive that knows what she's doing or what       he's doing.    Listen, this is not some trivial exercise. This is 250 years of  history my Democratic colleagues are planning to flush down the toilet  because they don't get their way on a bill we rightfully have very  strong philosophical disagreements on.   Hey, I don't agree on giving rapists and sex offenders who are  convicted felons voting rights when they get out of prison; I am not  alone on that. I don't agree in Federal tax dollars being used to be  able to pay for political campaigns. I am not alone in that. That is  not that crazy.   I don't agree that my State should have to go play ``Mother, May I''  with some future Attorney General because they want to add another day  of voting. I am not alone in that. But to say, ``If you don't do this  now, I will destroy the Senate'', is a toxic shift for our Republic,  and it is a violation of what you have said before in public, in fact,  written to the leadership of the Senate and said: Please don't do this,  and we will not do this. And now, years later go: It is not convenient.  That was when we were in the minority. We had one opinion. Now we have  different core beliefs because we are in the majority.   Interestingly enough, Joe Biden today stood in Georgia and made this  statement. He said:         Today I am making it clear: To protect our democracy, I       support changing the Senate rules whichever way they need to       be changed to prevent a minority of Senators from blocking       action on voting rights. When it comes to protecting majority       rule in America, the majority should rule in the U.S. Senate.    Well, that is fascinating. Now that he is President of the United  States, it is my way, or I will destroy the whole place. When he was  Senator Joe Biden, he had a different opinion.   Senator Joe Biden wasn't about ``I am the President, so I get what I  [[Page S156]]  want.'' Senator Joe Biden made this statement:         Folks who want to see this change want to eliminate one of       the procedural mechanisms designed for the express purpose of       guaranteeing individual rights, and they also have a       consequence, and would undermine the protections of a       minority point of view in the heat of majority excess.    But now he says: No. I am in the majority. I should get my way.   Senator Joe Biden said:         I have been here 32 years, most of the time in the       majority. Whenever you are in the majority, it is frustrating       to see the other side block a bill or a nominee you support.       I have walked in your shoes, and I get it. . . . Getting rid       of the filibuster has long-term consequences. If there is one       thing I have learned in my years here, once you change the       rules and surrender the Senate's institutional power, you       never get it back.    Senator Joe Biden said:         Simply put, the nuclear option would transform the Senate       from the so-called cooling saucer our Founding Fathers talked       about to cool the passions of the day to a pure majoritarian       body like a Parliament. We have heard a lot in recent weeks       about the rights of the majority and obstructionism. But the       Senate is not meant to be a place of pure majoritarianism. Is       majority rule what you really want?    That is what he said as a Senator, but as President, his demand was,  majority rule or we will break every rule in the Senate to get what we  want.   Senator Schumer, in his public statements, has been very clear. ``It  would be doomsday for democracy,'' he said, ``if you change the  filibuster.''   This is the statement Senator Schumer made in 2017, the same Senator  Schumer who has spent the last 12 months trying to find a way to tear  down the filibuster. In 2017, when there was the debate going on around  this, Senator Schumer said on the floor of the Senate, standing right  there, ``I hope the Republican leader and I,'' he said, ``can, in the  coming months, find a way to build a firewall around the legislative  filibuster, which is the most important distinction between the Senate  and the House. Without the 60-vote threshold for legislation,'' Senator  Schumer said, ``the Senate becomes a majoritarian institution like the  House, much more subject to the winds of short-term electoral change.  No Senator would like to see that happen so let's find a way to further  protect the 60-vote rule for legislation.''   That was Senator Schumer in 2017, but now it is: I am in power. I am  going to do what I want.   This is not a flippant issue, and as I have spoken to some of my  Democratic colleagues, they seem to believe we will just take this vote  and no one is going to care. In fact, some of my Democratic colleagues  are saying: We know we are going to lose. Senator Manchin and Senator  Sinema have already made public comments. They are not going to go with  this, or, we are going to take this, make a statement. Our progressive  base wants us to be able to do this. It has no consequences. It is not  going to pass anyway, so we will just do it--except they are forgetting  that 5 years from now, 10 years from now, there will be another time  just like this. Maybe Democrats will be in a slightly larger majority.  Maybe Senator Sinema and Senator Manchin won't be here at that moment,  and the majority leader, Democrat Senator, at that point will step  forward and say: You voted on this in 2022. It is time for us to vote  on it now.   Democratic activists will rush at you and will say: Don't you dare  change what you did. Tear the place down. Let's get what we want.   I have spoken to so many of my colleagues and said: Don't do this.   They have quietly responded back to me: I don't want to do this.   I am not here to attack my colleagues. You each make your own  decisions. But these are decisions that matter. These are the decisions  that 100 years from now will still guide the direction of the Senate.  These are the decisions that will direct our Republic.   We are the only body that has a protection for the minority voice; I  think the only legislative body in the world that is designed like  this. It has been part of the secret sauce of America that the minority  in America, however large or small it is, has a voice.   My Democratic colleagues are now saying: We no longer want the  minority to have a voice in America. If you are in the minority  opinion, you don't count. Sit down. Shut up. We are in the majority.   That has never been the American way, not in 250 years. This has been  the place where we have argued, debated, and where, yes, I have talked  to House Members who have said good bills went to die. But the Senate  has been the spot where all Americans get to speak. And my Democratic  colleagues are seriously considering this week saying: No more, because  we want to pass a voting bill that gives Federal dollars to House  candidates and gives felons the right to vote and takes away voter ID.   What in the world? What has this body become that people who signed  this document, page after page of it--I mean, I could bring out page  after page of Senators who have signed this and have said ``Do not take  away the legislative filibuster'' but now are just flipping and  flippant and saying it won't matter. Yes, it does. One hundred years  from now, this week will still matter.   I encourage my Democratic colleagues to think carefully on this one  because this one counts.   I yield the floor.
