 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Colorado  as well.   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2581, the Verify First Act. I  helped introduce this legislation with my good friend and colleague,  Mr. Barletta from Pennsylvania, to ensure illegal immigrants are not  able to use healthcare tax credits to purchase health insurance.   Under ObamaCare, the Federal Government paid these tax credits up  front on a temporary basis to people before verifying their immigration  status. This created a pay-and-chase system where the Federal  Government would seek repayment only after it found it had paid out  benefits to an illegal immigrant.  [[Page H4871]]    This bill puts an end to this taxpayer abuse by requiring the Social  Security Administration, or the Department of Homeland Security, to  verify the immigration status of every tax credit applicant before the  Treasury Department issues a credit.   Texans and hardworking taxpayers around the country already struggle  to pay for their healthcare. Their hard-earned dollars should not be  used to foot the bill for those who broke the law to come here. My  constituents in Texas and American taxpayers deserve better.   I want to thank Congressman Barletta for his dedication and continued  leadership on this issue, and, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  join me in supporting this legislation.
