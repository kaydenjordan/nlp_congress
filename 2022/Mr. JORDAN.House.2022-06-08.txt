 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   What happened in Uvalde, Buffalo, and Tulsa is as wrong as wrong  could be, and our hearts go out to those communities and those families  who have been impacted in such a terrible way. The answer is not to  destroy the Second Amendment, but that is exactly where the Democrats  want to go.   Don't take my word for it. Just look at what they said. The President  of the United States said last week that he wants to get rid of the  most popular handgun in the country. Michael Moore, a Democrat--not a  Member of Congress but a Democrat--said it is time to repeal the Second  Amendment.   During our 10-hour markup last Thursday in the committee hearing,  Representative Jackson Lee said if this bill passes, we are not  finished. Representative Jones said if this bill doesn't pass, we will  end the filibuster; we will expand the Supreme Court; we will do  whatever it takes to get law-abiding citizens' guns.   Today, we have this hodgepodge of six bills thrown together. Many of  the elements in these bills are unconstitutional. Even the Ninth  Circuit has said it is unconstitutional what they want to do on the age  limit. These bills would say when you can buy a firearm, what kind of  firearm you can get, and where and how you have to store that firearm  in your own darn home.   Of course, tomorrow, they are bringing the so-called red flag law to  the floor. Someone who doesn't like you can file a complaint. Within 24  hours, there is a hearing that you are not allowed to be at--you can't  confront your accuser--and they can take away your Second Amendment  liberty. That is the bill they are going to pass tomorrow.   Frankly, this shouldn't surprise us. For 18 months, Democrats have  assaulted the First Amendment. It shouldn't surprise us now that they  are coming after the Second. Every right we enjoy as Americans under  the First Amendment--your right to practice your faith, your right to  assemble, your right to petition your government, freedom of the  press--heck, some of them call for outlawing certain networks.   And freedom of speech, just a few weeks ago, the Biden administration  tried to put together the Disinformation Governance Board. Oh, my  goodness.   The attacks on the First Amendment have been sustained. They have  been going on for 18 months, and now here they come, going after law- abiding citizens' Second Amendment liberties.   The Speaker started by saying this bill is about protecting our kids.  That is important. Sure is. That is what she said, protecting our kids  is important. Yes, it is. But this bill doesn't do it.   What this bill does is takes away Second Amendment rights, God-given  rights protected by our Constitution, from law-abiding American  citizens. That is what this legislation does, and that is why we should  oppose it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Chabot).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Gaetz).    Madam Speaker, the previous speaker said ``nonsense.'' It  is not nonsense to defend the Second Amendment. The Second Amendment  protects our God-given right to protect ourselves, our family, our  property, and our freedom. That is not nonsense. That is essential is  what it is, and it is a critical part of the Constitution.   Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Hudson).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Gohmert).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Representative Massie was right on target when he said red flag laws  take all guns from some people and they do so without due process. This  bill takes some guns from all people. But Democrats say, don't worry.  We are not out to get the Second Amendment. Really?   Here is what Representative Cicilline said in committee last week:  Spare me the B.S. about constitutional rights.   Here is what Representative Jones said last week in committee: If the  filibuster obstructs us, we will abolish it. If the Supreme Court  objects, we will expand. We will not rest until we have taken weapons  out of circulation in our communities. Each and every day, we will do  whatever it takes; whatever it takes.   They are out to get the Second Amendment.   The right of the American people, the right of we, the people, to  keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed. That is what bothers them.  They don't trust we, the people. They are smarter than us. They are  better than us. They don't trust law-abiding American citizens. They do  not trust them.   And that is what is so wrong with the direction we are going with  this legislation and the legislation they are going to bring to the  floor tomorrow.   We have seen they don't trust Americans to exercise their First  Amendment liberties. Now they are going after their Second Amendment  liberties. And that red flag law they are going to bring up tomorrow  goes after the Fifth Amendment due process rights that we enjoy as  American citizens. That is why we should oppose this legislation and  the legislation tomorrow.   And I hope, as my friend from Florida said, I hope the United States  Senate doesn't go down this red flag trail that they are now on and  further take away liberties from law-abiding American people.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
