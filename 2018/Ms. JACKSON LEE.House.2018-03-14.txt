 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished ranking  member, the chairman of the committee, and the proponents of this bill.  I acknowledge their commitment and certainly their sincerity.   Mr. Speaker, I joined the thousands of young people today on the west  side of the Capitol as they came from schools throughout this region to  stand for 17 minutes to acknowledge those who lost their lives in  Florida at a high school.   That should not have been their destiny. It should not have been  their destiny to die in a bloody massacre in their school. It should  not have been the destiny of those in the Pulse nightclub, Sutherland  Springs, Columbine, Las Vegas, Texas Tech, the streets of Houston in my  district, Chicago, or any other place.   This bill is not about preventing the unsafe use of guns. Guns kill.  The young people today made it very clear that they will not stop until  we have real gun safety legislation barring the AR-15 and we have  universal background checks.   At the same time, I believe these bills of our colleagues are  important legislative initiatives. So, in tribute to these individuals  who have passed, but also the Members, I believe the STOP School  Violence Act of 2017 is a ready response to aspects of school safety  and security that are very important.   One of the unique aspects of this bill that I think should be noted  is the language in the bill itself that indicates it is through  evidence-based strategies and programs to prevent violence, which may  include the use of appropriate technologies. The bill readily  acknowledges many aspects of school safety.   The AFT and the National School Boards Association are two of the  supporters of this legislation. But it does not answer totally the  question of the parent who said: ``I didn't get a chance that morning  to say good-bye to my daughter.''   We must address the question of gun violence. I believe it is  important that we put a stop to children evacuating schools, like this  one, and for us to be able to address a real, nonpartisan, bipartisan  response to the proliferation of guns, whether it means enforcing gun  laws, lifting the age to 21, or banning bump stocks, all points we  thought the President was supporting but, unfortunately, he is not.   I do want to raise the point of the tip line. I think it is extremely  important, as long as it is guided by teachers, counselors, and mental  health experts. We must be very sure that we do not have racial  disparities where the largest percentage of individuals impacted by the  tip line may be African-American youth, Hispanic youth, or Muslim  youth.   We know that racial disparities are real because the largest  percentage of those who are sent to detention or juvenile centers  happen to be African-American children, young boys and girls, which I  really believe is something that has to stop.   In addition, it is important that we comply with civil rights law. I  think the advocates of civil rights organizations like the Legal  Defense Fund are absolutely right. There must be a standard where the  civil rights of these children are not violated on this tip line and  that due process is provided for them.   We must make a statement here today that, as we support this  legislation, we do not intend to support legislation that we skew to be  biased toward these young people. These young people in impoverished  neighborhoods and schools, Mr. Speaker, deserve to learn as well. But  we want safe schools. Those safe schools can be had with the beginning  of this infrastructure.    We can begin with this question of school safety and  a tip line and best evidence and best practices. We can begin with  grants to ensure the safety of our schools. We can allow schools to  make choices about what will make them more safe.   At the same time, we must safeguard our children and their rights. We  must answer the cry of the children. We will not finish our task until  we have real gun safety legislation.   Enough is enough. It is time to act now. I need my Republican  brothers and sisters to work with me.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Legal Defense  and Education Fund and a news article published in the New York on  March 13, 2018.                                             NAACP Legal Defense and                                          Educational Fund, Inc.,                                     Washington, DC, March 12, 2018.      Re H.R. 4909, the STOP School Violence Act of 2018.       Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: On behalf of the NAACP       Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc. (LDF), we write to       express our concerns with H.R. 4909, the Student, Teachers,       and Officers Preventing School Violence Act of 2018 (the STOP       School Violence Act or Act). This bill will fail to achieve       its goal of improving school safety and will instead create       more dangerous conditions for students, especially students       of color.        Founded in 1940 by Thurgood Marshall, LDF is the nation's       oldest civil rights law organization. For almost 80 years,       LDF has relied on the Constitution and federal and state       civil rights laws to pursue equality and justice for African       Americans and other people of color. Since the historic U.S.       Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education, which       LDF litigated and won, we have continued to represent       students of color to ensure they receive quality and       equitable educational opportunities.        Unfortunately, we all have too much experience dealing with       the aftermath of school shootings. After the incidents in       Columbine, CO and Sandy Hook, CT, families, school districts,       and lawmakers took a variety of actions intended to prevent       future tragedies. In studying these actions and their       consequences, we can see which efforts work, and which do       not. The STOP School Violence Act does not do enough to       ensure that effective methods that protect all students are       used by our nation's schools and risks furthering racial       disparities in education.        The U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Secret       Service have published a guide (the ED/SS Guide) to       maintaining safe schools, recommending the following steps:        1. Systematically surveying students, teachers, and other       stakeholders about the emotional climate of a school to be       able to continuously assess and improve school climate;        2. Encouraging students and teachers to respectfully listen       to each other;        3. Ensuring that students feel comfortable speaking with       adults in the school community;        4. Preventing and addressing bullying through promotion of       pro-social behaviors;        5. Involving students and staff in the maintenance of a       culture of safety and respect;        6. Ensuring all students have a trusting relationship with       at least one adult at school; and        7. Creating mechanisms for developing and maintaining safe       school climates.        The ED/SS guide emphasizes that safe and secure school       environments are created only through focusing on maintaining       a respectful and supportive school environment where       students' emotional and academic needs are met, with things       like effective threat assessment only a small part. These       recommendations are supported by other experts.        To effectively make schools safer, the STOP Schools Act       should provide grants to states and districts to help       cultivate these positive environments. To do this, the Act       should focus on expanding resources, such as school       counselors, mental health services, social workers, and       proven programs, such as Positive Behavioral Interventions       and Supports (PBIS) and restorative practices, and prohibit       assigning law enforcement to schools. Instead, the Act       provides grants to states and school districts to improve       school security by providing training to prevent student       violence, including for law enforcement officers, school       personnel, and students; developing and operating anonymous       reporting systems for threats of school violence; developing       and operating school threat assessment and intervention teams       that may include coordination with law enforcement agencies       and school personnel, and specialized training for school       officials in responding to mental health crises; coordinating       with law enforcement; using metal detectors, locks, lighting,       and other deterrent measures; implementing security       assessments and training; installing technology for expedited       notification of law enforcement during an emergency; and       taking ``any other measures that . . . may provide a       significant improvement in security.'' These provisions are       only a small part of the strategy that experts recommend for       maintaining safe school environments, and as written,  [[Page H1564]]       the provisions have a high risk of exacerbating race-based       disparities in how students are treated by school police and       staff.        The Act's language regarding coordination with law       enforcement and allowing any measures that ``may'' provide       more security will allow school districts to use the grant       funding to increase law enforcement presence rather than on       evidence-based interventions. Research has shown that having       more police in schools does not make schools safer, but,       results in an increasing number of students being led from       schools to the justice system. Although Black and Latinx       students do not misbehave more than White students, students       of color make up over 58% of school-based arrests, but only       40% of public school enrollment. Black students are more than       twice as likely as their White peers to be referred to law       enforcement or arrested at school. Additionally, research       shows that police officers perceive Black youth as older and       more culpable than they do similarly-situated White youth,       and this bias leads to the over-criminalization of Black       students. Furthermore, the presence of police in schools       makes Black students and students who have been victims feel       less safe, which would negatively affect school climate.        To address these disparities, a clause should be added to       the Act requiring that data be collected on any activities       undertaken with grant funding to determine whether they are       disproportionately affecting students of color or other at-      risk groups. Any districts that are discriminating against       students should not receive federal funding.        Moreover, the Act's anonymous reporting system does not       have prescribed due process or civil rights protections and       could lead to more racial disparities in how students are       treated at school. As the ED/SS Guide cautions, anonymous       systems could lead to individuals reporting false and       malicious information. It will be an easy vehicle for       students or staff who hold implicit or explicit biases       against students of color to report those students as being a       danger to themselves or others based on discriminatory       reasons. In order to protect students, the tip system should       be implemented as recommended in the guide: it should be       housed within a wider system of trust amongst students and       staff so that all feel comfortable filing reports and       providing any required additional information in assessing       threats. In addition, the communications should be tracked       and data disaggregated and assessed for racial disparities in       threat reporting.        Finally, the STOP Violence Act does not restrict its       funding to public schools and does not state that all       recipients of funds must comply with existing civil rights       laws. The Act should include a statement that any school       receiving funds under this Act complies with all federal law,       including civil rights laws protecting students on the bases       of race, color, national origin; sex; disability; and age.        All students deserve to attend safe and welcoming schools,       and we encourage you to provide states and districts with       additional resources to achieve this goal. Unfortunately, the       STOP School Violence Act as currently written will not       improve school safety and will risk further harm to students       who are already disserved by the system.

Dixon,        Deputy Director of Policy.

Green)         Washington.--After a gunman marauded through Marjory       Stoneman Douglas High School last month, conservative       commentators--looking for a culprit--seized on an unlikely       target: an Obama-era guidance document that sought to rein in       the suspensions and expulsions of minority students.        Black students have never been the perpetrators of the mass       shootings that have shocked the nation's conscience nor have       minority schools been the targets. But the argument went that       any relaxation of disciplinary efforts could let a killer       slip through the cracks.        And this week, President Trump made the connection,       announcing that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos will lead a       school safety commission charged in part with examining the       ``repeal of the Obama administration's `Rethink School       Discipline' policies.''        To civil rights groups, connecting an action to help       minority students with mass killings in suburban schools       smacked of burdening black children with a largely white       scourge.        ``Yet again, the Trump administration, faced with a       domestic crisis, has responded by creating a commission to       study an unrelated issue in order to ultimately advance a       discriminatory and partisan goal,'' said Sherrilyn Ifill, the       president and director-counsel at NAACP Legal Defense and       Educational Fund Inc.        ``School shootings are a grave and preventable problem, but       rescinding the school discipline guidance is not the       answer,'' she said. ``Repealing the guidance will not stop       the next school shooter, but it will ensure that thousands       more students of color are unnecessarily ushered into the       school-to-prison pipeline.''        The issue of the Obama-era discipline guidance was raised       formally by Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, who,       after seeing a flurry of conservative news media reports,       wrote a letter to Ms. DeVos and Attorney General Jeff       Sessions questioning whether the guidance allowed the       shooting suspect, Nikolas Cruz, to evade law enforcement and       carry out the massacre at Stoneman Douglas High.        It was, on its face, an odd point: Mr. Cruz is white, and       far from evading school disciplinary procedures, he had been       expelled from Stoneman Douglas.        ``The overarching goals of the 2014 directive to mitigate       the school-to-prison pipeline, reduce suspensions and       expulsions, and to prevent racially biased discipline are       laudable and should be explored,'' Mr. Rubio wrote, asking       that the guidance be revised. ``However, any policy seeking       to achieve these goals requires basic common sense and an       understanding that failure to report troubled students, like       Cruz, to law enforcement can have dangerous repercussions.''        Broward County educators and advocates saw Mr. Rubio's       letter as an indictment of a program called Promise, which       the county instituted in 2013--one year before the Obama       guidance was issued--and has guided its discipline reforms to       reduce student-based arrests in Broward County, where       Stoneman Douglas is.        The N.A.A.C.P. said that Mr. Rubio ``notably backs away       from raising the purchase age for assault-style rifles and       restricting magazine capacity,'' and instead focuses on a       system that once sent one million minority students to       Florida jails for ``simple and routine discipline issues       ranging from talking back to teachers to schoolyard       scuffles.''        The program was praised by former Secretary of Education       Arne Duncan, and echoes the goals of the 2014 Obama guidance       in discouraging schools from using law enforcement as a first       line of defense for low-level offenses.        In the days before making his request, Mr. Rubio released a       proposal that he said would remedy lapses in the Promise       program and the 2014 guidance.        In a tweet on Tuesday, Mr. Rubio noted that the gunman was       not in the Promise program, but had displayed violent and       threatening behavior.        ``The more we learn, the more it appears the problem is not       the program or the DOE guidance itself, but the way it is       being applied,'' Mr. Rubio said, referring to the Education       Department. ``It may have created a culture discourages       referral to law enforcement even in egregious cases like the       #Parkland shooter.''        Long before the attack in Parkland, Fla., the 2014       discipline guidelines, which encouraged schools to examine       their discipline disparities and to take stock of       discriminatory policies, were already on Ms. DeVos's radar--      but not because they were seen as a possible culprit in the       next school shooting. Conservatives were using the Trump       administration's effort to rein in federal overreach to       reverse policies designed to protect against what the Obama       administration had seen as discriminatory practices.        The ``Rethink Discipline,'' package that Mr. Trump's       commission will examine includes guidance that the Obama       administration issued on the legal limitations on the use of       restraints and seclusion, corporal punishment and equity for       special education students.        In recent months, educators and policy experts from across       the country have traveled to Washington to voice support for       and opposition to the disciplinary guidance, in private       meetings with officials at the Education Department and in a       series of public forums.        At a briefing hosted by the United States Commission on       Civil Rights, dozens of policy experts, researchers,       educators and parents sounded off on the Obama-era discipline       policy in a meeting that became so racially charged that some       black attendees walked out.        Since the discipline guidelines were issued, conservatives       have blamed the document for creating unsafe educational       environments by pressuring schools to keep suspension numbers       down to meet racial quotas, even if it meant ignoring       troubling and criminal behavior. Teachers who sought       suspensions or expulsions of minority students were painted       as racists, conservatives maintained.        ``Evidence is mounting that efforts to fight the school-to-      prison pipeline is creating a school climate catastrophe and       has if anything put at-risk students at greater risk,'' said       Max Eden, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan       Institute, who argued that teacher bias was not the driving       force behind school discipline.        But proponents argued that racial bias was well documented.        When the guidance was issued, federal data found that       African-American students without disabilities were more than       three times as likely as their white peers without       disabilities to be expelled or suspended, and that more than       50 percent of students who were involved in school-related       arrests or who were referred to law enforcement were Hispanic       or African-American.        ``Children's safety also includes protection from       oppression and bigotry and injustice,'' Daniel J. Losen,       director of the Center for Civil Rights Remedies at the       University of California at Los Angeles's Civil Rights       Project, wrote in testimony to the Civil Rights Commission.       ``Fear-mongering and rhetoric that criminalizes youth of       color,  [[Page H1565]]       children from poor families and children with disabilities       should not be tolerated.''        The Education and Justice Departments wrote in a 2014 Dear       Colleague letter that discipline disparities could be caused       by a range of factors, but the statistics in the federal data       ``are not explained by more frequent or more serious       misbehavior by students of color.'' The departments also       noted that several civil rights investigations had verified       that minority students were disciplined more harshly than       their white peers for the same infractions.        ``In short, racial discrimination in school discipline is a       real problem,'' the guidance said.        In recent months, Ms. DeVos has said change will be coming.       She has already moved to rescind a regulation that protects       against racial disparities in special education placements.       Her goal, she said last month, was to be ``sensitive to all       of the parties involved.''        In a bruising interview on ``60 Minutes'' on Sunday, Ms.       DeVos said that the disproportionate discipline issue ``comes       down to individual kids.'' She declined to say whether she       believed that black students disciplined more harshly for the       same infraction were the victims of institutional racism.        ``We're studying it carefully and are committed to making       sure students have opportunity to learn in safe and nurturing       environments,'' she said.        Ms. DeVos's office for civil rights also announced that it       would scale back the scope of investigations, reversing an       approach taken under the Obama administration to conduct       exhaustive reviews of school districts' practices and data       when a discrimination complaint was filed.        But Ms. DeVos's own administration has continued to find       racial disparities. In November, the Education Department       found that the Loleta Union Elementary School District in       California doled out harsher treatment to Native American       students than their white peers. For example, a Native       American student received a one-day out-of-school suspension       for slapping another student on the way to the bus, in what       was that student's first disciplinary referral of the year. A       white student received lunch detention for slapping two       students on the same day--the student's fifth and sixth       referrals that year.        While Mr. Cruz was repeatedly kicked out of class and       ultimately expelled, it is unclear whether he was ever       referred to the police for his behavior in school. However,       Mr. Cruz was known to law enforcement, which never found       cause to arrest him, and a report of troublesome behavior to       the F.B.I. went unheeded.        The Broward County superintendent, Robert Runcie, said that       Mr. Rubio's effort to connect the district's discipline       policies to the Stoneman Douglas shooting was misguided.        ``We're not going to dismantle a program that's been       successful in the district because of false information that       someone has put out there,'' Mr. Runcie said on Twitter. ``We       will neither manage nor lead by rumors.''    Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on H.R. 4909, the ``STOP School Violence  Act of 2017.''   This important bipartisan legislation comes before us today on the  one month anniversary of a senseless and tragic school massacre, which  claimed 17 lives.   On February 14, 2018 our world lost Alyssa Alhadeff, Martin Duque,  Nicholas Dworet, Jaime Guttenberg, Luke Hoyer, Cara Loughran, Gina  Montalto, Joaquin Oliver, Alaina Petty, Meadow Pollack, Helena Ramsay,  Alex Schachter, Carmen Schentrup, and Peter Wang.   Also lost, were three coaches: Chris Hixon, Aaron Feis, and Scott  Beigel, who was also a biology teacher.   Today, in their honor, you, the students organized a nationwide  school walkout for gun violence prevention. Parkland wants to go down  in history as more than just survivors. We in Congress can help make  that happen.   I was proud to stand in solidarity with you all this morning, hand- in-hand as you were armed with passion and vision; unapologetic about  your stance on these issues as you continue to display your advocacy as  bold, relentless and engaged leaders of our future.   Mr. Speaker, they want universal background checks, and sensible  legislation that will curtail gun violence, thereby, keeping guns out  of their schools and out of the hands of those that threaten to take  lives and wreak havoc in our churches, theatres, concerts and schools.   ``When will it all stop,'' they asked. We too in Congress must  evaluate ourselves and ask: when will we respond adequately?   My heart goes out to students and parents all across America who find  themselves routinely faced with these tragic incidents of great  proportion; from Columbine to Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook, and Parkland;  and our cities like Chicago, Baltimore and the rest of America.   These are the faces of our children as they were leaving Marjory  Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., after the Valentine's  Day deadly shooting.   ``I didn't get a chance that morning to say goodbye to my daughter,  but I'm here today to make sure that I'm one of the last fathers that  ever has to bury their daughter or son or loved one from a senseless  act of violence in a school,'' said Ryan Petty, whose daughter Alaina  Petty was among the 17 killed.   Mr. Petty, I hear you. I agree with my colleagues, that school safety  is paramount and that is why I signed onto this bill following the  Parkland school shooting.   This bill is not perfect and I will address my concerns. But it is a  good first step.   As Ranking Member of the Judiciary Crime Subcommittee, I caution any  measure that could adversely impact our constitutional rights.   Had this bill went through regular order, I would have amended it  with a clause that would prescribe due process or civil rights  protections in the anonymous reporting system. This would allow the  accused with notice and an opportunity to respond with representation.   As written, this bill is amenable to abuse where false and malicious  information can be reported by any staff or student who may have a bias  against the accused but alarmingly, the accused has no avenue for a  remedy in defending him/herself.   I want to ensure that the current race-based disparities in how  students are treated by school police and staff are not further  exacerbated by this bill as written.   H.R. 4909 provides that there be coordination with law enforcement in  providing security, which will increase law enforcement presence in  schools rather than use evidence-based interventions.   I would like to add to this bill, a clause requiring that data be  collected of any activities undertaken with grant funding to determine  whether they are disproportionately affecting students of color or  other at-risk groups.   Research has shown, when law enforcement engage minority students,  there is a high likelihood of increasing the `schoolhouse to jailhouse'  track.   Students of color make up over 58% of school-based arrests, but only  % of public school enrollment. A judicious approach is therefore  warranted in implementing this bill.   Finally, any recipient of federal grants should be required to comply  with all federal laws, including civil rights laws protecting students  based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability and  age.   In our quest for school safety we must always exercise due care in  balancing a benefit against the backdrop of our civil liberties so that  we do not repeat incidents like North Carolina, where a young girl was  grabbed around the neck with one arm, by school resources officer  gripping her arm with his other hand and flipping her backward out of  her chair.   I stand firm with students everywhere because they ``all'' are the  future of America. And standing with them all no matter where they are  from is a net positive for us all.    Mr. Speaker, in the course of my coming over to the  floor, we heard a comment, which I intend to check, of an accidental  discharge of a firearm by a resource officer in a school in Virginia.  The gun went off.   I just want to conclude by saying that we have brought people  together in that nothing in this bill will allow for Federal funds to  be used in these grants for the arming of teachers. I think the AFT has  evidenced their support for that.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Preventing Crimes Against Veterans Act of 2017 would  make it a crime to knowingly engage in any scheme to defraud a veteran  or his or her dependents of veterans' benefits. This legislation  provides an important, additional tool for Federal prosecutors to use  to combat veterans' benefits fraud.   Because we honor the service of our brave men and women, and because  of the sacrifices our veterans have made for us, it is particularly  important that we protect them from fraud and ensure the integrity of  the benefit system we provide.   According to a 2016 AARP study of investment fraud victims, it shows  that while veterans are less than 10 percent of the U.S. population,  they were one-third, 33 percent, of the victims of investment fraud  because their money is certain. A recent Federal Trade Commission's  Consumer Sentinel program reveals that the number of complaints filed  by military veterans each year has increased by 63 percent over the  past 5 years.   Recently, my State of Texas highlighted these issues in an article  which reported that several disabled veterans were unable to receive  their benefits via direct deposit. Investigation revealed a number of  veterans did not receive their VA disability compensation checks due to  the theft that occurred by way of perpetrators rerouting veterans'  benefits to virtual banks.   Veterans are the targets of many of the same types of fraudulent  activities as the rest of society, including mail, telephone, and  online fraud. They are more victimized by fraud than nonveterans, and  have lost money to scams 16 percent more than nonveterans during the  past 5 years.   Nearly 78 percent of veterans report having been a target of veteran- specific scams, such as approving a VA loan, taking advantage of  little-known government programs for vets, or paying for a back, knee,  or arm brace because of one's military service. Nearly 22 percent of  veterans report receiving 10 or more suspicious phone calls per week.  Nearly all veterans, 97 percent, have received at least one scam  attempt in the past 5 years.   We hope we can stop this.   Currently, there are about 21 million veterans--and more upcoming--of  the United States military. These are men and women who selflessly  served our Nation and in the theaters of war, from the Second World  War, Korea, and Vietnam, to more recent conflicts in Iraq and  Afghanistan. As I indicated, our veterans will continue to grow and be  vulnerable to scams.   Unfortunately, many of our veterans, as a result of their service,  have physical and mental scars. There are well over 1 million American  veterans with service-connected disabilities. It was my privilege to  institute a PTSD center in my own district supported by the late  Congressman Murtha.   In addition, veterans are more likely than nonveterans to become  homeless. They comprise 17 percent of our homeless population, even  though many of them are eligible for veterans' benefits. On any given  night, an estimated 50,000 veterans are sleeping on America's streets.   In recognition of the extreme sacrifice by our veterans and the  hardships many of them continue to face after their military service,  it is our duty to provide, to the best of our ability, an appropriate  measure of compensation for them, particularly those in need.   For instance, we provide disability payments to those with service- connected disabilities, pensions for veterans with limited incomes,  education and training under the GI Bill, and also various life  insurance benefits.   This is the least we can do, and it is still not enough. There  continues to be issues with the medical care we provide our veterans  and problems about some benefits never being processed and paid because  of the loss of claims by the Veterans Benefits Administration.   That is why we must prohibit any schemes to defraud a veteran of his  or her veteran's benefits. Anyone convicted of such crime could be  fined, imprisoned, or be subject to both penalties. Those who defraud  veterans or their surviving spouses or dependents endanger our system  of veterans' benefits not only by harming the victims, but also by  diminishing resources required to pay the claims and fund the programs  that are needed to help those who have served their country have a  decent quality of life.   Accordingly, I support H.R. 506. I commend the bill's sponsors,  Representative Tom Rooney and Representative Ted Deutch, for their work  on this important issue.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support H.R. 506, the ``Preventing  Crimes Against Veterans Act of 2017,'' which would make it a crime to  knowingly engage in any scheme to defraud a veteran or his dependents  of veteran's benefits. This legislation provides an important,  additional tool for federal prosecutors to use to combat veterans'  benefits fraud.   Because we honor the service of our brave men and women, and because  of the sacrifices our veterans have made for us, it is particularly  important that we protect them from fraud and ensure the integrity of  the benefit system we provide.

Accordingly, I support H.R. 506 and I commend the bill's sponsors,  Representative Tom Rooney and Representative Ted Deutch, for their work  on this important issue.   Mr. Speaker, we must do everything we can to protect our Veterans who  have given so much of themselves to keep us all safe. We must ensure  that the benefits they have earned are safeguarded against criminal  acts.   We ask our veterans to lay their lives on the line so that we can  enjoy the freedom, which is at the heart of this great country. We owe  them much. Surely we can and should repay our gratitude whenever we  can.   Protecting their veterans' benefits is one way of expressing our  appreciation, and it is the right and just thing to do.   For reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch), the coauthor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 506 creates a new section, 1352, in chapter 63,  title 18, to penalize fraudsters that knowingly execute or attempt to  execute a scheme or artifice to defraud a veteran of his or her  benefits--that is a dastardly act--or in connection with obtaining that  veteran's benefits by imposing a fine, imprisonment of up to 5 years,  or both.   Under current law, you can be an agent or attorney and meet certain  standards and you can help a veteran. But there are many who were not  licensed, not connected, or had the approval of various States or local  governments, and they were fraudulently taking precious resources from  our veterans. There was no criminal or financial penalty for breaking  the law.   So, H.R. 506 provides that penalty because, in recent years,  financial predators across the country have targeted easy targets, who  are veterans. Many, as we have said, have been physically or mentally  maimed in their service to this Nation. Many of them are also elderly  and live in low-income housing.   This bill is long in coming. I thank Mr. Rooney and Mr. Deutch,  working with the members of the Judiciary Committee, for moving this  legislation forward.    We ask our veterans to lay their lives on the line so that we can  enjoy freedom, which is at the heart of this great country. We owe them  much. Surely, we can repay our gratitude whenever we can. Protecting  their veterans' benefits is one way of expressing our appreciation, and  it is the right and just thing to do.   Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, to the distinguished manager and to the author of this  legislation, there is certainly room for legislation that speaks to the  needs of our children and speaks to those who obviously have joined  vicious and violent gangs even though of young ages.   I will always, however, reemphasize the message that, as we look at  these efforts, as I speak about my Juvenile Block Grant Antibullying  and Prevention Act, legislation that I would like to see go through the  Judiciary Committee, we must be reminded that, in order to continue to  be safe, this Congress cannot ignore debate and passage of gun safety  legislation.   Guns kill. AR-15s kill. The lack of raising the age from 18 to 21 for  guns  [[Page H1575]]  hurts our children. Not having universal background checks hurts our  children. But at the same time, we must find ways to stem the tide of  gangs, and there are many gangs throughout the Nation.   Just speaking with my law enforcement, the gang names that came to me  were not just MS-13. We will find gangs in our particular jurisdictions  that have many names. But whatever their names, their behavior is  dastardly and it is injurious, and if we can find ways to keep our  neighborhood safe, as H.R. 3249 intends to do, the Project Safe  Neighborhoods Grant Program Authorization Act of 2017, which would  provide additional resources to help local jurisdictions prevent and  fight crime in their communities, then we should stand together to do  so.   The bill would authorize the Attorney General to establish and  implement a program to be known as the Project Safe Neighborhoods Block  Program within the Office of Justice Programs at the Department of  Justice, thereby providing a formal authorization for the Project Safe  Neighborhoods program currently implemented by DOJ. A portion of the  funding awards under the program would be allocated to fighting gang- related crime.   While I support authorizing this program, I would like to highlight  two concerns. The first is the Juvenile Block Grant Antibullying and  Prevention Act, which would have reauthorized the juvenile block grants  which would go to communities for a variety of reasons. That has been  stalled in the Judiciary Committee under the pretense of not having an  offset. And I see that this particular legislation does have,  seemingly, a $70 million a year authorization without an offset.   So I think we should work together, and as I support this  legislation, I think we should support other legislative initiatives  that can really intervene. It is clear that the perpetrator in Florida,  there is some evidence, some newspaper reporting, that this individual  was bullied and had a very difficult life. We see that that is  certainly a reason that young people become gang members.   So as we look to supporting this legislation, I think that we should  look to broaden our support and work on the whole idea of steering our  children away from the idea of gangs, guns, and violence.   I would hope, first, a substantial portion of the funding of this  bill will be dedicated to antigang task forces. I support preventing  and fighting crime no matter who the perpetrator may be. But I also  want to make sure that we look holistically at dealing with young  people and that we have alternatives for them, which block-granting  does in giving alternatives to communities to direct young people in  other directions other than gangs.    We must be vigilant in conducting oversight, also, of the use of  program funds and in protecting those program funds so that they can be  utilized for authorization of other efforts to help our young people.   Let me also indicate that this program should be one facet of working  with young people. The program will be one facet of DOJ's efforts to  address gun and gang violence at the local, State, and Tribal levels.   The Juvenile Accountability Block Grants, which provide other funds  for a myriad of activities in our local communities, we should view it  from the holistic perspective and as an effort to supplement but not  supplant alternatives that may employ different but yet still effective  approaches, which I am speaking of through the Juvenile Accountability  Block Grants program. None of the funding prohibitions would serve the  interest of public safety.   For instance, the bill would eliminate the Byrne Criminal Justice  Innovation Program, which, when implemented, helps local governments  develop crime reduction strategies to address crime in hotspots that  generate a significant amount of crime within larger communities or  jurisdictions.   The Byrne Criminal Justice Innovation Program is a community-based  strategy that aims to prevent and control violent crime, drug abuse,  and gang activity in high-crime neighborhoods by providing funding to  support partnerships between law enforcement agencies and community- based organizations that balance targeted enforcement with prevention,  intervention, and neighborhood restoration services. If you ask your  local police, many of them will tout the Byrne program as being very  successful.   In the past, OJP has coordinated the efforts of this program with  related efforts to promote neighborhood revitalization by the  Department of Housing and Urban Development and Department of  Education. We see no reason to eliminate the possibility of funding for  this program which is very helpful.   So along with the Juvenile Accountability Block Grants program and  many others, I believe this legislation can be enhanced. I hope that as  we make our way through the legislative process, we will not only work  with H.R. 3249, but we will also work with other legislation that will  holistically help the crime situation in our Nation and secure young  people as they desire to be secured and, particularly, work on gun  violence, which is severe in many of our communities.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   In closing, again, I want to acknowledge the author of H.R. 3249 for  an important statement regarding gangs, and I would hope that we could  continue to work on these issues. For instance, the bill would  eliminate the Byrne Criminal Justice Innovation Program, and I hope  that we can restore that.   As well, I hope that we can work very closely on other legislative  initiatives that are going through the Judiciary Committee. A holistic  approach is the best approach. And then I hope that we can restore the  funding that is necessary for some of the programs that have been  eliminated because of this legislation. Good as it may be, it is  important to do a combination of efforts to deal with protecting  children and steering children away from these vile actions.   Mr. Speaker, I truly believe that there are programs dealing with  bullying and prevention of bullying that can complement the work that  is being done here and the Byrne program that has been utilized by the  Department of Housing and Urban Development, cleaning neighborhoods,  making neighborhoods safe. I can see it in my congressional district  and I can see it in other congressional districts, to come in and  combine with those resources. And then, of course, are the resources  that uplift our young people, steer them in the right direction and  provide alternative support systems for them.   As many people know, in years gone by, something that many people  found humorous was midnight basketball. Today I hear law enforcement  officers say: You know, that midnight basketball really worked so many  years ago.   We need to look at a collective approach to getting kids off the  street, making sure our children are safe, and that they don't find, as  their only relief, gangs, but they can also find clean, safe  neighborhoods and neighborhoods that are free of guns as the only tool  to settle their disputes.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, the children of our Nation are raising  their voices. In the last couple of days in my district, many young  people representing the 140,000 DACA-status young people in Texas and  800,000 in the Nation walked and shouted and asked and cajoled and  spoke eloquently about the ridiculous malaise of this Congress, where  we have not reauthorized DACA when there is a bill ready to move.   Do we care about our children? Do we care about the doctors, lawyers,  and astronauts? Do we care about the teachers? Do we care about the  parents--mothers and fathers--all DACA-status individuals who love this  Nation?   And then today we heard from the voices of those who raised their  hands  [[Page H1587]]  and said: I do not feel safe in school. I do not feel safe.   So they left their schools and honored those who died in Florida just  a few weeks ago. They begged for this Nation and this Congress to get  out of its stupor and to begin to pass real gun safety legislation.   Raise the age. Ban the bump stocks. Have universal background checks.  The children's voices are crying.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, where in the world does General Sessions get in  his mind that he can fire FBI Directors, Assistant Directors? And where  in the world does the President get in his mind that he can fire the  Secretary of State in such a disgraceful manner?                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today on this special occasion  to commemorate our beloved colleague and next door neighbor,  Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur from the 9th District of Ohio.   March has been designated to commemorate Women's History Month and  Congresswoman Kaptur has indeed made history this month.   First elected to the 98th Congress in 1982, and reelected to the  succeeding 17 Congresses, Marcy Kaptur is now the longest serving woman  in the history of the U.S. House of Representatives, breaking the  record previously set by Congresswoman Edith Nourse Rogers of  Massachusetts.   Congresswoman Kaptur, a native Toledoan, lives in the same modest  house where she grew up.   She is a Polish-American with humble, working class roots.   Her family operated a small grocery store and her mother later served  on the original organizing committee of a trade union at the Champion  Spark Plug factory in Toledo.   After graduating from St. Ursula Academy, she became the first member  of her family to attend college, earning a bachelor's degree in history  from the University of Wisconsin (1968) and later a master's degree in  urban planning from the University of Michigan.   After working for 15 years as a city and regional planner, primarily  in Toledo and Chicago, she accepted an appointment as a domestic policy  advisor to President Jimmy Carter.   During his Administration, she helped maneuver 17 housing and  neighborhood revitalization bills through Congress.   In 1981, while pursuing a doctorate in urban planning and development  finance at MIT, she was recruited by the Lucas County Democratic Party  to run for Congress against a first-term Republican.   Although she was outspent by a 3-to-1 margin, Marcy Kaptur parlayed a  strong economic message during the 1982 recession to stage a  nationally-recognized upset.   In Washington, Marcy Kaptur fought vigorously to win a seat on the  House Appropriations Committee.   Today she is the ranking member on the Energy and Water  Appropriations Subcommittee, which is fitting given that the Ninth  [[Page H1601]]  District hugs the Lake Erie coastline from Cleveland to Toledo.   Congresswoman Kaptur also is the first Democratic woman ever to serve  on the powerful Defense Subcommittee.   There, she is a strong advocate for national security, energy  independence and adequate support for the armed forces.   She is also a member of the Interior Subcommittee where she fights  for clean water programs that protect our Great Lakes.   Earlier in her congressional career, she served on the Appropriations  Financial Services Subcommittee as well as the Banking Committee.   She served on the Budget Committee as recently as the 112th Congress.   She has received the Prisoner of War ``Barbed Wire'' Award for her  commitment to veterans' affairs.   She has secured funding for a path-breaking study into the incidence  of post-traumatic stress disorders and other mental health issues among  our armed forces.   And she helped lead a community effort to save the 180th Fighter Wing  in Toledo when it was threatened by the base closure commission.   Congresswoman Kaptur has always shown strong interest in America's  standing in the world and its relations with other countries.   She currently serves on the Congressional-Executive Commission on  China and co-chairs the Congressional Hungarian Caucus and also the  Ukraine Caucus.   A strong supporter of Middle East peace, she directed the first  surplus farm commodities in 1999 to support the peace process in  Lebanon, Israel and the Palestinian Authority.   Congresswoman Kaptur remains dedicated to the development of  democratic institutions globally.   She has spearheaded private charitable efforts to alleviate suffering  in nations such as Ukraine and Vietnam.   As leader on issues related to international trade and human and  labor rights, Marcy Kaptur has led the fight for fair trade laws,  dating back to her opposition to the North American Free Trade  Agreement.   In 1993, Congresswoman Kaptur was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Laws  degree by the University of Toledo in recognition of her ``effective  representation of the community.''   St. Ursula Academy named Marcy Kaptur Alumna of the Year in 1995.   She is recipient of the Taubman College Distinguished Alumna award  from the University of Michigan, making her the first woman so  recognized and the first graduate of the Urban and Regional Planning  Program to be so honored.   Marcy Kaptur recently received the Director's Award from the Edmund  A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University for her  commitment to increased understanding and appreciation of the peoples  and cultures of Eurasia, Russia and East Europe.   Marcy Kaptur was named the National Mental Health Association's  ``Legislator of the Year'' for her championing mental health and  received the 2002 Ellis Island Medal of Honor.   Marcy Kaptur is also the author of a book, Women in Congress: A  Twentieth Century Odyssey that was published by Congressional Quarterly  in 1996.   Dedicated to the principle that fiscal responsibility begins in  ``one's own backyard,'' Congresswoman Kaptur has consistently returned  money to the federal Treasury.   Marcy Kaptur refuses to accept Congressional pay raises and donates  them to offset the federal deficit and charitable causes in her home  community.   Marcy Kaptur leads the charge on urban agriculture in Congress, she  introduced the Urban Agriculture Production Act of 2017, which will  create help create jobs, healthier, local food options and  opportunities for cities and towns to become part of the food  production process.   With all of that said, Congresswoman Kaptur's kindness,  thoughtfulness, and generosity precede her.   When Hurricane Harvey hit the 18th District, she promptly sent my  staff a box of doughnuts, knowing they would need that extra push to  get through the busy hours ahead.   Congresswoman Kaptur goes above and beyond her job description as  Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and  Water Development, and Related Agencies.   Marcy Kaptur worked closely with me to pass several Jackson Lee  amendments to Energy and Water Appropriations spending bills to provide  funding for flood mitigation studies in Houston and Harris County and  was crucial in securing House passage of the supplemental  appropriations providing disaster recovery relief for hurricane Harvey  victims.   So on behalf of the residents of the 18th District of Texas, I say  thank you Congresswoman Kaptur for being there and standing strong with  us in our time of need.   Her compassion shows through random acts of kindness and  thoughtfulness ranging from holding the door open for a young staffer  to calling to check on the status of the 18th District as she is  concerned about the human consequences of extreme flooding--I imagine  her background in urban planning plays a role in her attentiveness.   As the Ranking Member for the subcommittee with Jurisdiction over the  Army Corps of Engineer, Congresswoman Kaptur helped in the effort to  secure funding allocated to study floods--a crucial program for  Hurricane Harvey recovery and future preparedness.   Thank you for your leadership, Congresswoman Kaptur.
