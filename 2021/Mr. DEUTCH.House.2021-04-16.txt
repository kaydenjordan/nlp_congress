 Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to my good  friend, Shawn Friedkin, who left this Earth on March 3 after a  courageous battle with cancer.   When Shawn was 27, he was tragically injured in a car accident. The  accident took away Shawn's ability to walk, but it also inspired him to  dedicate his life to helping other exceptional people. He founded the  nonprofit association, Stand Among Friends, whose mission followed  Shawn's, to help people with disabilities to live a life without  limits.   Stand Among Friends partnered with Florida Atlantic University to  open the Disability Center, which provides resources and career  guidance to help individuals with disabilities find meaningful  employment. Shawn was a founding member of the Boca Raton Advisory  Board for People with Disabilities. He advocated for the disabled  community and was appointed to the White House Healthcare Task Force.   Shawn's mission was to help people with disabilities embrace their  differences, realize their abilities, and leave a positive impact on  their community. And his positive impact leaves a lasting legacy  through the lives of all the people he helped personally, and most of  all through his loving family. All of us are privileged to call him a  friend,   Above all, Shawn was devoted to his family and cherished spending  time with his loving wife of 38 years, Lisa, and their incredible  daughters, Bennett and Sydney. We will all miss Shawn's endless  kindness, compassion, and generosity. Our lives are better for having  Shawn as part of them.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Shawn  Friedkin's life on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives.                            ____________________
