 Mr. President, in the face of the ever growing threat of  climate chaos, it is vital for the future of our Nation and our planet  that we move swiftly and boldly to transition from an energy economy  that relies on carbon fossil fuels to one that is electrified and  powered by clean and renewable sources of energy.   The Inflation Reduction Act makes historic investments in making that  greener, cleaner future a reality. Included in those investments is the  residential clean energy credit for battery storage technology. When we  talk about transitioning to a greener economy, energy storage is  critical. With this credit, homeowners can install energy storage  capacity in two ways: by purchasing stand-alone batteries or by  purchasing a bidirectional charger so the batteries in their electric  vehicle can discharge to their home or the electric grid. Both will be  ``qualified battery storage technology expenditures'' under this  legislation.   Bidirectional charging is an exciting, groundbreaking new frontier  for our vehicles and for our energy grid. I was excited, not too long  ago, to see Ford's new F-150 Lightning with my own eyes when one was  parked outside the front of this Capitol. And it was impressive, and I  think it could be a game changer. One of the features I loved most is  that, in the event that a storm knocks out power to a house, the F-150  Lightning can be plugged in as a backup to keep the lights on. Not only  is that convenient, it could be lifesaving.   So I am very excited that this tax credit, which will be essential to  the continued development and deployment of bidirectional battery  storage technology, is included in the Inflation Reduction Act. And I  look forward to supporting it in this bill and then building from it in  the days to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on August 2, 2022, I missed rollcall vote  No. 280, the Honoring our PACT Act of 2022. Had I been in attendance, I  would have voted yea.   Millions of American veterans whose time in the military spanned from  Vietnam to Iraq and Afghanistan came home injured from toxic exposure  to Agent Orange, burn pits, and more while serving our Nation with  honor. They deserve not only our utmost respect for their sacrifice,  but also the ability to access their earned benefits without  bureaucratic obstacles. For too long, these veterans were met with  skepticism and denial about the consequences of toxic exposure, despite  mounting evidence of the serious health consequences that can stem from  this exposure. No more.   These generations of men and women stood up for us, now it is our  duty to stand up for them. Ensuring that those exposed to these harmful  and deadly toxins can get the care they need is the least that we can  do for such heroes.   Mr. President, on August 3, 2022, I missed rollcall vote No. 282,  Treaty Doc. 117-3, Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on  the Accession of the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden. Had  I been in attendance, I would have voted yea.   For over seven decades, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization-- NATO--has been the bedrock of security in Europe and helped preserve  world order. Today, in the face of Russia's unprovoked invasion of  Ukraine, the importance of transatlantic strength and unity cannot be  overstated.   It is more important than ever that, as we remain committed to the  pursuit of peace and prosperity in Europe, we work with our NATO allies  to stand up to Vladimir Putin's aggression and send a clear message to  any who attempt to follow his path that the free world will not stand  idly by while its values and its sovereignty are attacked.   The addition of these two Nordic countries and European Union  members, Finland and Sweden, who have long acted in partnership with  this alliance, will serve to not only send that critical message, but  will make NATO a stronger force for peace in the world.   This is a historic day. And I gladly support and welcome the addition  of these two important allies whose military and diplomatic  capabilities will help NATO better address urgent and emerging threats  to European and global security.   Mr. President, on August 4, 2022, I missed rollcall vote No. 283, a  joint resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act. Had  I been in attendance, I would have voted no because this resolution  would undermine core provisions of the National Environmental Policy  Act--NEPA--that are critical for protecting our environment, our water  and air, endangered species and their habitats, and the well-being of  the American people.   The purpose of NEPA is to ensure that the Federal Government fully  thinks through and considers all of the impacts of infrastructure  projects, both the direct and indirect cumulative impact of a projects.  In the fight against climate chaos, NEPA is a critical tool for  ensuring that our government considers all of the ways that a project  might add to or mitigate the climate crisis, and then empower agencies  to analyze reasonable alternatives that are less harmful to our natural  environment.   As part of its relentless campaign to undermine the fight against  climate chaos, the last administration went to  [[Page S4435]]  great lengths to weaken NEPA's ability to protect our environment and  severely limited the ability of agencies to seek out less harmful  alternatives. The previous administration also directed that the  indirect and cumulative impacts of Federal projects no longer needed to  be considered. As stated in a letter sent to the Senate by a group of  200 organizations representing millions of members and supporters,  these changes were a blatant effort ``to entrench federal climate  denial, hastily permit dangerous or polluting projects, and  systematically disenfranchise low-income, rural, and minority  communities from government decision-making.''   Since coming into office, President Biden has worked to restore  NEPA's core provisions, reduce litigation risk, and help deliver more  sustainable and equitable projects. The ``Phase 1'' rulemaking that  this CRA attacks, is essential to addressing the climate crisis and  ensuring environmental justice for communities that disproportionately  bear its brunt. If this joint resolution were to pass, it would not  only undermine our agencies' ability to mitigate climate change or make  decisions that ensure a project is more resilient to the foreseeable  effects of a changing climate, it would also potentially stop any  future administration from using NEPA to address the climate impacts of  Federal decisions. That would be disastrous for our environment, for  our country, and for the American people.   Therefore, as previously stated, for the well-being of our planet and  of future generations, had I been present, I would have strongly  opposed this effort to weaken the National Environmental Policy Act and  voted no on this joint resolution.   Mr. President, on August 4, 2022, I missed rollcall vote No. 284,  confirmation of Executive Calendar No. 1100, Roopali H. Desai, of  Arizona, to be U.S. Circuit Judge for the Ninth Circuit. Had I been in  attendance, I would have voted yea.                            ____________________
