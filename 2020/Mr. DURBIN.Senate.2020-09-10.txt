 I want to thank my colleague from New York for his  comments this morning. He is right. We have seen this play before. We  know how it ends. Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, comes to  the floor and proclaims that his latest creation is bipartisan; the  Democrats have a choice to vote yes or no; take it or leave it; we are  done.   We have been through this over and over again. That is not how  Congress or human activity works. We have a split government between  Democrats and Republicans. When we sit down together and compromise,  good things can happen. We proved it March 26. The vote was 96 to 0 for  the CARES Act, a $3 trillion bill early on to address the coronavirus  pandemic and to deal with the serious challenges to our economy.   Thank goodness we did it. It gave $600 a week in additional Federal  supplements and unemployment to families who were facing layoffs and  closures of their businesses. We helped  [[Page S5530]]  small businesses injecting billions of dollars back into protecting  their payroll and keeping the lights on for the day when they can  return.   It worked, and it worked on a bipartisan basis, but where we are  today reflects a failure and a repetition on the Republican side.   Explain to me this: Why did the Republican Senate leader refuse to  physically present himself at any stage of the negotiation since March  26 for relief from this coronavirus pandemic? That is right. Senator  McConnell refuses to enter the room where representatives of the White  House and Democratic congressional leaders were meeting to discuss a  bipartisan compromise. We can't reach a compromise unless we clearly  have all the parties at the table. When the Republican congressional  leaders--McConnell, McCarthy of California on the House side--boycott  these meetings for negotiations, nothing happens.   I can't tell you how many times back in Illinois during the August  recess I was asked, so are you going back to Washington?   I said: Yes, we are planning on going back the first week in  September.   What are you going to go?   I said: I don't know.   At this point, there has been no negotiation and compromise. Today we  have a vote. We have been through this before. It is a McConnell  proposal that was not put to any kind of bipartisan negotiation. It is  a one-sided offering. It fails in so many respects.   Think if you are unemployed, trying to make your mortgage payments,  car payments, medical bill payments, credit card payments, put food on  the table, make sure the kids are ready to go back to school, and  Senator McConnell announces, well, we are going to cut that check you  have been receiving for unemployment benefits in half. It will not be  $600 a week; it will be $300 a week.   Why? For that family, their needs and their bills are still the same.  The economy is still hurting, with 30 million-plus Americans out of  work, 800,000 in Illinois receiving unemployment benefits, I am sure  thousands in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. And yet the reality is, what  is going to be proposed by Senator McConnell today will create a  hardship on these families they never envisioned.   Is there any money in there to protect these families from being  evicted? No. Wait a minute. How about food stamps and SNAP? Many of  these families are struggling to put food on the table. Any help in  this bill for them? No. How about money for testing so that we can find  out if people have positive results and should quarantine themselves  and stay away from others? No, not the kind of investment that is  needed at this moment in history.   Time and again, what this Senator from Kentucky has given us is just  an effort to say we tried. But he didn't. He didn't present himself at  one of the negotiations to make a bipartisan bill.   There is one provision I just want to spend a minute on here that  really is troubling. Senator McConnell has announced for months that  nothing will move, nothing will help Americans unemployed or small  businesses until he gets what he called his redline proposal on  liability immunity.   Basically, what they have done is to write a provision in this bill  which absolves businesses from their responsibility to the public and  to their employees when it comes to safety in the workplace and the  marketplace. They have argued they have to do it because of the tsunami  of frivolous lawsuits they anticipate because of COVID-19.   It turns out that that so-called tsunami has never materialized. The  lawsuits that are being filed are primarily by businesses against  insurance companies to decide coverage under insurance policies and by  inmates in prisons who are protesting what they consider to be inhumane  conditions in the midst of a pandemic. It is only a handful of lawsuits  that have been filed against businesses or malpractice suits related to  COVID-19 infections   Here is the bottom line: Conscientious businesspeople in Illinois and  across America are prepared to make their business place safe for the  people who work there in the marketplace.   What they need is a rational, clear statement of public health  experts as to what they must do. I heard this over and over again. They  said to me: Senator, give me the standards on social distancing and  labeling and sanitizers and masks, and we will live up to them.   We can never guarantee that someone will not file a frivolous  lawsuit, but we should be able to say to people, if you will follow the  public health experts with a real standard of care, then your motion to  dismiss is going to prevail in that lawsuit, and that will be the end  of it.   But Senator McConnell thinks there is a better way to really absolve  them from meeting any standard when it comes to public health. In fact,  what he proposes today basically says: If you try to comply with any  local ordinance, good enough; enough said; it doesn't have to be any  standard of public health that is credible.   This doesn't keep America safe. What it is going to do is encourage  the bad actors to do little or nothing. If we are going to deal with  this pandemic, everyone has to be serious about it--from wearing these  masks to social distancing, to putting up with what has become a  tedious responsibility of staying away from friends and family when you  want to be with them to get this behind us.   When it comes to the business and marketplace, the same thing  applies. They are going to have to pitch in, if they want to reopen-- and I wish they could today or tomorrow--but if I, they went to reopen,  they have to pitch in with a good-faith effort to meet a good public  standard. I will stand by them, and everyone else will too.   Senator McConnell's approach absolves them from responsibility. It is  liability immunity and an invitation for bad actors to do little or  nothing in protecting innocent people, including their own employees.   I am going to yield the floor at this point and say that we can do  better than what Senator McConnell is offering the Senate today. We can  gather on a bipartisan basis and reach a compromise if he will attend  the negotiations.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from California (Ms. Harris)  and the Senator from Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from California (Ms. Harris)  and the Senator from Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from California (Ms. Harris)  is necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from California (Ms. Harris)  is necessarily absent.    Mr. President, in 1978, I was the Democratic nominee for  Lieutenant Governor of Illinois, running with Michael Bakalis, the  Democratic nominee for governor. We squared off against a ticket headed  by six-foot-six Governor Big Jim Thompson. Big Jim was 40 years old and  a relatively new Governor, only elected 2 years earlier. Bakalis and I  were underdogs, but we were hopeful. We shouldn't have been.   Our fate was sealed when Jim and Jayne were joined by their beautiful  daughter Samantha right after Labor Day. Election day came, and we were  clobbered. We found out what many Democrats would learn over the years.  Big Jim was hard as hell to beat. Why? He may have campaigned as a  partisan, but he governed in bipartisanship. His talent for working to  get things done helped make him the longest serving Governor in  Illinois history.   Last month, Jim passed away. I was honored to call him a friend and,  today, I would like to pay tribute to his life.   James Robert Thompson, Jr. was born on the West Side of Chicago in  1936. Jim was known to be shy but ambitious. He listed his ambition as  ``President-Politician'' in his yearbook. In one classmate's yearbook,  he wrote ``Jim Thompson, Pres. of U.S. 1984-1992.''   Jim attended the University of Illinois at its campus on Navy Pier in  Chicago. He transferred to Washington University in St. Louis in his  junior year and attended law school at Northwestern in 1959.   In 1961, Jim worked for the Cook County State's attorney and argued  two cases before the United States Supreme Court. He also joined  Northwestern University Law School as an assistant professor.   For 5 years, Jim taught at Northwestern, inspiring many students to  pursue criminal law. In 1969, he became the head of the criminal  division of the U.S. Attorney's office. As fate would have it, he was  the lecturer on criminal procedure in my bar review course. In 1971,  President Richard Nixon appointed him to be the U.S. Attorney for the  Northern District of Illinois.   At the age of 35, Jim was a crusader against corruption in both  parties, leading investigations against Chicago aldermen and Vice  President Spiro Agnew. His efforts made him look like a political  outsider--just what Illinois  [[Page S5543]]  was looking for in a Governor. Jim decided to run for Governor in the  1976 election. During that campaign, he married his wife Jayne.   He won the gubernatorial race as the first candidate in the State  ever to garner 3 million votes. Though he would have a close election  in 1982, Big Jim never lost a race.   As Governor, he accomplished a lot of good for the State of Illinois.  He spurred the construction of more highways than any other Governor.  His ``Build Illinois'' plan launched a $2.3 billion infrastructure  effort that helped turn the State into a national leader in economic  development, historic preservation, and environmental protection.   There are too many projects to name that Jim championed through the  State legislature. He helped bring about Navy Pier's renovation, making  it the State's top tourist destination. When the Chicago White Sox were  on the verge of leaving Chicago for Florida, he fought hard to keep  them. Jim was working the votes well into the night, and the White Sox  got their new stadium. He supported the legislation that paved the way  for the Chicago Bulls' arena, the United Center.   When Republicans in the Illinois House sought to make Illinois a  right-to-work State, Jim called local beer distributors in Springfield  and had them set up on the lawn of the Governor's mansion, where he  invited protesting labor members to have a drink. The right-to-work  legislation never passed.   In 1989, Jim decided against running for a fifth term. He had guided  the State through a recession and helped rebuild it. He made countless  deals with people of both parties. Jim could have coasted on the  reputation he had built, but he didn't. He joined the law firm Winston  & Strawn, and within 2 years, he was chairman and had made the firm a  powerhouse. Jim also continued to serve his country as he was part of  the 9/11 Commission, he chaired the Illinois Sports Facilities  Authority, and he argued several cases before the Illinois Supreme  Court. He retired in 2015.   Jim Thompson never hesitated to work with the other side for a  greater good. We were political adversaries, yet we also were personal  friends. Sure, we disagreed on quite a bit, but we always worked  together for the State of Illinois. Loretta and I send our thoughts and  prayers to Jayne and their daughter Samantha.                            ____________________
