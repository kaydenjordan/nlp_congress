 Mr. President, I would like to share a few words  today to honor an outstanding leader and friend of mine who recently  passed away. Eric Feaver was a force in Montana and a lifelong advocate  for educators across our State. He was the former president of  Montana's teacher's union who devoted more than 40 years to improving  the State's public school system. His commitment to Montana's working  [[Page S3200]]  families was tangible and had a profound impact on public policy. It is  safe to say the Treasure State wouldn't be what it is today without  him.   As a fierce advocate for the labor movement, Eric was an inspiration  to fellow labor leaders, politicians, teachers, students, and community  members alike. It takes a lot these days to reach across party lines,  but Eric consistently worked with those who held different views. Just  ask some of the folks who worked with Eric. They will tell you, even  though they didn't always agree with him, they respected him.   Raised in Oklahoma and sent to Vietnam as a conscientious objector  and U.S. Army combat medic at the age of 23, Eric first planted roots  in Montana when he landed a teaching job at Helena Junior High School  in 1974. It didn't take long for Eric to find his way into the State's  labor movement, where he would spend nearly 50 years helping shape  education and union policy.   As a result of Eric's charisma and expertise, he was elected  president of the Montana Education Association in 1984, and in 2000, he  led MEA to a monumental merger with the Montana Federation of Teachers.  As president of MEA-MFT, Eric spearheaded another major merger, which  resulted in the creation of the Montana Federation of Public Employees,  an organization that today represents more than 25,000 public sector  employees. Over the years, Eric continued to bring together folks  across Montana. And he managed to do a lot of good for the State's  workforce and public schools in the process. But even more than his  accomplishments, I think Eric will be remembered for his passion--his  genuine commitment to making the Treasure State a better, fairer place  to live and work.   I am lucky to have called Eric a friend. His legacy and his  friendship have left a lasting imprint on me and so many others. I  extend my deepest condolences to Eric's wife, Ellen; their two  daughters, Amity and Ashley; two sons-in-law, Rich and TJ;  grandchildren, Tristin, Cameron, Braden, Halo, Ethan, and Oliver; and  his brothers, Douglas and Edward.   While Eric is no longer with us, he will go down in Montana history  as one of the State's greatest labor leaders and champions of public  education.   He will be sorely missed.                            ____________________
