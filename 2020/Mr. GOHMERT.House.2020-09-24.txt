 Mr. Speaker, I seek to provide a privileged resolution  here in the House.    H. Res. 1148, raising a question of the privileges of  the House.   Whereas, on July 22, 2020, H.R. 7573 was brought to the House floor  for a vote, with the purpose of eliminating four specific statues or  busts from the United States Capitol along with all others that include  individuals who ``served as an officer or voluntarily with the  Confederate States of America or of the military forces or government  of a State while the State was in rebellion against the United States''  yet failed to address the most ever-present historical stigma in the  United States Capitol; that is the source that so fervently supported,  condoned and fought for slavery was left untouched, without whom, the  evil of slavery could never have continued as it did, to such extreme  that it is necessary to address here in order for the U.S. House of  Representatives to avoid degradation of historical fact and blatant  hypocrisy for generations to come.   Whereas, The Democratic Party Platform of 1840, 1844, 1848, 1852, and  1856 states ``That Congress has no power under the Constitution, to  interfere with or control the domestic institutions of the several  States, and that such States are the sole and proper judges of  everything appertaining to their own affairs, not prohibited by the  Constitution; that all efforts of the abolitionists, or others, made to  induce Congress to interfere with questions of slavery . . . are  calculated to lead to the most alarming and dangerous consequences; and  that all such efforts have an inevitable tendency to diminish the  happiness of the people and endanger the stability and permanency of  the Union, and ought not to be countenanced by any friend of our  political institutions.''    =========================== NOTE ===========================        September 24, 2020, on page H4951, the following appeared: and  that all such efforts have an inevitable tendency to diminish the  happiness of the people and endanger the stability and permanency  of the Union, and ought not to be countenanced by any friend our  political institutions.''      The online version has been corrected to read: and that all such  efforts have an inevitable tendency to diminish the happiness of  the people and endanger the stability and permanency of the Union,  and ought not to be countenanced by any friend of our political  institutions.''    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Whereas, The Democratic Party Platform of 1856 further declares that  ``new states'' to the Union should be admitted ``with or without  domestic slavery, as [the state] may elect.''   Whereas, The Democratic Party Platform of 1856 also resolves that  ``we recognize the right of the people of all of the Territories . . .  to form a Constitution, with or without domestic slavery.''   Whereas, The Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 penalized officials who did  not arrest an alleged runaway slave and made them liable for a fine of  $1,000 (about $28,000 in present-day value); Law-enforcement officials  everywhere were required to arrest people suspected of being a runaway  slave on as little as a claimant's sworn testimony of ownership; the  Democratic Party Platform of 1860 directly, in seeking to uphold the  Fugitive Slave Act, states that, ``the enactments of the State  Legislatures to defeat the faithful execution of the Fugitive Slave Law  are hostile in character, subversive of the Constitution, and  revolutionary in their effect.''   Whereas, The 14th Amendment, giving full citizenship to freed slaves,  [[Page H4952]]  passed in 1868 with 94 percent Republican support, 0 percent Democrat  support in Congress; the 15th Amendment, giving freed slaves the right  to vote, passed in 1870 with 100 percent Republican support and 0  percent Democrat support in Congress.   Whereas, Democrats systematically suppressed African-Americans'  rights to vote, and by specific example in the 1902 Constitution of the  State of Virginia, actually disenfranchised about 90 percent of the  black men who still voted at the beginning of the twentieth century and  nearly half of the white men, thereby suppressing Republican voters;  the number of eligible African-American voters were thereby forcibly  reduced from about 147,000 in 1901 to about 10,000 by 1905; that  measure was supported almost exclusively by Virginia Democrats.   Whereas, Virginia's 1902 Constitution was engineered by Carter Glass,  future Democratic Party U.S. Representative, Senator, and even  Secretary of the Treasury under Democrat President Woodrow Wilson, who  proclaimed the goal of the constitutional convention as follows: This  Democrat exclaimed, ``Discrimination! Why, that is precisely what we  propose. That, exactly, is what this Convention was elected for--to  discriminate to the very extremity of permissible action under the  limits of the federal Constitution, with a view to the elimination of  every Negro voter who can be gotten rid of legally.''    =========================== NOTE ===========================        September 24, 2020, on page H4952, the following appeared: to  discriminate to the very extremity of permissible action under the  limits of the federal Constitution, with a view to elimination of  every Negro voter who can be gotten rid of legally.''      The online version has been corrected to read: to discriminate  to the very extremity of permissible action under the limits of  the federal Constitution, with a view to the elimination of every  Negro voter who can be gotten rid of legally.''    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Whereas, In 1912, Democratic President Woodrow Wilson's  administration began a racial segregation policy for U.S. government  employees and, by 1914, the Wilson administration's Civil Service  instituted the requirement that a photograph be submitted with each  employment application.   Whereas, The 1924 Democratic National Convention convened in New York  City at Madison Square Garden; the convention commonly known as the  ``Klan-Bake'' due to the overwhelming influence of the Ku Klux Klan in  the Democratic Party.   Whereas, Democrat President Franklin Delano Roosevelt continued  Woodrow Wilson's policy of segregating White House staff and maintained  separate dining rooms for white and black staffers. He also continued  the White House Correspondents Association's ban on credentialing black  journalists for White House duties until outside pressure from black  publications finally forced a change in policy in 1944, the last year  of his presidency. According to the American Journal of Public Health,  prior to his presidency, Roosevelt not only banned blacks from  receiving treatment at his polio facility in Warm Springs, Georgia, but  black staff were forced to live in the basement of the facility or in a  segregated dormitory while white staff lived in the hotel or in  surrounding cottages.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        September 24, 2020, on page H4952, the following appeared:  Whereas, Democrat President Franklin Delano Roosevelt continued  Woodrow Wilson's policy of segregating White House staff and  maintained separate dining rooms for white and black staffers.

Board of Education of  Topeka (KS) which determined that segregated public schools were  unconstitutional. Smith's declaration urged people to utilize all  ``lawful means'' to avoid the ``chaos and confusion'' which would occur  if they desegregated schools. History.House.Gov states that, ``Under  Smith, the Rules Committee became a graveyard for numerous civil rights  initiatives in the 1950s.''     =========================== NOTE ===========================        September 24, 2020, on page H4952, the following appeared: the  Supreme Court's 1954 decision on Brown v.

Whereas, Leading the Democrats in their opposition to civil rights  for African-Americans was a fellow member of the Democratic Party,  Senator Robert Byrd from West Virginia--a known recruiter for the Ku  Klux Klan.   Whereas, Democrats enacted and enforced Jim Crow laws and civil codes  that forced segregation and restricted freedoms of black Americans in  the United States; and    =========================== NOTE ===========================        September 24, 2020, on page H4952, the following appeared:  Whereas, Democrats enacted and enforced Jim Crow laws and civil  codes that forced segregation and restricted freedoms of black  Americans in the United States.
