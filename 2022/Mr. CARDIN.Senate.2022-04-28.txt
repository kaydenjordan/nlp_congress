 Mr. President, I rise today to speak about two of the  Federal government's most important innovation programs: the Small  Business Innovation Research program, also known as the SBIR, and the  Small Business Technology Transfer program, or STTR for short.   It is very appropriate we are having this discussion as we are about  to go into conference in regards to legislation that affects America's  competitiveness. The SBIR and the STTR program represent the best of  government industry partnerships.   The programs harness the creativity and ingenuity of America's  entrepreneurs and innovators, solve the most pressing public health and  national security challenges of our time.   The programs are also primed to help our Nation rebuild our domestic  production capacity, to reduce our reliance on foreign supply chains on  critical products, and reduce costs for the American people.   I would like to remind my colleagues that fighting inflation and  rebuilding our domestic manufacturing capacity are inextricably linked.   When factories close, when products sit in shipping containers in  ports, when production capacity decreases due to sick employees, and  when products take longer to get from the warehouse to the store,  prices go up.   I have no doubt that every Senator has heard from businesses in all  sectors of the economy about solving this critical issue.   According to a recent survey the National Federation of Independent  Business conducted, more than half of all small business owners  reported a significant impact due to supply chain disruptions.   Thirty percent reported that the disruptions were causing a  ``moderate impact,'' and 14 percent reported a ``mild impact.'' Only 5  percent of those surveyed reported that they were unaffected by the  disruptions. Of the small business owners affected by disruptions, 80  percent reported that the disruptions have caused them to miss out on  business opportunities.   I am very pleased to hear that President Biden announced during his  State of the Union address that rebuilding America's domestic  production capacity is central to his administration's plan to fight  inflation and keep our Nation secure.   SBIR and STTR are two of the best tools in the Federal government's  toolkit to achieve our goal. Congress created the SBIR in 1982 to  increase the participation of small businesses and Federally funded  research and development opportunities in areas ranging from clean  energy to advanced manufacturing.   Under the program, Federal agencies that budget at least $100 million  annually for outside research must allocate a portion--3.2 percent  since fiscal year 2017--to support R&D and small businesses.   There are 11 Federal agencies and departments currently in the  program, including the Department of Defense, Department of Energy,  Department of Education, and Health and Human Services. The program  awards funds in three phases:   Phase 1 awards are worth up to $225,000 and may be used to conduct a  feasibility study to determine an idea's scientific and commercial  promise.   Phase 2 awards up to $1.5 million and may be used to conduct further  R&D on the feasibility of turning an idea into a commercial product.   And phase 3 does not involve an award of funds, but denotes that an  idea is ready to move from the laboratory to the marketplace.   During the commercialization phase, small businesses must raise  funding from the private sector or secure non-SBIR Federal funds.   Congress created the STTR program in 1992. While the program is  similar to the SBIR in structure, utilizing a similar three-phase  progression, the STTR awards go to small businesses engaging in  collaborative R&D with Federal labs, as well as nonprofit educational  and scientific institutions.   The program requires Federal agencies and departments to spend at  least $1 billion on outside research to allocate at least 0.45 percent  of the funds to STTR opportunities.   Most people may not be familiar with SBIR or STTR, but they  definitely recognize the products and companies in the programs that it  helped create. Sonicare Electric toothbrush, iRobot, Lasik eye surgery,  all received SBIR/STTR funding when they were startups. Qualcomm, which  makes computer chips, semiconductors, and other technologies critical  to our national communication infrastructure, also received funding  from these programs. Progeny Systems, a small business based in  Manassas, VA, received more than 300 SBIR and STTR awards to conduct  research over a 20-year period. Progeny's research produced technology  that drastically improves the Navy's torpedo capacity. The company is  now the sole supplier of torpedos to the Navy; and, yes, it is still a  small business.   This is another benefit of these programs: They expand and diversify  the supplier base from which the Federal agencies source goods and  services, increasing competition and investment in high-growth sectors,  which reduce costs over time.   On the manufacturing front, several agencies, including NASA and the  Department of Defense, are currently funding research on advanced  manufacturing techniques, such as 3D printing and glass that can handle  temperatures as high as 900 degrees, which would revolutionize our  ability to monitor nuclear reactors and power plant furnaces to prevent  accidents.   Simply put, SBIR and STTR are invaluable to our national security,  and we should fund these programs adequately to rebuild our domestic  supply chain. Unfortunately, authority for these critical programs  will expire at the end of September unless Congress acts to extend  them.    The House and Senate will go to conference soon on America COMPETES  Act, which includes a 5-year extension of SBIR and STTR. I urge all my  colleagues, especially those who will be conferees, to support this  critical provision.   The junior Senator from Iowa has submitted a motion to instruct  conferees to couple this effort to extend the SBIR program and the STTR  program by 5 years with authorizing language to prevent China and  Russia from acquiring critical national security technology developed  by the program.   I agree with the Senator that the United States needs to safeguard  technologies from being compromised and stolen, and I am pleased that  the House Competes Act bill includes safeguards to prevent our  adversaries from affecting our innovation--not just China and Russia,  but all foreign countries of concern, including Iran and North Korea.  This effort builds off of section 223 of the fiscal year 2021 National  Defense Authorization Act that provides protections and requires  disclosure to guard against foreign influence on Federally funded  research and development.   So I will support the motion the Senator from Iowa will make; but we  must recognize that if we are able to compete with China and Russia,  extending the authorization for SBIR and STTR are critical. I hope she  will work with me to keep this important program from shutting its  doors on September 30.   I would like to add that this issue is very important to my  constituents in  [[Page S2226]]  Maryland. Our State ranks number one in the Nation in R&D spending due  to the presence of Federal and academic research institutions such as  the National Institutes of Health, the National Institute of Standards  and Technology, Johns Hopkins University, and the University of  Maryland.   I have had many discussions with State government officials and  leading scientists in Maryland who have told me that one of the most  sensible steps we can take to improve the SBIR and STTR program were to  make these programs permanent. The research SBIR and STTR funds often  continues for several years before producing a product ready to go to  the market. Researchers need to know that these programs will not  disappear in the middle of years-long research projects.   It is our responsibility to make sure that we act timely so that  there is no lapse in these programs or reduced funding that is  critically needed for these programs' success.   Any such action would be shortsighted and would have a devastating  impact on small businesses engaged in cutting-edge research Nationwide.  Reducing the size of these programs or allowing them to lapse  altogether would hinder our efforts to restore the production of  critical products.   I recently convened a hearing of the Senate Small Business Committee  to examine the impacts of supply chain disruptions on small businesses.  One of our witnesses, Dr. Sridhar Kota, who leads an organization that  advocates for increased public and private sector investment in  America's manufacturing sector, called the SBIR and the STTR ``one of  the really good tools in the toolbox'' and urged the committee to  strengthen the programs to support even more researchers. I could not  agree more.   Instead of leaving the researchers who are inventing the tools that  will power the economy of the future guessing about the SBIR and STTR,  we in Congress have an opportunity--and I would say an obligation--to  reauthorize these programs before they expire in September. We should  also make them permanent, which both the Pentagon and NASA have urged  us to do. This is in our national security interest, as well as our  economic interest and fairness to small businesses.   Arthur C. Clarke wrote:         New ideas pass through three periods: (1) It can't be done.       (2) It probably can be done, but it's not worth doing. (3) I       knew it was a good idea all along.    The SBIR and the STTR programs help visionary entrepreneurs get  through one and two to reach three. Getting to three makes America  stronger and more prosperous.   Let us make sure that we act in time.   With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
