 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and insert extraneous material on H.R. 7780, the Mental Health  Matters Act.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the mental health  crisis among American students, educators, and families.   In 2021, 44 percent of students experienced persistent feelings of  hopelessness; almost 20 percent seriously considered suicide; and 9  percent of American kids attempted suicide.   Regrettably, 80 percent of youth in need of mental health services do  not have the access to heal in their communities. As a result,  educators have been forced to play an outsized role in supporting and  responding to students' mental health needs, leading to increased  depression and trauma among educators, their students, their families,  and the community. However, our schools do not have the specialized  staff necessary to respond to the increased prevalence and complexity  of students' mental health needs.   According to a 2019 ACLU study, no State met the student-to-social  worker ratio of one social worker for every 250 students, as  recommended by the National Association of Social Workers. Not one  State.   On top of that, the national ratio of school psychologists per  students during the 2020-2022 school years was one psychologist per  every 1,162 students--more than double the ratio recommended by the  National Association of School Psychologists. Clearly, this is  unacceptable.   The rise in mental health challenges is not isolated to students and  educators. Nearly half of the United States workforce now suffers from  mental health issues since the COVID-19 pandemic started. Yet, many  workers are denied the mental health and substance use disorder  benefits they are legally entitled to receive under their employer- sponsored health plan.   In a recent report to Congress, the Departments of Labor, Health and  Human Services, and the Treasury found widespread violations of the  Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act by group health plans.  Unfortunately, some of these plans are failing to maintain parity  between behavioral health benefits and physical health benefits as  required by statute.   The report recommended that Congress enhance the Secretary of Labor's  capacity to enforce the parity law, including providing authority to  impose civil monetary penalties for violations.   Notably, the same recommendations were made by former President  Trump's Commission on Combating the Opioid Crisis, which was led by  then-New Jersey Governor, Chris Christie.   In response to these violations and the national mental health  crisis, I introduced the Mental Health Matters Act, which includes  proposals championed by several committee members.   This legislation helps Head Start agencies implement evidence-based  interventions to improve the behavioral health of children and staff in  Head Start programs.   It improves trauma-informed services in schools by developing  innovative initiatives to link schools and local educational agencies  with local trauma-informed support and mental health systems.   It requires colleges and universities to accept existing  documentation of disability and provide reasonable accommodations so  disabled students can achieve success in higher education.   It also provides the Department of Labor with enhanced authority to  ensure that private, employer-sponsored group health plans and insurers  comply with the mental health parity and related laws.   The bill ensures workers who are wrongfully denied health or  retirement benefits under their job-based plans have meaningful access  to the courts.   And finally, this legislation directs the Department of Education to  award grants to build a pipeline of school-based mental health service  providers and increase the number of mental health professionals  serving in elementary and secondary schools in high-need areas.   Mr. Chairman, simply put, the Mental Health Matters Act delivers the  resources students, educators, and families need to improve their well- being.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.     Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I do want to say that it is always delightful, truthfully,  to see my friend and our differences of opinion. I see Mr. Allen will  speak as well, my wonderful colleague and ranking member of the  subcommittee.   Just as a former small business owner, the term ``voluntary'' is, in  my view, accurate in the sense that it is an employer's choice to  provide health insurance, but the parity is required by statute once  having done that. So, it is a question of terminology, perhaps.   As I have said, even just shortly ago, I am ready to work with my  friend to work on enforcement mechanisms that are efficient because I  think we all agree there is a problem here in this country about mental  health and kids and how we enforce the best possible enforcement for  employers. The vast majority of employers do the right thing, but how  to make sure that people who don't do the right thing, and thereby get  an advantage if we don't enforce the laws against law-abiding  employers, I really think that we can work something out.   This is the best mechanism I see right at the moment, however  imperfect. I look forward to continuing the conversation.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms.  Bonamici), who is the chair of the Civil Rights and Human Services  Subcommittee of the Education and Labor Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the very  distinguished gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney), who is a  member of the Education and Labor Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Connecticut.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Mrs. Hayes), a distinguished member of the Education and  Labor Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Clark).    Mr. Chair, could I ask how much time we have  remaining?    Mr. Chair, we have no more speakers, I am prepared to  close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chair, I love my good friend's closing. That was artful and  poetic, but I respectfully disagree. I look forward to continuing the  conversation, particularly around enforcement and the definition of  parity.   To me, as a former employer, I thought parity was clear, but if we  need more clarity for some employers, I am happy to have that  discussion.   Mr. Chair, as lawmakers, we have a duty to support Americans' health  and well-being. The Mental Health Matters Act will help us deliver on  that goal by ensuring students, educators, and families receive the  support they need to lead healthier and happier lives, and provide  America with future generations of healthy and happy providers.   I thank the gentleman from Virginia, Chairman Scott; the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Chu); the gentlewoman from Massachusetts,  Assistant Speaker Clark; the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Mrs. Hayes);  the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici); the gentleman from  Connecticut (Mr. Courtney); and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Norcross) for their leadership on this legislation.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H8240]]         Mr. Chair, I rise as the designee of the gentleman  from Indiana (Mr. Mrvan), and I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, for nearly 3 years, frontline and essential workers have  experienced traumatic stress while navigating different and difficult  barriers and new challenges in the workplace.   Studies have shown that nearly two-thirds of adults, 63 percent,  believe their lives have been irreversibly changed by the COVID-19  pandemic. Many reported worsening mental health, traumatic stress,  anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, and other negative health  outcomes.   For those who experience loss or workplace violence and harassment,  traumatic stress can make a demanding workload, longer shifts, repeated  staff shortages, and administrative challenges difficult to manage.   That is why Representative Mrvan introduced H.R. 8887, the  Prioritizing Workplace Mental Health and Resilience Act.   Throughout my career in public office, I have worked to ensure that  resources are available for those impacted by PTSD, anxiety,  depression, and other mental health conditions.                                time  1215    The pandemic was particularly challenging for many members of  organized labor in the manufacturing and construction industries, who  continued to show up to work every day during that challenging time,  and this provision would aim to give them the support they deserve.   As Mr. Mrvan's designee, I am offering the text of his Prioritizing  Workplace Mental Health and Resilience Act as an amendment to H.R. 7780  today.   This amendment will ensure affected workers, who made it possible for  our Nation to recover from various challenges posed by COVID-19 in the  public health emergency, are afforded the adequate support services  during their times of need.   The amendment will establish a research program to identify and apply  comprehensive approaches to support frontline and essential workers  exposed to and affected by workplace stressors that contribute to  adverse mental health outcomes.   If adopted, this amendment will require NIOSH, the National Institute  of Occupational Safety and Health, to coordinate with other research  programs within the Institute to develop comprehensive, evidence-based  approaches to support mental health and behavioral health; inform NIOSH  on best practices and recommendations for organizational-level  workplace interventions; support the Institute's mission to prevent  worker injury or illness and reduce the risk of such mental health  outcomes among frontline, essential, and other affected workers.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   In closing, I will just say it is vital that we address the adverse  mental health outcomes that stem from work environments and provide  resources to workers living with PTSD, anxiety, depression, and other  mental health conditions. I urge my colleagues to support this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
