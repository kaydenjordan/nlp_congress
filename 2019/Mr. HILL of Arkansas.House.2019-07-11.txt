 Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman of the full  committee, and I thank the ranking member for yielding.   Today I rise in support of Mr. Rose's amendment to the National  Defense Authorization Act. This amendment, which I cosponsored, takes  the necessary steps to target bad actors responsible for the illegal  trafficking of fentanyl into the United States.   Across Arkansas, heartbroken families have told me their stories time  and time again about how the opioid crisis has claimed the lives of  their loved ones.   According to the CDC, in 2017, more than 130 Americans lost their  lives to opioid abuse each day, nearly half of those deaths  attributable to fentanyl.   We have a responsibility to stem the tide of this crisis. Targeting  the source of the world's largest producers and distributors of  fentanyl will begin to stop the flow of these drugs.   Mr. Chair, I am grateful to Mr. Rose for this effort, which  complements work that I have been doing over the past year with my  friend, Senator Tom Cotton, to fight this plague.   Mr. Chair, I thank the ranking member for yielding, and I urge a  ``yes'' vote on this en bloc package.
