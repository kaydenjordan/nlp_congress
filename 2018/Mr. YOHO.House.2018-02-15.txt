 Madam Speaker, this week commences the Lunar New Year, a  time of thankfulness and new beginnings for the United States and many  of our Asian partners.   Reflecting upon last year's Year of the Rooster, we have enjoyed  tremendous political, social, and economic achievements. Filled with  enthusiasm for diplomacy and cooperation, we continue to look to our  partners in Asia to promote peaceful international relations.   During the Year of the Dog, I believe that our friends will continue  to embody loyalty, honesty, and integrity, working with us to craft  mutually beneficial international policies. In turn, the United States  will encourage effective diplomatic behaviors among all of our Asian  counterparts.   As lawmakers, we have an obligation to protect the interests of the  United States, as well as those of our strong allies around the globe,  especially in the Asia-Pacific region.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to continue to work toward  policies that will positively shape strong, multinational Asian foreign  relations in 2018.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my good colleague from  Virginia (Mr. Garrett) and everybody else who has participated in this  important topic.   For far too long, Washington has allowed our broken immigration  system to fester. Since 1986, when safeguards were put in place to  protect our Nation from illegal immigration, we have seen the rule of  law not followed, and it has led to the situation we have today. This  is not an overnight sensation that just has happened.   If you look at the number one role of government, it is to provide  for the common defense of our Nation and the security of our Nation.  Madam Speaker, you cannot have a secure nation if you don't have secure  borders. That is one of the reasons we lock our car doors. That is one  of the reasons we lock our house doors is to secure our family.   Well, the government's role is to secure their Nation and the people  within it so that we can have a secure nation, the peace of mind that  our families are protected from people that shouldn't be here in the  first place. We need to reform our system so that we have legal  immigration that is not burdensome to the point where it doesn't work,  and that is what Washington has been well known for. We need to seek  real reforms that cut down on illegal immigration while protecting and  bolstering the legal immigration system.   Our Nation is a nation of immigrants, and Theodore Roosevelt  addressed this, I think, very succinctly in 1907 in a speech when he  talked about our land being a land of immigrants, how we have come over  from other countries from around the world. But he also went on to say  and talk about the values of America, that we, being a land of  immigrants, understand this: There is but room for one flag. It is the  American flag. You need to honor it. There is room but for one  language. It is English. You need to learn it.   Immigration without assimilation is an invasion, and that is really  what we have, an invasion, because we don't know who is here. We don't  know where they came from.   And Dreamers who were brought here to this country, I think we are  all sympathetic. They were brought here to this country at no fault of  their own and registered with DHS under DACA. There is a program where  they could have registered. They are a different class, but they can be  handled in a systematic manner, whether it starts off with probationary  periods, running background checks, ensuring all fines are paid for  outstanding traffic tickets or other, among other things. And I stand  with and I am a cosponsor of the Goodlatte-Labrador bill. I think it is  a great start. As immigration policies or as policies up here in  Washington, we know they change over time, and so I think this is a  good start.   We need to strengthen our border--that needs to be paramount--and  tighten our borders through what the Customs and Border Patrol tell us  to do.   You know, there are people who want to build a wall from sea to  shining sea. I think we should build a wall where the experts say we  need to build a wall and do other forms of security, but the bottom  line is we have to have a secure border. And it is not just our  southwest border; it is all of our borders. And I think every American  should be concerned about this, and you would think they would want  this.   We also should allow Customs and Border Patrol to survey and make  recommendations for how they think best we can increase the security  of, again, not just our southern border but, again, all the borders.   Sanctuary cities who openly defy Federal immigration law place  American citizens at risk, and I would hope the people in those cities,  the citizens of those cities, would rise up and hold their elected  officials accountable so that it is not a political platform that a  party wants to promote. All you have to do is look at the many people  who have been killed by people here illegally, and they rush for the  protection of a sanctuary city.   And these are cities, again, that are breaking the Federal law. They  defy Federal law without consequence. Congress does have the power to  hold these people accountable, these States. And, again, it will be the  citizens of those cities, hopefully, who will rise up and say enough is  enough.   The Goodlatte-Labrador bill, H.R. 4760, the Securing America's Future  Act, I cosponsored because it lays out a plan to address many of the  immigration reform priorities: It eliminates the diversity visa, which  is just a happenstance. If you are the lucky one  [[Page H1207]]  who pulls the right number, you get the lottery ticket, and the lottery  ticket is coming here to America. It eliminates the diversity visa to  increase the number of skilled worker visas. It creates a new  agriculture guest worker program.    And I am proud because some of the recommendations we have are in  that bill, and so we want to see that pass. This is one of the things  that has to happen.   But before we can go forward, we have to make sure that the borders  are secured, that the rule of law is enforced, and that we have a good  guest worker program. It also requires employers to utilize the E- Verify system to ensure their employees are legally able to work in  this country.   The good thing about the E-Verify system, it also gives protection to  the employer, knowing that they went through the process that the  government says they must go through and they have hired people that  the government says are okay. So it gives protection not just to our  employers, but it gives protection to the people here, who come here  for the privilege of coming to America to work.   It invests in a new security measure for our borders, gives  registered DACA recipients a renewable 3-year legal status, while  ensuring individuals who could cause harm are not eligible for it. It  withholds grants and Federal funding from sanctuary cities and gets rid  of the chain migration.   So this, I think, is a very strong bill. I think it is a very good  bill, that it accomplishes the goal. It could always be better. It is  not comprehensive immigration reform, but it is a great start.   You know, working in the agricultural sector for 35 years of my life  as a veterinarian working on the farms, I talked to a lot of the  immigrants, and a lot of the immigrants that I talked to were here  illegally. And I asked them: Do you want to be a citizen of the United  States?   They said: No. The majority of them didn't. They wanted the  opportunity--the opportunity--to come here to make some money to go  back home, and I think we should accommodate that.   And then if you talk to other immigrants who are here and they  migrated here legally, I asked them: Why did you come here? Why did  your parents come here?   And do you know what it always comes down to? They wanted  opportunity, and they wanted security, and they wanted a better life  for their family.   So our broken system does not accomplish that, and it is time to fix  the broken system, and this is the time to do it.   With that, I thank the gentleman for bringing up this great topic,  this passionate topic, and with your work, your help, we can accomplish  this.
