 Mr. Speaker, the United States Postal Service is  the only agency specifically mentioned in the Constitution.   It is essential for delivering everything from medicine, tax  documents, and in Oregon, where we proudly vote by mail, ballots. USPS  is a pillar for rural communities and communities without high-speed  internet.   Under Postmaster General Louis DeJoy's leadership, workplace and  revenue challenges at the Postal Service have caused a drastic decline  in public trust.   One of the most significant issues facing the USPS is staff  shortages. Issues like branch closures are forcing seniors and families  in rural communities to travel further for postal services.   DeJoy's 10-year plan will only make things at the U.S. Postal Service  worse. His plan includes downgrading service standards, reducing  person-to-person interactions, cutting air delivery, and slowing mail.  Unfortunately, efficiency and quality are being sacrificed.   The U.S. Postal Service must change course. Slashing services and  raising prices harms their mission and diminishes the United States  Postal Service popularity.                            ____________________
