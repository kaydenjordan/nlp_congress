 Mr. Speaker, I am honored to stand here with  my friends--Chairman Perry, Mr. Cawthorn, Mr. Good, Mr. Norman--in  defense of our Second Amendment rights. I say this not only as a Member  of Congress, but I say this as a woman, and I say this as a mother. I  say this also as an adult who knows what it is like when my school was  held hostage by another student with a gun, a very upset student.    It is not the guns that are the issue. It is the severe mental  illness, the breakdown in America with our morals and our values, and  this severe divide among all of us as Americans.   I want to add to this, and this is a story that I haven't even been  able to share with my good colleagues here, but just this weekend, now  that I am a Member of Congress, many of us get a lot of death threats,  but one of my family members received a voicemail on their personal  cell phone from a man saying very bad things about me, and then saying:  ``This is what I am going to do to her,'' and he cocked a gun and shot  it several times.   This is the type of threats I get, and it came with the threat of a  gun. But I tell you this as a woman and a gun owner: I need to be able  to have any kind of gun that I want to own to defend myself, to defend  my family, to defend my home. God forbid if someone chose to do  something to me.   You see, here is the issue: It doesn't matter how many gun control  laws we put in place. It doesn't matter how many types of guns are  banned. The criminals and the people who intend to do harm to others,  those that would murder someone even if they could murder them with  their bare hands, are still going to do it, and they are not going to  be the ones that hand over their guns to the government. Oh, no, they  are going to be keeping their guns so they can continue breaking the  law.   We have guns coming across our border every single day illegally. We  have terrorists who have been caught at our border, and then we have a  lot of got-aways. We don't know how many of those are terrorists and  what kind of criminals, how much human trafficking, how much child  trafficking is happening down there. Crime is up in every single city,  county, and small town across America.                                time  1700    Americans need their guns, and there should not be a ban on assault  weapons because it is not about the gun or the weapon; it is about what  is inside someone's human heart.   What we have to do is we have to stand in defense of and protect our  Second Amendment because it is the most important freedom that we have.  If we are unable to do that, and we lose it in the name of the so- called issues--what they are pointing at really is a tool. A gun is a  tool. The gun doesn't get up and kill people on its own. It is the  people who do it.   When you take away all the guns from the legal gun owners, the  criminals will be the ones that are left with the guns. Then do you  want to know what happens? Even if those guns are gone, they are still  going to commit murder, and they will just use something else.   It is about elections. That is why they are trying to ban assault  weapons, because inflation is out of control, crime is out of control,  gas prices are difficult to afford. Now, our President is moving us on  to some sort of clean energy that just will fail America even more.   This isn't what we need to do, and I am so happy that there are  people here that want to stand in defense of people's gun rights.
