 Mr. President, yesterday, our wonderful colleague from  California, Senator Dianne Feinstein, announced that she will retire at  the end of her term.   I am careful not to throw the word ``legend'' around too often in  this Chamber, as it truly befits so few, but Dianne Feinstein is  precisely that. She is a legend.   She is a legend in California, where she shattered innumerable glass  ceilings as the first woman Senator from the State. And we forget how,  even 20, 30 years ago, the barriers which are still in front of women  were even stronger, so it took a strong, tough, resolute woman to break  them, and she did.   She is a legend here in the Senate. The longest serving woman Senator  in U.S. history, she built a reputation as an expert legislator and a  leader on so many issues--gun violence, the environment, women's  rights, and so much more.   I first got to know Dianne when she led the effort to pass the 1994  ban on assault weapons in the Senate. I led it in the House. I have  always been amazed by the sheer depth of her knowledge on the issues  and how careful she is about learning all of the facts before she goes  forward and then her seemingly innate ability to convince people on  both sides of the aisle to work together. That is why her list of  accomplishments is so long--the assault weapons ban, protecting  oversight authority during the investigation into U.S. torture,  championing the Violence Against Women Act. The list goes on and on and  on.   But perhaps her greatest legacy is how she blazed a trail for women  and girls everywhere. Today, there are 25 women serving in this  Chamber. There are 25 women serving in this Chamber, all of whom stand  on Dianne's shoulders.   We are all very glad we have another year and a half with her to  fight the good fight, and I know she will use that time to fiercely  advocate for women's rights in all aspects of life and unwaveringly  represent the people of California.  [[Page S406]]                                ____________________     Mr. President, now on implementation, as President Biden  pointed out last week during his State of the Union Address, the  Democratic agenda is already bearing fruit across this country. There  will be tens of thousands of projects funded. Last week, for instance,  I joined with President Biden to talk about Gateway in New York, which  is something New Yorkers have waited for for decades and is vital to  continuing the health of our bistate--New York-New Jersey--economy as  well as the economy of the Northeast.   When the President came and we actually started working on the  project, you could feel exaltation and excitement in the city. That is  going to start happening again and again everywhere--in urban,  suburban, and rural areas--as Democrats make it a priority to get the  word out about all the good things that are coming the American  people's way. It is one thing for Americans to read about things that  Congress has passed, but when they can actually feel and see these  accomplishments play out in their communities, it makes a world of  difference. We have a responsibility to make the connection between  what happens in this Chamber and what is going on in people's  backyards.    This morning, I sent out a Dear Colleague with Senator Stabenow about  how Democrats are going to get the word out on implementing our agenda  in the coming weeks. We have a great story to tell the American people  and no shortage of examples of how our agenda is making the country  stronger and making Americans' lives better.   Let me give a few examples: Seniors on Medicare, for instance, can  now, already, take advantage of Democrats' historic $35-a-month cap on  insulin. After years of hard work, this is no longer an aspiration; a  $35 insulin cap is now the law of the land. Seniors, who were up nights  worrying how they were going to pay $400, $500, $600, $700 a month for  this vital drug when you have diabetes can now breathe easy. Millions  of people--the seniors and their families and friends--can breathe  easier because of what we have done.   Now--let's not forget--we should be expanding the cap to all  Americans, not just to those over 65. And in this Congress, Democrats  are going to work hard, try to work with our Republican colleagues--we  hope they will join us--to make that happen.   Here is another one: Very few people know of this, but we are  spreading the word. Seniors on Medicaid can take advantage of free  shingles vaccines. These two benefits alone--the insulin cap and free  shingles vaccines--could mean hundreds in savings every year for  seniors on Medicaid. And so many seniors are.   On the infrastructure fund: Communities across the country can now  apply for new grant funding to fix their roads, their bridges, their  highways. These are perhaps the most obvious examples of our agenda at  work. People are going to start seeing more orange vests, more  hardhats, and good-paying union jobs in their communities as the  communities get the updates they sorely need.   And the Inflation Reduction Act is already doing exactly what its  name suggests: saving people money. The tax credits alone can give  families as much as $14,000 for making their homes energy efficient.  People can put in heat pumps, get help to get those heat pumps, and  their heating bills go down. It is a great thing.   The examples go on. Democrats are going to make implementation a top  priority in this Congress. After everything we have been through over  the past 3 years, Americans deserve to hear some good news about how  their leaders are working hard for them. That is precisely what we will  focus on in the coming years.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, chaos over there in the House on the  Republican side. Each day that passes in Washington, two things hold  true: We keep getting closer to default but no closer to a Republican  plan to lift the debt ceiling. I repeat once again: House Republicans,  Speaker McCarthy, show us your plan. It has been more than a month  since Speaker McCarthy and House Republicans began threatening the  entire U.S. economy in order to secure drastic spending cuts that, in  all likelihood, will hurt the American people badly. But in all this  time, nobody can seem to get an answer to the $64,000 question: What  cuts exactly are the Republicans proposing? Show us your plan.   Some of the things we are hearing from the MAGA wing is the stuff of  nightmares. Later this afternoon, I will join with a number of Senate  colleagues to shine a light on how devastating the radical MAGA cuts  would be for American families if the MAGA Republicans got their way.   But where is the House Republican plan? How are they going to lift  the debt ceiling? After months of no answers, now Speaker McCarthy has  recently claimed Republican leadership is trying to come up with a plan  right now. I am glad he is at least saying he wants to answer our  question.   Frankly, it is a lot easier said than done, and I don't think Speaker  McCarthy will be able to unify his conference. It takes 218 votes, as  we know, to pass anything in the House, and with the razor-thin GOP  majority paralyzed by internal division and with the stronghold the  MAGA Republicans have on the Speaker, Speaker McCarthy will have a very  difficult time getting everyone on the same page, if he can do it at  all.   To quote from Punchbowl this morning, ``House Republicans . . . face  an intractable political math challenge as they seek to reduce the $1.4  trillion deficit.'' For one, Speaker McCarthy has insisted Republicans  will only preserve the full faith and credit of the United States if  they secure drastic spending cuts first.   MAGA Republican hardliners have demanded Speaker McCarthy release a  proposal to balance the budget over the next 10 years, one of the  conditions for having supported his leadership. At the same time,  Speaker McCarthy has also claimed Republicans won't touch Social  Security and Medicare. Now, I will believe that when I see it because  so many Republicans, not just a handful--so many--have spent years  going on record calling for cuts and changes and privatization of these  programs.    All this leads to a terrible conclusion. If Speaker McCarthy is going  to meet these goals, Republicans would need to cut 85 percent of all  discretionary spending in order to balance the budget in 10 years. Let  me say that again. If Speaker McCarthy and House Republicans are  serious about balancing the budget in their 10-year plan without  touching Medicare and Social Security, they will need to cut 85 percent  of all discretionary spending. That would be Republican austerity at an  apocalyptic level.   Teachers, nurses, firefighters, student loan borrowers, police  officers would all kiss Federal funding goodbye. Funding for scientific  research, so vital in our competition with China, would likely  disappear. Child hunger would spike without Federal nutrition programs.  Housing programs would be starved of resources. We would be thrust into  a greater housing crisis than we now have.   So my point is this: Speaker McCarthy is not going to be able to keep  his promise to balance the budget in 10 years while, at the same time,  leaving Social Security and Medicare untouched. The math doesn't add  up. Very soon, the MAGA brigade will see that the Speaker made a bunch  of promises that he won't be able to keep, and I worry greatly that the  dangers of slipping into default will only increase as the toxic  dynamic within the House GOP gets worse day by day.   That is why it is so important that now, early on, the House  Republicans show us their plan.                            ____________________     Now, on ESG and China--two more items, Mr. President.  First, reports are out that Republicans will reintroduce a measure  targeting a new rule from the Department of Labor that allows--repeat,  allows but not requires--fiduciaries to consider the impacts of climate  change and other ESG issues when making investment decisions.   Across the country, hard-right State legislatures are up in arms and  trying to stop State investment funds from working with money managers  who dare commit the, oh-so heinous offense  [[Page S407]]  of looking at the big picture, looking at the future when making  investments, including how climate change and other issues can present  financial risks.   I just want to point out the obvious. Nothing in this DOL rule  imposes any requirement on anyone. It is not a requirement. In fact, it  goes out of the way to make sure decision making remains solely in the  hand of the fiduciary.   Republicans like to talk about small government. They like to talk  about letting the private sector do its work. But their obsession with  eliminating ESG, their sort of ostrichlike view about climate change  and the damage that carbon presents when going into the atmosphere,  would do just the opposite.                                    China     Finally, on the China surveillance balloon and what  happened over the weekend, after yesterday's briefing, it is clear our  defense and intelligence Agencies remain laser-focused on gathering  every piece of information about what happened over U.S. and Canadian  airspace.   John Kirby said these most recent objects did not pose any direct  threat to people on the ground. That is very important. People should  not worry about that. Of course, we have much more to learn. Today, we  are going to have another all-Senators briefing on the State of U.S.  defense readiness with respect to China. I am sure that will include a  discussion of the military but also of our surveillance abilities.   Republicans eager to score political points right at this moment are  doing nothing more than engaging in premature attacks. It is  precipitous. It is no time for premature partisanship. We need to work  together in Congress to get to the bottom of what happened, which  Senator Tester is taking the lead on here in the Senate. I thank him  and all of my colleagues of good faith for working together.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand that there is a bill at the  desk that is due for a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar, under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceedings.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a joint  leadership letter be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                    Joint Leadership Letter and Colloquy         The Joint Leadership Letter and Colloquy of February 15,       2023, stated the following with regard to the division of       funding and office space for the majority and minority.                           Joint Leadership Letter         We mutually commit to the following for the 118th Congress:       The Committee on Rules and Administration is to determine the       budgets of the committees of the Senate. The budgets of the       committees, including joint and special committees, and all       other subgroups, shall be apportioned to reflect the ratio of       the Senate as of this date, including an additional ten       percent (10%) from the majority and minority salary baseline       to be allocated to the chair for administrative expenses.        Special Reserves has been restored to its historic purpose.       Requests for funding will only be considered when submitted       by a committee chairman and ranking member for unanticipated,       nonrecurring needs. Such requests shall be granted only upon       the approval of the chair and ranking member of the Committee       on Rules and Administration. Funds for committee expenses       shall be available to each chairman consistent with the       Senate rules and practices.        The division of committee office space shall be       commensurate with this funding agreement. The chairman and       ranking member of any committee may, by mutual agreement,       modify the apportionment of committee funding and office       space.     Mr. President, in the 112th Congress, the Senate adopted  a new funding allocation for Senate committees. This approach has  served the Senate well for the five of the past six Congresses,  excluding last Congress when the evenly divided Senate adopted a power- sharing agreement by resolution. I believe this approach will continue  to serve the interests of the Senate and the public, regardless of  which party is in the majority, by helping to retain core committee  staff with institutional knowledge. This funding allocation is based on  the party division of the Senate, with 10 percent of the total majority  and minority salary baseline going to the majority for administrative  expenses. However, regardless of the party division of the Senate, the  minority share of the majority and minority salary baseline will never  be less than 40 percent, and the majority share will not exceed 60  percent. It is my intent that this approach will continue to serve the  Senate for this Congress and future Congresses.
