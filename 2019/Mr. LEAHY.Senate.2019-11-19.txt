 Madam President, the Washington Nationals' upset victory  in the 2019 World Series reminded a good friend of mine, Rabbi Michael  Cohen of Manchester, VT, of another unforeseen win. Fifty years ago,  the New York Mets, led by star pitcher Tom Seaver, and manager--former  Brooklyn Dodgers star Gil Hodges--shocked the baseball world by  defeating the heavily favored Baltimore Orioles in the fall classic.   Rabbi Cohen, who has led an exemplary life, taking action on major  issues including Mideast peace, antisemitism, and other difficult  challenges, sees a common theme in these two victories, 50 years apart.  Life, as in sports, offers all of us the opportunity to achieve what at  the outset seems insurmountable. Peace in the Middle East is possible.  We can end the scourges of antisemitism, xenophobia, and racism.   Rabbi Cohen's words in an article published in the Jerusalem Post on  October 28, 2019, ``Letter from America: The `69 Mets and lessons for  today'' are a powerful reminder of what we humans can achieve against  the odds.   I ask unanimous consent that Rabbi Cohen's writing be printed in the  Congressional Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                            [The Jerusalem Post]                  (By Michael M. Cohen, October 28, 2019)          Letter from America: The '69 Mets and lessons for today         The articles we read in The Jerusalem Post and other news       sources can be daunting, leaving us with a feeling of       hopelessness and a debilitating sense that the conditions of       the world are only getting worse.        From the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, which       seems intractable, to climate change, to endless strife in       the Middle East, to an assault on the institutions of, and       belief in, democracy, to the worldwide rise of antisemitism,       xenophobia and racism, to name but a few, the odds appear       against us.        Fifty years ago the New York Mets began the baseball season       with 100 to 1 odds against the scenario they would win the       World Series. Before the 1969 season they had won a total of       394 games and lost a staggering 737 games since they first       started playing in 1962. A sense of gloom pervaded the team.       But in 1969 they would win 100 games, and this year's World       Series marks the 50th anniversary of the final out in game       five against the favorite and imposing Baltimore Orioles led       by Frank Robinson and Boog Powell.        Baseball and other sports are not only about wins and       losses and statistics. On a deeper level, sports are a       metaphor for life and a holder of lessons for life. The '69       Mets are no different for us today.        The 1969 Season did not begin with a stellar start for the       Mets. By the end of May they were continuing to lose more       than win, with a record of 18-23.        I attended my first major league baseball game on June 19,       when the Mets beat the Phillies in Philadelphia at the old       Connie Mack Stadium, 6-5. Member of the tribe Art Shamsky       went four for four, including two home runs, and pitcher Tom       Seaver stole second base!        Three weeks later Seaver would pitch two outs short of a       perfect game against the Chicago Cubs, as the Mets moved       within 3 games of the division-leading Cubs.        Change seemed at hand, but change is rarely perfectly       linear. By mid-August the Mets had fallen 10 games behind the       Cubs. But then the Mets took all the accumulated and       invaluable lessons from the losses of those previous seasons       and applied them to win an incredible 38 of their last 49       games, and win the Eastern Division of the National League.        That is the thing about baseball. A good batting average is       .300, which means that 70% of the time a good player fails       when he is at bat. Players will tell you they take all the       lessons from their previous at bats every time they are in       the batter's box, with most of those lessons coming from       failed experiences.        In addition, baseball is the only sport where the team on       offense, the team at bat, does not have the ball. Rather, the       team on defense pitches to you. That dynamic makes the       encounter more difficult, but batters know those are the       conditions they operate within.        The Mets would go on to sweep baseball legend Hank Aaron       and the Atlanta Braves in the National League playoff series       and then face the Baltimore Orioles in the World Series. They       would win the Series by tenacity, hustle, a strong work       ethic, smart baseball, and that factor out of our hands,       serendipity.        On the second pitch of the first game of the World Series,       Don Buford hit a home run off Seaver, and the Orioles would       go on to win  [[Page S6663]]       the game. After that game many felt that an Orioles sweep of       the Mets was a very good possibility. The tenacious Mets had       other ideas, and went on to win the next four games in a row       to become the champions.        In game two, their oldest member, Ed Charles, 38, came       through, batting, and helped end the game with a difficult       and brilliant throw to Donn Clendenon at first base.        Game three was all about two magnificent running catches by       center fielder Tommie Agee. The first, with two runners on       base, was caught in the webbing of his glove, the white of       the baseball protruding from the glove, while the second       diving catch was made with the bases loaded.        Game four the Mets won because the correct call was not       made. J.C. Martin bunted in the bottom of the 10th inning and       ran to first base on the wrong side of the first base line.       Because of that, Oriole pitcher Pete Richert's throw hit       Martin's wrist and the ball rolled to the ground, allowing       Rod Gasper to score the winning run. Martin should have been       called out, but he was not.        The final game was won by the Mets because of smart,       creative and detailed thinking by Mets manager Gil Hodges. In       the bottom of the sixth inning, with the Mets trailing 3-0,       Dave McNally's pitch to Cleon Jones went low and ended up in       the Mets dugout. Umpire Lou DiMuro ruled the ball had not hit       Jones. Hodges then emerged with the baseball showing a smudge       of shoe polish on it. Jones was then awarded first base, and       the next batter, Donn Clendenon, would hit a two-run homer,       and the Mets would go on to win the game, 5-3.        The challenges we face can feel disheartening. We may feel       like the Mets before the '69 season began, when the past       suggested 100 to 1 odds against a different and better       outcome. But change did happen. Fifty years later, that       uplifting lesson should not be lost on us.        We are also reminded of that lesson in the Bible, where       Moses's last speech to the people is a poem. We see in the       life of Moses--who 40 years earlier said to God, ``I have       never been a man of words . . . I am slow of speech and slow       of tongue'' (Exodus 4:10)--someone who develops from a poor       orator to a master of prose and poetry.        That which appears to be insurmountable may be difficult to       overcome, but as Babe Ruth said, ``Never let the fear of       striking out keep you from playing the game.'' The batter's       box awaits.

Today, the  oceans, on which life on Earth depends, are under serious threat.   Threats from climate change, habitat destruction, illegal,  unreported, and unregulated fishing, and pollution--plastic waste  pollution in particular--are accelerating and causing potentially  irreparable harm to this planet.   I spoke recently on the significant health, environmental, and  economic impacts of the more than 300 billion pounds of plastic waste  circulating in the oceans, and on funding in the Senate version of the  fiscal year 2020 Department of State and Foreign Operations  appropriations bill to strengthen U.S. efforts to address this  pollution.   Today I will further discuss the scale of the problem and actions  that governments, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), private  companies, and other stakeholders can take to address this challenge.   I want to share a few findings and recommendations from a report  recently published by Ocean Conservancy and the Trash Free Seas  Alliance, a global group of companies and NGOs seeking to reduce and  reinvent products and services that contribute to ocean pollution.   Absent collective action, the report depicts a bleak future--one  involving more than 550 billion pounds of plastic waste in the oceans  by 2025, clogging our rivers and waterways, threatening marine life and  seabirds, endangering human health, contaminating the food supply, and  triggering a significant decline in economic benefits.   For perspective, the amount of plastic entering the oceans each year  is equivalent to dumping a garbage truck full of plastic into the ocean  every minute of every hour of every day. That is 1,440 truckloads of  plastic per day, or more than half a million truckloads per year. And,  of course, this does not include the immense amounts of chemical waste  and other types of pollution that enter the oceans every day.   As the report describes, rising ocean plastic pollution is a direct  result of the increasing global production and use of plastic, which  totals more than 750 billion pounds per year, an estimated 40 percent  of which is single-use. Waste management systems, particularly in  developing countries, are woefully incapable of managing the growing  quantity of plastic waste.   So the majority of plastic entering the oceans was never collected as  part of a formal waste management system, and without increased  resources for waste management programs and improvements to collection  infrastructure, developing countries--and the oceans--will continue to  be inundated with plastic waste.   There is no single solution. Instead, the report outlines four  priority areas on which to focus our collective efforts: financing the  collection of plastic waste; reducing the production and use of single- use plastics; improving design standards to address nonrecyclable or  difficult to recycle plastics; and increasing the demand for post- consumer plastics.   One option for increasing resources to finance the collection of  plastic waste is by charging fees to companies based on the amount of  nonrecyclable materials used in their products. Such fees have the  potential to generate up to 75 percent of the resources needed to  support effective waste collection programs. And increasing the demand  for recycled products--one of the other priority lines of effort-- reportedly has the potential to reduce the resources needed for such  programs by more than 30 percent. Other options for tackling plastic  pollution include a ban on microplastics, incentive programs for  recycling, preferential procurement policies, and the use of refillable  packaging.   All of this is to say that steps can, and must, be urgently taken.  While ocean plastic pollution may be a devastating and growing  challenge, it is not an insurmountable one.   And as I have said before, while the United States should  significantly increase our engagement and leadership on this issue, we  cannot solve this problem alone. There is no greater unifier than the  oceans. Their protection should be of the utmost importance to  governments, companies, and individuals on every continent and in every  country.                            ____________________     Madam President, I would like to take a moment to  celebrate the achievements of Maida Townsend, a Vermont State  Representative and now a decorated figure skater, who recently took  home the gold medal in an international figure skating competition in  Lake Placid, NY. Marcelle and I have known Maida for many years, and we  have always been impressed with her dedication, artistry, and  selflessness. While we have come to know Maida through her tireless  work for the State of Vermont, we have been impressed, but not  surprised, that she brings the same dedication to figure skating, a  sport she picked up at the age of 50.   Maida has served the State of Vermont over the years through her  leadership as the president of the Vermont branch of the National  Education Association, as a chair of the Vermont Democratic Party, and  in recent years as a State representative for South Burlington. Most  noteworthy though is Maida's long career as a public school teacher, a  career in which she has taught young Vermonters the French language for  well over 30 years. Maida's career of public service is exemplary. I  know that she will continue to dedicate herself to Vermont for many  more years to come.   But just as inspiring as her long career in public service is her  pursuit of a personal joy and passion, that of figure skating. Maida,  proving it is never too late to pursue a new joy, is as dedicated to  her sport as she is to her career. Starting her days hours before many  of us see the sun rise, Maida hits the ice before she hits the halls of  the State legislature. Maida is a friend, a true Vermonter, and a true  treasure.   Marcelle and I are proud to join her loved ones in offering a hearty  congratulations to Maida Townsend on  [[Page S6664]]  this impressive win in one of her many passions. We are lucky to know  her, and Vermont is lucky to have her.   I ask unanimous consent that the article, ``State rep wins gold in  international skating competition,'' originally published by ``The  Other Paper,'' be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                       [The Other Paper Nov. 7, 2019]              State Rep Wins Gold in International Competition         It was an introduction even Townsend--Chittenden District       7-4 State representative--wasn't expecting to hear. But sure       enough, it's how she was presented to judges, the audience       and her fellow competitors at the International Adult Figure       Skating Competition in Lake Placid, N.Y., on Oct.17.        ``I confess that it got my attention being introduced as       representing the United States as opposed to representing my       club, which is what I am used to hearing,'' Townsend said.        But represent the U.S. she did, as skaters from around the       globe filled the Olympic-size rink. In her own category,       Adult Ladies Bronze V division--V designating competitors       born in 1951 or earlier--Townsend skated against three other       Americans and a Canadian to earn the gold.        As she took to the ice, she noted the judges' position and       prepared herself for the music to begin. ``Bumpin' on       Sunset,'' a Jazz song by Wes Montgomery, filled the arena. It       was a personal selection, as most of Townsend's program music       is.        ``There is the adage, let the music take you there,'' she       said. ``It does; you have practiced so long, over and over       again, this music is part of a person and the music just       carried me.''        As she left the ice and awaited her score, Townsend felt       great pride. She knew she had skated well and met her       requirements.        ``I'm my hardest critic,'' she said, but added, ``I knew       when I came off the ice that I'd skated it really well.''        But getting to victory was no small feat. Townsend began       preparing her program with her coach, Martha Harding, in       early summer. The two worked an hour each day Tuesday through       Thursday, adding in Fridays the month before internationals.        The program looked better each week, until just before       internationals.        ``For two solid weeks before this competition, nothing was       working right, everything was falling apart,'' Townsend said.       ``I was psyching myself out.''        But getting on the ``storied rink'' at Lake Placid--where       countless ``greats'' like the Russian duo, the Protopopovs,       Sonja Henie and Scott Hamilton have skated--made the rough       practices disappear.        ``I got on the ice to do the program and it was like those       two awful weeks never happened,'' Townsend said. ``I was in       the zone and it just felt so good.''        What's noteworthy about Townsend's skating is that it only       began 25 years ago, when she was 50 years old.        Townsend was an avid fan of watching the elite figure       skaters on television.        ``I'd find myself just so drawn to it, and oftentimes I'd       find it so beautiful I was there crying watching the       performances,'' she said.        When an ad for group skating lessons stared up at her from       the pages of a newspaper, Townsend knew the message was meant       for her.        Townsend wasn't fearful about safety when she hit the ice       for the first time. Rather, she said she was concerned about       being the ``tallest skater.'' Figure skating is a sport that       typically attracts a less aged crowd, but Townsend discovered       age is but a number. She practiced the basics in group       lessons, then found a coach to study under.        With Coach Julie MacDonald's help, Townsend honed her       skills and grew tremendously. Though Townsend was content to       continue lessons with MacDonald, her coach saw a greater       future for her.        ``At a given point in time, Julie [MacDonald] informed me       that she needed to kick me out of the nest,'' Townsend said.       ``I was very comfortable with Julie and she sensed I was too       comfortable.'' That's when Townsend paired with Harding.        ``Martha [Harding] was this really big deal coach,''       Townsend recalls. ``I was really scared, I remember saying to       Julia, 'What if she rejects me?'''        But Townsend met all of Harding's requirements and the duo       has worked well together ever since.        ``Julie knew what she was doing when she kicked me out of       the nest,'' Townsend said. ``Martha worked with me,       understanding as an older skater my goals are very different       from a kids'.''        Harding and Townsend spend much of their time working on       ``quality skating.'' For Townsend, that means dedicating       effort to flow, posture and working the edges of her blades.        ``To me, skating is when your foot is on the ice, as       opposed to jump, jump, jump, jump,'' she said. ``There's the       whole business of interpreting the music ... if all you're       doing is going back and forth jump, back and forth jump, it's       not being one with the music.''        Don't let that fool you, Townsend still gets some air. In       her early years with Harding, she did all the single jumps--      save for the Axel. Today she does what jumps and spins her       body permits.        And one of her big requirements is looking confident and       competent on the ice. It's not uncommon for people who start       skating in their adulthood to be more cautious than their       youthful counterparts, according to Townsend.        ``Adults are more cautious in skating, I think, than kids       are,'' she said. ``Kids don't have so far to fall, kids heal       a lot faster than adults and kids don't have to go to work       the next day.''        But Townsend challenges that. In fact, she's had judges       assume she's skated for most of her life. And though Townsend       is the first to say she's learned a great deal from Harding,       Harding says the feeling is mutual. ``I've learned a lot from       [Townsend] as far as being disciplined,'' Harding said.        Townsend's disciplined nature keeps her skating even when       the Legislature is in session. During the session, she's up       at 3:15 a.m. to walk her dog and prepare for the day, then       she's on the ice at 5:45 a.m. and en route to the Capitol by       6:35 a.m. But skating is good for both mind and body,       Townsend said. During the session it's a joyful event that       can be ``cleansing.''        ``If I didn't skate I think I'd be a much older 75 than I       am,'' Townsend said.        That's why Townsend would recommend the sport to anyone       who's interested but perhaps trepidatious to skate.        ``You're not too old to do it. There's no reason to be       defined by a number,'' she said. ``I really believe that. I       intend to keep skating 'til my body tells me, 'Stop.' So far       my body's nowhere near telling me to stop.''                            ____________________
