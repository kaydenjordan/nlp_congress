 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend for yielding,  and I want to thank him for his friendship and his work.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. I want to thank  Congressman Barr for his leadership in bringing this legislation to the  floor in a strong bipartisan way. I am proud to support the CAROL Act  in honor of Andy's lovely wife, the late Carol Barr.   Like everyone who knew her, we know the moment and where we were when  we heard of her passing. It was sudden. It was unexpected. It was  something no one ever thought could happen.   If you ever met her, you were her friend. She was a kind and graceful  person with a heart for service. As I speak today, I remember her  laugh.   Throughout her own career and working with Andy, Carol devoted her  time and energy to giving back to the community. She had a service  heart. It was all about the Sixth District.   I met her years ago. I met her when she first knew Andy, before  either daughter was born. I was able to watch them grow and watch the  look in their mom's eyes.   I remember one time when we were there, she was holding Eleanor.  Eleanor was showing me her parade wave.   Carol led a highly respected career in sales at Pfizer. She served as  executive director for the Henry Clay Center for Statesmanship; and she  volunteered at the Junior League of Lexington and the University of  Kentucky's College of Communication and Information National Advisory  Board.                                time  1600    Her faith, her patriotism, and her generosity toward her neighbors  were manifest. For those who attended the time to honor her life,  speaker after speaker after speaker could tell you the moment in time  that Carol walked into their life. The interesting part when they told  it, their life got better, but Carol never walked out of their life.  That was the interesting part.   Oh, how she loved Andy and her two beautiful girls, Eleanor and Mary  Clay.   This disease strikes you at a time you don't even know. You just come  back from doing something most all of us do--the family photos, even  getting ready for a campaign. You look at her face, and you look at the  children's faces.   And you know Andy. Carol did all the work. Carol prepared everybody.  Andy is a great legislator, but Carol made everything happen.   I love when I meet people early on. I always ask, how did you first  meet? I asked Andy and Carol. Andy would tell you the story. He saw  her, and he could tell you the moment it happened. He had a plan. His  plan, he had it all mapped out. He was going to ask for her business  card. He just didn't realize she didn't have one.   The problem with Andy is, he didn't have a backup plan. But the great  thing about it is, God had already taken care of this. God already had  a plan for Andy and Carol. Eight weeks later, he brought them back  together again. This time, Andy didn't let her get away. They were  married for more than 13 years.   I cannot tell you the loss we feel. Andy feels it every day. The  community feels it every day. There is not a day that goes by that we  don't pray for him and the girls. There are times when I would pick up,  just call and check on him. I remember doing it recently. He said it  was a good weekend. He took the girls, just the girls and him, and went  to the place that the Barr family would always go to. It was in the  woods. It was a time of reflection.   There are others in this body that have had to deal with this type of  loss, a loss in their own family. We all know the different ways to  suffer. We are all familiar with the five different stages of grief-- the denial, the anger, the bargaining, the depression, and the  acceptance.   Andy didn't have time for any of them. Andy channeled his grief into  what I believe is the sixth stage, the lawmaker, and he did something  important, working to honor Carol today but save lives for everybody  else in the future.   We are going to do work today that most people when they talk about  Congress wish we did every day. There is not going to be partisanship.  I think if you met Carol, it didn't matter what side of the aisle you  were on. It would be harder to attack Andy. We are going to save lives  for the future, and that is exactly what this bill does, Madam Speaker.  It saves lives.   More than 25,000 Americans die from valvular heart disease every  year. Many, like Carol, show no outward signs. You don't have a  warning. You kiss your spouse good-bye, and you are going to go down  the street. The next thing, something goes wrong.   Too often, the diagnosis comes down to luck. Carol got an indication,  but we had COVID. We said to wait to have a procedure.   We must do better. Our doctors and families deserve to have better  information so they can make the right decisions about treatment. The  CAROL Act will help get them the information by providing $20 million  in research grants to study valvular heart problems.   Andy, your work to pass this bill in honor of Carol has truly been an  inspiration to all of us. Of all the moments that I had an opportunity  to spend with them, I always reflect on this one. Like many of you,  collectively, we will do a trip to Israel, legislatively, foreign  policy. There was this moment in the trip--and you know the trip. It is  filled with meetings after meetings after meetings. You are in a  different time zone, and it gets tiring. You are up early until late at  night.  [[Page H7520]]    Carol would always be smiling. We were visiting this one facility  with the Sermon on the Mount where Jesus had spoken. I remember  standing next to her, reading the story in the Bible. I remember her  smile. More importantly, I remember her love for all.   I know she is with us today. I know she is proud of Andy. She is  proud of Eleanor and Mary Clay. Her work and life on this Earth was not  long, but her impact was great.   Today, what we are doing is right. Today, what we are doing is going  to make tomorrow better.   Andy, your dedication, which is so ably represented in this important  bill, is a fitting tribute to Carol. She had a heart for service.  Anyone who knew her will tell you that. Today, we are going to honor  her memory, and we are going to salute you. We are going to salute that  Carol made a difference yesterday, today, and tomorrow.   She will not be forgotten, be it through the caring, the sweetness,  the kindness of her daughters; but, more importantly, the love and  respect of her husband, who, in a very tragic situation, could go a lot  of different paths. But I know he wondered what Carol would want to be  done, and that is exactly what he did. He put himself in a position to  make the world better and to make fewer families to have that same  call.   I respect everybody I serve with. People go through a lot of  challenges. There are very few people in my life who I have ever  witnessed the dignity and the respect and the honor that Andy has given  to Carol for her life and her memory.
