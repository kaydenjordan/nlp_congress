 Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Lee. We are all  grateful to you for being so clear and so principled.   As I have often said, Congress must fulfill its constitutional  obligation to consider an updated AUMF, and as my colleagues said, that  stands for the Authorization for the Use of Military Force. Right now,  the administration is still using the authorization we passed after  September 11, 2001, in the legal justification to fight ISIS. That is  deeply problematic.   The 2001 AUMF has none of the limits many of us are seeking. We are a  Congress. We are not a rubber stamp to any President. We have a right  to vote on issues such as war and peace.   U.S. leadership to defeat ISIS is critical, but this doesn't require  a large-scale deployment of U.S. forces. With American leadership, we  were able to prevent the wholesale slaughter of the Yazidi people.   Iraqi partners were able to maintain control of the Mosul Dam, which,  if breached by ISIS, could have resulted in death and displacement of  up to 2 million people and endangered American personnel in Iraq. With  our support, local forces have taken back about 80 percent of the  territory from ISIS in Iraq and Syria.    So another large-scale, open-ended commitment of American troops is  certainly not the answer. The disastrous intervention in Iraq last  decade set the stage for the rise of ISIS in the first place. The 2001  AUMF has no limits at all on U.S. ground troops.   As troop levels continue to rise in the fight against ISIS, we just  cannot put our heads in the sand. We need to sit together as a  deliberative body and make these important decisions, not give any  President or any administration a blank check.   I am working on legislation to limit the authority Congress provided  after September 11. We need to tailor this authority to the threat we  face today. September 11 happened 16 years ago. We need new parameters  to define our mission and our goals. I voted for that AUMF 16 years  ago, but I never would have imagined that 16 years later it would still  be there and give a blank check to any President who would use it  anytime, anyplace, and to do anything. So we must fulfill our  constitutional responsibility and consider what an appropriate  authorization should include.   Using a 2001 authorization for a 2017 conflict sets a terrible  constitutional precedent. Congress has a vital constitutional  responsibility over America's war powers. This is one of the most  important decisions we are charged with making. When we fail to live up  to that responsibility, we weaken the balance of power that is the  bedrock of our democracy. Considering an updated AUMF is not easy, but  it is our job. We should do our job.   President Obama came to Congress well over a year ago with a proposed  AUMF. Not many people cared for it, but it was a proposed AUMF. We  could have changed it--it was a starting point--but we didn't do it. We  threw it away because it just got too hard. That cannot happen again.   Congress has a responsibility to do its part here, and,  unfortunately, we are not meeting that responsibility. We owe it to the  American people and we owe it our men and women in uniform to do our  job. Congressional inaction on an AUMF is inexcusable.                                time  1815    I want to say that it a separate issue from the recent strikes  against Assad. Congress has made no authorization whatsoever for  sustained military action against Assad. The 60-day clock started  ticking when the President notified Congress of his missile strike.   The administration must come to Congress on that issue as well. There  cannot be long-term military action against Assad without Congressional  say-so.   Assad is a bad guy, and I think that he should be deposed, quite  frankly. I think that any future for Syria cannot include Assad, who  has murdered hundreds of thousands of his own people.   But whether the United States must involve itself in every single war  and ground troops using an outdated authorization for the use of force  just strikes me as being something that should not happen and will lead  us down a path in the future where we can't get out of it.   I want to thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee). She has  always stood up for her beliefs, whether they seem popular or unpopular  when it happened. That is just the kind of people we want to serve in  Congress: someone who speaks out and has been a consistent fighter.   I am proud to join with her tonight, and I hope that more colleagues  on both sides of the aisle will understand that this is an important  constitutional principle. It is not a matter of who is in power, who is  the President, what party has the majority. As Americans and as  legislators, we should all be very concerned about giving any President  a blank check to go to war.
