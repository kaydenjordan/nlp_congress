 Mr. President, I also rise to speak on the nomination of  Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.   When he was nominated to fill the vacancy occasioned by the  retirement of Justice Kennedy, I immediately began to read all I could  about his record. I reviewed his judicial opinions, law review  articles, speeches, and I reviewed, such as they were made available,  documents produced from his time working with the Bush administration  and his work with the special prosecutor, Ken Starr.   Following the review, I met with him to ask him serious questions  about his record. I then watched his Judiciary Committee hearing with  interest. After that hearing, based on all I had seen and read, I  announced my opposition to his nomination for two reasons.   First, the Nation needs a Justice with the backbone to stand up as an  independent check against both the President and Congress. That is why  our Nation gives judges life tenure, so they can render independent  rulings without fear of losing their jobs.   In a whole series of writings, speeches, and rulings over the course  of many years, both as a lawyer and as a judge, Judge Kavanaugh has  embraced an unusual deference to Executive power. I think this is one  of the reasons the President nominated him, and I don't have confidence  that Judge Kavanaugh will hold the President accountable to the law.   Second, Judge Kavanaugh's writings as a Bush administration lawyer-- at least those that the majority has allowed us to see--demonstrate his  personal view that settled law is settled only until five Justices  decide to do something different.   This is true, as a matter of realpolitik, but I am left with serious  questions about what other areas of settled law might be unsettled,  should he ascend to the Court.   I can understand how my colleagues might reach different conclusions  on the two issues that led me to oppose this nominee, but since I  announced my position, two additional issues of great importance have  arisen.   The first is how the Senate, as an institution charged with  leadership, will respond to the real and pervasive problem of sexual  assault. The second issue is how blatantly partisan we would want the  Supreme Court to be.   Christine Blasey Ford has come forward alleging that Judge Kavanaugh  sexually assaulted her in high school. Deborah Ramirez has come forward  to allege that he sexually humiliated her during a party during his  time at Yale.    The two allegations by two people who do not know each other, about  instances that happened in different times at different places, have  striking similarities. Both Ford and Ramirez allege that Kavanaugh was  under the influence of alcohol and, in the presence of other people,  assaulted or sexually humiliated them while others stood by laughing-- laughing. In both allegations, the sexual abuse of a woman was treated  as some form of entertainment for other persons.   People who have suffered from sexual assault or harassment are  watching to see how the Senate responds to these serious charges. And  what do they see?  [[Page S6585]]  A hearing where Dr. Ford described her experience calmly, credibly, and  candidly, while Judge Kavanaugh attacked her claims, as well as those  of Ms. Ramirez, as nothing more than a partisan political conspiracy; a  narrowly limited, 5-day investigation by the FBI, which, under orders  from the White House, contacted a handful of witnesses, while dozens of  witnesses proffered by Dr. Ford and Ms. Ramirez were ignored; and a  single copy of the FBI investigation notes made available for Senators  to read, provided that its meager contents not be shared with the press  or public.   Even that minimal investigation raises serious concerns about these  claims and Judge Kavanaugh's general truthfulness, but by moving  forward to a vote anyway, the unmistakable message to survivors is that  the Senate does not take allegations of sexual assault seriously.   More than 150 survivors of sexual abuse from Virginia have reached  out to me to share their personal stories and ask that the Senate show  we care about survivors. Some of these people are women I have known  for decades who had never shared their stories with me.   A woman from Alexandria wrote:         As a citizen, veteran, assistant professor, mother,       grandmother, wife and sexual assault victim at age 17 in       1968, I want to thank Dr. Blasey Ford for her testimony. I       have never told anyone of the sexual attack, and I am 68       years old.    A woman from Sterling wrote:         I want my future daughters to grow up in a country where       sexual assault and abuse is taken seriously by every official       and legal professional in the United States.    A man from Chesapeake wrote:         As a male sexual assault victim, I understand how difficult       it is to come forward. I strongly and respectfully urge you       to attempt to empathize with those of us who have been       abused.    A survivor from Radford wrote expressing dissatisfaction with the  minimal investigation, saying, ``It makes me feel like if my attacker  were nominated for the Supreme Court, that I wouldn't be taken  seriously either.''   A woman from Williamsburg wrote:         Dr. Ford has agreed to full investigations into her       experiences, but our leaders are failing her and every       American citizen. I watch this unfold with anticipation,       hoping that my representatives will listen to us.    An immigrant from Henrico:         When my family immigrated, an American couple who had       helped sponsor our family became my temporary legal       guardians. My sponsor mother was wonderful but did not know       that her husband repeatedly molested and raped me. It started       at age five until I returned to my family at age nine--my       older daughter's current age.    What are these survivors asking? First, that a real investigation  into the charges be conducted; that the dozens of witnesses proffered  by Ms. Ramirez and Dr. Ford not be ignored; and finally, that the  Senate not confirm to the Supreme Court a person with a question mark  by his name.   To confirm Judge Kavanaugh under these circumstances would send a  powerful message that the Senate--and now possibly the Supreme Court-- is a hostile environment for survivors of sexual assault.   The second issue raised by these allegations is how partisan we want  the Court to be. A person accused of any offense--especially sexual  assault--is entitled to defend themselves. It is natural to be  emotional and even angry of such an offense if one felt falsely  accused. But Judge Kavanaugh went far beyond that. He claimed that the  allegations of Dr. Ford and Ms. Ramirez were part of a political  conspiracy connected to the Democratic Party, outside activists, and  the Clintons.   The performance was insulting, and the conspiracy charge was a  complete fabrication. There is no evidence to suggest that politics  created Dr. Ford's account of being attacked at a party, her history of  seeking counseling years before the nomination, the notes from her  therapist, her willingness to take a polygraph, the results of that  polygraph, the extensive corroboration of her story of alcohol-fueled  house parties in the DC suburbs in 1982, or the admitted exploits of  the alleged co-assailant, Mark Judge.   There is no evidence to suggest that politics created Ms. Ramirez's  account of being sexually humiliated at Yale. Indeed, if the FBI were  willing to interview witnesses who are now speaking publicly, there is  ample evidence corroborating the account.   So when a nominee who in the past advocated slash-and-burn partisan  tactics as part of the Starr investigation reveals that he still  harbors partisan resentment and attempts to shrug off serious claims of  sexual assault as a political conspiracy connected to ``outside  leftwing . . . groups'' or the Clintons, he reveals a temperament that  would be very dangerous if added to the Supreme Court. That is why  retired Justice John Paul Stevens has come out urging a ``no'' vote on  this nomination.   The good news is that there is a solution to this. There is a  solution. We need not settle for a nominee burdened by questions  regarding sexual assault allegations or excessive partisanship. There  are numerous jurists who could meet the standards of a Republican  President and a Republican Senate majority who do not have these  issues. Why approve a nominee whose approval would send a hostile  message to sexual assault survivors? Why approve a nominee whose  nomination and approval would send a message of concern for those who  don't share his political views? We can find a nominee who will not  cause sexual assault survivors, litigants, or lawyers to fear how they  will be treated by the Nation's highest Court.   For the good of the Senate and for the good of the Court, I urge my  colleagues to vote no on the Kavanaugh nomination, and I ask the  President to send up a nominee who will not hurt the reputation of  either institution.   With that, I yield the floor.
