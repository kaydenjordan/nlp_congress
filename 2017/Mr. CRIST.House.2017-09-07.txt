 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor our guest chaplain,  Reverend Louis M. Murphy, Sr., of my hometown of St. Petersburg,  Florida.   Reverend Murphy truly embodies what it means to love your neighbor as  yourself. In his 18 years as senior pastor at the Mt. Zion Progressive  Missionary Baptist Church, he has been a dedicated disciple of Christ,  giving his time, energy, and compassion to lifting up his congregation  and the larger St. Petersburg community.   In addition to his duties as pastor of one of the largest churches in  Pinellas County, Reverend Murphy has been a leader in economic  revitalization efforts in south St. Petersburg, and in supporting job  training and outreach programs for at-risk youth.   A native of Florida, truly a man of God, and a man of the people. I  personally thank Reverend Murphy for coming to the people's House and  providing such a moving, thoughtful invocation. God bless you.                            ____________________
