 Madam President, Republicans have spent months trying to  repeal the Affordable Care Act. They knew that tens of millions of  Americans would lose their care, they knew it would betray our Federal  trust responsibility to Native Americans, and they knew it would throw  one-fifth of our economy into chaos. TrumpCare failed because the  American people opposed it. Americans spoke out against it in record  numbers. TrumpCare failed to pass four times. We hope that now we have  put that to bed and we can move on.   But rather than listening to millions of Americans, President Trump  has responded by sabotaging the Affordable Care Act. His reckless  behavior is already causing chaos in the marketplace. His actions have  hyped up the cost of premiums. He has sent out-of-pocket costs through  the roof. Instead of helping Americans get better healthcare, he has  put it out of reach for millions.   I commend my colleagues Senator Alexander and Senator Murray. They  have found a bipartisan solution to this new healthcare crisis caused  by our President. I urge Leader McConnell to put it onto the floor.   The Affordable Care Act isn't the only healthcare program at risk.  The President and Republicans are letting funds run dry for other  critical health programs. Last month, the Children's Health Insurance  Program expired. CHIP insures almost 9 million children across the  country, including over 11,000 kids in my home State of New Mexico. The  Community Health Centers Program also expired last month.    Republicans failed to extend the Maternal, Infant, and Early  Childhood Home Visiting Services. That is one of the most effective  health programs that we have. Without it, more than 1,000 New Mexico  parents could miss out on home visits. They will not get crucial  information about how to nurse their newborns, recognize healthy  behavior in infants, and teach basic skills to their children. The  Special Diabetes Program for Indians is also set to expire in December.   I urge Republicans to work with us to reauthorize these critical  healthcare programs. We need to act urgently. We can get this done by  Thanksgiving or earlier if we work together.   Madam President, I want to talk about CHIP first.   CHIP provides comprehensive health insurance for kids whose families  do not quite qualify for Medicaid but who cannot afford private  insurance. CHIP covers basic medical care, like immunizations,  prescriptions, routine checkups and dental visits. Thanks to CHIP, the  rate of uninsured kids in America has dropped from 14 percent to 4.5  percent.   CHIP has been a lifesaver for some families. This is Colton. He is  from the small town of Anthony, NM. Colton was 8 years old when he was  diagnosed with cancer. Fortunately, the cancer was treatable, and he  was insured by CHIP. So the cost of his treatment and medications were  covered. Without CHIP, Colton's family would have had to have paid  hundreds of dollars a month for his treatment, which is the cost of a  month's rent.   Families should not have to choose between lifesaving care for their  children and a roof over their heads.   Colton's father wrote to the Santa Fe New Mexican, and it read:         Watching my son battle for his life was almost more than I       could bear. I couldn't imagine dealing with the stress of       scraping together everything we had to cover the medical       bills if we didn't have coverage. Having [CHIP] allowed us to       focus on what was truly important--Colton's future and being       there for my family as we went through this life-changing       experience.    But, now, States are looking at contingency plans. New Mexico has  reserves but only until next spring. Some States will be forced to  cover all of the cost in just a few months, and others are preparing to  send notices to families that their coverage will end. No parent who is  already in crisis because of a sick child should have to go through  that. CHIP was a bipartisan success story. I hope that we can get back  to working together on this.   The 50-year-old Community Health Centers Program delivers  comprehensive healthcare services to some of our Nation's most  vulnerable individuals--schoolchildren, people experiencing  homelessness, agricultural workers, and our veterans. In New Mexico, 17  of these clinics serve 333,000 patients in 90 underserved and rural  communities.   The Community Health Centers are also important to the economy in  rural communities. In New Mexico, they employ almost 3,000 people  across the State. These clinics cannot sustain a 70-percent funding cut  if Federal support is canceled. Many would be forced to shut their  doors.   I recently visited one of these clinics--the De Baca Family Practice  Clinic in Fort Sumner, NM. It provides high-quality medical services to  over 3,000 patients. Over one-fifth of its patients are children, and  another one-fifth are seniors, but if funding runs out, the De Baca  Family Practice Clinic will be forced to start laying off essential  medical staff and to reduce its hours.   Clinic director Lisa Walraven told me: ``You simply cannot reduce  funding by 70 percent from a small frontier healthcare facility and  expect anything other than a significant loss of access to care.''   Both CHIP and community health centers provide preventive care to  underserved communities throughout New Mexico. They are supporting our  healthcare system to ensure that we don't let any families fall through  the cracks.  [[Page S6794]]    Indian Country also depends on these programs and others like them to  provide vital care to their communities. The Federal Government has a  trust and treaty obligation to provide healthcare to Native Americans.  Yet the Indian Health Service is severely underfunded. CHIP and similar  programs help to supplement care that the Indian Health Service cannot  provide. CHIP currently covers more than 1,400 Native American children  in New Mexico. Allowing these programs to expire would betray our  treaty obligations.   Another program cited that is critical to Indian Country is the  Special Diabetes Program for Indians. It provides grants to Native  communities for diabetes treatment and prevention. Without proper  treatment, diabetes can lead to limb amputation and kidney failure. The  disproportionate impact on Native Americans is a public health problem  that we cannot ignore.   This program is making real progress. It helps to fund over 300  Native health programs in 35 States, including 29 programs in New  Mexico. They help educate communities about how to prevent diabetes and  provide care so that Native patients can manage their diabetes more  effectively.   It is one of the most effective public health initiatives ever  undertaken by the Federal Government. Diabetes-related kidney failure  has dropped 54 percent among Native Americans. In some States, like  Alaska, leg amputations among Native people with diabetes have  decreased more than 68 percent. This program literally saves life and  limb.   Program directors across Indian Country tell me that without this  funding they will have to start laying off staff and limiting their  diabetes programming. We need to provide funding to Tribal communities  so that they can invest in projects that will be more effective in  preventing diabetes over time.   Congress must act to allow this successful program to reach its full  potential. We cannot allow diabetes to become a death sentence in  Indian Country once again.   The failure to fund CHIP, the failure to fund the community health  centers, home visiting health services, and the Special Diabetes  Program will force families into another health crisis. Every day that  we neglect these programs, more people will suffer. These programs have  years--sometimes decades--of proven success.   The American people want Congress to work together to come up with  bipartisan solutions. Most of these programs were created through  bipartisan cooperation. Let's get back to that spirit and work together  for the American people again.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
