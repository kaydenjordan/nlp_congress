 Mr. Speaker, for far too long, Big Pharma has played by  its own rules, benefiting from skyrocketing drug prices on the backs of  our most vulnerable populations.   Back in 2003, legislation was passed establishing Medicare part D to  make prescription drugs more affordable for people, but Big Pharma  lobbyists influenced those policies and made it so there is a provision  included that would ban the Secretary of Health and Human Services from  negotiating lower prices directly with pharmaceutical companies,  something that the VA can already do today.   Over 42 million Americans who are enrolled in Medicare part D  continue to face rising costs on brand name drugs, fewer generic drugs,  and higher premiums, making it difficult, if not impossible, for many  to fill their prescriptions.   I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the Medicare Prescription Drug  Price Negotiation Act to take back our healthcare from pharmaceutical  companies and allow the Secretary of HHS to negotiate drug prices  directly with manufacturers to secure affordable, lifesaving medication  for millions of Americans.                            ____________________
