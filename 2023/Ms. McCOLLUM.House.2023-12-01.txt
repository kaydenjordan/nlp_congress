 Madam Speaker, I rise to share my concerns regarding  the hate speech and threats throughout our country and the world.   We must speak loudly and clearly with one voice: Threats, harassment,  and hate based on race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation,  gender, or any other identity have no place in our communities, on our  college campuses, and in our society.   The increase of these cases is serious and it demands action. Bills  we have been voting on do not address all the rise of hate against all  the protected groups, including the concurrent rise of Islamophobia and  bigotry against Palestinians.   Let me be clear: I stand with our ally Israel. I condemn the violence  committed against the Israeli civilians by Hamas. I speak out against  anti-Semitism, but it is a glaring omission not to include other  protected classes.   We are missing an opportunity to condemn hate in all its forms. I  remain steadfast in condemning hate speech and the violence it  inspires.                            ____________________
