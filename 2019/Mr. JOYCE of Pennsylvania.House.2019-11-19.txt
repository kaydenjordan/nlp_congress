 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember  President Lincoln's famous remarks in Gettysburg, 156 years ago today.   In the Gettysburg Address, President Lincoln expressed some of the  most important American values in just 272 words. At the time,  President Lincoln said: ``The world will little note, nor long remember  what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.''   Over the past 150 years, the world still remembers the service of  those who fought in Gettysburg, including my great-grandfather.   We continue to remember and to cherish what President Lincoln said  there, and we remain resolved ``that government of the people, by the  people, for the people, shall not perish from the Earth.''   It is my privilege to represent Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, in the  United States House of Representatives and to highlight our region's  significant role in American history.                            ____________________
