 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Officer  Brandon Tsai. He was a brave member of the Grand Prairie Police  Department, and he died in the line of duty this past week.   Officer Tsai bravely protected the people of north Texas and the city  of Grand Prairie since January of this year, after serving 5 years with  the Los Angeles Police Department.   The Grand Prairie Police Department described Officer Tsai as a  loving friend, a trusted colleague, and outstanding officer whose  passion provided service to the public.   I join the entire north Texas community and all of his brothers and  sisters in blue in all of the metroplex departments in keeping Officer  Brandon Tsai's family, friends, and all of his colleagues at the city  of Grand Prairie in our thoughts and prayers during this time.                            ____________________
