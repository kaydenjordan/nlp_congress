 Madam Speaker, Vice President Kamala Harris was named  border czar on March 24, 2021. It was 93 days later when she finally  went down to visit a border community amidst this unprecedented  humanity crisis. There is just one problem: she didn't actually visit  the border.   Last Friday, Vice President Harris hopped off her plane in El Paso  for a few hours on her way to California. She quickly toured a border  patrol station 10 miles away from the actual border avoiding a visit to  ground zero.   And what do I mean by ``ground zero''? I mean the actual border where  thousands of migrants are flooding across daily, like the Rio Grande  Valley sector where over 50,000 illegal immigrants were apprehended in  May alone, which is 128 percent, more than the entire El Paso sector.   Or in the Del Rio sector where every afternoon buses on the Mexican  side of the border pull up and they unload hundreds of migrants who  cross the Rio Grande River in knee-high water.   I saw it myself firsthand when I visited the Del Rio sector in June.  While I was there getting a tour of the actual border, a couple of men  crossed the Rio Grande over to the American side, and when they got to  the bank of the river, DPS agents and I questioned them.   We asked them where they were from, why they were here, and why they  thought they could get into America. They told us they were from Cuba  and they had come here to work. Then they told us something that  shouldn't surprise anyone: They thought they could get into America  because President Biden said they could come.   Within minutes, agents of Border Patrol pulled up in a van, loaded  with other migrants who had crossed down river, and away they went.  Situations like this are happening in the thousands every day along our  border. And Border Patrol is the one being forced to pick these  migrants up, process them, straining their manpower and resources,  resulting in our border being completely open for criminal illegal  aliens who want to cross undetected.   Americans have been hearing about this Biden border crisis for  months, and they see nothing changing. They see the cartels are getting  rich trafficking these migrants across our border. And they hear the  horror stories of children being abandoned and abused during their  journey to our southern border. All of this has a real world impact on  Americans.   As a former county sheriff in Texas, I know all too well the second  and third order effects of an unsecure southern border. Americans will  undoubtedly become victims of crime from the illegal aliens  successfully avoiding detection when they cross. Like Ms. Bowie who was  run over and killed while I was sheriff by an illegal alien who had  been deported six times prior.   Our open border will strain local law enforcement and border State  resources who are tasked with cleaning up the mess. A mess created by  the Biden administration's failure to stem the flow of illegal aliens  pouring across the border.   But it really doesn't need to be this way. The Biden border crisis  all started when Biden reversed the Trump administration's remain in  Mexico policy and stopped construction of the wall. We can get back to  operational control of our southern border if the Biden administration  just reverts back to the Trump administration's policies. Until then,  there simply is no end in sight.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, crime is rising across the country. Double- digit increases in violent crime have been seen in cities across our  country; liberal cities, no less, that chose to defund their police.  This shouldn't be a surprise to anyone here. When you defund the  police, you have less police. And less police means more criminals on  the streets.   Rather than address the poor policy decisions that have led to this  increase in violent crime, like defunding police, Democrats are  attempting to deflect blame on to gun owners. Law-abiding gun owners in  this country are frequently attacked by the radical left as being the  source of the gun violence problem. The left wants to tell them what  guns they can own and how they should be able to purchase them.   As a former county sheriff, I know firsthand how important gun  ownership is. When someone lives in a remote part of the country, they  can't afford to wait for a 20-minute law enforcement response time in  the event of a home invasion. That person needs quick access to a  firearm to defend themselves and their loved ones. And that is exactly  what legal gun ownership is about, defending one's liberty from would- be attackers.   Law-abiding gun owners are not the source of the problem with gun  crimes across the country. It is criminals who have no regard for the  law. Taking away or limiting a law-abiding citizen's access to legally  purchasing a firearm will only hurt law-abiding citizens. We must  protect the Second Amendment rights of all Americans. It is a  foundational right of our Republic and must not be infringed.   Republicans in the House must stand firm as the radical left  continues their assault. If we lose the Second Amendment, all others  will be in jeopardy. ``Shall not be infringed.'' It is that simple.
