 Mr. President, this week, Senator McConnell has scheduled  votes on five judicial nominees.   Some of these nominees, I will oppose, including 11th Circuit nominee  Andrew Brasher. Some, I will support, including John Kness, a nominee  for the Northern District of Illinois, who was part of a bipartisan  package of nominees in my State.   But first, I want to point out that, under this Republican majority,  the Senate simply doesn't do legislation any more. There are literally  hundreds of bills that have passed the House of Representatives and are  gathering dust on the Senate desk.   These bills deal with critical issues like reducing prescription drug  prices, protecting pensions, securing our elections from foreign  interference, and closing gaps in our gun background check system, but  time and again, when Senate Republicans have the opportunity to bring  bills to the floor, they take a pass. They just don't want to do the  hard work of legislating. Last year, the Senate voted on only 22  amendments all year. I remember when we used to vote on that many  amendments in a single day.   Sadly, under this Republican majority, the Senate is becoming an  appendage of the White House and no more than a conveyor belt for  President Trump's judicial nominees. We are abdicating our  responsibility to legislate on matters of importance to the American  people.   The Constitution assigns the Senate important roles as part of a  coequal legislative branch. We are not rising to meet these challenges.  When we look at this week's nominations votes, we are reminded yet  again of how the Senate is abdicating its authority.   Andrew Brasher is the 18th Trump circuit court nominee who has been  moved through the Senate Judiciary Committee without blue slips from  both home State Senators. For a century, blue slips served as a  critical check in the system, helping ensure that Senators, as the  elected representatives of their State's citizens, have a role in  choosing the Federal judges who will serve lifetime appointments in  their State.   But Republicans, who used blue slips to obstruct many of President  Obama's nominees, cast aside the blue slip once President Trump came  into office. Now, circuit court nominees are routinely being rammed  through the Senate over the objections of home State Senators. Some of  these nominees are lightly qualified, to put it nicely. Some have  barely practiced law in the State in which they have been nominated to  serve. Some have barely seen the inside of a courtroom.   Today's nominee, 38-year-old Andrew Brasher, was confirmed as a  district court judge last year without bipartisan support. Less than a  year later, he is being put forward for the 11th Circuit. A former  solicitor general of Alabama, he worked on controversial efforts to  restrict voting rights, limit reproductive rights, and undermine gun  safety laws.   But beyond the controversial advocacy that he undertook on behalf of  his clients, Andrew Brasher also made comments in his personal capacity  that call into question his impartiality and temperament. This includes  a 2015 blog post he wrote in opposition to same-sex marriage and a  speech he gave at a 2014 pro-life political rally where he said, ``The  ACLU and Planned Parenthood want a fight and we will give them one.''   I will oppose the Brasher nomination, and I will also oppose Alaska  district court nominee Joshua Kindred, who has a lengthy record of  opposition to environmental protections. Mr. Kindred once described  environmentalists as being driven by ``passionate ignorance.''   I will vote in support of the nomination of John Kness to the  Northern District of Illinois. Mr. Kness is the final part of a package  of four Illinois district court nominees that was agreed upon between  myself, Senator Duckworth, the Illinois Republican congressional  delegation, and the White House. It is a good bipartisan package.   Mr. Kness is a graduate of Northwestern and Northwestern Law and a  former Assistant U.S. Attorney. He is currently the general counsel for  the College of DuPage. He is diligent, thoughtful, and principled, and  I urge my colleagues to support his nomination.                            ____________________     I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Bennet),  the Senator from Minnesota (Ms. Klobuchar), the Senator from Vermont  (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator from Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are  necessarily absent.

Madam President, every day, we are reminded of the  devastating toll of gun violence in our Nation. On average, around 100  Americans die each day from gunfire. It is an epidemic of violence.  This week marks the anniversaries of three horrific mass shootings.   On February 15, 1 year ago, a gunman shot and killed five coworkers  at a warehouse in Aurora, IL, and also shot and wounded five police  officers who rushed to the scene. On that day, we lost Russell Beyer,  Vicente Juarez, Clay Parks, Josh Pinkard, and Trevor Wehner.   February 14 was the date of the 2008 mass school shooting at Northern  Illinois University in DeKalb, in which a mentally disturbed gunman  killed 5 students and wounded 17 more. On that day, we lost Gayle  Dubowski, Catalina Garcia, Julianna Gehant, Ryanne Mace, and Daniel  Parmenter.   And February 14 was also the date when 17 students and staff were  murdered in 2018 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland,  FL.   These anniversaries and statistics are grim, but they do not capture  the true impact of this horrific gun violence--so many funerals, so  many families and communities devastated.   And every day we lose still more lives to gun violence in communities  large and small. Just this past weekend, at least 23 people were shot  in the city of Chicago, nine of them fatally.   We pray for the families and loved ones of those we have lost, and we  remember the wounded who bear physical and mental scars from their  trauma. We also renew our thanks for the first responders who run  toward the sound of gunfire and risk their lives to help others.   There are many people throughout America who are doing all they can  to try to reduce our Nation's epidemic of gun violence. This includes  parents, community leaders, teachers, faith leaders, law enforcement,  public officials, the medical community, and more.   I particularly want to commend a coalition of hospitals that has been  working with me in Chicago on the HEAL Initiative. This is an effort to  coordinate these hospitals' resources, from economic investment to  community programming, to help reduce violence and improve quality of  life in their surrounding neighborhoods. There are promising efforts  taking place in many States and local communities to address gun  violence.   But is the U.S. Senate doing all it can to protect our communities  from gun violence? No, not even close.   While there is no single reform that could prevent every shooting, we  know there are obvious gaps in Federal gun laws that make it easy for  felons, abusers, and mentally unstable people to get guns.   Nearly a year ago, on February 27, 2019, the House of Representatives  passed a bipartisan bill to close gaps in our background check system  that allow an estimated 22 percent of gun sales to occur without a  check. Around 90 percent of Americans support closing the gaps in the  background check system. It is a step that would save lives. Yet the  Republican Senate majority refuses to call the bill up for a vote. I  can't explain why Senate Republicans won't take up bipartisan, House- passed gun safety legislation that Americans overwhelmingly support. It  makes no sense.   There have been too many deaths, too many mass shootings, too many  grim anniversaries, and too many excuses for inaction. It is time for  Senator McConnell to call up H.R. 8, the bipartisan background checks  bill, and hold a vote.                            ____________________     Madam President, the Chicago area is blessed to have some  of the top hospitals and academic centers in the country. Rush  University Medical Center and College in Chicago, in particular, has  advanced into a comprehensive and leading health care institution. Rush  continues to deliver high-quality care to its patients, driving the  field of innovative medical research and training the next generation  of healthcare practitioners. I would like to celebrate the tenure and  accomplishments of the hospital's president and CEO and the leader in  the program at Rush, my friend, Dr. Larry Goodman.   In 1976, Larry earned his medical degree from the University of  Michigan's Medical School. He completed his residency at the Rush  University Medical Center, where he served as the chief medical  resident before joining the faculty.   At Rush, Larry served as an infectious disease specialist, working to  improve the lives of people affected by HIV and AIDS. He also served as  the senior vice president of medical affairs and the dean of the Rush  Medical College before the hospital appointed him as it's president and  CEO in 2002.   Under Larry's leadership, Rush has prospered. The hospital doubled  its student enrollment in the last 20 years, training future physicians  who will provide top-notch healthcare services in communities around  the Nation. The hospital also collaborated to increase its employment  of local community members. These efforts, in part through West Side  United, have helped to reduce the health inequities that exist between  the residents of low-income communities and those in affluent  communities. In fact, it was Dr. Goodman who first told me about the  alarming 16-year gap in life expectancy between people living in the  Loop and in West Garfield Park--just two ``L'' stops, or 6 miles, apart  from each other on the Blue.   More than a year ago, I joined several community leaders to announce  the Chicago Hospital Engagement, Action, and Leadership, or HEAL,  Initiative to help address many of the root  [[Page S986]]  causes of gun violence, such as economic hardship and spare mental  health services. Under this initiative, each hospital made 16  commitments to address these issues. Larry was the inspiration for this  undertaking and instrumental in getting it off the ground. It is a  testament to his lifelong dedication to those in need.   After decades of service dedicated to improving lives and helping  others, Larry has retired with an amazing legacy. He has been key to  thinking about the transformative role of hospitals in uplifting  communities and through his hard work, vision, and commitment to make  it possible. I am especially grateful for our partnership over the  years, from his leadership on the Cook County Hospital transition to  the Chicago HEAL Initiative.   I am proud to call Larry my friend, and I wish him the very best in  retirement.                            ____________________     Madam President, it was more than 50 years ago that a  young couple from Springfield, IL brought their baby daughter to then- Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago. They drove more than 200 miles  each way because they knew Children's Hospital provided the best care  for their daughter, and they repeated that trip every 3 months for  years. I know this story well because it is the story of my family's  relationship with Children's Memorial, now known as Lurie Children's.  It also is a story thousands of other children and families could tell  about the world-class treatment they received at Children's.   I want to take this time to recognize a person who has been the heart  and soul of this hospital for decades: my friend, Mr. Patrick Magoon.  Pat served as the president and CEO of the Ann and Robert H. Lurie  Children's Hospital of Chicago for more than two decades. He retired  recently, and I want to take this opportunity to honor his work.   In 1977, Pat started his career at then-Children's Memorial Hospital  as a planning department intern while he pursued his master's degree in  urban policy and planning from the University of Illinois. When he  joined the staff at the hospital, he held a number of administrative  positions--even working as the hospital's laundry manager--before he  became president and CEO in 1997.   In the last 20 years under Pat's direction, Lurie Children's has come  to be recognized as one of the best children's hospitals in the Nation.  In the last 8 years, U.S. News and World Report has named Lurie's a top  10 children's hospital in the country 7 times. It also has received  four Magnet Award designations, the highest national recognition given  for excellence in nursing care.   When Pat was appointed, the hospital faced financial challenges,  losing about $1 million a month. Thanks to his hard work, vision, and  commitment, the hospital is not only financially stable but has become  a beacon of hope for children--both within its own walls and in the  Chicago community. During Pat's tenure, it has increased the number of  children it serves by more than 50 percent, giving thousands of  children access to high-quality healthcare services. Lurie Children's  has significantly expanded its innovative research and treatment  services, including its Nation-leading efforts on trauma-informed care  and violence prevention, to meet the increasing needs of its patients.   Pat Magoon has been the key to positioning Lurie Children's as a  national leader in the care of kids. I am especially grateful for our  partnership over the years and his leadership in protecting and  advocating for the youngest, most vulnerable patients. We could always  count on Pat and Children's to be a strong ally in the support of the  Affordable Care Act and Medicaid, biomedical research funding, and  addressing violence and the social determinants of health.   Pat Magoon's legacy is not just a great children's hospital, which  Lurie Children's has become, but the heartfelt appreciation of the  children, parents, staff, and volunteers who know he has been an  integral part of making their lives better. I salute my friend, Pat  Magoon.   (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
