 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized in  morning business.    Mr. President, I understand the majority leader may be  coming to the floor to make a request. If he does, I certainly would be  willing to yield to him, and I hope I won't lose my right to the floor.   Mr. President, a lot has happened here in Washington in the last few  days. Marcelle and I knew that a number of Vermonters were coming down  for the Women's March on Washington. We said to them, ``Look, if any  Vermonters are coming down, why don't you join us for coffee?'' We  arranged it right here on Capitol Hill, so they could.   At first, we didn't know how many would show up until we started  getting the responses. Marcelle and I were there, along with members of  my staff, shortly after 6 in the morning, and people started pouring  in. Eventually, we had 500 or 600 from the little State of Vermont who  joined us. I had a chance to speak to them.   My wife, Marcelle, gave one of the most powerful speeches, totally  ad-libbed, that I have heard, pointing out the stakes of what is  happening in this country. Of course, she pointed to the Supreme Court  just next door.   What got me is that these people came from all walks of life in  Vermont. Some I knew, and a lot I didn't. Some are Republicans. Some  are Democrats. Some are Independents. All were very concerned. Most  came down in buses and drove all through the night, a little over 500  miles, to show that our brave little State says no to hate. We had  thousands more who marched in my State capital, Montpelier. Let me put  this in perspective. Our State capital--I was born there, and I know it  very well--is home to only 8,500 people, but 15,000 Vermonters stood on  our statehouse lawn to show the President that they are paying  attention, they want their voices to be heard, and the American people  will hold him accountable.    I got some of the most enthusiastic emails and tweets. My 14-year-old  granddaughter, Francesca, told me how thrilled she was to be there. One  Vermonter who took part in the enormous Women's March in Montpelier  told a member of my staff, ``This is the first time I have been able to  smile since Election Day.''   In Washington, Marcelle and I were proud to march with our daughter,  Alicia, and 12-year-old granddaughter, Sophia. I was proud to see this  12-year-old holding her head high, knowing the respect that was being  shown to her and her mother, as well as to Marcelle and me. She knew  that respect went to her in a way that reflected everybody--Black,  White, no matter what you might be. People cared.   We have heard disrespectful, offensive and dangerous comments seep  into  [[Page S419]]  our national discourse. The millions of men and women who participated  in marches across the country this weekend offered a powerful statement  that they will not tolerate policies that restrict the rights of women  or treat women like second-class citizens. They will not treat my wife  as one, they will not treat my daughter as one, they will not treat my  three wonderful granddaughters as one, and all five of our  grandchildren will be treated the same.   Unfortunately, the Trump administration ignored the voices of  millions of Americans and is already undermining the rights of women.  Two of the President's first Executive Orders targeted women. His first  Executive Order attempts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, which  throws into limbo the health insurance arrangements of millions of  American women who have been guaranteed maternity coverage as part of  their health care plans, who have been able to have affordable birth  control for the first time, who have been able to tell insurance  companies that no, pregnancy is not a preexisting condition. In other  words, women can be treated the same as men when they seek insurance.   President Trump also reinstated the so-called Mexico City policy, a  policy that would be illegal and unconstitutional in this country--that  will only result in more abortions and more pregnancy related deaths in  developing countries. A former Republican Senator whom I respected  highly, when he was chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee--he  was strongly against abortion, but he said this kind of a policy is  only going to result in more abortions and more pregnancy-related  deaths in developing countries, and he is right. He is right.  Affordable health care, affordable birth control, and the availability  of these services would bring down abortion and pregnancy-related  deaths, whether in the United States or the countries we help.   Mr. President, Americans are watching. From what I heard and saw from  Vermonters on Saturday, I could tell you that they are fired up and  ready to go. We need a President who is committed to equality and  opportunity for all people, no matter their sex, gender, or race. We  will not stand for policies that turn back the clock on so much  progress we have made. To paraphrase Dr. Martin Luther King, we have to  accept finite disappointment, but we must not give up infinite hope.  Only light can crowd out the darkness.   I was proud to see so many Vermonters speaking up. They are not going  away, and, as I pledged to them on Saturday, I am not going away. I am  going to speak. I am going to speak the same way I did when Marcelle  and I walked with our daughter and our granddaughter in the million  women march. I will continue to speak up, as the people in my office in  Vermont did, in Montpelier. I will speak up for all five of our  grandchildren, for Francesca and Sophia and Fiona, but also for Patrick  and Roan. I will speak up for all Americans. I will speak up for all  Vermonters. They expect nothing less and they deserve nothing less.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, it has become fashionable, particularly  among supporters of the Trump administration, to accuse the United  Nations of just about everything. This is, however, nothing new. The  U.N has been an easy target, especially for some Republicans, for a  long time, because like any unwieldy international organization  comprised of member states with very different priorities and interests  it will probably never be as efficient or effective as we would like.   But there is simply no question that the U.N. serves many vital  functions that are fully consistent with key U.S. interests and values.  For that reason, it is essential that the U.S. continues to play a  leadership role in the U.N., which we were instrumental in creating  seven decades ago, in a manner that strengthens the institution.   At times, I have expressed my own frustrations with the U.N. It  wastes inordinate amounts of time debating and adopting redundant  resolutions that accomplish next to nothing. It has suffered from  personnel policies that make it difficult if not impossible to fire  underperforming employees. It pays its officials at rates that dwarf  what many could earn in their own countries. It has been too slow to  implement procedures to ensure transparency and accountability,  including for whistleblowers who have suffered retaliation for exposing  corruption and other misconduct.   So there is no dispute that the U.N. needs to do better. The new  Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, knows this as well as anyone and  he has made clear that he is going to do his best to put the  institution on a road to real reform.   But, of course, he cannot do that by himself. He is empowered only to  the extent that the U.N. member states, and particularly the permanent  members of the Security Council, support him.   Attempts by past the Secretary Generals to implement reforms have  been partly stymied by resistance from governments that prefer the  status quo. While I believe the prospects for U.N.reform have never  been better, that will not be possible without the active leadership  and skillful diplomacy of the United States.   And that is where our U.N. Ambassador comes in.   I have known many of them, although I was only 7 years old in 1947  when Warren Austin of Vermont, nominated by President Truman, became  our third U.N. Ambassador.   The position of U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. has also been held by  such accomplished people as Henry Cabot Lodge, Adlai Stevenson, George  H.W. Bush, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Thomas Pickering, and Madeleine  Albright. Each was recognized and widely admired across the political  spectrum for his or her depth of foreign policy experience and wisdom.   Today we are considering the nomination of Nikki Haley to be the next  U.S. Ambassador. Governor Haley's record as Governor of South Carolina  was decidedly mixed, and I will not take time today to discuss that  record. What is most relevant here, however, is her dearth of  experience for the job she has been selected for. That is not so much a  criticism of Governor Haley as it is of President Trump, as there are  certainly well qualified, seasoned diplomats in the Republican Party  who would be well received by members of both parties.   Instead, we are asked to support a nominee who will no doubt be  confirmed but will be starting from square one. If there ever were a  case of having to learn on the job, this will be it. That might not  concern me if it were not for the indispensable role of the United  Nations in an increasingly dangerous and polarized world, the  importance of this position, and the complex challenges the next U.S.  Ambassador will face on her first day on the job.   It was painfully apparent during her confirmation hearing that  virtually everything Governor Haley said in her opening remarks and in  her responses to questions of Senators, she had learned in the previous  2 months since she was chosen for the job. Her answers largely parroted  popular Republican talking points with little substance to back up her  response and revealed only an elementary understanding of how the U.N.  functions. Her stated interest in U.N. reform is well placed, but it  did not appear that she grasps what U.N. reform entails or what it  takes to build the necessary support for reform.   Again, I do not blame her for that. Her career has focused entirely  on issues relevant to the State of South Carolina. But that does not  make her qualified to be our Ambassador to the U.N.   As Governor, she jumped on the politically expedient bandwagon and  opposed the resettlement of any Syrian refugees in her State over  ``security concerns,'' although it being a Federal decision some  Syrians have been resettled there. In other words, she supported a  blanket prohibition against an entire nationality of people--men,  women, and children--regardless of the merits of their individual  status as refugees fleeing war.   She stated, in spite of the fact that all of our major European  allies supported the nuclear agreement with Iran, that Russia's and  China's support was a ``red flag,'' without acknowledging the reality  that without their support it would be impossible to achieve an  agreement to halt Iran's nuclear weapons program or any of our other  key objectives at the U.N.   She condemned the U.S. abstention on U.N. Security Council Resolution  [[Page S428]]  2334 regarding Israeli settlements and incorrectly implied that it is  inconsistent with longstanding U.S. policy and interests. In fact, she  insisted that the resolution, not settlements themselves, makes peace  negotiations more difficult--a view with which I disagree. She seemed  to acknowledge that the U.S. does not support settlement construction,  but stated that the U.S. should have vetoed the resolution anyway.   She mischaracterized U.S. law regarding our share of dues in support  of U.N. peacekeeping missions that the U.S.--Republican and Democratic  administrations--voted for, failing to acknowledge that we have a  treaty obligation to pay 28.5 percent of U.N. peacekeeping costs. She  made little mention of and gave little if any credit to the troop- contributing countries themselves, other than to highlight incidents of  sexual exploitation and abuse. This is a critical issue that I and  others here have been working with the U.S. Mission to the U.N. to  address, and progress is being made in developing meaningful  accountability procedures.   She stated that the cut-off of U.S. funding for UNESCO as a result of  the vote of a majority of its members to accept Palestine as a member  state, which led to our loss of influence, is a ``good thing'' and that  she would continue to support the cut-off of funding. She and I  disagree about that and what it could mean for the future. I think even  the Israeli Government has come to recognize that it is better for the  U.S. to be at the table, using our influence to deflect attempts to  unfairly target Israel, than on the sidelines.   Governor Haley suggested that the U.S. may want to reconsider  participation in and funding for the U.N. Human Rights Council, despite  overwhelming evidence that our role serves to protect our interests and  has reduced substantially the council's disproportionate and wasteful  focus on Israel. At no time did she acknowledge the many council  resolutions that are fully consistent with U.S. interests or that the  influence lost by the U.S. is simply ceded to the very governments she  opposes having a say in the council.   On the other hand, Governor Haley did repeatedly reject what she  described as ``slash and burn'' tactics when it comes to budget  cutting, and on that, I fully agree with her.   She said she supports moving our embassy to Jerusalem, although there  is no compelling need to do so, it is strongly opposed by our ally  Jordan, would likely incite a violent reaction in Arab countries, and  could do more to drive a nail in the coffin of what little remains of  the Middle East peace process than anything else.   In responses to written questions she betrayed a serious lack of  understanding about Cuba, its economy, and the failures of the 55-year- old U.S. embargo. Indeed, if she were to apply her answers regarding  Cuba to other countries with repressive governments, we would have to  close dozens of U.S. Embassies, end diplomatic relations, and impose  ineffective, unilateral sanctions against each of them.   I urge Governor Haley, as our U.N. Ambassador, to listen to the  overwhelming majority of Americans and Cubans, including many  Republican Members of Congress, who support a policy of engagement. I  urge her to travel to Cuba and see and hear for herself, unlike those  who continue to favor a Cold War embargo that has been exploited by the  Cuban Government to justify its repressive policies and that has hurt  the Cuban people.   I have been a congressional delegate to the United Nations three  times, after being nominated by Presidents of both Republican and  Democratic parties. I appreciated that opportunity because I have long  believed that it is in the strong interest of the United States to play  an active, leadership role in the U.N.   That is only possible if we, by far the world's wealthiest country,  meet our financial commitments. And it is only possible if we build  coalitions through skillful diplomacy and refrain from the tactics that  some critics of the U.N. advocate, such as bullying and ultimatums,  which are often self-defeating.   I recognize that Governor Haley will be confirmed, and I wish her the  best. I hope she becomes a great U.S. Ambassador. I urge her to seek  out and listens to a wide range of views, particularly on controversial  issues like the Middle East, Iran, and how the U.S. can best help make  the U.N. work better for everyone.   I will do everything I can to support Secretary General Guterres, the  budget of the U.S. Mission to the U.N., and funding for U.N. agencies  like the World Food Program, the U.N. Development Program, UNICEF, the  U.N. Environment Program, the U.N. Population Fund, U.N. Women, the  U.N. Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture, and so many others that  carry out lifesaving humanitarian and development programs around the  world.   And if there are other ways that I can help soon-to-be Ambassador  Haley to defend the values and effectively advance the interests of the  United States at the U.N. and to bring about needed reforms I will  gladly do so.    Mr. President, I want to take a moment to recognize two  exceptional members of the Smithsonian Institution's board of regents:  John W. McCarter, who has served as chair of the board, and Shirley Ann  Jackson, who has served as the vice chair. I have had the honor of  serving with both of them and believe that their dedication and  leadership have greatly benefitted the Smithsonian. Both are stepping  down from their roles, and while John will continue to serve on the  board, Shirley will be moving on to dedicate her considerable talents  to other initiatives.   John W. McCarter, Jr., of Illinois has had a long and distinguished  career. He was first appointed as a regent in 2009 and was elected  chair in 2013. In addition, John has lent his expertise and wisdom to a  number of the regents' other committees.   During his tenure, John has overseen a number of important strategic  initiatives, including the search for the Smithsonian's 13th secretary;  the development of the Institution's relationship with the Victoria &  Albert Museum in London; the reopening of the Arts and Industries  Building to the American public; and most recently, the opening of the  National Museum of African American History and Culture. These  opportunities will help to ensure the Smithsonian's continued success.   John also led the charge in reopening the historic Arts and  Industries Building on the National Mall to the public. The building,  shuttered since 2004, was reopened to the public for the secretary's  installation ceremony in October 2015 and was the site of a very  successful pop-up cultural exhibition over Memorial Day weekend in May  2016. John's vision and leadership have made this national treasure  available to the American people once more.   A tireless advocate for the Smithsonian in his home State of  Illinois, John has raised the institution's profile across the Nation  and around the world. Thanks to his recruitment efforts, the  Smithsonian advisory boards are more diverse, more dynamic, and more  engaged than ever before. Through all of these initiatives, John has  pushed the Smithsonian to be more ambitious and to renew its commitment  to ``the increase and diffusion of knowledge.''   I want to thank John for his exceptional leadership as chairman of  the board of regents, and I look forward to working with him through  the remainder of his term as a regent.   Dr. Shirley Ann Jackson of New York is the president of Rensselaer  Polytechnic Institute. She was appointed as a regent in 2005 and has  served as board and executive committee vice chair since 2013.   Shirley was the regents' representative for the successful events  that opened the Smithsonian's 19th museum, the National Museum of  African American History and Culture, in September 2016. Alongside  other notable guests, Shirley helped inaugurate the newest Smithsonian  museum by delivering remarks at the museum's dedication ceremony. As  she noted during her speech, the museum furthers ``the Smithsonian's  founding mission, to promote `the increase and diffusion of knowledge,'  by opening a museum dedicated to the African-American experience in the  United States, and its crucial place in the American experience.''   Shirley has a remarkable life story: She was the first African- American woman to earn a doctorate from MIT, and since 1999, she has  served as the president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute--marking  the first time an African-American woman has led a top research  university. She was also the first woman and the first African-American  to serve as chair of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Shirley is  emblematic of everything the Museum was founded to celebrate about the  African-American experience, and we were proud to have her serve as the  board's representative at all of the opening ceremonies.   The Smithsonian has also benefitted from Shirley's demonstrated  commitment to the sciences. As a trained physicist, she is particularly  passionate about inspiring the next generation of scientists and  conservationists. As vice chair, she has been a staunch advocate for  the Smithsonian's scientific researchers, trumpeting their successes  and inviting them to speak at Rensselaer. She has made a point of going  beyond the brick and mortar of the Smithsonian museums to visit the  Smithsonian's many research centers, including the Smithsonian Tropical  Research Center in Panama.   This past year, Secretary David Skorton tapped into Shirley's  extensive leadership and management experience, asking her to cochair  the institution's initiative to create a new strategic plan for 2017- 2022. Shirley has  [[Page S433]]  rolled up her sleeves, asking tough questions and meeting with a  variety of stakeholders regarding the institution's priorities for the  next 5 years. As a chief architect of this plan, Shirley will be  instrumental in charting the future of the institution long after she  has left the board of regents.   As a member of the board of regents, it has been my honor to serve  alongside Shirley. I believe her contributions to the Smithsonian  community will be witnessed and appreciated by generations to come.                            ____________________
