 Mr. President, I rise today to honor Sebastian  County Judge David Hudson who recently retired after nearly five  decades of service to the county and its citizens.   Judge Hudson grew up in Fort Smith. I have been blessed to know him  since  [[Page S73]]  our days at Darby Junior High School and he has been a dear friend ever  since. He earned his bachelor and master's degrees from the University  of Arkansas and started working for Sebastian County in 1976 as an  administrative assistant. Two decades later, he was elected to his  first term as the Sebastian County judge.   Judge Hudson spent his career improving the financial management of  the county while continuing to implement critical projects. Without  raising taxes, he led the renovation of the county courthouse, an  expansion of the county jail, and construction of a new courts  building, waterpark, and EMS facility, all of which have greatly served  the county and its residents.   He was also a champion for the creation of the State's first crisis  stabilization unit, which I had the privilege of visiting with Judge  Hudson. He worked closely with law enforcement, prosecutors, and mental  health professionals to see the completion of this project to provide  an alternative to jail and emergency rooms for people experiencing a  mental health crisis. Throughout his career, he has been a champion for  law enforcement, the court system, and our first responders, and I  appreciate his dedication to solving these important issues.   Judge Hudson distinguished himself as an advocate for the community  and a champion of the people who call the region home. Before being  elected as county judge, he managed the Sebastian County Emergency  Medical Services for 15 years. He also served in a number of roles  including as an educator at the former Westark Community College, as  well as an active member and leader of numerous civic organizations and  State and local boards and commissions.   I congratulate Judge David Hudson for his outstanding work and years  of service to Sebastian County. I appreciate his friendship and  excellent leadership which has resulted in improvement and growth  throughout the county. I wish him all the best in his  retirement.                            ____________________
