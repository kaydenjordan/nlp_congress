 Mr. President, the majority leader says that he will  move forward this week with a vote on a straight repeal of the  Affordable Care Act in its entirety. I don't believe that a majority of  Senators are willing to support a reckless leap in the dark, which that  vote would mean. It is a vote that would end protections for people  with preexisting conditions. It would take healthcare coverage away  from tens of millions of Americans and tens of thousands in New  Hampshire. It would terminate the Medicaid expansion that has been  critical to fighting the opioid epidemic in my State and so many States  across this country.   According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, a straight  repeal of the Affordable Care Act would result in more than 32 million  people losing their insurance coverage by 2026. Premiums would roughly  double in the individual marketplaces. I urge my Republican friends not  to go forward with this misguided approach.   The idea that they can repeal the healthcare bill now and give us a  new bill in 2 years or whatever period of time is in the bill just  doesn't pass the smell test. If we haven't seen an alternative to the  Affordable Care Act in the last 7 years, there is no reason to believe  that our Republican colleagues are going to be able to produce a bill  in 2 years when there is chaos in the marketplaces.   There is a better way forward for the Senate and for our country.  During the Fourth of July recess, Majority Leader McConnell said that  if he can't secure the votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act, he is  prepared to work in a bipartisan way with Democrats on legislation to  repair and strengthen the law.   I believe that bipartisanship is the best way to get something done.  That is what I tried to do when I was Governor of New Hampshire. I  worked closely with our Republican legislature, and we got things done.  It should not be a last resort for what we are doing; it should be the  first resort. It should be what we do to build a foundation for policy  in this country.   I am hopeful that following the floor consideration of whatever the  majority leader decides to do on healthcare--and, hopefully, it is  going to get defeated--we will move forward with the majority leader's  fallback plan, which I believe should be the starting position. We need  to start fresh with regular order to craft bipartisan legislation that  builds on the strengths of the Affordable Care Act, that builds on what  is working and fixes what is not working. As we have been hearing at  townhalls and in countless messages from our constituents, this is  exactly what the American people want us to do.   There is remarkable consensus in this country that the Republican  leaders' bill is the wrong approach. An ABC/Washington Post poll on  Sunday found that by a more than 2-to-1 margin, Americans prefer the  Affordable Care Act to the Republican leaders' bill. Their bill is  strongly opposed by hospital associations, by healthcare providers, by  the health insurance industry, and by nearly every patient advocacy  group, including the American Cancer Society and the American Heart  Association. There is no reason to think that just repealing the  Affordable Care Act is going to make that any better.   On Saturday, the New Hampshire Hospital Association, the New  Hampshire Medical Society--our physicians--and the New Hampshire AARP  joined together in opposition to the bill. They noted that more than  118,000 Granite Staters--nearly 1 in 10 people in New Hampshire--would  lose healthcare coverage under the Republican bill, and that number is  even greater if we just repeal the Affordable Care Act. Their joint  statement urges Senators ``to start over and create a new version of  legislation that protects coverage for those who have it and provides  coverage for those who need it most.''   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the joint statement by  these groups be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                 [From the Concord Monitor, July 15, 2017]    Our Turn: Protecting Patients Must Be the First Goal of Health Care                                Legislation             (By Todd C. Fahey, Stephen Ahnen and James Potter)         The New Hampshire Hospital Association, New Hampshire       Medical Society and AARP New Hampshire have joined in       opposition to the Better Care Reconciliation Act currently       under consideration in the U.S. Senate.        Our three organizations oppose the BCRA because it would       erode health protections for millions of Americans and expose       them to increased costs and health risks. We believe that any       health care legislation should have the goal of protecting       patients first.        We are concerned that the BCRA would reduce funding for       Medicare by cutting nearly $59 billion over 10 years from the       Hospital Insurance trust fund, which would hasten Medicare's       insolvency and diminish the program's ability to pay for       services in the future. This would affect hospitals, doctors       and consumers by reducing revenue and making it more       difficult to provide services to Medicare patients. To put a       sharper point on the issue, New Hampshire hospitals are       projected to receive approximately $1.5 billion less in       Medicare reimbursements over the next decade, reductions that       were enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act to help pay       for the coverage expansions that have occurred. To maintain       those spending reductions while millions of people lose       health insurance coverage is simply not feasible.        The BCRA threatens protection for people with employer-      sponsored health coverage by weakening consumer protections       that ban insurance companies from capping how much they will       cover annually or over a person's lifetime--leaving people       vulnerable to costs that could be financially catastrophic       for them.        In addition, the bill cuts more than $700 billion from       Medicaid by creating a capped financing structure in the       Medicaid program. This could lead to cuts in provider       payments, program eligibility, covered services or all three,       ultimately harming some of our nation's most vulnerable       citizens and dramatically impacting providers' ability to       serve patients and communities who depend on them every day.       It has been estimated that this would result in over $1.4       billion in reduced federal spending on Medicaid in New       Hampshire over the next decade. Where would New Hampshire       turn to find the resources necessary to care for our most       vulnerable citizens?        According to the CBO, the BCRA will leave 22 million more       people uninsured, including more than 118,000 Granite State       residents who were able to secure vital health coverage       through the Affordable Care Act, making it more difficult for       our most vulnerable to receive the services they need to stay       in their homes. Without health coverage for, and therefore       access to, critical health services, patients will seek care       in emergency rooms, ultimately raising uncompensated care       costs for hospitals throughout New Hampshire and increasing       cost-shifting to New Hampshire businesses.        We believe that the Better Care Reconciliation Act needs to       be viewed through the eyes of patients and the caregivers who       take care of them, and should make protecting health care       coverage for our most vulnerable citizens a higher priority.       We remain opposed to the BCRA and urge the Senate to start       over and create a new version of legislation that protects       coverage for those who have it and provides coverage for       those who need it most.        We appreciate the efforts of both of our senators to       protect access to affordable health care for all Granite       Staters, and we urge them to continue to work toward       bipartisan solutions that will cover more people, not less,       and reduce health care costs, including insurance premiums       and the high cost of prescription drugs.     Mr. President, I strongly agree with these New  Hampshire groups. After spending 6 months trying to pass the deeply  unpopular, deeply flawed bill to repeal the law, shouldn't we welcome a  bipartisan effort to improve the law? I believe the answer to that is  yes, and the place to begin is by taking urgent action on a matter  where most of us agree, and that is providing certainty to health  insurance markets in order to hold down premium increases. In their  2018 rate request filings, insurers say that large increases are  necessary because of the uncertainty surrounding the repeal of the  Affordable Care Act and because the Trump administration refuses to  commit to making cost-sharing reduction payments--those payments that  go to insurance companies so they can help their consumers with  [[Page S4032]]  the cost of health insurance, making sure that more people can get  health insurance. Well, we now have an opportunity to end this  uncertainty by putting the repeal behind us and authorizing a simple  bill to authorize regular appropriations for the cost-sharing reduction  payments.   The current instability in the ACA marketplaces is a manufactured  crisis, and Congress can put a stop to it very quickly. That is why I  have introduced the Marketplace Certainty Act, which is a bill to  permanently appropriate funds to expand the funds for and to expand the  cost-sharing repayments. It does two things: It guarantees that these  payments are coming, and it is going to cover more people to help. I am  pleased to be joined by 26 Senators who have already cosponsored this  bill. We can end this artificial crisis. We can immediately restore  certainty and stability to the insurance markets, and, in turn, we can  get the time we need in order to come together in a bipartisan way to  improve this law to build on what is working and to fix what is not.   We have a number of these commonsense measures, and this is one that  has been embraced, not just by Democrats but by key Republican leaders,  including Chairman Lamar Alexander and House Ways and Means Chairman  Kevin Brady, who have urged that these payments be continued. As  Chairman Brady put it, the payments are needed ``to help stabilize the  [health] insurance market and help lower premiums for Americans.'' He  added: ``Insurers have made clear the lack of certainty is causing 2018  proposed premiums to rise significantly.''   We have heard from our constituents at home. We have heard from  doctors, nurses, hospitals, particularly rural hospitals, nursing  homes, patient advocates, insurers, and those constituents who were in  the statement I asked to be printed in the Record. They are pleading  with us to set aside our partisan differences and work together to  repair the Affordable Care Act.   Again, we know what we can do. It is not just the Marketplace  Certainty Act; there are other bills that have been introduced that can  fix the uncertainty in the markets and allow us to address other issues  with the law.   Bipartisanship should be the Senate's first resort, not the last  resort. An excellent place to start is by coming together right now to  permanently appropriate funds for the cost-sharing reduction payments  that keep health coverage affordable and to look at some of the other  commonsense measures that are going to be talked about by my  colleagues, like Senator Klobuchar, who will be coming to the floor.  She has legislation that would help us deal with the high cost of  prescription drugs, which is one of the things that is driving the  increasing costs of healthcare. We need to pass these commonsense  measures, and we need to do it now.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I am really pleased to have been joined  by my colleagues to talk about the importance of addressing healthcare  for all Americans, especially my colleague from New Hampshire. She and  I have been touring the State for months now, talking with people in  hospitals, with patients, with physicians, with providers, with people  with substance use disorders, with providers who are providing  treatment for people with substance use disorders, with people all over  New Hampshire about what we can do to make sure people get healthcare  when they need it.   That should be the goal of this body. It should not be throwing  people off their healthcare, which a repeal of the Affordable Care Act  would do. It would throw 32 million people off their healthcare.   We can address the instability in the marketplaces. We can do that  pretty quickly. Senators Kaine and Carper talked about reinsurance,  something which has worked very well for the first 3 years of the  Affordable Care Act, and the reason it doesn't work now is because they  have stopped. That is why we are seeing some of these rate increases.   We can address the uncertainty by being clear that we are not going  to repeal the Affordable Care Act, by addressing those cost-sharing  reduction payments. The ACA already stipulates that CSR--those payments  which reduce the costs of copays and deductibles--are to be made  pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 1324.   My bill provides for payments to be made jointly from a permanent  appropriation rather than subject to the year-to-year whims of the  annual appropriations process. The Marketplace Certainty Act removes  all bases for any further questions about what is already clear from a  fair reading of the Affordable Care Act as a whole; that both those CSR  payments and the advanced premium tax credit subsidies are to be funded  from the same permanent appropriation.   I see my colleague from Texas on the floor, and I am sure he is going  to object to the unanimous consent request I am going to be proposing  in a couple of minutes. He objected last Thursday when I asked for  unanimous consent to pass the Marketplace Certainty Act, and he  justified the objection by asserting that the cost-sharing reduction  payments are--I think he called it a bailout of the insurance  companies. That is an inflammatory term, and I think we ought to be  careful with how we use it because the truth is, the cost-sharing  reduction payments are in no way, shape, or form a bailout. They are  orderly payments built into the law to go directly to keep premiums,  copays, and deductibles affordable for lower income Americans. In fact,  those same payments were included in the bill Majority Leader McConnell  just said he is not going to go forward with, the Republican bill. It  included those very same cost-sharing reduction payments. I think they  were included because there was a recognition that these are important  to help address the cost of healthcare for all Americans.   As I said earlier, we have had statements by the chairman of the  Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, Lamar Alexander,  talking about that these payments should be continued. We have heard  from House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady, who said we need to  continue these payments to help stabilize the insurance market. It is  the uncertainty that is causing the current problem, and we could  address that today--this week--if people were willing to work together.   As Democrats, we have come to the floor to say we want to work  together. We think we can address the challenges we face with the  Affordable Care Act. We can do it in a bipartisan way. I know we can  because Tim Scott and I have done it. We passed a bill several years  ago by unanimous consent, which basically gave States the ability to  control group size for people and for companies in the marketplaces so  I know it can be done, and I know we could do it today if there were a  willingness on the part of all of our colleagues to work together. That  is what the American people want. They don't want 32 million people  thrown off their health insurance. We don't want rural hospitals to  close in New Hampshire. We don't want nursing homes to close. We don't  want people to be thrown out of their nursing homes.   I was up in northern New Hampshire at a nursing home over the  weekend, where I talked to a group of women in their eighties and  older. One woman said to me: You know, I worked my whole life. I paid  my taxes. I did everything I was supposed to do. I sold my house so I  could get into this nursing home so I could qualify under Medicaid. I  got rid of all my assets. Now they are telling me I am going to get  thrown out? She said: What would I do? I have no place to go. I have no  family to help me.   People don't want that. What they want is for us to work together, to  help fix healthcare so people can get what they need when they need it.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions be discharged from further consideration  of S. 1462; that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration;  that the bill be considered read a third time and passed, and the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I am disappointed but not surprised that  my colleague has objected. I don't believe he objected because of the  effort to help pay these subsidies, which are passthroughs to insurance  companies.   Reforming how we do those, I am certainly happy to sit down and talk  about that, but the fact is, that is not the issue right now. The issue  is, this is a way we could address the current uncertainty in the  marketplaces in a way that will be good for maintaining stability of  healthcare for all Americans. I am disappointed there isn't a  willingness to work together to do that.   I hope, as this debate continues, we will finally see people come  together to get something done to address, not just healthcare for  Americans but to address the one-sixth of the economy that depends on  the healthcare industry.   I yield the floor.
