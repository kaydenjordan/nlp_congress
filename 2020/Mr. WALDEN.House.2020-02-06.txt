 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this resolution. We wouldn't be  having what is going to be a spirited debate today over the facts if  the Energy and Commerce Committee had bothered to have a hearing on the  underlying issue.   I have asked the chairman, my friend, Mr. Pallone, to do exactly  that. He cited a source, Kaiser Family Foundation, saying pregnant  women are going to be involved in all of this. The head of CMS and  their lawyers say: Not true. Not the case at all.   So here we have a disputed fact on the floor being hammered out here  without the benefit of due process and regular order. There has been no  regular order, no hearing, no opportunity to bring in these very  qualified people, and do what we do best in this Congress, which is  listen to the experts, take the testimony, make up our minds, and have  debates.   No. The administration put out their letter, their guidance, saying  here is how States can innovate. Our State of Oregon spent a lot on  innovation in this space. We were both in the State legislature at  times, and we sought waivers as a State so we could innovate, create  the Oregon Health Plan, and do all of these things. Forty States have  waivers. Most of our States have waivers so they can innovate; so they  can bring better healthcare to the working poor; and find cost savings  they can plow back into better services and more services, which is  what this underlying proposal allows.   Let me talk about a couple of things: One, there is no mandate here.  This is not, as my friend describes, some evil-empire approach where  the Trump administration is forcing something on States. That is  factually not the case. This is States seeking an option to innovate  and provide better healthcare at lower costs to the people they are  trying to serve.   They would have to meet rigorous standards, including all of the  essential health benefits required under ObamaCare. That is a  requirement here. They can't walk away from that.   This applies to able-bodied adults, not to children, not to people  with disabilities, on down that list of mandatory populations. This  does not affect the mandatory. This is only the expansion population in  the States that expanded Medicaid.   They are going to argue differently because I heard it in the Rules  Committee. I can tell you directly from CMS, that is not the case. That  is not their intent. That is not what they have suggested. That is not  in their proposal.   If we are going to have this difference of opinion, I go back to the  underlying issue here. Why in the devil did we not take an hour or two  to do regular order and have the Subcommittee on Health, chaired by my  dear friend from California, Ms. Eshoo, who could have done a great job  having a hearing? She can be rigorous on the administration. We could  have hashed this out there. But no.   This isn't even a resolution of disapproval that stops what the  administration is proposing. This is the partisan equivalent of a press  release. It is a sense of Congress saying: We don't like this.   So when we are done with that, then what happens? Nothing. This is a  partisan, political, pathetic debate that serves no real legislative  purpose. Done.   If you want to argue legislation, the grownup work we do so well at  Energy and Commerce, then let's have a legislative hearing. Let's bring  in the Kaiser Family Foundation that was just cited and hold them  accountable under oath to show us where what they claim is fact. We can  dispute whether something is legal or not. Let's have the lawyers there  to give us guidance. But that is not what we are doing.   On Monday afternoon, this language got posted. We went to the Rules  Committee. We asked for an opportunity to have an alternative, a motion  to recommit on this issue. We were denied that. We had no opportunity  to dig into the facts and the figures.   We do know one thing: Our States are great laboratories for  innovation. They really are. California has waivers. Oregon has  waivers. A lot of States have waivers. We had it back in the day when,  I think, Project Independence was a waiver from Medicaid because we  thought we could do it better and be a laboratory.   This administration believes in that. States can, those closest to  the people can create even better programs to take care of those they  serve. This is a Federal-State partnership.   Mr. Speaker, I object to this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to House Resolution 826; a  resolution hastily put together that opposes the Administration's  Healthy Opportunity demonstration initiative in Medicaid.   The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services introduced a voluntary  proposal to allow states to file for an 1115 Waiver called the Healthy  Adult Opportunity Initiative. This is an option; let me emphasize, an  option, for states for certain able-bodied adults-only.   This optional Healthy Adult Opportunity Initiative does not apply to  children, seniors, or those with disabilities--just able-bodied adults.  It is a prepackaged set of flexibilities, most of which are already  used by states in running their programs.   There are many provisions in this proposal that we can all get  behind: lowering drug costs, increasing transparency, and greater  access to health care. These proposals build on bipartisan legislation  we've worked on in the past.   Administrator Verma released a 56-page letter for the demonstration  initiative on January 30th. Industry groups were already voicing  opposition to the initiative only an hour later--pretty quick to read  it and write an opposition to it if you ask me. House members were  faster than that.   The day before the plan was released, 36 House members sent a letter  to Secretary Azar and Administrator Verma opposing the initiative. How  can you oppose something you haven't even seen?   The resolution says that the goal of the Waiver Opportunity is to  deprive Medicaid beneficiaries of health services. But on Page 7, CMS  points out that any state electing to participate in this demonstration  initiative will be expected, at a minimum, to provide coverage of items  and services in the categories of the ACA's Essential Health Benefits  (EHBs), benefits such as (1) ambulatory patient services; (2) emergency  services; (3) hospitalization; (4) maternity and newborn care; (5)  mental health and substance use disorder services, including behavioral  health treatment; (6) prescription drugs; (7) rehabilitative and  habilitative services and devices; (8) laboratory services; (9)  preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management; and  (10) pediatric services, including oral and vision care, which  generally are not applicable for the populations that would be covered  under any state that participates in the Waiver Opportunity.   The resolution also asserts the initiative would roll back access  standards. But on Page 4, CMS expressly states that those who  participate in the demonstration will be monitored to ensure health  outcomes are achieved.   This resolution is just another case of Democrats putting partisan  political rhetoric in the way of facts and meaningful health reform.   The Healthy Adult Opportunity--if states choose to participate in  it--will not give states the ability to cap beneficiary enrollment or  cut benefits. CMS is putting an expenditure cap on the waiver should a  state choose to take this option, but expenditure caps are fairly  common in health programs.   For example, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and many  section 1115 Medicaid demonstrations (of which more than 40 states  currently participate voluntarily) already operate under a funding  ceiling.   I want to point out that while total federal funding will be capped,  the waiver does not change the need for states to submit claims  reflecting actual expenditures to obtain federal matching funds for the  Medicaid program and to maintain health outcomes as under current law.  Again, states will not be allowed to cap  [[Page H872]]  enrollment and qualify for the statutory enhanced federal match rate  for this expansion population.   Finally, to the extent a State achieves savings and demonstrate no  declines in access or quality, CMS will share back a portion of the  federal savings for reinvestment into Medicaid. Perhaps, this sort of  shared responsibility and incentives could help the people the Medicaid  program is intended to serve.   Now, to be clear, I agree this is a major proposal, one that needs to  be examined carefully. To that end, let's have a committee hearing at  Energy and Commerce, the Committee with jurisdiction over Medicaid,  where we can hear from stakeholders as well as the Administration and  walk through the facts of the Waiver Opportunity. Instead of a hurried  disapproval resolution that bypassed the Committee process, let's do  the work at the Committee level to examine this proposal carefully.   When I was Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, we were  committed to a process of regular order, allowing for enough time to  have meaningful debate and examination of the issues that came before  our committee.   House Democrats said they are just as committed to regular order, yet  time and time again, we come to the House floor to debate bills or  resolution with no committee process and always for partisan political  theatre.   Instead of this resolution, we should be voting to end surprise  billing. We should be debating how to avoid the Part D catastrophic  cliff Obamacare created. We should be considering bipartisan  legislation to lower drug prices.   This is another episode of House Democrats putting politics over  progress.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Latta).    Mr. Speaker, I have to just respond in that none of that  is what is in this resolution because this resolution has no force of  law. This resolution is not healthcare policy; it is a press statement.  It does nothing to deal with any of the issues my dear friend has just  raised, other than make a statement.   Do you want to legislate? Then legislate. Let's go have a hearing.  Let's go have a markup. Let's go work on these issues together.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Burgess). The good doctor is the former chairman of the Health  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, once again, I just point out the State  Governor would have to seek a waiver and get approval to maintain all  the essential benefits of the Affordable Care Act in everything they  do. This only applies in States that took the expansion, not others.  States are the great laboratories that innovate and deliver healthcare  better for the working poor.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington  (Mrs. Rodgers).    Mr. Speaker, could I inquire as to how much time each  side has remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Mitchell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I just point out that, again, this is a State option. Nobody is  mandating anything on any State. States can come to the Federal  Government, as they willfully do, and say: We have a better idea to  take care of the working poor. We think we can achieve some savings  that we understand. If we do, we will be plowed back into more benefits  and services in some large measure to improve and expand Medicaid in  our State.   Mr. Speaker, our States have done that. As you know, others are. This  is an option. It is not a mandate.   Finally, the resolution on the floor today has no legal effect on any  of this. It is a press release called a resolution. It never even goes  to the Senate. It will never go to the President. It will never become  a law. It is just a press statement.   Mr. Speaker, so for all the comments about stopping this and stopping  that, you do that with legislation. That is why we have said you ought  to have a hearing in the committee of jurisdiction. If you want to mark  up a bill, let's go do that. Let's have witnesses. Let's do what we do  best around here. But we are not doing this.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Carter), Congress' pharmacist.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I was going to raise that point.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   May I say, the proposal before us today has no force of law. There is  a lot of heated rhetoric, yes. There is a lot of fire and brimstone,  yes. There are even words that probably could have been taken down. But  the resolution before us is nothing more than a partisan political  press release.   So for all of the comments, you could legislate, but you are not. You  could actually have the force of law.   Now, let's get to the underlying issue. All these attacks on the  President say the President is doing this, the President is doing this,  that, and the other thing, when, in fact, that is not what is happening  here. The President is giving States the opportunity to do a better job  of providing healthcare to their citizens.   Nothing in this waiver process that exists today in statute or exists  tomorrow under this proposal that the administration has put forward is  allowed to adversely affect people on disabilities or pregnant women or  children. This goes to the expanded adult population, where they can  then innovate.   Our State, Mr. Speaker, as you know, is seeking a waiver to be able  to expand substance abuse disorder treatment. That would be allowed  under this. States like California could come to the administration  under this authority and say we would like to expand our Medicaid  program to include more services for people who need mental health, so  mental health and substance abuse disorders.   Mr. Speaker, earlier in the debate, my colleague from Washington  State talked about the backlog for people on disabilities who can't get  access to Medicaid. So what is wrong with a State saying: We can do it  better; we can do it more efficiently; we can save money; and we can  plow the savings back into expanded coverage?  [[Page H876]]    By the way, Mr. Speaker, Oregon has been a leader in this sort of  effort with our CCOs, our Coordinated Care Organizations, where they  have done precisely this. They do wraparound services. They take the  most vulnerable and people in need in our communities and say: Let's  all get together and take care of this patient. In doing so, the  savings, in large measure, go back into expanded services.   So, for all the doomsday talk I hear on the floor, Mr. Speaker, let's  get to the facts of the matter. The facts of the matter are nobody is  being forced to do a block grant; nobody is being forced to do cap and  a gap.   What we are saying is: States, let's be thoughtful about this. Come  to Washington. Here are some things we know work elsewhere, and you can  do it in your State and save money and probably provide more benefits  and maybe save a little for the taxpayers and improve the quality of  the healthcare for the people you are overseeing.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, Michigan doesn't have to apply for another waiver.  Nobody is going to force anything like we just heard on Michigan. That  is not the proposal from the administration, and nothing in this  resolution stops anything anyway.   In fact, I would argue, Michigan probably came to an administration  to get exactly an 1115 waiver to do everything my friend and colleague  just said they are doing in Michigan, just like Oregon had to come back  and get waivers to do what we are doing.   All this administration is doing is saying: Let's make that waiver  process a little easier, but you have to make sure you are continuing  to provide the best care possible to the people you serve.   And once again, despite what we have heard on the floor today,  nothing in their proposal would apply to the categories we have been  discussing: the mandatory, the legacy population. That is not what is  there.   That is why, Mr. Speaker, it would have been so much better to have a  real hearing in the Energy and Commerce Committee where we could have  had a real discussion with real experts there to get us all on the same  basis of fact. It is unfortunate we don't have that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, my friend from North Carolina, I would just  say, through the Chair, that Oregon is an expansion State. So you are  right. We have seen the benefits of this in my State. We have seen the  benefit of flexibility. We have sought waivers and gotten them to do  exactly the sorts of things you are saying.   And, ironically, under the proposal of the administration, North  Carolina could use this authority to expand its Medicaid population.  That is allowed under the proposal from the administration out to the  States. They can actually use these tools and do exactly what the  gentleman is saying: expand the population in North Carolina.   So there are good thing things in here.   Mr. Speaker, I am not going to get into the legal debate. I am not a  lawyer. I am not burdened with a law degree. But I would argue that, if  we had this discussion in our committee we love so much, maybe we would  have a better outcome here.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the amount of time each  side has.    Mr. Speaker, I don't believe we have any more, but I  still have 8 minutes, so I am going to share a few comments.   Mr. Speaker, I want to say a couple of things.   When I chaired the Energy and Commerce Committee, we did try to do  some reforms on healthcare, certainly, and there was a big  disagreement, but we also extended funding for community health  centers, the biggest increase they had ever gotten, 2 years fully  funded.   The chairman and I both are supportive of a 5-year extension of fully  funding community health centers going forward. In my State, I think we  had 63 different places people got healthcare in my district, and 122-- well, a lot of people in Oregon go through community health centers.    As chairman, I led the effort in this Congress the last session to  fully fund a 10-year expansion of the Children's Health Insurance  Program. That is the biggest expansion, I think, in modern legislative  history, probably.   Many Democrats voted against it when I tried to get it extended for 4  years, and then a lot of Democrats voted against it when it was 6, and  then eventually we got to 10--unprecedented. We got that into law. We  eventually came together and we got that into law.   We have done a lot of work on special diabetes program funding and a  special program for those with diabetes in our Native American  community.   One thing after another, in the last Congress, we accomplished in a  bipartisan way.   The work we did on opioids together as a Congress, you were a very  important part of that, Mr. Chairman, on a proposal that we passed in  the House. Unfortunately, we fell a little short in the Senate to get  better communication among providers.   We put real money behind that, billions of dollars into our States  and communities; and that help is starting to show up with expanded  access--I think it is a 38 percent increase in access--to the kind of  services, health services, people dealing with addiction need.   And, as a result of our work, I would say, in public education and  other work, we saw, finally, a topping off in the overdose deaths.   Now, there is more work to do there.                                time  1530    This proposal, the underlying proposal the administration has put  forward, I would argue, builds on the notion of local, State, Federal  partnership to serve the same people. We would give States more  authority to manage their Medicaid programs more efficiently and  effectively. Savings would be put back into the Medicaid program in  large measure.   Now, my friend from New Jersey, not the chairman, but the predecessor  speaker here, talked about ripping away healthcare. Ironically, it is  the socialist left that wants to take away all Americans' healthcare  and have the Federal Government run it. That would be Medicare,  Medicaid, Medicare Advantage, veterans' healthcare in there, Medicare  for all proposals that would, I think, bankrupt the Federal Government.   But it would rip away all the health insurance products out there and  make them illegal. So if you liked your health insurance, you could say  good-bye to it. And some of these same people that can't count votes in  Iowa want to run your insurance in America, and I don't think that is  really a good thing.   So we stand here today opposing this resolution. We stand here today  saying, the resolution does nothing anyway, other than make a  statement. Do you want to legislate?   We can be partners, as we were on community health centers, as we  were on opioids, as we were on children's health insurance, as we were  on a lot of things; but let's go back to work where it belongs, in the  committee.   Mr. Speaker, I would just ask my colleagues, vote against this  resolution. Then let's get back to work on the real policy in the place  where policy is done best. And with all due respect to those on the  Ways and Means Committee, that would be the Energy and Commerce  Committee. That is one thing we agree on in a bipartisan way.   We can do our work there. We can get this right. Mr. Speaker, I ask  for a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
