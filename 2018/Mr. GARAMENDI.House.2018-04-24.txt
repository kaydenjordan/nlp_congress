 Mr. Speaker, it is good to be back here on the floor  to talk about a good deal, a better deal, and a raw deal. But before I  get into a discussion about how we can move this Nation forward and how  our colleagues on the other side are really taking us in the wrong  direction, I want to put this up for us to take a look at.   I suspect I caught your attention having it upside down. I did that  on purpose.   I often start these discussions with this. It is from FDR, one of his  great speeches. He said: ``The test of our progress is not whether we  add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we  provide enough for those who have too little.''   I keep coming to this because it is a statement of values. It is a  statement of direction. It is a statement of what I believe we should  be doing as Members of Congress and as leaders of this Nation.   ``The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the  abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for  those who have too little.''   My Democratic colleagues and I take this to heart, and we try to  structure our policies, our programs, and the direction in which we  want our country to go along this line, to make sure that those in our  Nation, those in our community, those in our States, and even within  our families, that they have enough--enough of the wealth of this  Nation so that they can enjoy the fruits of their work, so that as they  labor that 8 hours or 10 hours or 12 hours a day that they put in, it  provides them with enough income so that they can have what we learned  from our Founding Fathers: happiness.   That is not where we are today. That is not what is happening today.  Yes, the economy is moving. Yes, the unemployment rate is down. But  this Congress has just passed a monumental tax scam back in December,  presumably to grow the economy, and when you look at that, it is not a  better deal, which is what we Democrats want for America. We want a  better deal, one in which healthcare costs come under control, where  prescription drugs can be available, where we have a real  infrastructure program that actually will build the sanitation systems,  the water systems, dealing with those communities like those in  Michigan that have contaminated water and those in my State of  California where the wells go dry--and if they are not dry, those wells  are contaminated.                                time  1945    We want a better deal for America so that the minimum wage actually  provides sufficient income so that a family cannot only survive, but be  able to pay the rent, be able to educate their kids, be able to put  food on the table, and maybe even have a vacation.   We want a better deal for America. We want a country that is  internationally competitive. We want a better deal for America's  mariners, not where the maritime industry continues to decline as it  has for the last 20, 30 years, but rather where it is built up.   Legislation such as I proposed that would require that a certain  percentage, a small percentage, of the natural gas, one of our vital  natural resources; and our oil, another vital natural resource, that it  be shipped overseas on American ships with American sailors, who can  continue to provide the necessary support for our military so that our  shipyards can build those LNG container ships as well as the oil ships.   We want a better deal for America. That is what we are here for.  There are so many things. How about an education? Why should it be that  here in America the Federal Government provides student loans, not at  the lowest possible interest rate, which would be the borrowing rate  for the Federal Government plus maybe one-half of a percent for  administrative purposes, but oh, no, our Federal Government charges  maybe twice as much as what the Federal Government could actually  borrow money for. So the markup is like 100 percent.   That is a raw deal for America. And we tried to change that with  policy changes that would allow for the refinancing of student loans.  We want a better deal for those students as they come out of school,  not burdened by heavy debt, but, rather, able to start a family, buy a  car, buy a home, start a small business. But oh, no, somehow our  Republican colleagues won't consider refinancing student loans.  Americans are able to refinance their homes, but not their student  loans. Something is wrong here. We want a better deal for America.  There are so many policies.   We want a strong, capable military, but we also want a smart  military. We want a government that will protect us from cyber hacking.  Look what has happened to America. We basically have allowed the  Russians to hack into our energy systems, into our power grids. That is  not a good deal for America. So where is the Federal Government  stopping that? What action has the President taken to protect our  electorate, to protect our policies?   There is one raw deal after another--when we offer a better deal, an  active Federal Government that will protect us in cybersecurity. That  is what we want. We can't get it. We can't do that now because our  Republican colleagues are controlling the House. What they offered us  was a tax scam that is leading to one raw deal after another raw deal.   Let's understand exactly what has happened here with this tax policy.  Perhaps we could see it best here. In the tax scam, the GOP gives to  the rich and makes every other American pay for it. They do it in just  three easy steps.   First of all, they cut taxes for the rich. I don't know what you have  heard about this tax deal that passed with great fanfare just before  Christmas and the President went down to Mar-a-Lago just after he  signed it. He talked to all of his rich buddies and said: I have made  you so much more wealthy. Indeed, he did--$1.5 trillion-plus, plus more  than that. Tax cuts, who got them? Eighty-three percent of all of that  money went to American corporations and to the top 1 percent--$1  trillion and more. It is a raw deal for Americans--a tax scam of  unprecedented proportions, foisted upon the American public as though  somehow it would be good for them. That is step one.   They said this tax bill will pay for itself. The essence of trickle- down economics is what it was. And so what is the next thing that  happens? Well, when they passed this bill, there wasn't a deficit hawk  to be found on the Republican side of this House. Not one word did I  hear from the deficit hawks as they ramped through this tax scam  without one public hearing here in the House of Representatives. No  accountant came in, no tax lawyer came in on a public hearing. Slam,  bang, done. It was done--done in for Americans.   Oh, the deficit hawks weren't exterminated. They are not an  endangered species. They just simply migrated out of town. Guess what?  They are back. The deficit hawks are back, and they are back with a  vengeance. They are back with a plan that will rip the guts out of  programs that Americans depend upon: Social Security,  [[Page H3498]]  Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps. Oh, yes, they are back, because they  exploded the deficit.   They exploded the deficit. We will have close to a $1 trillion  deficit this year. It started at $440 billion before the great tax scam  and now added on to it. Next year--let's just take a look.   People say: Oh, you are just a politician. You are just up here  talking. Here is some real news, not fake news. Real news. And this  comes from--well, let's see, ``Republican tax cuts to fuel historic  deficits: CBO,'' reported by Reuters, April, 2018.   ``Deficit to top $1 trillion per year by 2020, CBO says,'' reported  in The Washington Post, April 9, 2018.   ``CBO: GOP policies add nearly $1.6 trillion to deficit,'' Axios,  April 9, 2018.   Here is one in The Wall Street Journal: ``. . . wider than previously  expected budget deficits and a mostly temporary spurt in economic  growth.'' Real news, not fake news.   So the deficit has exploded and so the deficit hawks return to town,  and what do they want? Well, now they demand big cuts--big, beautiful  cuts to: Medicare, nearly $1 trillion; Social Security, half a  trillion; education; Medicaid. That is what the deficit hawks want  because they have come to understand that their big, beautiful tax scam  really is sending this country into a huge deficit for years to come.   So here is what they propose to do: Republicans will cut Social  Security, Medicare, and Medicaid to pay for their tax scam. Says who?  Says the Speaker of the House. ``Ryan says Republicans to target  welfare, Medicare, Medicaid spending in 2018,'' his words reported in  The Washington Post, December 6, 2017.    ``Top Republicans are already talking about cutting Medicare and  Social Security next,'' reported by Vox news, December 20, 2017.   ``House GOP Budget Plan Cuts Medicare and Social Security,'' The  Atlantic.   ``Trump Proposes to Cut Medicare and Spend Big on Wall, Defense''-- his budget. You heard some of my colleagues talk about this earlier.   So what did the tax scam bring us? A raw deal--a raw deal for  millions upon millions of Americans.   We want to do it better. We want a better deal for Americans. We can  control prescription drugs if we had the votes. We could allow the  Federal Government to negotiate prices for drugs given to or provided  for Medicare recipients, Medicaid recipients, and others. We could do  it. It is a simple law.   We can do an expansion. We can maintain the expansion of the  Affordable Care Act so that some 16 million, 18 million Americans could  stay on Medicaid around the country. In California, 3.5 million  Americans are potentially going to lose their healthcare insurance if  the Republicans have their way with Medicaid cuts.   That is a lot of people. That is a lot of families that are not going  to have insurance. The majority of children now born in California and  in many other States are on Medicaid. We call it Medi-Cal in  California. So what of them? What of those children? What kind of a  healthy start will they have?   Speaking of Healthy Start, it was one of the programs that the  President proposed be cut. What sense does that make? All so that the  tax scam can give $1.5 trillion to American corporations and to the 1  percent. Trickle-down economics--oh, they said it works. Really? They  say it works. Does it really work?   Well, let's take an example. I talked a moment ago about drugs. The  most expensive illnesses in this Nation are dementia and Alzheimer's.  One dollar out of every $5 spent by Medicare today is spent for that.  And as the baby boomer population grows and a percentage of our  population grows into their later years, Alzheimer's is going to bust  the bank.   One of the great American drug companies, Pfizer, had a major  Alzheimer's research program underway to look for that miracle drug to  understand what Alzheimer's is all about, how the brain works or  doesn't work. So they received a $3 billion or $4 billion tax reduction  in the GOP tax scam. They immediately turned around, terminated the  Alzheimer's research program that they were conducting, and spent the  money on stock buybacks and increased dividends.   Do you know what that does? A stock buyback will increase the price  per share because there are fewer shares outstanding. Do you know who  benefits? You got it: the corporation executives, because their pay is  based upon an increase in the value of the stock--not in more and  better drugs, not in hiring more people, not in more research, but only  by manipulating the price of the stock earnings per share.   That is what the tax scam did, and it is repeated all across this  country. Oh, I know, they promised a one-time bonus, not an increase  over the years in the salaries and the wages paid to workers, but a  one-time bonus. Less than 13 percent of the reduced tax benefit to  corporations has gone to pay for salaries and wages.                                time  2000    That is what the tax scam did. It is the ultimate trickle down. The  Democrats want a better deal for America. We have had enough raw deals.  We know that there is a possibility should our proposals on  infrastructure be taken seriously by our Republican majority: programs  such as Peter DeFazio's A Penny for Progress, with serious  infrastructure, over time putting 16 million people to work; programs  such as I proposed dealing with the export of natural gas and oil and  that it be on American ships--not all of it, just a small percentage of  it. We could build 50 to 100 ships and put mariners to work and, at the  same time, provide the necessary ocean transport for our military.   We need real Make It In America policies, not something soft and  fluffy, but real, strong Make It In America policies, so if we are  going to spend your taxpayer dollars, those taxpayer dollars would be  spent on goods and services made in America.   How many years have I been talking about Make It In America policies?   Through our efforts, we were able to increase, a little bit, the  percentage of made in America for the highway dollars. We are not where  we ought to be. We ought to bump that up to 80, 90, 100 percent so that  we can really manufacture once again in America.   All the talk of the President doesn't deal with this unless you write  a law that says your tax dollars will be spent on American-made  equipment and services, not on stuff imported from China. No.   We are going to continue to push the Make It In America policy as one  of the elements of a better deal, a real deal, and not a raw deal. You  are going to hear a lot about this in the days to come. You will hear a  lot about this in the days to come because we believe Franklin Delano  Roosevelt when he said the test of our progress is not when we add more  to the abundance of those who have much.   The test of progress is an F grade given to the President and to the  GOP, to my Republican colleagues, when they passed the great tax scam  of 2017 and gave a trillion dollars-plus to the superwealthy, to the  Wall Street bankers, and to America's big, wealthy corporations that  had so much gas they didn't know what to do with it before there was a  tax cut. So they give it back to Wall Street.   The test of our progress is not when we add more to the abundance of  those who have much--and here is where we are as Democrats--it is  whether we provide enough. It is for those young mothers out there who  need maternity care and who will deliver a baby on the Medicaid  programs across this Nation. Those are the people we care about.   We want young men and women to have a good education. I am sure the  superwealthy can take care of themselves. They don't need a Pell grant.  They don't need more. But I will tell you that a child who, let's say,  is 16, 17, ready to go to college and his father is earning a minimum  wage, there is no way that family can support that kid in college. He  will take out a loan and the Federal Government will rip him off with  an interest rate twice what the Federal Government can borrow money  for.   The test of our progress is what we do for those who have too little.  That is our mantra. That is how we see a better deal for Americans. FDR  was right. We will work to see that it happens in America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H3499]]                                ____________________
