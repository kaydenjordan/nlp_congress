 Mr. Speaker, this week is National Gun Violence  Survivors Awareness Week.   A decade ago, in this spot, I gave my first speech in the House about  the epidemic of gun violence in our Nation. I could not then have  imagined two things: First, that Congress would fail to take  significant action to address gun violence in our Nation; and second,  that mass shootings would continue to grow as an epidemic. Last year  alone, there were 647 mass shootings in our country, including in my  community of Highland Park.   For all the hundreds of communities that are affected and part of  this tragic union from the devastation of gun violence, the effects are  permanent.   Seven months ago, in my community, at 10:14 a.m. on July 4 at the  Independence Day parade in Highland Park, a monster with an assault  rifle climbed a ladder and fired 83 bullets in less than a minute into  the festive crowd below. He murdered seven wonderful people, wounded  dozens more, and traumatized an entire community.   The devastation and damage to a human body from these weapons are  inconceivable. We have to address gun violence. We have to pass an  assault weapons ban that was introduced this week. I call on our  communities to act.                            ____________________
