 Madam Speaker, recently, Speaker McCarthy stated that if  the Department of Justice can prosecute Donald Trump, then ``they can  do that to any American.''   Speaker McCarthy is absolutely correct. If the Department of Justice  can prosecute Donald Trump for unlawfully retaining top secret,  classified documents that put American lives at risk and sharing those  documents with random people, then yes, the Department of Justice can  prosecute you for unlawfully retaining top secret, classified documents  and sharing them with random people, because you are not above the law  and neither is Donald Trump.
