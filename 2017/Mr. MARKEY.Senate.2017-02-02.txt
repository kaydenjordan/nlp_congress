 Madam President, I thank the Senator from Washington  State for her tremendous leadership on all of these environmental  issues, which are now on the table in our  [[Page S620]]  country for the first time in a generation.                         Tribute to Bill Bonnavillian    Before I turn to the resolution the Senate is debating, I want to  take a minute to recognize the contributions of Bill Bonnavillian to  advancing America's science and technology policy. Last month, Bill  stepped down as the head of the Washington office of the Massachusetts  Institute of Technology after 11 years.   Bill's leadership of the office continued MIT's historic role of  providing a vision for advancing science policy and ensuring that  knowledge generated at MIT was relevant and available for policymakers  in Washington, DC. His leadership will be missed at the MIT Washington  office, but I am glad to know he will be staying engaged with the MIT  community. I hope he will continue to provide guidance to this body  since now, more than ever, we need science to inform the decisions we  are making on the Senate floor.   Today, Madam President, congressional Republicans are beginning the  process of going one by one to overturn commonsense rules that have  long been opposed by the oil and gas, coal, and other industries in the  United States of America. The majority is trying to undo these rules by  deploying a rarely used procedural tool known as the Congressional  Review Act.   In fact, the majority is talking about using the Congressional Review  Act, or CRA, so often that it could actually get hard to keep track of  which industry is benefitting from week to week to week from the  Republicans' use of the CRA. I brought down a helpful tool so the  viewers at home can keep track of which industries are benefitting each  week from Republicans using the CRA to roll back protections for public  health, for clean air, for clean water, for clean soil, for the health  of the families in our country.   So let's consult our wheel to see who is the big winner of the GOP  giveaway this week.   Up first are the mining and the coal industries. They are the first  big winners of the GOP Congressional Review Act wheel of giveaways.  That is right. First up for repeal by the Republican Congress are  public health protections against the toxic practice of mountaintop  removal coal mining.   These protections were put in place by the Obama administration  because a Bush-era rule was thrown out by the courts. These commonsense  rules to monitor and ultimately restore streams impacted by coal mining  are despised by the coal industry. Those that created the problem  despise any rules that would require remedying the problem, as it  affected public health--no surprise.   Mountaintop removal mining is one of the most environmentally  destructive practices on Earth. Mountains are turned into barren  plateaus. Streams in the bottoms of nearby valleys are filled with  debris and buried. Heavy metals destroy water quality for nearby  residents and ruin ecosystems.   The rule that the Republicans are attempting to repeal today protects  the public health and drinking water of millions of American citizens  in Appalachia and elsewhere across our country.   The rule requires that lead, arsenic, selenium, and other toxic  pollutants are monitored. It requires that streams that are damaged or  destroyed must be restored.   Now, the majority likes to say that there is a war on coal, but the  only war that coal is losing is in the free market to natural gas, to  wind, to solar. These are the sources of electricity that the utilities  of our country, that the citizens of our country have been moving to  over the last 10 to 15 years. There is a war going on in the  marketplace.   Adam Smith is spinning in his grave as he listens to the Republicans  trying to protect an industry from market forces. Adam Smith is  actually spinning so fast in his grave that he could qualify as a new  energy source for our country. That is how shocked he would be about  this attempt to undermine the public health and safety in our country  on behalf of an industry that is losing a battle in the marketplace.   It is the free market that ultimately is causing these changes, and  the coal industry is saying: Please protect us from having to protect  the public health and safety--clean air, clean water. Please protect us  from having to protect families affected by our industries.   A few years ago, we generated roughly 50 percent of our electricity  from coal. Now it is down to 30 percent of all electricity generated in  our country from coal--50 percent to 30 percent of all electricity in a  handful of years.   Coal has been replaced in the free market by natural gas, which has  grown from a little over 20 percent of U.S. electricity generation a  decade ago to 35 percent today. That is coal's big problem--natural  gas, another fossil fuel, but one that emits one-half of the greenhouse  gas pollutants as does coal.   Coal has also been replaced by clean energy, by wind, especially,  which has grown by 5 to 6 percent of our generation, and by solar,  which is now 1 percent of our generation.   In other words, if you go back to 2005 and you look at our country,  natural gas was a relatively small percentage of electrical generation,  and so were wind and solar. As we debate this issue here today, wind  and solar are now up to 7 percent of all electricity generated in our  country, up from 1 percent just a little bit more than 10 years ago. It  is growing so fast as a preference for American industry, American  utilities, and American homes, that it poses a marketplace threat.   So what we need to do now, finally, is to have the big debate out  here as to what are the implications for public health and safety and  what do we have to do in order to maintain the high standards that we  have created for the protection of families over the last generation.   Last year, electricity generation from natural gas surpassed that  from coal for the first time since 1949, when data collection began.  Why? To quote the Department of Energy:         The recent decline in the generation share of coal, and the       rise in the share of natural gas, was a market-driven       response to lower natural gas prices that have made natural       gas generation more economically attractive.        Between 2000 and 2008, coal was significantly less       expensive than natural gas. However, beginning in 2009, large       amounts of natural gas produced from shale formations changed       the balance.    While the cost of coal has risen by 10 percent since 2008, the cost  of natural gas has fallen by more than 60 percent. For a power producer  considering new generation capacity, the lifetime cost of electricity  from a new coal-fired powerplant is 67 percent higher than from a new  natural gas powerplant and 17 percent than from a newly constructed  wind farm, according to the National Academy of Sciences.   The reason no one is building coal-fired powerplants is very clear:  It is the free market. Coal cannot compete in the free market. In 2016,  we added more than 14,000 new megawatts of solar. We are going to add 7  to 8,000 new megawatts of wind. We are going to add nearly 9,000 new  megawatts of natural gas, and we added virtually no new megawatts of  coal-fired generation in our country. We are projected to add no new  coal generation this year as well. It will be more natural gas, more  wind, and more solar.   The marketplace is rejecting coal as a source of electricity. The  marketplace is doing that. This isn't a conspiracy. It is competition  in the free market.   Lest my colleagues think that this is just happening in the United  States, it is not. More than half of all electrical generating capacity  added in the world last year was renewable.   Let me say that again. More than half of all new electrical  generating capacity added in the world last year was from renewable  energy--wind and solar--across the planet.   China recently announced that it intends to invest $360 billion on  renewable energy by 2020. They intend to create 13 million Chinese jobs  in renewable energy in that time.   This isn't a conspiracy. It is competition, and the competition for  those clean energy jobs is global.   When we started carrying iPhones, it wasn't a war on black rotary  dial phones; it was a technological revolution. When we started using  Macs and PCs, it wasn't a war on typewriters; it was a technological  revolution. The horseless carriage wasn't a war on horses; it was a  technological revolution that moved us to automobiles.   The move away from coal and oil toward clean energy and natural gas  isn't  [[Page S621]]  a war; it is a revolution--an American-made free market revolution.   We now have more than 400,000 Americans employed in the solar and  wind industries. By 2020, there are projected to be 600,000 Americans  working in these clean energy industries. It is not a war. It is a  revolution.   Now, next there is going to be another industry to win in the CRA,  the Congressional Review Act giveaway game. That is right. The next  winner will be the oil and gas industries.   Republicans intend to move to overturn a bipartisan requirement under  the Dodd-Frank bill that publicly traded oil, gas, and mining companies  disclose to their investors when they make payments to foreign  countries, but that requirement is vigorously opposed by ExxonMobil,  the American Petroleum Institute, and the oil and gas industry.   Section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer  Protection Act was a bipartisan provision authored by Senators Cardin  and Lugar. It requires oil, gas, and mining companies to disclose  payments to foreign governments, and that is now in jeopardy.   The Dodd-Frank disclosure rule goes to the core of the Securities and  Exchange Commission's mission of investor protection. Secret payments  can easily be expropriated by corrupt governments. They can also be a  signal that a company is involved in risky business overseas--risks  that investors need to know about when making investments.   By eliminating this disclosure requirement, using the Congressional  Review Act, we are potentially allowing for oil companies to make  secret, undisclosed payments to foreign governments. Those could  include payments intended to gain an advantage over other companies or  even bribes to foreign officials.   Eliminating this disclosure requirement could allow for oil companies  to make secret payments to foreign nations that could have serious  implications for these nations and for investors.   I urge my fellow Senators to reject these resolutions and keep in  place the commonsense protections for public health, clean water, and  financial disclosure.   Earlier today, the Republicans on the Environment and Public Works  Committee reported out the nomination of Oklahoma Attorney General  Pruitt.   Democrats on the committee have grave concerns about his ability to  uphold the EPA's mission to ``protect human health and the  environment.''   So what we are talking about here is the totality of a picture. The  use of the CRA to--one by one by one--go after these environmental  protections that have been put in place to increase the health of  Americans, to reduce their exposure to arsenic, to lead, and to other  dangerous chemicals. This first one that we are debating goes right to  the heart of that issue. What the coal industry is doing is using the  justification of their need to be competitive with the natural gas,  wind, and solar industries, a battle they are losing in the financial  marketplace, as a justification for undermining the public health of  our country so they can be more competitive.   In other words, the price to be paid to make the coal industry more  competitive with other industries to which they are losing market share  in the electrical generation market is that the public health has to be  compromised and we have to turn a blind eye to the impact on the  children and the families in our country who are being exposed to these  dangerous chemicals.   That is the price we have to pay as a nation? It is unacceptably  high.   So Adam Smith looks on, and Adam Smith judges us here today.   This marketplace defeat of coal by natural gas, wind, and solar is  one that is being used to hurt children and hurt families in our  country. I do not think it is an acceptable position for our Nation to  take. I urge a rejection of that motion.   I yield back to the leader of this effort on the Senate floor, the  great Senator from Washington.
