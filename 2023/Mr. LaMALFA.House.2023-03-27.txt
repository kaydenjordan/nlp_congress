 Mr. Speaker, American families are faced with  historically high inflation and energy prices.   Energy demand is expected to increase by 50 percent by 2050. Gas and  oil needs will increase, and they will be met whether it is in this  country or other countries around the world that haven't gone all- electric or aren't being forced into doing so.   America's needs for minerals necessary for the defense and tech  sectors are projected to grow exponentially.   To meet these crises, an all-of-the-above approach is needed for  American energy. Unfortunately, the NEPA permitting process hinders  American domestic energy expansion.   For example, it can take a decade to open a new mine in the U.S.,  while other countries such as Canada and Australia take only 3 years to  do the same. There is nothing new under the Sun on what needs to be  permitted. Get it done.   The NEPA permitting process is filled with repetitive assessments,  lengthy and expensive litigation, and bureaucratic hurdles. It is  almost impossible for new energy and infrastructure projects to ever  see the light of day, but I think they want it that way.   What? Are we supposed to all live in caves and eat mealworms? That  seems to be the direction we are going.                            ____________________
