 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules,  I call up House Resolution 409 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 409         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 3233) to       establish the National Commission to Investigate the January       6 Attack on the United States Capitol Complex, and for other       purposes. All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill and on any amendment thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Homeland Security or their       respective designees; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 3237) making       emergency supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year       ending September 30, 2021, and for other purposes. All points       of order against consideration of the bill are waived. The       bill shall be considered as read. All points of order against       provisions in the bill are waived. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on any       amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion       except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled       by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Appropriations or their respective designees; and (2) one       motion to recommit.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), my  friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Yesterday, the Committee on Rules met and reported a rule, House  Resolution 409. The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 3233 to  establish a National Commission to Investigate the January 6 Attack on  the United States Capitol Complex Act, under a closed rule.   The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by  the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Homeland  Security or their designees and provides one motion to recommit.   The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 3237, the Emergency  Security Supplemental to Respond to January 6 Appropriations Act, 2021,  under a closed rule.   The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by  the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Oversight and  Reform or their designees, and provides for one motion to recommit.   Madam Speaker, it has been 133 days since an angry mob of  insurrectionists tried to stop the certification of a free and fair  election in America. The question before us today is this: What are we  going to do about it?   Some of my colleagues on the other side want to sweep this dark  chapter under the rug. Just last week, one Republican said the events  of January 6 resembled a ``normal tourist visit.''   Madam Speaker, I was here presiding over the House on January 6.  People died that day. Police officers were beaten and bloodied.  America's Capitol, the symbol of our freedom and the  [[Page H2564]]  citadel of our democracy, was desecrated by a mob that wanted to  invalidate an election. There was nothing normal about it.   It is not normal for a mob to break into this complex to try and hang  the Vice President of the United States and harm other elected  officials.   It is not normal for insurrectionists to try to stop the  certification of an American election, one that judge after judge after  judge said was free and fair. And it is not normal for Congress to  respond by doing nothing. That is why we are considering the underlying  legislation contained in this rule. It will establish a bipartisan 9/ 11-style commission to investigate what happened, a commission led not  by politicians, but by experts.   Now let me say this plainly: A vote for this commission is a vote to  make sure this never happens again. And I want to recognize the  incredible work of the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on  Homeland Security in navigating this truly bipartisan deal. It is one  that will keep the focus where it should be, solely on the events of  January 6. And I look forward to the Commission's report at the end of  the year. But the truth is, we cannot wait until then to fix what we  already know needs fixing.   We need to upgrade the physical safety of this and other Federal  buildings. We need to increase security in district offices, repay the  National Guard for their service in the aftermath of the insurrection,  and provide support to the overworked Capitol Police force that keep us  all safe day after day.   Madam Speaker, this is how you respond responsibly to what happened 4  months ago, not with deflection or mistruths, but by taking action to  protect not only this complex and those who work, serve, and visit  here, but to also protect our very democracy, and making sure we never  become a country that lets any angry mob decide who the next President  will be.   Madam Speaker, only the voters can do that. We need to put the facts  on Record here, to tell the truth and not spread lies. And the truth is  that some on the other side are afraid to do anything around here  because they are afraid, afraid of the truth, afraid because their  leadership doesn't want to offend the ex-President and his big lie.  That is all I could think of when I read the minority leader's deeply  troubling statement opposing the January 6 commission.   Now, even though it is bipartisan, even though his own ranking member  negotiated the deal, even though we gave him virtually everything he  asked for during the negotiations, a Republican aide said it best when  they were quoted in the press yesterday saying this: ``I think Kevin  was hoping that the Democrats would never agree to our requests; That  way the commission would be partisan and we can all vote ``no'' and say  it is a sham operation, because he knows Trump is going to lose his  mind.'' Lose his mind over a bipartisan commission.   Madam Speaker, this moment is a choice, a choice between the truth or  siding with the originator of the big lie. To my friends on the other  side, I am asking you to lead with the courage of your convictions.  Vote your conscience. Support this bipartisan commission, not just  because it is the right thing to do, but support it out of respect, out  of respect for your colleagues, for your staff and the support staff  here, for the Capitol Police, but, most importantly, respect for this  institution.   Now, I have cast some tough votes in my career, but casting a vote to  establish a bipartisan commission to establish an insurrection is not  one of them. I appeal to my colleagues to do the right thing, to lead  with courage, and support this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I also agree with the gentleman that Chairman Thompson and Ranking  Member Katko deserve an enormous amount of credit. They negotiated a  truly bipartisan deal.   I have taken note of the letter that Minority Leader McCarthy sent to  Speaker Pelosi of all the things he wanted in this deal, and he got  virtually every one of them, all in this bipartisan deal. Now, all of a  sudden, it is not good enough.   All of the concerns that my good friend raised are addressed in this  bill. The commission could look at anything and investigate anything  related to the violence that occurred here on January 6.   I mean, what happened here, isn't that a big enough deal to merit an  investigation?   I don't get it.   In the bill, by the way, is language that is quite clear about how  this commission will not interfere with any other ongoing  investigations. In fact, very similar to the 9/11 commission, it will  be informed by other investigations and complement other  investigations.   So, again, I urge my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to vote  for this commission, out of respect for the people who work here, out  of respect for this institution, out of respect for our democracy.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from the District  of Columbia (Ms. Norton).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from the District of Columbia.    Madam Speaker, I reference the text of S. 937 and H.  Res. 275, a bill and a resolution we are considering this week. S. 937  was passed yesterday, and right after this debate, we are going to  adopt H. Res. 275. They are two pieces of legislation condemning hate  crimes against Asian Americans in this country.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New Jersey  (Ms. Sherrill).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gallego).    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a statement from  the family of United States Capitol Officer Howie Liebengood, who died  by suicide. His death was a direct result of the trauma and strain from  the January 6 attack.   Madam Speaker, in the statement, the family of Officer Liebengood  states: ``We believe a thorough, nonpartisan investigation into the  root causes of and the response to the January 6 riot is essential for  our Nation to move forward. Howie's death was an immediate outgrowth of  those events.''  Liebengood Family Statement on the January 6th Commission and Security                                Supplemental     Family of fallen USCP Officer Howie Liebengood calls on Congress to                      pass both pieces of legislation         Washington, DC--Today, the Office of Congresswoman Jennifer       Wexton (D-VA) released the following statement from the       family of United States Capitol Police Officer Howie       Liebengood regarding the National Commission to Investigate       the January 6 Attack on the United States Capitol Complex Act       and the Emergency Security Supplemental to Respond to January       6th Appropriations Act.        ``We believe a thorough, non-partisan investigation into       the root causes of and the response to the January 6th riot       is essential for our nation to move forward. Howie's death       was an immediate outgrowth of those events. Every officer who       worked that day, as well as their families, should have a       better understanding of what happened. Uncovering the facts       will help our nation heal and may lessen the lingering       emotional bitterness that has divided our country. We implore       Congress to work as one and establish the proposed       Commission.        ``Additionally, improved mental health for USCP officers       has been one of our goals for the past four months. Through       the tireless efforts of Congresswoman Wexton, we are honored       a wellness program bearing Howie's name has been proposed in       the security supplemental along with more resources for the       program. We welcome and support the new funding and staffing       initiatives that will help prevent future tragedies among the       USCP.''        Howie C. Liebengood grew up and lived in Vienna, Virginia       and was Congresswoman Wexton's constituent. He was raised in       the Capitol Hill community, where his father, Howard S.       Liebengood, served for decades as a Hill staffer and later       the Senate Sergeant at Arms. Howie received a Bachelor's       Degree at Purdue University, a Master 's Degree at the       University of Memphis, and started a career as a race car       driver in the 1990s. Howie joined the Capitol Police in 2005       and served as an officer for 15 years He was assigned to the       Senate division and often worked at the Delaware entrance of       the Russell Senate Office Building. Howie took his life on       January 9, and his death was a direct result of the trauma       and strain from the January 6th attack on the Capitol and the       around-the-clock shifts in the subsequent days. He is       survived by his wife, Dr. Serena McClam Liebengood, his       siblings, John Liebengood and Anne Winters, and many family       and friends who loved him dearly.        Following Howie's death, Dr. Liebengood and Howie's family       have been advocating [iqconnect.house.gov] to have Howie's       death designated ``in the line of duty;'' to support much       needed USCP reforms; and to promote positive change around       mental health issues for his fellow law enforcement officers,       both with the Capitol Police and with law enforcement       agencies generally.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a May 19 letter  [[Page H2567]]  from the Bipartisan Policy Center in support of H.R. 3233, the National  Commission to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the United States  Capitol Complex Act.   In the letter, the cochairs of the 9/11 Commission, Governor Tom Kean  and Representative Lee Hamilton state: ``A full accounting of the  events of January 6 and the identification of measures to strengthen  the Congress can help our country heal.''                             [From BPC Action]                   BPC Action Urges Support for H.R. 3233         H.R. 3233, the ``National Commission to Investigate the       January 6 Attack on the United States Capitol Complex Act,''       is a crucial step for the country to get the truth of those       shocking events and agree on how to ensure they never occur       again. The Bipartisan Policy Center is encouraged that the       agreement reflects the principles of 9-11 Commission chairs       Gov. Tom Kean and Rep. Lee Hamilton, who stated, ``A full       accounting of the events of January 6th and the       identification of measures to strengthen the Congress can       help our country heal.''        A single narrative of the facts of that day and actionable       recommendations for preventing them from recurring are the       predicate for ensuring our democracy is respected and       protected. This bipartisan, independent commission is       structured so experts will be empowered to objectively assess       the evidence and chart a path forward.        In this midst of opportunity for growth and healing, it is       crucial that we reflect on our history: the strength of the       9/11 commission was that it was bipartisan and unified by the       imperative of national security. Twenty years later, we are       reminded of the security challenges this nation faces, and we       must come together in the same way we did following 9/11.        We applaud the House and Senate committees and law       enforcement investigations that have laid groundwork for an       independent commission to begin its work--and House and       Senate leaders, especially Chairman Bennie Thompson and       Ranking Member John Katko, for creating a process that has a       real chance for success. We urge Congress to support H.R.       3233.                                   ____                               [From Issue One]   Joint Statement from Governor Tom Kean and Congressman Lee Hamilton,             Chairman and Vice Chairman of the 9/11 Commission         ``We very strongly urge House Members to support H.R. 3233,       the bipartisan National Commission to Investigate the January       6 Attack on the United States Capitol Complex. That bill       would create a 9/11 style commission to investigate the       January 6th assault on the U.S. Capitol. That was a dark day       in American history, one of the darkest.        ``As Chairman and Vice Chairman of the 9/11 Commission,       unity of purpose was key to the effectiveness of the group.       We put country above party, without bias, the events before,       during and after the attack. We sought to understand our       vulnerabilities in order to prevent future attacks or future       acts of terrorism.        ``Today, democracy faces a new threat. The January 6 attack       on the U.S. Capitol was one of the darkest days in the       history of our country. Americans deserve an objective and an       accurate account of what happened. As we did in the wake of       September 11, it's time to set aside partisan politics and       come together as Americans in common pursuit of truth and       justice.''     Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Mississippi (Mr. Thompson), who is the distinguished chairman of the  Committee on Homeland Security.    Madam Speaker, let's be clear that opposition to this  commission is not about substance or policy; it really is about  politics, plain and simple. At least, my Republican colleagues in the  Senate side are willing to admit that. Senator Thune said that there is  concern among Republicans that the findings could be ``weaponized  politically and drug into next year''.   I get that his members want to ``be moving forward and not looking  backward,'' but this was an attack on the United States Capitol, and  all the people who work here. It was an attack on our democracy.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a CNN article entitled  ``Republicans fear January 6 probe could undercut 2022 midterm  message.''                          [From CNN, May 19, 2021]    Republicans Fear January 6 Probe Could Undercut 2022 Midterm Message                               (By Manu Raju)         Senior Republicans are making clear they have little       interest in moving forward with a sweeping January 6       investigation in part because a detailed probe could become       politically damaging and amount to a distraction for their       party just as control of Congress is at stake in next year's       midterm elections.        Publicly and privately, Republicans are making that case,       with Senate GOP Whip John Thune noting that there's concern       among some GOP members that the findings of the probe ``could       be weaponized politically and drug into next year.'' ``I want       our midterm message to be on the kinds of things that the       American people are dealing with: That's jobs and wages and       the economy and national security, safe streets and strong       borders--not relitigating the 2020 elections,'' Thune told       CNN. ``A lot of our members, and I think this is true of a       lot of House Republicans, want to be moving forward and not       looking backward. Anything that gets us rehashing the 2020       elections I think is a day lost on being able to draw a       contrast between us the Democrats' very radical left-wing       agenda.''        Thune's comments came moments after Senate GOP Leader Mitch       McConnell announced his opposition on the floor, contending       it would duplicate ongoing probes  [[Page H2568]]       and contending the deal--which was reached between a House       Republican and House Democrat--is designed to find a       conclusion that would be in ``Democrats' hands.'' The       commission would be structured so 10 members--chosen equally       between the leaders from both political parties--could report       by year's end on what happened on January 6, as well as the       ``influencing factors'' behind it.        It's clear that such an investigation would also look at       then-President Donald Trump's role in promoting the January 6       ``Stop the Steal'' rally, his lies that the election was       stolen and his efforts to subvert the will of voters.       Moreover, it could put an uncomfortable focus on some       conservative GOP senators and House members who sought to       overturn the election results in Congress, while keeping the       issue front-and-center as the investigation plays out over       the next year.        And there are ample questions about whether House GOP       Leader Kevin McCarthy would be forced to testify to explain       what Trump was saying on January 6 given the two spoke during       a heated phone call that day.        ``It would be a distraction,'' one senior GOP source told       CNN, arguing any investigation should also look at left-wing       extremism as well.        Similar concerns were voiced through the Senate Republican       Conference on Wednesday, coming hours after a group of       members huddled privately with McCarthy earlier in the       morning.        Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican and member of       leadership, said that in addition to his concern about a       commission's work overlapping with criminal probes, he       accused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of pushing the       investigation to help Democrats' chances at keeping control       of Congress.        ``Well, part of the concern is that's the plan,'' Cornyn       said. ``That's Pelosi's plan.'' If the probe dragged out       until the next year, he added: ``That would be the Democrats'       dream. . . . I generally don't try to help Democrats.''        While the bill is expected to pass the House on Wednesday,       it's an open question whether it will pass the Senate, where       60 votes would be needed to break a GOP filibuster.        Thune, the chief GOP vote counter, said they haven't taken       the caucus' temperature yet on the plan.        ``I would say that there's a skepticism about what's       happening in the House right now and whether or not what       comes out is a proposal that will be fair.''        Sen. Gary Peters, who chairs the Democratic Senatorial       Campaign Committee, said there's a reason why Republicans are       battling the commission.        ``They're afraid of the truth because it puts them on the       wrong side of what is right,'' Peters, a Michigan Democrat,       said Wednesday.        Asked if he is concerned the probe could last into the       midterm season when the GOP wants to focus on jobs,       Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said: ``There's       a lot of stuff we need to focus on.''        ``Why shift our attention away from that, when we already       have an infrastructure in place to address a lot of the       things that the commission seems to be stood up to address,''       Tillis asked. ``Seems redundant.''    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Espaillat).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Madam Speaker, I am having trouble trying to figure out  exactly what the problem that some of my Republican colleagues may have  with this bill. Maybe, based on the lack of speakers, they are having  trouble figuring it out too.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon), who is a distinguished member of the Rules  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining  for us on both sides.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members here today to read  today's Washington Post editorial questioning Leader McCarthy's  political courage in opposing this bill and calling for him to testify  under oath about his eyewitness experience of the violence and former  President Trump's apparent indifference to it.   The editorial also criticizes his false equivalence of Black Lives  Matter protests to the Capitol invasion and his minimization of the  insurrection's significance, which only encourages the lies on which it  is based.   I include that article in the Record.                  [From the Washington Post, May 18, 2021]      Opinion: Kevin McCarthy Plumbs New Depths of Political Cowardice                      (Opinion by the Editorial Board)         Democratic and Republican negotiators agreed last week to       create a high-level, expert commission with subpoena power to       conduct an examination of the Jan. 6 Capitol invasion, one of       the lowest moments in U.S. history. But House Minority Leader       Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) on Tuesday threw his negotiators       under the bus, condemning the compromise and vowing to oppose       the bill creating the commission when it comes to a House       vote Wednesday.        Many Republicans do not want an impartial panel to remind       the public of their party's role in the event. A fair inquiry       would examine how GOP lawmakers fed the election lies that       inspired the mob, and how they built Jan. 6, which should       have featured a pro forma counting of electoral votes, into a       showdown over the 2020 presidential election. Republican       lawmakers who signed a spurious lawsuit seeking to overturn       the results bear some guilt; those who went on to object to       the counting of electoral votes from several swing states       bear even more.        An honest proceeding would also require Mr. McCarthy to       testify under oath about his eyewitness experience of the       violence--and to then-President Donald Trump's apparent       indifference. Mr. McCarthy has resisted offering the public a       frank accounting of his interactions with Mr. Trump,       including on a phone call during which Mr. McCarthy       reportedly begged Mr. Trump to stop the mob. Mr. McCarthy has       concluded that whatever political benefits he receives from       embracing Mr. Trump are worth the price of his integrity.        If there are to be hearings, Mr. McCarthy argued, they       should examine not only the Capitol invasion but other       politically motivated violence, such as the riots surrounding       the Black Lives Matter protests last summer. The point is to       draw a false equivalence between a historically unique attack       on the nation's seat of government, in which Mr. Trump and       other Republicans are directly implicated, and crimes that       left-leaning activists committed--crimes that did not occur       in the halls of Congress, that did not aim to interrupt the       peaceful transition of power, that did not reflect a plot to       overturn a presidential election.        Mr. McCarthy knows Democrats will never endorse a panel       designed to mislead the nation about Jan. 6, so his proposal       for a broader mandate is a ruse: He simply does not want any       investigation at all. House Democrats should nevertheless       advance the compromise plan on Wednesday. Then the public       will see whether there are 10 Senate Republicans willing to       approve the deal. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-      Ky.) on Tuesday did not rule out supporting it, raising minor       concerns about its structure that should be negotiable. But       if Senate Republicans capitulate to the calculations driving       Mr. McCarthy, House and Senate committees should use their       subpoena power to conduct their own investigations, even if       that means Democrats lead the inquiries without Republican       cooperation.     Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I am deeply disappointed that any of my Republican  colleagues would oppose the creation of this commission. There is a lot  of talk all the time about the need for bipartisanship, and that is  what we have here. This is true bipartisanship.   The distinguished minority leader sent a letter to Speaker Pelosi  asking for an equal 5:5 ratio in appointments by Democrats and  Republicans on this commission. He got it.   He asked for coequal subpoena power. He got it.   He asked for no inclusion of findings or other predetermined  conclusions which ultimately should be rendered by the commission  itself. He got it.   Now, maybe the gentleman didn't think he would, but Chairman Thompson  and Ranking Member Katko, who was appointed by the minority leader to  negotiate on behalf of the Republicans, came to a deal, a genuinely  bipartisan deal to look into the horrific acts of what happened in this  Chamber on January 6.   I was here that day. They were not ordinary tourists who came in  here. My colleagues on the Republican side who are here today, there  are pictures of them helping to barricade the doors. They know exactly  what happened on January 6.   Those people who attacked the Capitol were not here to make a  political point. They were here to desecrate this building and hurt  people.   We, as Members of Congress, signed up for this job. But I want  Members to vote for this commission, not because of us, but because of  the people who work here, our staff, the support staff, the Capitol  Police, the people who work in our cafeterias, the people who maintain  this building. They were traumatized by what happened here.   Our response to all of this is: Well, let's move on. Let's not do  this, in spite of a truly bipartisan negotiation and a bipartisan  commission.   This is so disappointing. I mean, don't talk to us about  bipartisanship, and then when you get it, you turn your back on it.   Madam Speaker, I am sick and tired of those who want to hover around  mistruths and lies and spread conspiracy theories. What happened 133  days ago can never be normalized. We all have to speak the truth, and  we must act to prevent it from ever happening again. That starts with  not only passing this rule but passing this bipartisan bill to  establish a bipartisan commission to produce a report for the American  people so that we know clearly and credibly as to what happened and  that we can take additional actions to make sure it never happens  again.   As I said in my opening, vote for this out of respect for this  institution, out of respect for our democracy, out of respect for the  truth, out of respect for the people who work for you, who come here  every day and work for you. We owe it to them and to this country to  move forward.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Cole is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 409         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       resolution (H. Res. 153) condemning recent hate crimes       committed against Asian-American and Pacific Islanders. The       resolution shall be considered as read. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the resolution and preamble       to adoption without intervening motion or demand for division       of the question except one hour of debate equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on the Judiciary.        Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H. Res. 153.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
