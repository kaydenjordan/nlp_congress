 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 908,  condemning all forms of anti-Asian sentiment as related to COVID.   I cast my ``yes'' vote today in memory of Vincent Chin. The anti- Asian racism and hate that led to his murder in Highland Park,  Michigan, in my district, is alive today, and it is what led to the  June 9 horrific attack in 1982.   I am proud to stand with my sister in service, the first Asian- American woman in the Michigan Legislature, State Senator Stephanie  Chang, to say that the disgusting wave of hate against our Asian- American friends and neighbors we are witnessing in our country will  not stand.   In this moment, I think of one of our Nation's greatest heroes,  Detroiter Grace Lee Boggs. While she would be proud of our vote here  today, she would remind us that our work is not done.   We must commit, as she did for over 100 years, to the revolutionary  struggle to liberate our world from hate, embrace all humankind with  love, and grow our own souls in the process.   I thank so much Congresswoman Meng for her leadership, and I urge my  colleagues to please vote ``yes.''                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I submit for the Record a letter of support  for this legislation from the March of Dimes.                                                September 11, 2020.      Re Support the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the March of Dimes, one       of the leading non-profit organization fighting for the       health of all moms and babies and promotes the health of       women, children and families across the life course, we       enthusiastically support the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act       (H.R. 2694). Modeled after the Americans with Disabilities       Act, the bill would require employers to provide reasonable,       temporary workplace accommodations to pregnant workers as       long as the accommodation does not impose an undue hardship       on the employer. This bill is critically important because no       one should have to choose between having a healthy pregnancy       and a paycheck.        Three-quarters of women will be pregnant and employed at       some point in their lives. Most pregnant workers can expect a       normal pregnancy and healthy birth. However, healthcare       providers have consistently recommended that some pregnant       women make adjustments in their work activities to sustain a       healthy pregnancy and prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes,       including preterm birth or miscarriage. Workplace       accommodations are medically necessary and can include       allowing additional bathroom breaks, opportunities to stay       hydrated, lifting restrictions, or access to a chair or stool       to decrease time spent standing.        Unfortunately, too many pregnant workers, particularly       pregnant women of color, face barriers to incorporating even       these small changes to their workdays. Workplace       accommodations help safeguard a healthy pregnancy or prevent       harm to a higher-risk pregnancy. Across the country, pregnant       workers continue to be denied simple, no-cost or low-cost,       temporary adjustments in their work settings or activities       and instead risk being fired or forced to take unpaid leave       to preserve the health of their pregnancy. Low-wage pregnant       workers in physically demanding jobs, which are       disproportionately occupied by people of color, feel the       impact most acutely. This impossible choice forces many       pregnant workers to continue working without accommodations,       putting both mother and baby at risk of longlasting and       severe health consequences.        One of the main predictors of a healthy pregnancy is early       and consistent prenatal care. Getting early and regular       prenatal care can help ensure a healthy, full-term pregnancy.       The costs of a healthy birth tend to be around $5,000,       whereas the costs associated with a premature or complicated       birth range closer to $76,000. Prenatal checkups are crucial       and necessary, so that providers can answer any questions,       check on the overall health of mom and baby, and spot       complications early when there is a greater chance to prevent       them. If there is a possibility of a loss of employment, it       would impact family resources and threaten the ability to       afford vital prenatal care and healthcare costs when most       needed.        Pregnancy affects every system of the body, so pregnant       workers may need workplace accommodations to mitigate       complications before they arise. During the second and third       trimester, additional stress requires that the lungs work       harder to provide oxygen as the heart supplies blood       throughout the body and for the fetus. Some pregnant people       have chronic health diseases, such as diabetes and       cardiovascular disease, and need to take extra precautions to       manage the condition. Moreover, additional stress during       pregnancy may be caused by physical discomfort and other       changes in daily life. Some of this stress may cause serious       health problems, like high blood pressure, which could lead       to problems like preeclampsia and premature birth, conditions       that impact Black women at far higher rates than white women       and contribute to this country's Black maternal health       crisis. Therefore, it is imperative that pregnant workers are       protected and provided the necessary and reasonable       accommodations, to ensure that they are able to continue       working and maintain healthy pregnancies.        The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is a measured approach to       a serious problem. March of Dimes understands the importance       of reasonable workplace accommodations to ensure that women       can continue to provide for their families and have safe and       healthy pregnancies. We urge swift passage of the Pregnant       Workers Fairness Act.            Sincerely,      Ariel Gonzalez, ESQ., MA,        Senior Vice President, Public Policy & Government Affairs,       March of Dimes.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Pregnant  Workers Fairness Act.   In my district and across the country, pregnancy discrimination  persists, especially against people of color and immigrant women.   When companies refuse to accommodate for pregnancy-related needs, it  doesn't just hurt the person being discriminated against, it hurts the  entire family, especially when nearly half of working women are the  sole or primary provider for their families.   It is time to put families first over corporate greed. We must ensure  that no pregnant person is forced to quit, coerced into taking unpaid  leave, or fired because their employer refuses to accommodate them.   We must protect the more than 85 percent of women who will become  mothers at some point in their working lives.   On behalf of all the beautiful mothers in my district,  #13DistrictStrong, I thank Chairman Nadler and Chairman Scott for their  leadership, and I urge support for this bill.
