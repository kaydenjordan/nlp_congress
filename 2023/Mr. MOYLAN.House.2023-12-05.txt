 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and reflect on one  of the darkest days in Guam's history.   Mr. Speaker, 82 years ago, on December 8, 1941, the Imperial Japanese  military launched a surprise attack on Guam just hours after the  surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. This day in our history is a  dark one, and we will always remember how life changed for all  Americans 82 years ago.   Today, let us also remember and thank the Greatest Generation, our  ``manamko,'' ``seniors,'' for their sacrifice and contributions they  made for our island. I always enjoy listening to the countless stories  they share. Their stories are ones of bravery, patriotism, and  resilience. When faced with danger and threats, they never backed down  and are a great inspiration for our island and community.   While many in Guam associate this day with despair, this day is also  a day of celebration and faith in our community. To the large Catholic  community in Guam, December 8 is a very important day. It is the feast  of Guam's patron saint, Santa Marian Kamalen. On this day in 1941, it  began as any normal Sunday, with people going to church. However, life  changed with bombs dropping and planes flying overhead. It drowned out  the otherwise quiet island.   Despite the surprise attack on Guam, Santa Marian Kamalen survived  and is a representation of the people of Guam. No matter what happens,  our people are strong, and there is no event that can break our  communities.   This is true for every major setback Guam faces. Most recently, in  May of this year, the strongest typhoon to strike Guam in 20 years  breached our shores. When homes and businesses were destroyed and when  people felt down and despaired, it was the community, our friends, and  family who helped us get back on our feet. This is the ``hafa adai''  spirit that lives in everyone who calls Guam home and is a value that  keeps our island moving and on our feet.   While these moments in Guam's history are merely a single thread in  the fabric of our people and island, they make our island what we know  it as today. These stories live on, and it is important to reflect on  them always.   I could not be prouder to represent and advocate for such a diverse  and strong district. Because of our people, Guam is strong.   While we reflect on the history and sacrifices made 82 years ago, let  us fill our hearts with gratitude, reverence, peace, and faith.   Mr. Speaker, God bless Guam, God bless our ``manamko,'' ``seniors,''  and God bless America.                            ____________________
