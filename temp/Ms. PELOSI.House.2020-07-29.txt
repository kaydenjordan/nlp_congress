 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support for this  legislation.   I salute Congresswoman DeLauro for her leadership over the years,  constant, persistent, dissatisfied, and relentless, in terms of looking  out for our children.   I thank the distinguished gentleman from Virginia, the chair of the  Education and Labor Committee, for his leadership throughout all of  this. I think he knows this issue, chapter and verse, over the years,  and so I am so happy that we are coming to the floor for this.   In our community, there is such a need for childcare. It is endless.  We don't even come close. We have been thinking incrementally. We have  to think transformatively.   Even little children know. In our community, we have T-shirts,  ``Children Learning, Parents Earning,'' the direct connection between  quality childcare, where children are given a good start on where they  are going.   I rise during this devastating time for America, as the health and  economic crisis of COVID-19 hurtles further out of control. Ten weeks  ago, the Democrats delivered a solution by defeating the virus and  safely opening the economy with the HEROES Act--it was actually 10  weeks ago today--supporting our heroes, crushing the virus, and putting  money in America's pocket. Yet, for 10 weeks, we haven't had the action  that we need on that.   So, here we are. For all the statements that were made over time  about need for childcare, this virus has really shown a bright  spotlight on why it is so important. Parents know; children know; we  all know. But this virus has been an instructor, because if parents are  forced to go to work as essential workers, who is going to take care of  the children if their schools cannot open actually and some are  virtual?   Again, when I ran for Congress, over 30 years ago, people said to me:  ``Who is taking care of your children?'' My children were big. Four of  them were already in college and one a senior in high school. But that  was the question: Who is taking care of the children? And that is a  question for our Nation: Who is taking care of the children?   In order for us to succeed with this, we have to meet the needs of  the children, their families, and childcare workers. Our childcare  workers are the workforce behind the workforce, risking their health  and safety on the front lines to ensure that parents can go to work.   But they face a devastating situation. The childcare system needs at  least $50 billion in the next 6 months in order to survive. Just one in  five childcare programs believes that they can stay open for more than  a year without Federal support.   This is essential. An estimated 326,000 workers, nearly one-third of  the sector nationwide, have lost their jobs since February--326,000  since February.                                time  1145    Half of the providers have closed, and those that are open to serve  children of essential workers are risking their health, too often  without PPE, and parents are paying the price. We can't get people back  to work until we have widespread access to safe, quality, and  affordable childcare.   Here is the situation in the childcare workers' own words. Terry from  Wisconsin said: I have gone from 81 kids a day to two. I can't stay  open with two, we are considered essential, but how can I stay open  without the help needed? I love my kids, staff, and families, but to  ask me to go under because all of a sudden I am essential--really? This  is what we say: People are essential. We have to treat them as if they  are essential.   Traci from Pennsylvania says: We are a nonprofit center, mainly  funded by families who pay out of pocket. We need a way to maintain  payroll of staff so that they can be ready to return when we are  allowed to reopen. We need help paying our rent and health insurance  costs. We will need help understanding how to stay open safely and how  to adjust to new regulations, how to afford related training, and what  to do if our families can't afford to return.   And Mary in New York says: Since COVID, my childcare center has gone  from 89 percent to about 10 percent. Fifteen employees will lose their  jobs. We are the only center in a 1-mile radius in a very low-income  area. We are the only voice for our parents and children. Please help  us be heard.   And so action is needed now, which is why I am proud to support two  bills that will be a lifeline for childcare workers and for the  economy, while keeping our children safe and helping them and helping  parents go back to work:   H.R. 7027, the Child Care Is Essential Act, creating a $50 billion  childcare stabilization fund to provide funding to childcare providers  over the next 6 months and helping them safely reopen and operate  during and after the COVID-19 crisis; and   H.R. 7327, the Child Care for Economic Recovery Act, expanding access  to quality childcare to help workers safely return to their jobs and  stimulate the economy with Federal investments and tax subsidies.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Nita Lowey, a maestro of the  legislative process, who has advanced immeasurable progress for  generations of Americans.   I thank Richard Neal for his leadership on the tax credit and Federal  investments work.   Mr. Speaker, I salute Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, chair of the House  Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and  the godmother of much of the work for families and children that we do  in this Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I also thank Chairman  Bobby Scott and Senator Patty  Murray, ranking member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions Committee, for their leadership on this bill. Thank you, Mr.  Scott, for every day reminding us and leading us on how we can help our  children.   And I thank and recognize the outside organizers who have been  relentless, persistent, and dissatisfied, as is Rosa, as they have  fought for the strong investments in the childcare sector that our  children and workers need.   When people ask me, ``What are the three most important issues facing  the Congress?'' I always say the same thing  [[Page H3903]]  and have for over 30 years. The three most important issues facing the  Congress are our children, our children, our children: their health,  their education, the economic security of their families, a safe  environment in which they can thrive, a world at peace in which they  can reach their fulfillment, and my motivation for even coming to  Congress was one in five children in America who lives in poverty.   But it isn't only families in poverty who are affected by this  childcare issue; it is our entire society and entire economy, and that  is why we have to think transformatively about this.   As we observe the 100th anniversary of women having the right to  vote, as we observe the fact that we have over 100 women in Congress,  many of them moms of small children, we do have to recognize that, for  our economy to thrive, we have to have the full participation and  leadership of women, because we do believe, when women succeed, America  succeeds, for that to happen. And dads have this responsibility, too,  so we want them to succeed as well.   But for all of that to happen, we have to make sure that we know who  is taking care of the children, and the role that we play is to  facilitate all of that to make sure it is of the highest quality and  safety for the children and ensure that they are served by the  legislation that we are considering.   For the sake of the children, their health, their safety, and our  children's future, as we recover from COVID but learn from it, I urge  our colleagues to support this important legislation.
