 Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentlewoman for yielding and  for her leadership on so many issues.   Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening in opposition to this bill. It  really is a hateful and un-American demand for $5 billion to build  President Trump's border wall.   Let's be clear: President Trump and congressional Republicans aren't  negotiating. They are holding our government hostage and demanding this  wasteful, expensive wall as their ransom.   Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the White House. Mr.  Speaker, you would think that they could at least keep the government  open. Instead of passing the Senate-passed, clean continuing resolution  to prevent a shutdown, Republicans want to vote on this unnecessary  border wall.   Mr. Speaker, this is completely irresponsible. Federal workers rely  on their paychecks, especially during the holidays. People have planned  national park trips over the holidays.   Is President Trump really going to shut down the American government  in the midst of this holiday season during their vacation, during their  time with their families? How sinister and mean-spirited can the  President and our Republican colleagues be?   But this wouldn't be the first time that the Republicans were  manufacturing a crisis. The Republican-led shutdown in 2013 cost our  economy $24 billion. If President Trump shuts down the government--for  the third time this year, I might add--he will sabotage our economy.   Instead of pushing forward with this bill, House Republicans should  allow a vote on the Senate-passed continuing resolution to keep the  government open.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this disastrous  bill.
