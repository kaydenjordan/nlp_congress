 Mr. President, as a senior member and former  chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and  Entrepreneurship, each month I recognize and celebrate the American  entrepreneurial spirit by highlighting the success of a small business  in my home State of Idaho. Today, I am pleased to honor Alexander Davis  Men's Clothing in Boise as the Idaho Small Business of the Month for  September 2021.   Alexander Davis is a locally owned and operated men's clothing store  located in downtown Boise at the corner of 8th and Bannock in the  historic Hoff Building. Its founder, the two-time mayor of Boise and  the 11th Governor of Idaho, Moses Alexander, established the small  business in 1891 as a ``one price clothier'' that catered to the area's  gold miners. Since opening its doors, Alexander Davis has developed a  reputation as one of the State's premier tailors and clothiers. Their  longevity and successes have caught the attention of clothing industry  media. MR Magazine, a menswear trade publication, featured Alexander  Davis in an article honoring businesses operating for more than 100  years. The publication celebrated Alexander Davis being the 11th oldest  men's clothing store in the United States and one of the oldest stores  of its kind west of the Mississippi River. The business has become a  fixture in downtown Boise and credits its success to developing  longstanding personal connections with their customers.   Alexander Davis's current owner and Grangeville native, David Graves,  was a longtime employee of the store before starting the process to  purchase the company with his wife, Kathleen, in 2006. Since taking the  helm, David has made it a priority to build on the business's rich and  long history. When customers enter the shop, they are welcomed by  professional staff who provide one-on-one, personal service to ensure  every client's individual needs are met. David looks forward to  continuing his work at Alexander Davis and has positioned the store as  the Treasure Valley's premier high-end clothing retailer.   Congratulations to David, Kathleen, and all of Alexander Davis Men's  Clothing employees on being selected as the Idaho Small Business of the  Month for September 2021. You make our great State proud, and I look  forward to your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
