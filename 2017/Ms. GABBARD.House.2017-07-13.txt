 Mr. Speaker, in my home State of Hawaii,  hospitalizations and emergency room visits from opioid-related  conditions have more than doubled in the last decade. More people are  now dying from overdoses than motor vehicle accidents. This opioid  epidemic is killing 91 Americans all across this country every single  day.   For years, companies like Purdue Pharma, the maker of the commonly  known drug OxyContin, have profited off of the suffering of millions of  Americans who are dealing and struggling with opioid addiction. Now  Purdue and others are going overseas, targeting foreign populations,  using the very same shady marketing tactics, lies, and false  advertising that helped them get rich at the expense of the American  people.   This is absolutely unacceptable. We can't just keep wringing our  hands about the opioid crisis without actually tackling the cause of  it. Purdue and those responsible should be prosecuted for the deaths  and lives that have been ruined as a result of their lies.                            ____________________
