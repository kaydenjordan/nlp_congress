 Mr. Speaker, I would also like to thank my colleagues for  adding additional funding for our nation's tribal governments. This  bill adds $20 billion to aid tribal governments who have been  devastated by this pandemic, including tribes in my home state of  Michigan. It is critical that tribal governments be given the  flexibility to spend this money in a way that addresses the health and  economic challenges they have endured. In many parts of Indian Country,  tribes are among the largest employers of non-natives in their  communities. We must ensure that tribal governments have the financial  support to address the needs of their tribal members and those who are  employed by the tribes.   I am also pleased that language was included in this bill that would  ensure these federal dollars would only go to the 574 federally- recognized tribes. I want to thank my colleagues and Speaker Pelosi for  including these provisions in this legislation.
