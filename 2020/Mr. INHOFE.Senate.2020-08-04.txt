 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I want to start by doing something that  has become a little controversial. It shouldn't be, and the fact that  it is reflects a sad time in our Nation's history. Here it is:   To our Nation's police, sheriffs, and all other law enforcement  officers out there--State and Federal--thank you. I appreciate you and  am grateful for your service.   Why has that become controversial? Because all of a sudden,  criticizing and demonizing our Nation's law enforcement has become the  popular liberal thing to do.   Over the last few days, you have probably seen the liberal mainstream  media making wild claims and accusations that President Trump has  deployed so-called secret police to Portland. These allegations got  even more attention over the last few weeks because some of my  Democratic colleagues came down to the floor and made the wildest  accusations about how the Federal officers were the worst in the world.   Some of the words they used were: ``bold,'' ``sadistic,''  ``Gestapos,'' ``storm troopers,'' ``paramilitary''--words designed to  stir the emotions of everyone watching. They were talking about the law  enforcement community. They were talking about sheriffs and police.  Rather than letting these wild allegations go unchecked, let's remember  how we got here.   For over 60 days, violent demonstrators have laid siege on Portland.  That is not an exaggeration. They have specifically and deliberately  attacked a Federal courthouse, attempting to destroy it. Let's be  clear: These are not peaceful protesters. Everyone agrees in the First  Amendment and the support for peaceful demonstrations. We all agree on  that. That is not what we are talking about here. That is not what  happened when the anarchist groups co-opted the peaceful protests with  the fires, the lasers, the bricks, the Molotov cocktails, the  sledgehammers, and more.   See the chart. This chart we have here, the one on the right says:         Day 53. Federal facilities and law enforcement officials       targeted and attacked overnight. One officer injured and 5       arrested.    The one on the left says:         Day 56. Last night six DHS law enforcement officers were       injured in Portland. To be clear, criminals assaulted FEDERAL       officers on FEDERAL property . . . and the city of Portland       did nothing.    The response from local leaders? They have caved to the mob and will  not allow local law enforcement to protect Federal property. In fact,  they have demanded Federal law enforcement leave and surrender to the  mob. Can you imagine? This is in America that this happened.   So that leaves us two options: One, completely give in to the mob and  let them burn down the taxpayer-funded courthouse--and we all know that  they will not stop there--or, two, send additional Federal resources to  Portland.   We are a nation of law and order. Additional Federal resources is the  only correct answer here. The Department of Homeland Security doesn't  have a choice. They are legally required to protect these facilities.   Contrary to what has been reported in the media, these Federal  officers are acting in accordance with the law. They have the legal  authority and responsibility to protect Federal property, as well as  detain, question, and arrest anyone in accordance with that.  Specifically, that is found in 40 U.S. Code 1315. So they aren't some  sort of secret police; they are legal law enforcement doing what local  law enforcement wasn't being allowed to do locally there, so they took  up their responsibilities and performed.   Last week, Governor Brown finally conceded. I guess he just got to  the point where he was willing to be fearful for the people and their  injuries and the terrorist activity that was going on. But he conceded  and allowed the Portland Police Bureau to clear out the downtown parks  that were a base for the agitators and let the State police officers  defend Federal properties.   That is the responsible thing to do, and it shows the President's  commitment to working with State and local law enforcement when  additional resources are needed.   It could be easy to think that this is an outlier, but, sadly, the  national ``defund the police'' movement--it is a movement in this  country now. Everyone is talking about it, defund law enforcement. The  movement is having a real impact throughout America.   The result? Shootings have increased in New York by 277 percent this  year; in Chicago, by 50 percent this year, and in May, they saw the  most violent weekend in modern history; and in Minneapolis, the murder  rate is expected to surpass an alltime high.   In fact, as President Trump mentioned recently, the 20-most dangerous  cities in America are run by Democrats. I have to mention this because  the Washington Post tried to fact check the President's statement. And  do you know what? It is a good thing that they did. The result? The  Post showed that, per capita, 19 of the 20 cities with the most violent  crime per 10,000 residents were controlled by Democrats, and the one  that wasn't controlled by Democrats was an Independent, but that  Independent is a Democrat.   I guess they hoped we would only read the headline and not see the  data that shows the impact of the lack of leadership. In case you can't  tell watching at home, the blue lines on the chart that will go up  here--what we have here is the claim ``that the most dangerous cities  in America all run by Democrats. They aren't.'' But then they found out  that they are. Here they are. The blue lines are run by the Democrats;  the red lines, Independents. So that is a problem.   Honorable, good law enforcement officers are enduring severe budget  cuts from spineless politicians who want to concede to the far left  ``defund the police'' movement. They are being overstretched and  overburdened   That doesn't even get into the injuries law enforcement has endured  during these violent protests recently. In Portland alone, three  officers are facing possible permanent blindness after having high- intensity lasers shown in their eyes. Other officers have faced  injuries from being hit with bricks and fireworks. They have endured  verbal assaults, been spit on, and called the most offensive names. At  least 30 officers have been victims of a doxing, where anarchists share  where their families live online so they can have access to them. In  fact, since July 4, over 245 Federal law enforcement officers have been  injured in Portland.   Fortunately, President Trump is taking action, standing up for our  police  [[Page S4723]]  and also for law enforcement in our communities. Last week, he launched  Operation Legend, a Federal law enforcement initiative that will work  with State and local officials to address the spike in violent crimes  that we are seeing in too many cities. This is the right approach to  restore law and order.   The last thing I will leave you with on the floor is, 2 weeks ago, in  the midst of sensationalizing statements, the junior Senator from  Oregon challenged me, basically, implying that if what was happening in  Portland was happening in Oklahoma, I would feel differently. Well,  that isn't--the difference isn't how I would feel. The difference is  between Oklahoma City and Oregon, I guess. In Oklahoma, we respect our  police and the sheriffs and the State troopers.   This is a good one here. This is in the Springlake Division. This is  in Oklahoma. I walk past this every time we come and go from the  station. What a wonderful community we see serving here in Oklahoma  City. You can read statements of people saying how much they appreciate  our law enforcement officers. This is the door that was there, and it  is covered with hearts on the door. That tells the story.   The sacrifice they make daily is real. They put their lives on the  line to protect and serve our communities, but they also work long  hours in difficult conditions. Here is a reminder of that sacrifice.   I will put up two officers here. There are two officers whom I am  going to show you. Last month, two Tulsa police officers were  conducting a routine traffic stop, pulling over a car with expired  tags. As any veteran officer will tell you, there is no such thing as a  routine anything in law enforcement. This is no exception. Officer  Zarkeshan, a rookie, and Sergeant Craig Johnson had no way of knowing  that the man they had just pulled over was armed. The man on the left  is Craig Johnson. Both officers were shot multiple times. Sergeant  Johnson, who has two young sons, died. Officer Zarkeshan, after  enduring multiple surgeries, is blessed. He is now stable and making  good progress.   ``Protect and serve'' isn't just a phrase for the hundreds of  thousands of law enforcement officers around the country; it is a  calling, a sacrifice for them. Too often, officers have to sacrifice  their lives for their communities. That is why, when liberal  politicians are tripping over themselves, trying as hard as they can to  demonize all police officers, I want to make it clear that some of us  are standing up against defunding police and in favor of defending  police.   I will always stand with President Trump in defense of our good,  honorable law enforcement officers. They will sacrifice anything for  those of us here, and to not stand up and defend them is to dishonor  them.   In Oregon, politicians are clamoring to defend the terrorists who are  trying to destroy law and order. On the other side, our President is  trying to defend it. God bless America's law enforcement officers and  our President.   The police and our law enforcement aren't the only things the new  cancel culture has come for more recently. While not a literal mob  trying to burn down buildings, the online liberal mob is still seeking  to destroy our American icons by canceling them, subjecting them to  public backlash fueled by the progressive ideology.   Just before July Fourth--our national holiday--they came for the  National Anthem. The Yahoo music editor-in-chief wrote that the  ``'Star-Spangled Banner' seems to be striking a wrong note.'' The Los  Angeles Times wrote an op-ed titled, ``It's time to cancel the `Star- Spangled Banner.''' This is America we are talking about.   Why do they do that? Because in the fourth stanza of the song--and I  didn't even know until a month ago that it had more than one stanza.  They knew it was more than just one stanza. But in the fourth stanza,  there is a couplet that reads:         No refuge could save the hireling and slave        From the terror of flight in the gloom of the grave.   Now, because of that, they want to cancel the Star-Spangled Banner.  Marc Ferris, who literally wrote the book on the Star-Spangled Banner,  stated that Key was likely using the term loosely, contrasting the  free, patriot Americans against the British soldiers subjected to the  yoke of the monarchy.   But Yahoo's article even says if there is ``a tradition that hurts  any part of society,'' it is time to just throw it away. That throwing  it away has extended to statues of our Founders, like George Washington  and Thomas Jefferson. It also includes Mahatma Gandhi and Ulysses S.  Grant.   It even includes historical items from popular culture like ``Gone  with the Wind''--yes, ``Gone with the Wind.'' They wanted to do away  with ``Gone with the Wind.'' The organization that has a program where,  online, they can dial up any movie that they want to do, one of them is  ``Gone with the Wind,'' and they want to do it because of--they say-- the culture. That happens to be the one that Hattie McDaniel was the  first Black American to win an Oscar for.   This is, again, what is going on right now. Like so many American  families, I watch with shock and dismay as to how many are setting  aside critical thinking in favor of an emotional mob that moves closer  and closer to a total Cultural Revolution takeover.   Should we have expected anything less from the Democratic Party as  they continue to run toward socialism and proudly embrace communist  beliefs?   Remember, we have seen this before. Chairman Mao knew that, to fully  seize control and build a socialist country, he needed to destroy our  ``four olds": old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits. The  Communists in China needed the Orwellian control of ``History has  stopped'' in 1966, and the Communists here in America need it today.   How else can they erase our ideas, culture, and customs in order to  impose their radical policies on all of us?   How much longer do we need to wait for their cries of ``Abolish  rent'' to become ``Jail the bourgeois landlord''? We already see  professors accused of wrong thinking for having the audacity to teach  or advocate for anything unapproved by the progressive mob. How long  until they are denounced as class traitors?   Does our Nation have flaws? Of course. But what is unique and is  perhaps the most beautiful part of our Nation is that we have the  ability to see those flaws, to change them, and to grow. And we do it  under the promise of liberty and justice for all.   We did that after the Civil War. We saw it again after World War II.  We saw that growth in the civil rights movement.   The reality of this leftwing ``cancel culture'' mob is that there is  no goal of debate. The goal is to shame, humiliate, and ridicule into  conformity through a vicious attack reminiscent of the Chinese  Communist Party struggle session. Liberty is under siege.   Just remember what happened in the opinion pages of the New York  Times for merely publishing an opinion that was held by the majority of  Americans but rejected by the progressive mob. Senator Cotton put  forward a well-researched op-ed--requested by the Times--that advocated  the President, only as a last resort, should use the Insurrection Act  to put down the terrorist activity we saw in too many cities over the  past few months.   Again, a national poll held that 58 percent of registered voters  agreed with Senator Cotton, but some reporters at the New York Times  and the progressive mob didn't. They raised such a protest that the  head of the editorial page issued an apology, claiming that it wasn't  to the standards of the Times, that it was too extreme. And that wasn't  enough for the mob. He was fired.   Before the ``cancel culture'' mob goes further still to embrace their  Presidential candidate--who has gone through enough twists and turns to  make sure that he, too, conforms to the progressive demands--we should  all remember our Nation was founded on liberty, and it will only endure  with true liberty. That means being willing to live together in the  midst of all kinds of diversity, especially diversity of thought.   So, as we began, we can't forget what this is all about: The  terrorists ran, unchecked, in Portland for 60 days. No one raced to  stop them. Federal officials had to step in because the State and local  governments wouldn't allow their law enforcement to police the riots.   Scenes like we saw in Portland will not happen in Oklahoma, but they  [[Page S4724]]  could happen in other cities where lawlessness is pervasive.  Thankfully, we have a President who stands up for law and order and for  our law enforcers.   Where would we be without our brave police and sheriffs? I hope we  never find that out.   With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, for the Committee on Armed Services I  report favorably the following nomination lists which were printed in  the Records on the dates indicated, and ask unanimous consent, to save  the expense of reprinting on the Executive Calendar that these  nominations lie at the Secretary's desk for the information of  Senators.
