 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney  Davis) for yielding me time.   Let me just tell you that this really is a monstrosity of a bill, the  ``Democratic Politician Protection Act.''   You see, H.R. 1 was referred to 10 committees, but only one marked it  up; 100 pages of this bill fell within the jurisdiction of the  Judiciary Committee. We had a hearing but we didn't get to mark it up,  which I think was designed--who knows why it was designed, but we  couldn't expose all the flaws of this bill.   Let me talk about two of them right now, because these both are  patterned after the Arizona law, oddly enough.   The Independent Arizona Redistricting Commission in Arizona, passed  by the voters, upheld by the United States Supreme Court, and guess  what. We are not going to qualify under this bill.   That redistricting commission produced, actually, a Democratic  majority, so we have a blue majority in the house now. But I tell you  what, the registration numbers all were for the red, but the IRC in  Arizona changed that.   But guess what. Under this bill, it is not good enough. It is going  to be taken out of the hands of the State and put in the hands of the  Federal Government.                                time  1630    That is a violation of the Constitution and the spirit of electoral  law and redistricting throughout the country.   Let me talk about this, having heard now that this is going to be not  from taxpayers but from lawbreakers who are going to fund this.   Arizona has something called the Citizens Clean Elections Commission.  I was there when that came out, funded ostensibly by lawbreakers who,  oddly enough, are taxpayers. They are taxpayers. And guess what else?  Arizona's courts have said they are taxpayers and that the whole scheme  was problematic.   That is what is happening with this particular bill. It is rife with  problems throughout, but these two problems really are dilatory to this  bill. I urge Members to vote ``no.''    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, since the United States has a very mobile  population--roughly 40 million Americans, or 14 percent of the United  States population, move each year--voters rarely inform elected  officials when they move, and voters can often be on the voter rolls in  two or even more different States at one time. Unless States have an  efficient way of communicating with one another, it is possible that  they may not be able to identify an individual who is on the rolls in  two different States.   This bill, H.R. 1, makes it more difficult for States to use systems  provided for under the National Voter Registration Act and under HAVA.  Under current law, States can send out cards and go through a process,  which was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in Ohio in  2018.   What my amendment does, simply, is require that new State residents  applying for a driver's license notify the State if they intend to use  their new residency for the purpose of voting; and if so, the amendment  would mandate that the new State notify the applicant's previous State  of residence so its chief election official can update voter lists  accordingly.   The amendment protects voters who are only making temporary moves to  another State, while enabling States to more efficiently manage the  voter registration file for the vast majority of applicants who are  making a permanent move to a new State.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
