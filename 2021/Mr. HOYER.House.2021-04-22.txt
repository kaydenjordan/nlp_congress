 Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong support of this  legislation.   I want to just briefly respond to the remarks of the gentleman who  preceded me about retrocession. Retrocession is an interesting idea  that my Republican colleagues have. It has to do with the issue of two  United States Senators. One could say that has to do with both sides of  the aisle, two United States Senators.   The history of adding States has been a history where focus is on  those two United States Senators that would be added, and the party  that wanted them and the party that didn't want them. But retrocession,  frankly, is an interesting idea, except for the fact the gentleman  talked about the Founding Fathers and James Madison and the Federalist  Papers.   One of the articles of debate was, if you had a State, i.e. Maryland,  whose land, of course, the Federal city is located on--Virginia gave  some, but they took it back--you would have a State surrounding the  Federal enclave. No difference, except for it would be Maryland and not  Washington, Douglass Commonwealth. So that argument limps. It fails  because you are suggesting the same thing that some have said is of  concern to them. So the only difference is two Senators.   So this is about politics. Throughout history people have guessed as  to what the new States are going to be. Now some knew absolutely. We  have North and South Dakota. I don't know whether any of you know why  we have North and South Dakota; two Senators versus four Senators. And  the Republicans who were in charge wanted to have four Senators to  assure their majority in the Senate as opposed to the Democrats in the  South. Ironic how things change.   So if you are voting on politics, I get it. But on principle, Nevada  was added and taken from Utah, by the way, because the Republicans who  were then in charge back in the day wanted to have two additional  Senators. And they got them, with less than 10,000 people living in the  area that was taken from Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado, and formed  Nevada.   So let's not get mired in these principled votes, because this is  about two Senators. We get it. It is not about principle because there  are over 700,000 people--712,000, to be exact, maybe more when we get  the Census report--who are unequal citizens in America.   I want to thank the incomparable Eleanor Holmes Norton for her hard  work and tireless advocacy for so many years as the leader of this  cause on behalf of equal rights for the citizens she represents without  a vote. Why, are they lesser citizens? Is she a lesser Representative?  Surely not.   If a President of the United States, Republican or Democrat, asked  somebody to come to the District of Columbia and work for the U.S.  Government, bring your talents, your energy, and your focus to work for  your country in Washington, D.C., but, oh, by the way, you have to give  up your vote in the Congress of the United States through your  Representative. In no other democracy are residents of the National  Capital excluded from representation. None.   Frankly, I think the Founders had no concept of how big this city  would become, how vibrant it would become. None. Yet, nearly 700,000  Americans are denied full representation.   The Founders of our Union of States set forth a simple process for  the admission of new States to that Union. They believed, the 13 of  them, that adding new States would be positive for the country and that  they would want people represented in the territories in the Congress  when they became States and qualified to be such. They saw that process  of expansion as both healthy and workable, and they believed that it  would strengthen our democracy.    Through the years, however, the admission of new States has been a  very contentious process on both sides of the aisle. And there was a  time in our history in the latter half of the 19th century when  Republicans affected the admission of a number of new States in order  to increase the numbers in the Senate. They accomplished that objective  in some respects.   In one noteworthy example, which I have just mentioned, Nevada in  1864, less than 10,000 people. The criteria at that point in time,  theoretically, was 60,000, but it was ignored. It was ignored. Two  Senators. That is what this issue is about. Two Senators.   It is not about whether, on a principled basis, we ought to give to  712,000 of our citizens the right to be equally represented in the  Congress of the United States. No, if they live here, we ask them to  give up that right.   That same process, as I mentioned, was repeated in the admission of  North and South Dakota. They had hardly any people living there. They  could hardly qualify if you put all of the Dakota territory together.  But what the Republicans did was--they were in charge at that point in  time--they divided it, North and South Dakota. What happened? Two extra  Senators. It wasn't about principle, about how many people, what the  economic status was. It was about how many Senators.   My friends across the aisle complain that this bill would lead to the  election of two additional Democratic Senators. So what?   Is that the criteria, the political judgment of the citizens of some  entity seeking to become a State? There is nothing in the Constitution  about that. Zero. It is the politics of it. I get it. But it is not the  principle.   I hope people vote on principle, that they believe that their fellow  citizens who happen to live within this, what used to be a square, but  a square minus that to the south of the Potomac.   This legislation is very different than the acts that admitted those  States in the 19th century. It is different because it is based on the  demonstrable need to provide representation to hundreds of thousands of  Americans who deserve to have their voices heard in our democracy. And  they have determined they want to be a part.   Our Founders were offended, indeed outraged that they were forced to  pay taxes, but were afforded no representation in the body that set  those taxes.  [[Page H2077]]  Wouldn't all of us have been there at the Tea Party saying, ``You  cannot tax us, England, without us having representation in the  Parliament''?   I am sure you have heard the argument from many people on this  floor--I won't repeat them--about the level of taxation that is paid by  the citizens of the District of Columbia. But they have no say in the  level of those taxes which so outraged our Founders.   Moreover, this legislation would end the unjust practice of treating  D.C. residents differently than their fellow citizens in the 50 States  when it comes to allocating resources or providing COVID-19 relief  under the CARES Act last year.   Mr. Speaker, when President Eisenhower--a Republican President, but  not a very partisan President, unlike today, where we have seen a very  partisan President, no longer there--addressed the question of  admitting Hawaii as a State in the 1950s, he said the following--and by  the way, I think all of you probably know that when Alaska and Hawaii  were admitted not too far apart in time, Alaska was perceived to be a  Democratic State and Hawaii was perceived to be a Republican State.   So the assumption that somehow the District of Columbia will  automatically elect two Democrats--which may be accurate, but it may  not always be the case--the principle is what Eisenhower articulated,  and he said this:         You have an economy that is self-supporting. There is a       large population, and I would like to see the case handled       clearly and specifically on its merits.    By that metric, Washington, D.C., earned its right to statehood a  long time ago. And today, we can take a major step toward that goal  when we pass this bill, which we passed last Congress as well.   As to retrocession, again, I wonder if Nevada would like to be back  to Utah or to Wyoming or to Colorado or whether Wyoming, that has  200,000 less citizens approximately than the District of Columbia,  would like to be subsumed by one of the surrounding States because of  the few numbers? Vermont as well, which was taken from another State,  as was West Virginia, which was part of Virginia.                                time  1015    I hope the Senate will then take up this bill when we pass it and  consider the question of D.C. statehood on its merits, not on politics.  Maybe that is too much to ask.   This is not a partisan math problem or electoral prediction, which,  as we have seen, may or may not come to pass. But on the merits alone,  on the conviction that taxation without representation is not fair now  as it was not fair in 1776, the people of this city, our Nation's  Capital, deserve full and equal representation in Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I hope that this bill will pass with bipartisan support.  It is going to pass, but I hope we have some bipartisan support based  upon the principle that every citizen in our country ought to enjoy the  same representation in the Congress of the United States as every other  citizen.
