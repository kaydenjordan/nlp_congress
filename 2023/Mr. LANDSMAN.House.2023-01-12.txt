 Madam Speaker, I rise today for the first time as a  Member of Congress to thank the folks back home in Cincinnati and  throughout the First Congressional District. I couldn't be more  energized to be serving all of you and the country that we love.   My commitment to you and my new colleagues, Madam Speaker, is to be  here as a new, transparent, bipartisan, and highly reliable leader.   We are already working with Republicans on legislative priorities  that will help our children and families back home to cap the costs of  insulin for children, to help folks pay their bills with an expanded  earned income tax credit and a child tax credit, and to provide  additional grants to communities to recruit more police officers and  firefighters.   There will always be more that unites us than divides us.   My work will continue to find common ground working across the aisle  to get things done on the issues that matter most to us.                            ____________________
