 Mr. President, let me tell you about Farmers State Bank  of Allen, OK. I know exactly where Allen, OK, is. I bet a bunch of  folks in this room do not. It is a small town, and this a small bank.  There is $43 million in total assets in that bank. That is a pretty  small bank, as banks go. It is located in a town of about 900  Oklahomans in total. The town has a number of small business owners,  farmers, and ranchers--folks that some people in this room fly over.  There are good families who live in that great town. Many of them have  great credit scores and have a good family history of repayment back to  the bank when they have taken loans, because that is the bank in town.  They have been longtime customers of this bank. In many instances, the  bank employees and the people in the bank have grown up together. They  know each other, but they also understand seasonal income.   When you are a farmer and rancher who doesn't come in with a W-2  every single week or every month--it comes in seasonally--they  understand the credit restrictions there.   A banker, named Debbie, at the Farmer State Bank of Allen wrote me  this and said:         Between the Ability to Repay and Global Cash Flow analysis,       particularly for a bank of this size, these new rules take       our time away from doing what needs to be done--caring for       our customers.        We have 12 employees and we're treated the same as JPMorgan       Chase, or Goldman Sachs--both of which have an entirely       different business model of operating. They do not operate in       towns of 900 [people]. . . . That's not their business model       or their kinds of markets        One of our key employees now spends most of her time on       compliance issues. Total costs for this employee, together       with the cost of the annual compliance audit [and everything       that goes with it is], now exceeds $100,000 annually.    Again, folks in big towns may not think it is a big issue to have  $100,000 in appliance costs, but the total net income of this bank for  the year is right at $500,000 a year, and $100,000 of it is now spent  on compliance.   How did this happen? This happened when Congress decided in 2010 to  pass something called Dodd-Frank. Dodd-Frank was a bill signed into law  in July of 2010 to deal with the financial crisis that happened in 2007  and 2008, which was real. The largest banks in our country took some  incredible risks. It caused a financial domino effect all over the  country, and it caused great risk for our international markets.   In response to that, Congress rose up with a strong Democratic  majority, and President Obama ran to it and said: We need to do  something.   They looped together as many different financial restrictions as they  could. They created a new thing called the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau, with no oversight at all. They created a whole  litany of new regulations and said: This will only be for the biggest  banks because they were the violators.   They put it out there, and then the regulations started flowing after  that. Guess what. Farmers State Bank of Allen, which was not the cause  of the financial collapse in America, is now caught up, and they are  struggling to survive as a bank. Because Congress decided they were  going to do something, the something ended up being something that is  devastating rural economies in my State.   Since the passage of Dodd-Frank, we have seen a 16-percent decline in  the total number of Oklahoma bank charters--just in my State. There is  a 35-percent decline in Oklahoma charter banks with less than $100  million in  [[Page S1538]]  total assets since Dodd-Frank. The effects of Dodd-Frank were felt  pretty quickly in Oklahoma. It was passed in 2010. By the 2013-to-2014  reporting time, more than 40 percent of the banks in Oklahoma no longer  did mortgage lending at all.   Let that soak in for a minute--banks that don't do mortgages. If you  are in a rural community, that is the bread and butter of normal  lending in that community--going to get a mortgage. But 40 percent of  the banks in Oklahoma, starting in about the 2013, 2014 reporting  cycle--just 3 or 4 years after Dodd-Frank passed--had already said the  compliance costs were so high and the complexity was so great that they  no longer offered mortgages and mortgage lending.   There are folks who say: We will just drive to a big city and go to a  big bank and get it, and they will still take care of that. Quite  frankly, that is what is happening. Dodd-Frank has done an excellent  job of increasing the size, power, and strength of the biggest banks in  America and has targeted the smallest banks in America. We are watching  mergers all over my State, as the smallest banks struggle under the  compliance costs. It almost looks like the design of Dodd-Frank was to  cause biggest banks to get bigger because the smallest banks would not  be able to survive under the compliance burdens that were then created  for them.   What does that look like in real life? Let me tell you about a  gentleman who I bumped into early Monday morning. He was flying out of  Oklahoma. I was sitting next to the gentleman, and were striking up a  conversation. He is a farmer and rancher in Oklahoma. He owns about 200  acres in North Central Oklahoma. He started to go through the purchase  process to actually buy that acreage and couldn't get mortgage lending  for it. No banks in the area would do it. Why? The Dodd-Frank  requirements. Suddenly, a guy in Oklahoma trying to buy 200 acres had  to find a way to scrape together $100,000 of cash to buy a ranch.   Now, 5 years ago, 10 years ago, or 15 years ago, if you wanted to get  that same ranch, you would go to the bank in town. Now the bank in town  has to tell you that you have to go somewhere else or find some other  way to do it because the restrictions are so high that they can't do it  anymore.   Local customers don't want to deal with someone else in another State  or in another city. They would like to deal with their local bank, but  they can't anymore. Oklahoma's community banks had nothing to do with  the financial collapse in 2008. Yet they have been penalized all the  way through this process.   In total, Dodd-Frank required more than 10 Federal agencies to write  more than 400 new rules, imposing 27,000 new mandates on financial  institutions of every size. Just process that. When you are Farmer  State Bank of Allen and you have 12 employees, you now have to track  27,000 new mandates to keep up with it.   How are you doing with that?   That is what real life looks like. I have had folks say to me: This  is some giveaway to the biggest banks.   What we are dealing with in this reform package is pretty  straightforward. The Wall Street Journal wrote an editorial earlier  this week saying that the bill ``eases administrative burdens on 5,000  community banks that make up 98% of the financial institutions but only  15% of the assets.''   Let me run that past you again. What we are dealing with deals with  98 percent of the banks, but of total banking assets in the country, it  is only 15 percent of the assets. That means the top 2 percent of the  banks in the country--the largest top 2 percent of the banks in the  country--have 85 percent of the assets. I understand the higher  regulations on those. They are significant. If they fail, they take  down the global economy. For the other 98 percent of the banks in the  country that have only 15 percent of the total assets in the country-- these are the smallest banks in the country--why are they being dragged  into this?   All we want to say is to allow local banks to be local banks again  and to be able to loan to their neighbors. These are the folks with  whom they go to church and are in Rotary Club, and with whom they have  grown up. They know their kids, and they know their families, but they  are dealing with all these arcane requirements. They are dealing with  27,000 new rules, and they just can't make it.   What does this look like in real life? Let me give you an  illustration from Legacy Bank in Elk City. Damon, from Legacy Bank in  Elk City, OK, said:         As a community banker, my job has become much more       difficult and burdensome to our customers. Legacy has always       strived to offer the best customer service a bank can offer.       I used to be a lender to all. However, with the changes that       have come about with this bill, along with the fines and       penalties that are a potential and, at times, don't use       common sense, I am now a commercial lender only.    Let that soak in for a second. At Legacy Bank in Elk City, he used to  make loans to everyone, and now he is a commercial lender only. What  does that look like in real life? I have folks who come to this floor  and people who catch me and say: Banks are still making lots of money,  and banks are doing just fine. Why is Dodd-Frank a problem?   Yes, banks are going to find a way to still do business. What has  happened? The biggest banks are loaning to corporate customers, and the  smallest banks that used to do small business lending and mortgages and  took care of their community can't do that anymore. So the big is  getting bigger and helping the biggest, and the small is not able to  help the small.    I thought we were supposed to be a country that helped everyone-- corporations or individual farmers and ranchers and citizens who are  trying to start small businesses. Let's get back to doing that again.  Let's not put 27,000 new restrictions on a small community bank and  tell it that it has to abide by everything that JPMorgan Chase does and  treat it as if it is the same. It is not.   There is Frazer Bank in Altus, about which my wife and I have a  longstanding saying: Everywhere you go in the world, you are going to  bump into somebody from Altus, OK. Try it sometime.   A local banker wrote: This past week in Altus, we had a local small  business owner who applied for a home mortgage loan. The customer had a  down payment and closing costs, but one of the key issues preventing  our bank from making this personal loan was the time constraint of 2  years of history. This is someone to whom we would have made a home  loan prior to Dodd-Frank, but now we cannot.   So a small business owner with closing cost money and with an ability  to repay is now blocked out. How serious is that?   Jim Hamby from Vision Bank in Ada wrote me and was trying to describe  exactly what this looks like.   He made the statement: Overly prescriptive rules on mortgage lending  are the big issue. The ability to repay and the rules governing that  topic are geared for people who are W-2 wage earners, not small  business people. Many small business people have already been denied  credit who would have otherwise qualified for a mortgage, and that is  bad policy. Any mortgage bank keeps its own books and should  automatically define what is a qualified mortgage. This would help  alleviate the ``ability to repay'' rule and allow us to take better  care of our customers.   Don't miss what he is saying there. The rules are written for people  who get a paycheck from week to week, not for the small business owner  and certainly not for the farmers and ranchers.   Here is a statement from a banker in Northwest Oklahoma who asked a  simple question: What about a $60 million bank in the northwest corner  of Oklahoma? What about other rural markets where smaller, traditional  community banks have completely abandoned lines of business and  products because the cost of regulation makes it so unprofitable or  because the price of regulation and risk from examiners and lawyers  bring so much additional scrutiny that you can't afford it?   One thing is certain. When banks are forced to leave lines of  business due to government regulation, both customers and communities  suffer. Even in markets in which there are other participants in the  abandoned product line, the reality is, with fewer competitors,  customers pay higher rates and higher fees for a simple service.   This is not a hard issue. For the 2 percent of the largest banks that  have  [[Page S1539]]  85 percent of the banking assets, I understand there is systemic risk  there. For the other 98 percent of the banks in the country that cover  15 percent total of all of the banking assets in the country, why are  they considered so systemically important that 27,000 new regulations  would need to come down on their 12 employees?   This is a good moment in which to get small towns in rural America  working again and to allow people to go down the street to the bankers  they know and went to school with rather than to have to drive to some  big city and talk to the biggest banks in America and have them try to  understand more about rural America.   We can fix this. I am looking forward to passing this reform and  allowing our banks not just to make money--they will find a way to make  money; they are businesses--but to actually get back to serving the  customers they want to serve again in a fair way--farmers and ranchers  and small businesses.   I yield the floor.
