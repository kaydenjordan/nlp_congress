 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, after Senate Republicans established the  principle that the Senate shouldn't consider Supreme Court nominations  in Presidential election years, on Saturday, President Trump nominated  Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court with less than 40 days left in  the Presidential election.   The Senate has never--never--confirmed a nominee to the Supreme Court  this close to a Presidential election. In fact, the election is already  underway, but President Trump gets to play by different rules under  this Republican majority.   By nominating Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, President  Trump has once again put Americans' healthcare in the crosshairs.  President Trump has promised to nominate Supreme Court Justices who  will ``terminate''--his words--our healthcare law. In Judge Barret,  President Trump has found the deciding vote.   Judge Barret strongly criticized the ruling to uphold the Affordable  Care Act, claiming that if Justices read the law the way she does, they  would ``have had to invalidate'' the entire healthcare law. Let me  repeat that: Judge Barrett strongly criticized Justice Roberts'  decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act, saying that ``he pushed  [the law] beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute.'' If  Justice Roberts had read the law the way Judge Barrett does, the  Supreme Court would have had to invalidate the entire Affordable Care  Act.   The Republican lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act, as everyone  knows, will be heard 1 week after the election. Senate Republicans are  rushing to jam Judge Barrett's confirmation through in time for her to  hear arguments in that very case. Not one for subtlety, President Trump  tweeted on Saturday that our healthcare law would be replaced ``if  terminated by the Supreme Court.''   So the American people should make no mistake, a vote by any Senator  for Judge Amy Coney Barrett is a vote to strike down the Affordable  Care Act and eliminate protections for millions of Americans with  preexisting conditions.   Judge Barrett's record also suggests that if she is confirmed, the  reproductive freedom of millions of women would be in grave danger.  Should Judge Amy Coney Barrett be confirmed, a far-right majority on  the Court could turn back the clock on women's rights and a woman's  right to choose, workers' rights, voting rights, civil rights,  environmental protections, LGBTQ rights, and many more. The future for  DACA recipients hangs in the balance as well.   So this nomination concerns no less than the fundamental rights of  the American people. After holding a Supreme Court vacancy open for 8  months before a Presidential election, President Trump and Leader  McConnell are doing what no Senate has done before--shamelessly rushing  to fill Justice Ginsburg's seat less than 40 days before the  Presidential election.   Justice Ginsburg's dying wish was that she not be replaced until a  new President is installed. Republicans are poised not only to ignore  her wishes, but to replace her with someone who could tear down  everything she had built.   This reprehensible power grab is a cynical attack on the legitimacy  of the Court, and I would strongly, strongly oppose this nomination.   The Senate Republican majority has decided, however, that they will  stop at nothing, break all the rules--even their own rules--to rush  this nomination through before the election. But apparently the Senate  majority isn't going to stop at naked hypocrisy. It is also going to  engage in manufactured hysterics.   For the past few weeks, long before President Trump even nominated  Judge Barrett, Senate Republicans have been telling everyone who will  listen that Democrats ``better not make Catholicism an issue in this  nomination.'' That is their quote.   Last week, a Member of this Chamber wrote me an entire letter  preemptively warning about anti-Catholic attacks against a nominee who  hadn't been named yet. Another Member of this Chamber said that ``in  Chuck Schumer's America--only atheists can be Supreme Court Justices.''   Of course, not a single Democrat will make these attacks or make  personal religious beliefs an issue, but that doesn't matter to my  Republican friends. Oh, no. They will try to slander Democrats with  this imaginary issue anyway because they are desperate for a  distraction. Republicans invented this concern because they are so  eager to make this nomination about anything other than their  disgraceful double standard--anything besides their attempts to take  away healthcare and curtail the fundamental rights of the American  people.   Honestly, it is embarrassing how transparent Republicans are being  about this manufactured line of attack. They couldn't even wait for a  Catholic nominee to be chosen. They already scripted the attacks.   The Senator from Tennessee is making wild allegations; the Senator  from Missouri is writing ridiculous letters; and my friend from Florida  is cutting videos decrying the kind of attacks on a person's faith that  haven't occurred since the political right was implying that our last  practicing Christian President, President Obama, was a secret Muslim.   I don't remember my Republican colleagues making a fuss when peaceful  protesters were tear-gassed so President Trump could hold the Bible  upside down in front of a church for a photo op.   I understand why certain Republicans are resorting to this disgusting  tactic: They have no other argument. They can't argue that this  nomination  [[Page S5889]]  could proceed because of some solemn constitutional duty because they  argued the exact opposite position 4 years ago.   They certainly can't argue the merits of Judge Barrett's position on  the Affordable Care Act because they know it is dreadfully unpopular  with the American people. No wonder--no wonder Republicans are so  desperate to talk about, literally, anything else.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, COVID-19, yesterday,  the House of Representatives unveiled legislation to provide $2.2  trillion in emergency funding to help the American people in the fight  against COVID-19.   The proposal includes a number of crucial provisions that families,  businesses, local leaders, and hospitals desperately need, including  $600 in weekly emergency unemployment insurance, funding for our  schools, support for State and local governments, assistance for  renters and homeowners, additional resources for testing and contact  tracing, and measures to strengthen the post office and complete the  census.   It includes important aid for transit systems, by the way, vital to  our Nation's economy. It includes crucial support for economic drivers  like restaurants, music venues, independent theaters, and more that we  have named in our Save Our Stages Act, and it includes critical  workplace standards and protections for our workers.   Is this new bill everything that Democrats want? No, but it is an  honest attempt to provide the relief our country needs and reach an  agreement by moving closer to our Republican colleagues who want to  provide much less relief, if they want to provide any at all.   Once again, the bill demonstrates the willingness on the part of  Democrats to compromise. COVID-19 remains the No. 1 issue in America.  Weekly unemployment claims are still through the roof. Schools are  struggling to adapt. Over 200,000 Americans have died. We are a long  way from putting this crisis in the rearview mirror.   But none of this seems to concern the Republican majority in the  Senate. As countless businesses are going under, as thousands continue  to get sick, as millions of Americans are waiting for the Senate to do  its job, Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans are moving at a  lightning pace to jam through a Supreme Court nominee--a nominee who  could rip healthcare away from tens of millions of Americans in the  middle of a pandemic.   Leader McConnell chose to put the Senate on pause for 4 months while  COVID devastated our country. Now Leader McConnell has the Senate on  fast-forward to rush through a partisan nomination to the Supreme  Court. It goes to show you the priorities on the other side of the  aisle.                            ____________________     Mr. President, one final matter: Over the weekend, the  New York Times reported that President Trump paid $750 in income taxes  in 2016 and nothing in 10 of the prior 15 years, largely because he  reported losing more money than he made. No New Yorker was at all  surprised by this report. All the hallmarks of President Trump's career  before and after politics are there: hyperbole, fraud, avoiding  responsibility, and pursuing selfish interests above all else. That is  President Trump in a nutshell.   The documents obtained by the New York Times showed a long history of  President Trump's egregious tax avoidance and potentially criminal  activity and include the astounding figure that the President owes more  than $500 million--$500 million--in personal obligations. Who does he  owe that money to? And $500 million is not chump change. Who does the  President owe $500 million to?   If President Trump wants another 4-year term as President, the people  have to know who President Trump is so deeply indebted to. These  documents reveal that President Trump was an abject failure in business  and a serial tax cheat.   We have already heard the President claim the reporting in the New  York Times is fake. Well, President Trump, put your tax returns where  your mouth is.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 551, S.  4653, a bill to protect the healthcare of hundreds of millions of  people of the United States and prevent efforts of the Department of  Justice to advocate courts to strike down the Patient Protection and  Affordable Care Act.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.  [[Page S5901]]     Mr. President, last night, President Trump delivered one  of the most disgraceful performances at a Presidential debate that  anyone has ever seen, and I do not mean that from a political  perspective; I mean it from a human perspective.   One can become inured to the President's tendency to melt down when  confronted with his facts, his brazen lack of self-awareness, his  stunning lack of regard for others, but it was maddening to watch the  President last night--angry and small--unable to show a scintilla of  respect, unable to follow even the most basic rules of human civility  or decorum, unwilling to constrain a stream of obvious falsehoods and  rightwing bile.   Shakespeare summed up in ``Macbeth'' Trump's performance last night-- ``a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying  nothing.''   Yes, President Trump's debate performance was, in the words of  ``Macbeth,'' a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,  signifying nothing.   In an hour and a half that felt like a lifetime, the President  managed to insult Vice President Biden's deceased son and smear his  living one, please a fringe White supremacist group, and cap the night  off by, yet again, casting doubt on our own elections--tarnishing our  own democracy. Those were just his worst moments. The rest of the  debate saw the President heap lies upon lies--lies big and small and  every size in between. This President and truth don't intersect at all.   Still, one moment stands out. When asked to condemn White supremacist  groups like the Proud Boys--classified as a hate group by the Southern  Poverty Law Center and called ``hard-core white supremacists'' by the  Anti-Defamation League--President Trump demurred and then said: ``Proud  Boys, stand back and stand by.''   ``Stand back and stand by.'   President Obama once wondered rhetorically: ``How hard is it to say  Nazis are bad?''   Apparently, for President Trump, it is beyond his capacity. In a  national debate, he not only refused to condemn a far-right group of  violent White supremacists, but he told them to stand by.   As much of the country was in despair last night at the President's  juvenile behavior, one group was celebrating--the Proud Boys. They are  who were celebrating President Trump's debate performance--White  supremacists. Within minutes of the President's comments, the Proud  Boys were online, rejoicing at the tacit endorsement of their violent  tactics by the President himself. They made logos out of the  President's remarks: ``Stand back and stand by.''   I just want to ask my Republican colleagues: How are you not  embarrassed that President Trump represents your party? How can you  possibly--possibly--support anyone who behaves this way? Are you  watching the same person we are? Are you listening? Are you not  embarrassed that millions of Americans watched President Trump and  thought: ``That is what the Republican Party stands for now''?   He can't express sympathy for the families of 200,000 Americans who  have died from COVID; can't go 30 seconds without interrupting someone  when he is not speaking; can't refrain from attacking someone's family  and pretending not to know a person's deceased son; can't honor the  military, defend democracy, respect elections, or tell the truth; can't  even make it through a debate without emboldening White supremacists.   How are you, my Senate colleagues, not deeply, utterly, personally  embarrassed that Donald Trump is a Republican? How are we not all  embarrassed that someone who behaved the way President Trump did last  night is our President? I know I am. How about you?   Again, this President is just amazing, and his speech last night--``a  tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.''                            ____________________     Mr. President, on SCOTUS, it is for this President that  Senate Republicans are now rushing through a Supreme Court nominee  nearly days before a national election. A Republican majority that once  argued the American people should be given a voice in the selection of  their next Supreme Court Justice is planning to confirm a nominee in  the middle of an election that is already underway. You could not  design a scenario that would more fully expose the Republicans' double  standard than this one. Of greater concern to the American people is  how the rush by Senate Republicans to confirm this nominee will put  their healthcare at risk.   Now, yesterday, the Republican leader actually mocked the idea that a  far-right Supreme Court majority might strike down the ACA and that  Judge Barrett's judicial philosophy might play a part in that. ``What a  joke,'' Senator McConnell said, that Justice Barrett might pose any  risk to Americans' healthcare.   I guess Judge Barrett must have been joking when she publicly  criticized Justice Roberts for upholding the Affordable Care Act. It  must have been with a sarcastic flick of the pen when she wrote that  the Supreme Court would ``have had to invalidate'' the law if it had  read the statute the way she does.   I will tell you what: This is not a joke to the American people. This  is not a joke to the 20 million Americans who could lose their health  insurance if the ACA is struck down--not a joke to the parents of a  child who has cancer and who would have to watch helplessly as their  child suffers if the protections for preexisting conditions are struck  down; not a joke to the millions of Americans on Medicare, whose drug  prices would soar; not a joke to women across the country who could,  once again, be charged more for health insurance than men, denied  maternity care, and free access to birth control.   The only joke here is the Republican leader's desperate attempt to  pretend that his President, his party, and their Supreme Court nominee  pose no threat to our Nation's healthcare law--the same Senate leader  who did everything he could on the floor of this Senate to repeal the  ACA.   President Trump said he will pick Supreme Court nominees who will  ``terminate the Affordable Care Act.'' His administration is in court  right now, suing to eliminate it. Senate Republicans tried to repeal  the law and replace it with nothing. The Republicans' lawsuit against  the Affordable Care Act will be heard by the Supreme Court during the  week after the election. There is a reason the Republicans are  scrambling to fill this seat so quickly, and Judge Barrett, when the  ACA was challenged in major litigation, twice before--twice--sided  against the law.   So, if the Republican leader believes that the Democrats are raising  unfounded fears about healthcare, will he urge the plaintiffs to drop  their lawsuit against the ACA? Will Leader McConnell urge the Justice  Department not to spend taxpayer dollars in trying to eliminate the  taxpayers' healthcare?   Normally these questions would be rhetorical, but yesterday I filed a  procedural motion that will set up a vote on a bill that would protect  the healthcare of hundreds of millions of Americans and prevent efforts  by the Department of Justice--Donald Trump's Department of Justice--to  advocate that courts strike down the Affordable Care Act. Leader  McConnell and all of my Republican colleagues will have to vote on that  shortly. Let me repeat. Leader McConnell and all of my Republican  colleagues will have to vote very soon on whether the Senate should  consider a bill to protect Americans with preexisting conditions. With  that vote, we will see just how much of a joke it is that Senate  Republicans and their Supreme Court nominees want to eliminate  Americans' healthcare.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
