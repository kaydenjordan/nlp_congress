 Mr. Speaker, Benjamin Franklin described the  limitations of any deliberative body in his closing speech to the  Constitutional Convention. He said: ``When you assemble a number of men  to have the advantage of their joint wisdom, you inevitably assemble  with those men all their prejudices, their passions, their errors of  opinion, their local interests, and their selfish views. From such an  assembly can a perfect production be expected?''   We have certainly approached these limits in our deliberations in  recent days, and I pause for a moment to assess where we are and where  we are going. The Roman Empire fell for many reasons, but the two most  prominent were that it destroyed its economy by overspending and failed  to secure its borders.   Clearly, these two self-inflicted calamities are converging right now  upon our country, and we are fast running out of time to avert them.  For this reason, House Republicans have sought, with the most slender  of majorities, to reverse these policies, albeit imperfectly.   A few weeks ago, we passed H.R. 2, the strongest border security bill  in a  [[Page H4937]]  century. Over the past months, our majority on the Appropriations  Committee has drafted the 12 appropriations bills, which bend  discretionary spending down and enact important reforms.   I admit that we are inexcusably late in that process. The approach of  the fiscal year, though, provided us impetus to complete this work.  Last week, we began taking up and adopting appropriations bills that  now comprise 70 percent of Federal discretionary spending on the eve of  an impending shutdown.                                time  1215    We have learned from experience that a government shutdown can be  administered in a manner that does enormous damage to the economy and  to the lives of millions of Americans.   The President, if he wishes, can destroy every small business on  Federal land and those adjacent to Federal land. Obama went so far as  to barricade every monument and memorial, chain the gates of every acre  of Federal land, and even barricade the turnouts overlooking Yosemite  Valley so that people couldn't even pull over to catch a glimpse of it.   Mr. Biden had made it very clear that he had intended to follow that  strategy, specifically designed to create a panic and to force an  immediate resolution in favor of the status quo.   Accordingly, our Conference put forward a 30-day continuing  resolution to avert a shutdown, while reducing nondefense discretionary  spending by 8 percent and enacting the border security bill that we had  previously passed.   Unfortunately, 21 Republicans joined House Democrats to defeat this  resolution. Now, out of time and faced with an imminent shutdown, our  Conference directed the Speaker to put a 45-day continuing resolution  on the floor without the previous reforms as the only way to avert a  shutdown and to continue our work to complete the appropriations  process. We canceled the October recess to complete this work.   Yet now we are faced with the threat that a Republican will move to  vacate the Republican Speaker of the House. It will only require four  other Republican Members to join the Democrats to achieve this result.  The immediate effect will be to paralyze the House indefinitely because  no other business can be taken up until a replacement is elected, just  when we are on the verge of completing the appropriations process that,  in turn, will finally initiate discussions with the Senate that are  vital to change the dangerous path that our country is on. I cannot  conceive of a more counterproductive and self-destructive course than  that.   The supreme irony is that this is being initiated by self-described  conservatives. Do they honestly believe that when the Democrats side  with them to remove a Republican Speaker that they will then side with  them to name a more conservative replacement? Of course, not.   The Democrats will certainly recruit the most liberal Republicans to  establish a left-of-center coalition to run the House. This is exactly  what happened in California in 1994. A coalition Speaker will move the  administration of the House sharply to the left and effectively end the  Republican House majority that the people elected in 2022.   I implore my Republican colleagues to look past their prejudices,  their passions, their errors of opinion, their local interests, and  their selfish views, and to make a wise decision when it is needed most  at this critical moment in the life of our country.                            ____________________
