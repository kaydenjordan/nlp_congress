 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor an exceptional North  Carolinian taken from us too soon, Conen Morgan.   Conen grew up in Wake County, where he developed a love for science  in middle school. He graduated from Garner High School and went on to  earn his bachelor of science degree in computer science from North  Carolina State.   He was a Kappa brother and embodied their motto: Achievement in every  field of human endeavor.   Like a Rube Goldberg machine, he was always doing so many different  creative things. Conen was an activist, scientist, teacher, graphic  artist, and entrepreneur. Occasionally, he did some politics, too.   He served as the 67th president of the Young Democrats of North  Carolina and worked on countless campaigns, including my own.   However, after his wife, Reyna, and his family and friends, his  greatest love was Science Olympiad. With over 30 years of service to  Science Olympiad, he gave back to the entire North Carolina community  by empowering young minds to explore science and find wonder in the  world.   His friends, his family, his political colleagues, and the tens of  thousands of students he reached will all miss Conen's smile, his  laugh, his compassion, and, most of all, his faith that if a kid like  him could succeed, every kid in our State should have the education  [[Page H2668]]  and opportunities they need so they could succeed, as well.   Rest in peace, Conen.                            ____________________
