 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about a crisis that  is gripping our Nation. This crisis is impacting the livelihoods of  hundreds of thousands of hardworking men and women, such as Border  Patrol agents, TSA agents, national park rangers, janitors, machinists,  and many more.   The crisis I am referring to, Mr. Speaker, is the reckless government  shutdown that now has gone into its third week.   We are the greatest country in the world. This should never, ever  happen in this country. It has left Americans without paychecks,  forcing many of them to seek donations from family, friends, and  strangers just to make ends meet.   In Arizona, my constituents have reached out to share their stories.  One Federal prison employee told my office that she planned to take out  a loan on their retirement in order to pay for groceries, bills, and  health insurance. Another, a scientist based in Arizona and working for  the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, wrote to me just yesterday to tell  me that she would have to take up dog walking, Uber driving, and other  part-time jobs just to cover the cost of her rent.   Neither of these Arizonans know what they will do if their paychecks  continue to be held hostage for political games.   Mr. Speaker, the American people don't deserve this. It goes beyond  the furloughed government workers. Small business owners and Arizona  farmers and ranchers, already hit hard by uncertainty in their global  trade partnerships, are being hurt by this.   There is agreement in this body and in the Senate on bipartisan  spending measures that open up our government and provide increased  funding for SMART, 21st century border security technology that has  been proven effective.   The administration has conjured up this crisis and devastated the  lives of countless Americans in the process, and it must end.   Mr. Speaker, these political games are hurting Arizona and our  country.                                time  1115                     Honoring Sheriff Kelly ``KC'' Clark     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank and honor Sheriff  Kelly ``KC'' Clark as he retires from three decades of service to  Navajo County and the State of Arizona. From his first post as a patrol  deputy in Winslow in 1989 to sheriff of Navajo County, KC has always  dedicated his career to ensuring victims receive justice.   Throughout his life, KC has served Arizona as the president of the  Arizona Narcotic Officers Association and three terms as president of  the Arizona County Attorney/Sheriff's Association. Additionally, KC is  a graduate of the FBI Academy 220th Session and the Drug Unit  Commanders Academy. He was named Sheriff of the Year by the WETIP  Foundation. On top of all of this, Sheriff Clark served on the Northern  Regional Advisory Committee for Homeland Security and is a commissioner  on the Arizona Criminal Justice Commission.   Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to call KC a friend. His service to our  great State is an inspiration to all public servants. I wish him and  his wife, Brenda, the very best as he retires from the police force,  and I know his commitment to serve in his community will not end.                            ____________________
