 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor and remember my  friend, the civil rights pioneer, Congressman John Lewis, a true gentle  giant among us.   He walked the talk, and we watched him walk the talk in these Halls  of Congress for many years, from his years as a student at Fisk  University to his last days as one of the most influential Members of  Congress.   He didn't let bad actors and people who were trying to do him harm or  even cancer slow him down from his fight for equality until the very  end.   He led many Members of Congress on that march in Selma, a civil  rights pilgrimage that my husband and I were honored to join him on a  couple of years ago when we went to Memphis, Montgomery, Birmingham,  and Selma. He walked the talk and walked with us and shared with us the  memories of that painful journey for him and all of those students and  all the people that he led across that bridge. He took our hands, and  we all walked together.   He then later that year came to Indianapolis, where he was the  keynote speaker because our community celebrated the Kennedy King  Memorial Initiative becoming a national historic site. Indianapolis was  the site where Senator Robert Kennedy informed our city that Dr. Martin  Luther King had been killed on that night 50 years ago.   It was in Indianapolis, in 1968, that John Lewis learned from Robert  Kennedy about Dr. King's death. Dr. King was his friend, his mentor,  and his hero. He had not been to this park in Indianapolis for 50  years, yet he came there as the keynote speaker. He brought together  our community--Democrats, Republicans, Hispanics, African Americans,  and White. Everyone stood together to hear his words, to honor him, and  to pay tribute to his legacy, to the legacy of Dr. King, and to the  legacy of Senator Robert Kennedy.   John was our friend. He walked the talk. He is walking in Heaven now.  He is showing us all how to walk the talk, and now it is up to us to  not let him down.  [[Page H3682]]
