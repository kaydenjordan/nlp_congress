 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on the  impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on our communities of  color across this nation. This virus has deeply impacted every segment  of our society, but the harms that have befallen certain populations  have been disproportionate and devastating.   For our Black, Latino, Indigenous, Asian, and immigrant families,  COVID-19 has exacerbated longstanding inequities in our health care and  economic systems, and our communities of color have been burdened with  higher rates of comorbidities, more barriers in accessing medical care,  and worse health outcomes due to this virus. This has been devastating  to observe, as many of these same communities have also been dealing  with significant economic turmoil in these recent months.   Never has our society faced a challenge such as this. These are truly  unprecedented times, and it merits our relentless efforts to lessen the  damages of this pandemic, which is expected to worsen during this  upcoming winter season. It is our responsibility as members of this  chamber to prevent the imminent disparate harms of COVID-19 on  communities of color. We must also address the systematic issues of  structural racism in our society, which affects the health and economic  wellbeing of our families.   Everyday, our nation sees the need for further action to combat this  public  [[Page H5760]]  health crisis. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting additional  federal assistance to fight this pandemic and protecting our  communities of color.
