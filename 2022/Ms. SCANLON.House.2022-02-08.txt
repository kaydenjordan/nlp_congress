 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a local hero  from the borough of Swarthmore, Dr. Harold Wilkinson.   Last month, at the age of 95, Dr. Wilkinson passed away peacefully in  his sleep after a long life of exploration, inquiry, and service.   Hal enlisted in the Army Air Corps at the age of 18 and served  stateside through the end of World War II. After meeting his wife,  Rosie, in medical school, the pair settled in Swarthmore, where he  opened a family medical practice and she worked as a pediatrician for  children with developmental disabilities.   For 42 years, Hal maintained his practice, serving generations of  Swarthmore residents. He was known for making house calls long after it  went out of fashion, continuing his service into his seventies.   After his wife, Rosie, passed away, Hal was lucky enough to marry  another local legend, Sandy Sparrow, a beloved former elementary school  principal with whom he continued to travel the world.   Dr. Wilkinson was a pillar of our community, an iconic figure who  could be seen strolling with his friends or his rescue dog, Dugan,  until late last year. A beloved friend to many, Hal was always  interested in hearing the latest updates from friends and neighbors and  exploring the world around him.   As the borough of Swarthmore mourns his passing, our hearts are with  Hal's family. We were all so lucky to have known him.                  Celebrating the Life of Octavius V. Catto     Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate a Philadelphia  hero, Octavius V. Catto.   If you come to Philadelphia, you will see a statue of Octavius Catto  on the south side of City Hall. It is the city's first public statue  honoring an individual African American.   Throughout his life, Catto was an outspoken activist for the  abolition of slavery and for equal rights for Black Americans. During  the Civil War, he joined Frederick Douglass and other Black leaders to  recruit African Americans to join the fight for emancipation. After the  war, Catto continued his advocacy and successfully fought to  desegregate Philadelphia's streetcars.   Catto was a man of many accomplishments. He graduated from the  Institute for Colored Youth, which is now Pennsylvania-05's own Cheyney  University, the first HBCU in the country. He also ran the undefeated  Pythian Baseball Club of Philadelphia, a Negro League baseball team  that played the first Black versus White game.   However, the most enduring part of Catto's legacy is his efforts to  secure the right to vote for Black Americans. He was a champion for  suffrage and fought to ensure that no one would be denied access to the  ballot box.   Ultimately, his life's work brought about Catto's untimely death. On  October 10, 1871, the first election day that Black men were allowed to  vote in Philadelphia, 32-year-old Catto was shot and killed by a White  mob trying to stop the Black vote.   Octavius Catto's life and sacrifice are an important reminder of the  importance of continuing his work and honoring his legacy today to  ensure that all Americans have the freedom to vote free from mob rule,  gerrymandering, and other efforts to silence their voices.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from the Rules  Committee for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, for as long as our country has existed, the United  States Postal Service has played a critical role in the function of our  country.   Whether delivering news or bills, medicine or ballots, income tax  refunds or in a few days maybe Valentines, Americans--our small  businesses and our State, national, and local governments--rely on the  post office and the essential daily services it provides.   The famous motto of the Postal Service is: ``Neither snow nor rain  nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift  completion of their appointed rounds.''   How glad we have been to see them completing those rounds during a  pandemic which limited our ability to get goods and services from other  places and which limited our ability in some cases to get to the  polling places.   While the U.S. Postal Service has always been essential, in the last  2 years it has been even more so, as it has helped us all to navigate a  highly transmissible virus.   Unfortunately, during that same time, we have seen the Postal Service  struggle to navigate a series of highly disruptive policy changes that  slowed service and financial constraints that have threatened its long- term health. Over the past 2 years I have heard from hundreds of  constituents about problems with the Postal Service, all asking: What  is Congress going to do about it?   This week, I am proud to support the Postal Service Reform Act, a  bipartisan bill that will improve the performance of the U.S. Postal  Service and guarantee its long-term financial health.   This bill will guarantee the Postal Service's 6-day delivery  standard, improve customer support, and provide customers with  increased transparency about their local service performance. Most  notably, the Postal Service Reform Act will finally end the--unique to  the Postal Service--statutory requirement that it prefund retiree  health benefits, relieving the Postal Service of this onerous and  unnecessary burden that has jeopardized the service's finances since it  was enacted 15 years ago.   These reforms which have been endorsed by the postal unions are  estimated to save the Postal Service nearly $50 billion over the next  10 years.   The U.S. Postal Service is one of the oldest, core responsibilities  of the Federal Government, and so I look forward to enthusiastically  voting for this bill to ensure its continued success in the 21st  century.   In addition, Mr. Speaker, today's rule also provides for  consideration of another continuing resolution to fund the government.  The House did its job. We passed our funding bills on time, and  Chairwoman DeLauro has pushed her Senate counterparts to begin  negotiations early so that a funding deal could be passed on time.  However, Senate Republicans have hemmed and hawed and stalled to avoid  negotiations because they prefer a CR to finding bipartisan compromise.  We are nearly halfway through the current fiscal year. I regret the  necessity of another CR, but I look forward to a quick resolution and a  vote on an omnibus funding bill.
