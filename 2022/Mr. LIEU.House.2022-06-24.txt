 Mr. Speaker, Democrats and Republicans are not the same.  While Democrats are working to pass this gun safety legislation for the  people, Republicans have whipped their Members to oppose it.   Democrats and Republicans are not the same. With the Supreme Court  handing down radical decisions, you have extreme MAGA Republicans  working to eliminate gun safety laws, while Democrats are working to  expand gun safety laws.   You have extreme MAGA Republicans calling for a nationwide criminal  abortion ban while Democrats are working to preserve Roe v. Wade.   Democrats and Republicans are not the same. I urge all Americans to  remember that this November.
