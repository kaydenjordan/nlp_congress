 Mr. Speaker, let's shed light on the  Republicans' broken promises to our veterans.  [[Page H2616]]    I have the privilege of serving as the ranking member of the normally  bipartisan Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations  Subcommittee. However, this year, my Republican colleagues plan to  slash medical care for toxic-exposed veterans, rolling back a promise  this body made just last year when we passed the bipartisan PACT Act  into law.   The PACT Act created the Toxic Exposures Fund, which is a pledge in  law to provide a dedicated funding source to ensure the care related to  toxic exposures will always be set aside and not have to compete with  other veterans' priorities at VA and other agencies.   As you can see in this chart from the Republicans' VA budget report,  President Biden honored this promise by carefully calculating the need  and proposing $20.3 billion for the TEF in his fiscal year 2024 budget.  The Republicans' bill only provides $5.5 billion, a quarter of the  request. Not only do they shortchange the TEF by $14.7 in 2024, but  Republicans completely eliminate it, they zeroed it out in 2025.   Republicans can protest all they want, but their broken promise to  our veterans is right here in black and white. We must keep our promise  to our veterans, just like Joe Biden and the Democrats do.                            ____________________
