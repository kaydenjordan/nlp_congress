 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and  applaud him and salute him as a constitutional scholar, an intellectual  resource, and the force of justice that he has been as he has crafted  and advanced this resolution.   I thank the entire House Democratic Caucus for their love of country,  determination to protect our democracy, and the loyalty to our oath  that had been so beautifully manifested in this dark past week.   Mr. Speaker, a dark week it has been indeed. On Wednesday, the  President of the United States incited a deadly insurrection against  America that targeted the very heart of our democracy, this temple of  democracy, the United States Capitol, defiling the genius of the  Constitution--separate but equal--attacking the first branch of  government, trying to prevent us from carrying out our constitutional  duty to ascertain that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will be President  and Vice President of the United States.   The gleeful desecration of the Capitol and the violence against  Congress, our staff, and our workers are horrors that will forever  stain our Nation's history. Five Americans have died following the  violent attack. More than 50 police officers were seriously injured,  including 15 officers who were hospitalized.   On behalf of the House, I salute and express deepest gratitude to the  U.S. Capitol Police for the valor that they showed in protecting the  lives of Members, especially protecting our staff and those who make  Congress function.   Mr. Speaker, this is a sad day for our country, that we have to come  to the floor in a way to defend the Constitution of the United States  at this time.   The facts are very clear: The President called for this seditious  attack. For days, he urged supporters to come to Washington for the  insurrection. Wednesday morning, he participated in a rally to  encourage the rioters to march on the Capitol and fight.   Not only did he urge people to march on the Capitol and fight, he  further fanned the flames, and he and his family cheered and celebrated  the desecration of the Capitol.   Later that day, as the dangers escalated, he ignored and then flat- out rejected the pleas of Congress, including those of his own party,  to call off his supporters--the rioters, the terrorists--as they  engaged in vandalism and violence.   Now, the President is saying that he is not responsible and that his  incitement to violence was totally appropriate.   The President's actions demonstrate his absolute inability to  discharge the most basic and fundamental powers and duties of his  office. Therefore, the President must be removed from office  immediately.   This is a decision we make with the utmost solemnity and  prayerfulness which this crisis requires. Removal of the President is  an unprecedented action, but it is required because it is an  unprecedented moment in history because of the danger that he poses.   I heard the previous speaker say that we are objecting to the  President because we don't like the way he executes his duties. No, we  don't like it at all: acts of sedition, incitement to insurrection,  treasonous activity. If you are associating yourself with that as the  proper execution of the President's duties, then you are associating  yourself with sedition and treason.   Yesterday, in a pro forma session, we introduced a unanimous consent  request to take up Congressman Raskin's legislation, which calls on the  Vice President to mobilize the Cabinet to activate the 25th Amendment  to remove the President from office, again, to prevent him from causing  more damage to our country. Who knows what he might do next?   But House Republicans rejected this legislation. So the President's  unhinged, unstable, deranged acts of sedition may continue, endangering  America and undermining our democracy.   Now we are taking up this legislation in regular session. After  passage, we are calling on the Vice President to respond within 24  hours of passage. This resolution gives House Republicans the clear  choice to honor the oath of office, to defend our democracy, and to  uphold the sacred trust given to us by the Constitution and by those  whom we represent.   Mr. Speaker, during the Trump Presidency, these 4 years, and  especially during this sad time, I recall the words of the great  Israeli poet Ehud Manor when he said:       I can't keep silent in light of      How my country's changed her face      Won't quit trying to remind her      In her ears, I'll sing my cries      Until she opens her eyes.       ``I can't keep silent in light of how my country's changed             her face.'' I urge my Republican colleagues to open             their eyes and to finally hold this President             accountable. The security of our country and the future             of our very democracy are at stake.   When we pray for God to bless America, let us hope that that blessing  comes down strongly on us in the next few days.   Again, Mr. Speaker, I applaud the great leadership of Mr. Raskin.                                time  2130
