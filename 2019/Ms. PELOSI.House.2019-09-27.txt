 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank the chairman for making that very important point about the  quality of life of the families of our men and women in uniform, which  appears to have been demeaned by our colleagues.   Mr. Speaker, Members of Congress take a sacred oath to support and  defend the Constitution and to protect the American people. Today the  House honors that oath with this resolution to defend our national  security and our Constitution's system of checks and balances: the  guardrails created by our Founders to safeguard our Republic.   The President's decision to cancel $3.6 billion for military  construction to pay for his wasteful wall makes America less safe. The  administration is stealing funds from 127 initiatives in 21 countries,  23 States, and three territories, stooping so low as to steal from a  middle school at Fort Campbell in Kentucky.   A recent U.S. Air Force report shows that canceling these projects  hurts our national security worldwide, including in Europe where the  President is canceling construction for the European defense initiative  which deters Russian aggression. The President is canceling a project  which deters Russian aggression. That makes the Russians very happy.   In the Middle East he is canceling maintenance at a key base to  protect our troops from--in the words of this Air Force report--hostile  penetration in the midst of contingency operations and an increased  terrorist threat.   In the Pacific he is canceling construction on storage facilities in  Guam for more than $1 billion in munitions, the largest stockpile in  the region; and in North America he is canceling repairs which are  based in Alaska which are needed to prevent an explosion that would  cause a full evacuation and require millions of dollars of repair.                                time  1000    That decision also disrespects military families, as our  distinguished chair, Mr. DeFazio, mentioned.   A coalition of leading education, labor, and veterans organizations  wrote to the President to express their ``profound concern,'' saying,  ``Our troops and their families deserve much better for their  sacrifices.''   The President had said Mexico will pay for his wall, not military  families.   The administration's decision also dishonors the Constitution by  negating its most fundamental principle, the separation of powers, in  an assault on our power of the purse. It does great violence to our  Constitution and our democracy and strikes at the heart of our  Founder's conception of America, which demands a separation of powers.   Indeed, many White House decisions that have recently come to light  show this same disdain and disregard for the Constitution.   Today, we join the Senate--congratulations to the Senate--in a  bipartisan way to restore our system of checks and balances and  reassert Congress' constitutional responsibilities.   This issue transcends partisan politics. All Members take the oath to  protect and defend. We continue to urge House Republicans to join us to  uphold the Constitution and defend and support our national security.
