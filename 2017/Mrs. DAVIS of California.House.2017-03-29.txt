 Mr. Speaker, it looks like my colleagues  have wasted no time moving back to familiar territory after their  healthcare disaster last week.   Instead of fighting over how many people should lose health coverage,  they decided that it is easier to unite around the shared cause of  climate denial. This week President Trump announced plans to gut  President Obama's landmark Clean Power Plan, and the House will vote on  legislation to block the EPA from reviewing peer reviewed scientific  research when forming regulations.   So think about that for a second--the majority couldn't agree on how  many people should lose healthcare coverage; so they are united around  the shared cause of climate denial. The President likes to claim that  climate change is a hoax created by the Chinese.   Well, I know that the President and his party have developed a  disdain for fact-checkers, but silencing the scientific community takes  things to a whole new level.   Mr. Speaker, I have to ask: Can my colleagues handle the truth?                            ____________________
