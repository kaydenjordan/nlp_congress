 Mr. President, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  Hearing on Russia's role in Syria and the broader Middle East that had  been scheduled for last week has been postponed; therefore, I rise  today to raise awareness on the danger and urgency of the moment, given  the impending humanitarian catastrophe in Idlib, Syria, and the refusal  of the Trump administration to impose meaningful costs on Russia for  protecting Bashar al-Assad and his regime.   On Syria, Congress again finds itself in a situation where we often  hear more from the press than we do directly from the administration.  Last week many of us read with interest in the Washington Post a report  that President Trump agreed to a new strategy for Syria that  indefinitely extends the U.S. military presence and supports a major  diplomatic push to end the conflict. This same article also indicated  that the administration views the military campaign against ISIS as  nearly complete and that U.S. goals have now shifted to Iran's presence  in Syria given the doubts that Russia is willing and capable of  ejecting Iran from Syria.   Congress and the American people deserve to hear directly from the  Trump administration whether in fact this is our new strategy. When  this hearing is rescheduled, I expect the administration to explain in  detail its proposed diplomatic engagement and the plan for U.S. forces  in Syria after ISIS is defeated. I also want to know what specific  tools the administration proposes to use to ensure the removal of Iran  from Syria; compel the Assad regime to cease and Russia to cease  support for the bombing, torture, and gassing of Syrian civilians; and  hold Assad's brutal regime to account for its crimes against the Syrian  people, as well as consequences for the Kremlin's support of this  brutal regime.   In my view, Russia is fully culpable for perpetuating the war in  Syria and rendering that country persistently unstable, a magnet for  violent extremists and a direct threat to Israel.   Now more than ever, we must shine a light on Russia's role in  perpetuating the conflict in Syria, as well as Russia's role in the  region. And while we still await details on the disastrous and  embarrassing Helsinki summit between Presidents Trump and Putin, I am  deeply concerned that for the Syrian people Helsinki made a bad  situation worse.   I fear that President Trump did not raise Russia's war crimes in  Syria, such as Russian aircraft dropping Russian bombs in densely  populated areas of Syria. I doubt that President Trump called Putin out  for violating the deescalation agreement in southern Syria, agreed to  last year by the United States, Russia, and Jordan. I am skeptical that  President Trump pressed Putin to commit to delivering Assad to  participate in good faith at the UN-led process for a negotiated  settlement along the lines of Security Council Resolution 2254. I doubt  that President Trump insisted that Russia break its sinister alliance  with Tehran that has enabled the survival of Assad in Syria and  threatened the security of Israel. And I see no indication that the  administration is using any of the tools Congress has given it-- including mandatory sanctions provisions in the Countering American  Adversaries Through Sanctions Act of 2017, CAATSA--to change the status  quo in Syria or prevent the looming assault on Idlib province, where  Russia is already engaged in a bombing campaign alongside its client  Assad.   It seems to me that the administration is taking a backseat--or maybe  has gotten out of the car entirely--while the Assad-Russia-Iran  alliance is left unchallenged to starve, torture, and bomb the Syrian  people into submission.   While the humanitarian dimensions of this tragedy are reason enough  for the administration to take a different approach, there are  significant strategic consequences for allowing or enabling an Assad- Russia-Iran partnership to solidify as a salient feature of the  landscape of the Middle East. But instead of U.S. leadership shaping  the region, we have instead Vladimir Putin--the man who has long  ensured Bashar al-Assad's survival--flying around the Middle East  completing deals for base access and weapons sales. And rather than  utilize the threat of CAATSA sanctions to compel U.S. partners in the  Arab world to cease significant purchases from the Russian defense and  intelligence sectors, the administration instead sought a national  security waiver for this provision of the law.   While the United States has backed away from its key leadership role  in addressing the region's conflicts, governments in the Middle East  rolled out the red carpet for Putin and flocked to Russia during the  World Cup to sit by his side and sign agreements for increased  cooperation.   Putin can only take away one message from this posture by the Trump  administration: Russian activities and influence in the Middle East  will not be challenged in any meaningful way by the United States.  [[Page S6184]]    With so many vital U.S. national security interests at stake in the  region--including the safety and effectiveness of our troops fighting  ISIS--this leadership vacuum risks outcomes that serve only Russia's  interests, not our own.   While President Trump may believe that Russian hegemony in the Middle  East and Russian partnership with Iran is not a cause for concern, I am  deeply alarmed that we are on the road to a series of outcomes in Syria  that will be as catastrophic in human terms as they will be  strategically ruinous for U.S. interests and values for years to come.                            ____________________
