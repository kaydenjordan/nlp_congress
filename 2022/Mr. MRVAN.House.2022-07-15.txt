 Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my support for  research activities to prevent child sexual abuse under the CDC's  National Center for Injury Prevention and Control.   Throughout my career, it has been a top priority of mine to protect  the most vulnerable populations in our communities, including children  impacted from sexual abuse.   For the second year in a row, I was proud to lead a letter to the  House Appropriations Committee in support of these research activities.  Thank you to all 30 Members who joined me in this initiative as well as  the leaders of the Appropriations Committee for the increase in  funding.   I appreciate the report language that recognizes the severe and often  lifelong physical, cognitive, and emotional impact of child sexual  abuse and the value of this research to increase the understanding of  risk and factors that can improve prevention efforts.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to continuing to work with my  colleagues to ensure that all children can thrive in a safe and healthy  environment.                            ____________________
