 Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentleman's comments and all  the ideas of others with regard to this out of control agency and I  share his passion for bringing the CFPB under Appropriations oversight  as soon as possible. This is one idea of many, and I look forward to  working with the gentleman from Nevada and others in the near future as  we work to protect consumers from this rogue agency in some form or  fashion.
