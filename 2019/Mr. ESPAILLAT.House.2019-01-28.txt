 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Juan  Pablo Duarte, the founding father of the Dominican Republic. Duarte was  instrumental in the war of Dominican independence, and he fought for a  liberal democracy.   January 26, this past Saturday, marked Duarte's birthday, a day that  is celebrated in the Dominican Republic as a national holiday, and  Dominicans celebrated it across the world.   Last week, I introduced H. Res. 64, which supports the ideals of Juan  Pablo Duarte Day, and urges the recognition of this day in the United  States, as many Dominican Americans celebrate here as well.   This resolution is one of three I introduced last week to mark the  beginning of Dominican Heritage Month to honor the Dominican American  community in my district and across the country.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that my many colleagues join me in recognizing  this important day and the contributions of Dominican Americans across  the United States.                            ____________________
