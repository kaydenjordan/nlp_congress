 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday I met with President Trump's  nominee for the Supreme Court, Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Our conversation  covered many different topics. Unfortunately, Judge Kavanaugh refused  to answer even the most basic questions about his jurisprudence.   He refused to say if he believed Roe was correctly decided. He  refused to say if he believed Casey was correctly decided. He could not  name for me a restriction on a woman's right to choose that he would  consider an undue burden. Even when I asked him if a ban on abortion  after only 4 to 6 weeks would be an undue burden, he said he couldn't  answer that.   He could not tell me if he believed the Affordable Care Act was  constitutional. Nor would he answer or recall his level of involvement  in a number of controversies during his time in the Bush White House, a  portion of his record the Senate has been denied access to by the  Republican majority.   Now, I understand the imperative all judges face not to bias  themselves by commenting on cases that could come before their court,  but these are some basic questions of already decided cases.  Furthermore, I told Judge Kavanaugh that he is in a different place  than others.   President Trump has said that he will only appoint nominees who will  undo Roe v. Wade. President Trump has said he will only appoint  nominees who will declare the ACA unconstitutional. Judge Kavanaugh is  under a burden to refute that.   I asked him if, even when he sat with the President, did he tell the  President not to count on him, that he will not absolutely vote to  repeal Roe. He didn't.   So Kavanaugh has a burden beyond that of a normal Justice because of  what President Trump, the person who selected him, has said  unequivocally.   So here is Justice Kavanaugh's silence or refusal to commit to even  the most common things that should be said. He said he would say Brown  was correctly decided. Why can't he say Roe was correctly decided?  There is his silence, especially given his recent praises of dissent in  Roe and Casey. In 2016 and 2017 he praised Justice Rehnquist and  Justice Scalia's views that Casey and Roe were decided wrongly. What is  anyone supposed to reasonably believe?   Given that President Trump said that he will only choose people who  will repeal Roe and declare ACA unconstitutional, given that he has  praised the dissents in Roe and Casey, the fact that he was unwilling  to refute any of that in any way or to even say that a limit on  abortion after 4 weeks was an undue burden should raise real questions  for any American who believes in choice and who believes in the  constitutionality of government helping with healthcare, including  preexisting conditions.   Then, there is one issue we discussed yesterday that took on a whole  new light mere minutes after our discussion concluded. I asked Judge  Kavanaugh about his remarkably expansive views on executive authority.  As context, Judge Kavanaugh has said that Presidents should not be  subject to criminal or civil investigations while in office. He said  the only remedy for a President who committed a serious crime is  impeachment by Congress.   So I asked Judge Kavanaugh a more basic question: Does he believe  that a sitting President must comply with a subpoena or testify or  provide records? He would not say that the President must comply with a  subpoena.   I asked him that in the most extreme situation: In a criminal  investigation  [[Page S5793]]  against a sitting President, where our national security is at stake,  could the investigator subpoena the President? He wouldn't say he  would.   Now, that was before the news that broke late yesterday. During our  meeting, actually, the news broke that President Trump's former  personal attorney, Michael Cohen, implicated the President in a  violation of campaign finance laws.   The sequence of those two events--Kavanaugh's refusal to say that a  President must comply with a duly issued subpoena and Michael Cohen's  implication of the President in a Federal crime--makes the danger of  Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court abundantly clear. It  is a game changer. It should be.   The President, identified as an unindicted coconspirator of a Federal  crime--an accusation made not by a political enemy but by the closest  of his own confidants--is on the verge of making a lifetime appointment  to the Supreme Court, a court that may someday soon determine the  extent of the President's legal jeopardy.    In my view, the Senate Judiciary Committee should immediately pause  the consideration of the Kavanaugh nomination.   The majority of the Senate has still not seen the bulk of Judge  Kavanaugh's record. At the very least--the very least--it is unseemly  for the President of the United States to be picking a Supreme Court  Justice who could soon be, effectively, a juror in a case involving the  President himself.   In light of these facts, I believe Chairman Grassley has scheduled a  hearing for Judge Kavanaugh too soon, and I am calling on him to delay  the hearing.   I know that Chairman Grassley and Leader McConnell hold all the cards  in terms of scheduling hearings, but the plain facts of the case should  compel them to the same conclusion I have reached--that the Judiciary  Committee should postpone Judge Kavanaugh's hearings.   At this moment in our Nation's history, the Senate should not confirm  a man to the bench who believes that Presidents are virtually beyond  accountability, even in criminal cases, and a man who believes that  Presidents are virtually above the law and that only Congress can check  a President's power.   Over the past year, despite numerous abuses of Presidential  authority, despite numerous encroachments on the separation of powers,  despite numerous attacks on the rule of law, this Republican Congress  has done almost nothing--nothing--to check this President. If Congress  can be captured by one party's deference to the President, we cannot  allow the Supreme Court to be captured as well.   The doubts about Judge Kavanaugh's fitness for the bench were just  magnified by Mr. Cohen's plea agreement. The prospect of the President  being implicated in some criminal case is no longer a hypothetical that  can be dismissed. It is very real.   If Judge Kavanaugh truly believes that no sitting President,  including President Trump, must answer for crimes he may or may not  have committed, then he should not become Justice Kavanaugh with the  power to make those views manifest in our books of law.   More broadly, yesterday's news has blackened an already dark cloud  hanging over this administration. In addition to Mr. Cohen's  implication of the President, Paul Manafort was convicted of violating  Federal law on eight different counts in this trail, his first of two  trials.   To take a step back, President Trump's campaign manager was convicted  of Federal crimes. President Trump's personal attorney pled guilty to  Federal crimes. President Trump's first National Security Advisor pled  guilty to Federal crimes. A foreign policy advisor to his campaign pled  guilty to Federal crimes, and more trials are coming.   Cabinet officials have been forced to resign for flagrant graft and  profligacy funded by the American taxpayer. That is to say nothing of  the fact that the first two congressional endorsements of President  Trump's campaign came from two Congressmen who have recently been  indicted on counts of insider trading and campaign finance violations-- what a swamp, what a swamp. It is far worse than the swamp that existed  when President Trump took over. He has not cleaned the swamp. He has  made it more retched and more fetid.   No one in America can dismiss what has happened as the actions of a  few bad apples. There is a cesspool around this President. There is now  an unmistakable sinister hypocrisy to President Trump's campaign  slogan: Drain the swamp. President Trump brought the worst swamp we  have seen in Washington's history to town when he came here.   Yesterday's news leads me to make two points. First, Special Counsel  Mueller's investigation is clearly doing what it was constituted to do  and finding criminal activity in the process. Already there have been  four guilty pleas or verdicts and dozens of indictments. The idea of  calling Special Counsel Mueller's investigation a witch hunt was  already absurd and laughable, and it becomes even more so today.   Second, the President should not even consider pardoning Mr. Manafort  or Mr. Cohen at any point in the future. To do so would be the most  flagrant abuse of pardon power and a clear obstruction of justice.   The Rosenstein-Mueller investigation must be permitted to conclude  its work, and the President must resist the impulse to interfere with  pardons, dismissals, or any other action that prevents the work of the  Justice Department from going forward.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
