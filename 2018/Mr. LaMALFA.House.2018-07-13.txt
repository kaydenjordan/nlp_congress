 Mr. Speaker, the Endangered Species Act was passed 45  years ago. We have seen a recovery of approximately 2 to 3 percent of  species since then, but when the baseball All-Star Game is in town,  nobody is an all-star at 3 percent.   In my home State of California, an increasing trillions of gallons of  fresh drinking water flow unused into the ocean, still fish species  don't recover with all this new water introduced in the last 30 years.  People's needs are decimated as people need to ask for a glass of water  in a restaurant or soon decide if they will shower or wash clothes on a  given day in their homes. Electricity is much more expensive than need  be.   Home prices are so high in California, people cannot even live where  they work, in many cases sometimes commuting 3 hours to where they  work. No new lands, they say, are suitable other than building on ag  land or on floodplains. This, while the State attempts to commit tax  dollars to what they deem affordable housing.   The ESA back then that was passed with bipartisan support in 1973 was  well-intentioned, we all agree, on preserving species. Liberal courts,  nongovernmental organizations, and complicit Federal agencies have  weaponized it to stop productive Americans, harm jobs, and increase  imports.   The Congressional Western Caucus has a package of modest reforms to  reset back to bipartisan goals of the Endangered Species Act, but we  will hear how it is gutting the ESA when it is, instead, a series of  course corrections applied to a 45-year-old law that has been  reinterpreted and weaponized--accountability, transparency in data use,  how it is gathered, how success is measured, instead of just being a  roadblock for no-growthers, lawyers, and environmental groups.   Mr. Speaker, I commend the Congressional Western Caucus Chairman  Gosar and Mr. Bishop for their work in  [[Page H6179]]  this effort in making this happen and, hopefully, being fruitful in  adjusting the Endangered Species Act.                            ____________________
