 Mr. Speaker, Article I, Section 27 of the Pennsylvania  Constitution reads: ``The people have a right to clean air, pure water,  and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic, and esthetic  values of the environment. Pennsylvania's public natural resources are  the common property of all the people.''   Pure water, it doesn't get any more basic than that. But for years,  constituents in my district in towns like Horsham, Willow Grove, North  Hills, and Upper Dublin have worried about the quality of their water  and the impact of that water on their health and their family's health.  Like citizens who live near military bases across the country, their  water supplies have been contaminated with a class of manmade chemicals  known as PFAS.   Unfortunately, government has been slow to act. The EPA has attempted  to block research showing just how dangerous these chemicals really  are. Testing and cleanup have been insufficient, and, now, day 33 of  the administration's shutdown, 93 percent of EPA workers are  furloughed, challenging our ability to deal with this and other  important issues.   But today, we in the Congress have launched a bipartisan PFAS Task  Force. I invite all Members of Congress to work with us on this matter  of genuine national concern.                            ____________________
