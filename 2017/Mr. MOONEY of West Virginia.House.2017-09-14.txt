 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the  football players of Clay and Braxton County High Schools, both in my  congressional district, the Second District of beautiful West Virginia.  I commend them for exercising their right to pray before a football  game on September 1.   After one person complained about prayer at football games, Clay  County High School decided to institute a moment of silence instead.  Much to everyone's surprise, during that moment of silence, both teams  ran onto the field, knelt, and prayed together. In a spontaneous action  throughout the stands, individuals stood and joined the prayer.   In this time of great divisiveness in our Nation, gestures like these  remind us about what is great in America. Our First Amendment protects  all Americans from laws that hinder our religious freedom, our right to  free speech, and our right to worship God as we see fit.   Even though Braxton and Clay County are bitter rivals in football,  they came together to share this moment to worship the Almighty God. I  commend them for this gesture.   For the record, Braxton County won the game 23-13.   To the gentleman from Texas, thank you. I appreciate your good work  here and your words for the American people.
