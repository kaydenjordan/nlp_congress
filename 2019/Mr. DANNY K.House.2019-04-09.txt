 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the  rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1759) to amend title III of the Social  Security Act to extend reemployment services and eligibility  assessments to all claimants for unemployment compensation, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1759         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Building on Reemployment       Improvements to Deliver Good Employment for Workers Act'' or       the ``BRIDGE for Workers Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-123)       improved program accountability for effectively serving       unemployed workers and made a significant new investment in       reemployment services.        (2) Research shows the longer workers are out of work, the       harder it can be to maintain their skills, professional       network, and stable home life.        (3) Reemployment services give workers who might otherwise       struggle to find new jobs the tools that they need to get       back to work--such as individualized career counseling and       job search help as well as local labor market information--      and they can serve as an entry point to the workforce       development system.        (4) Reemployment services have been demonstrated to reduce       the number of weeks that program participants receive       unemployment benefits by improving their employment outcomes,       including earnings.        (5) Unemployment benefits replace less than half of working       income, on average, so workers who find new jobs quickly       suffer less financial hardship.        (6) Combining targeted reemployment services with       unemployment benefits helps keep people attached to the labor       force who might otherwise become discouraged and drop out.        (7) The Congressional Budget Office estimates that, over       time, investments in reemployment services create savings for       taxpayers and unemployment trust funds by reducing spending       on unemployment benefits.        (8) Many different types of workers can benefit from       reemployment services. Reemployment services should be used       to shorten the duration of unemployment for workers even if       they are not projected to fully exhaust their unemployment       benefits.       SEC. 3. ELIGIBILITY FOR REEMPLOYMENT SERVICES.         Section 306(a) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.       506(a)) is amended--        (1) by striking ``individuals referred to reemployment       services as described in section 303(j)'' and inserting       ``claimants for unemployment compensation, including       claimants referred to reemployment services as described in       section 303(j),''; and        (2) by striking ``such individuals'' and inserting ``such       claimants''.     DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1759, the BRIDGE for Workers Act, continues our  committee's bipartisan work to help Americans who are receiving earned  unemployment insurance benefits to get back to work faster.   Unemployment benefits are a vital lifeline for Americans who have  lost their jobs, helping them keep the lights on and pay the rent while  they search for work. But unemployment benefits replace less than half  of a worker's paycheck, on average. Especially for lower paid workers,  who may not have any savings to fall back on, the best outcome is to  find a new job as quickly as possible.   When you lose your job, it can be difficult to find a new one,  especially if you are older, haven't looked for a job in a long time,  or have made mistakes in the past. Reemployment services give people  looking for help the personal help they need to overcome those  barriers.   For instance, States might provide assistance targeted to a  claimant's needs, things like customized career and labor market  information, help with application materials, or allowing them to  practice for tough job interviews.   Last year, we passed important legislation to improve reemployment  services and eligibility assessment grants, or RESEAs. Our legislation  added important worker protections, gave States incentives to improve  the quality of the services being provided for workers, and ensured  that sufficient funding is available in every State and territory.   When I asked how RESEA grants were being used in my home State of  Illinois, they told me about Tara, who struggled to find a new job  after she was laid off, both because her skills weren't up to date for  the current labor market and because she had a criminal record. The  Illinois RESEA helped her upgrade her job skills and find a job with an  employer willing to take a chance, a chance on someone who had made  mistakes. She is now working and going to school to get an associate's  degree in welding, so she will have better pay and benefits in the  future.   The BRIDGE for Workers Act would add important and needed flexibility  to allow States to serve all workers who could benefit from  reemployment services, not just those who are expected to run out of  benefits before finding work.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the National  Association of State Workforce Agencies endorsing the BRIDGE for  Workers Act.                                       National Association of State                                              Workforce Agencies,                                     Washington, DC, March 13, 2019.      Hon. Stephanie Murphy,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Jackie Walorski,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Xochitl Torres Small,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Darin LaHood,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representatives Murphy, Walorski, Torres Small and       LaHood: We are writing on behalf of the National Association       of State Workforce Agencies  [[Page H3149]]       (NASWA) to endorse the BRIDGE for Workers Act and express our       appreciation of your bipartisan effort to authorize the       Reemployment Services and Eligibility Assessments (RESEA)       program as part of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L.       115-245).        Until the passage of the Act, RESEA had been limited to a       widely-successful pilot grant program. Today, States around       the nation now have the ability to accelerate unemployment       insurance (UI) claimants' transition back to employment       faster than non-participants, which is particularly important       in an economy desperately in need of skilled workers.        To enhance these efforts, we are pleased to see the       proposed minor statutory fix proposed in the BRIDGE for       Workers Act that reflects your intent to ensure any UI       claimant, not just those most likely to exhaust their       benefits, are eligible for RESEA services and assessments.       The current language in Section 306 of Act needs to be       modified to ensure this intent is actualized and while the       Appropriations Committee made such a modification in their FY       19 Labor-HHS Appropriations bill, a permanent fix would       provide clarity and stability for states actively focused on       helping claimants return to work expeditiously.        NASWA is the national organization representing all 50       state workforce agencies, D.C. and U.S. territories. These       agencies deliver training, employment, career, and business       services, in addition to administering the unemployment       insurance, veteran reemployment, and labor market information       programs. NASWA provides policy expertise, shares promising       state practices, and promotes state innovation and leadership       in workforce development.        Thank you for your consideration of this request.            Sincerely,      Jon Pierpont,        NASWA Board President, Executive Director, Utah Department       of Workforce Services.      Scott B. Sanders,        NASWA Executive Director.     DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, the BRIDGE for Workers  Act will ensure that more workers who need reemployment services get  them. Those individuals and workers, like Tara, will get back to work  faster, in better jobs, and on a path to a better future.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the BRIDGE for Workers  Act, and I reserve the balance of my time.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to  yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Murphy), the  sponsor of the bill.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Judy Chu).    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore), a member of our subcommittee    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how  much time I have remaining.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Torres Small), a cosponsor of this  bill.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. Sewell).    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I came to this session with the simple notion of coming  to do a job and to go do my work. Listening to my colleagues'  representations and their articulation of experiences and what this  bill really means, I am renewed, and I am delighted because it is an  important bill, seriously important.   Yes, in many places the economy is good; people are able to work. But  bridges connect and transport, and this bridge connects people to the  opportunity to get a job, to go back to work, to be able to take care  of their families, to have money so that their children can go to  college or they can sustain themselves while their daughter is  completing her education.                                time  1345    Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleagues, Mrs. Murphy and Ms. Torres  Small; the ranking member of the subcommittee, Mrs. Walorski; and Mr.  LaHood, my colleague from Illinois, for their ingenuity, creativity,  and for the introduction of this tremendous piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the  yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I want to commend  Chairman Lewis and Ranking Member Kelly for their tremendous work on  this bill.   I feel like today might be one of my best days in Congress, because I  had the opportunity a moment ago to talk about helping individuals who  are unemployed.   Now, we are talking about helping individuals with their income tax  preparation, individuals who might be low income; individuals who have  difficulty reading and writing and understanding; individuals who are  disabled; individuals who are poverty stricken, people who make less  than 250 percent of what is known as the poverty level in this country.                                time  1400    I feel good because I have spent much of the day talking about  helping those individuals in our country and in our society who need  help the most. It is a great bill, and I am proud to support it.   I thank all of those operations in Chicago, the Center for Economic  Progress, the City-Wide Tax Assistance Program via Ladder Up, the  United Way, and all the rest of those agencies in the city of Chicago  that are helping low-income people with their income tax.
