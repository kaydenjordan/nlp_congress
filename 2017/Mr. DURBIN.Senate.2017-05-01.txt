 Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for the  vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the nomination of Jay Clayton  to be a Member of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Executive  Calendar No. 36.   On vote No. 117, had I been present, I would have voted nay on the  motion to invoke cloture on Executive Calendar No. 36.                            ____________________
