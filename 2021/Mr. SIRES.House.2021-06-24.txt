 Madam Speaker, I rise today to commend the West New York  School Nutrition Service Department and Nu-Way Concessionaires for  serving the West New York, New Jersey, community throughout the  pandemic.   Nu-Way Concessionaires was founded in 1958 by a longtime West New  York resident, Joseph Pantaleo, who sadly passed away in December at  the age of 90. Joe understood the importance of giving back to his  community and fully embodied the spirit of service.   It is in this light that I wish to recognize the West New York School  Nutrition Service Department, managed by Nu-Way, which has provided  over three million free meals to the West New York community since the  beginning of the pandemic and will continue providing meals throughout  this summer.   Free breakfast and free lunch have been provided every day, including  weekends, and have provided a lifeline during a turbulent and uncertain  year.   I would also like to commend Sal Valenza and Jose Sabater and their  21 employees who have worked tirelessly every day for their community  to ensure students have access to healthy and locally sourced meals.                            ____________________
