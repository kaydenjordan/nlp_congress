 Mr. President, the United States is always grateful to  receive heads of State from around the world. Heads of State from  around the world come to the United States because they know we are 25  percent of the world's economy. We are the most powerful military in  the world. We are the most moral Nation in the world in how we manage  freedom of the press, freedom of speech, and freedom of opportunity for  all people within our country. When we see a problem in our country, we  work to address that.   So with that, we are welcoming another head of State to the United  States today, President Erdogan of Turkey. Turkey has been a long- standing NATO ally. NATO was formed in the late 1940s. Turkey and  Greece were the first two countries that came into NATO after its  formation in the 1940s. Turkey has been a member of NATO since 1952. We  have a very important military base based in Turkey, Incirlik Air Force  Base. It is key in the war against terror in that entire region. Turkey  hosts the largest Syrian refugee population. Turkey has been very  engaged in NATO, filling all of its billets and all of its  requirements. They have worked to be a good partner. They have  partnered with us in not only the War on Terror in multiple different  countries in the regions, but they have been very faithful to engage  with NATO as a whole.   But something is happening in Turkey that I hope President Trump and  President Erdogan had a very frank discussion on because since 2016,  President Erdogan of Turkey is shifting Turkey away from NATO toward  Russia, toward a more authoritative regime, changing their Constitution  to give more power to Erdogan and to whoever his successor is--if there  is a successor to Erdogan, if he doesn't maintain power and keep it  forever from here on out.   There was a mayoral election in Istanbul that Erdogan didn't agree  with, and so he declared it null and void and forced another election  in Istanbul, hoping to get the outlook he wanted, but the Turkish  people actually voted even more so against Erdogan in the next election  in Istanbul, putting in someone who directly opposed Erdogan and his  party.   President Erdogan recently imprisoned an American pastor who had  served more than 20 years in Turkey, serving people of all faiths and  all backgrounds in the beautiful city of Izmir. He rounded up Andrew  Brunson with tens of thousands of other people whom President Erdogan  and his government considered a threat, and most of them they have been  held without charges for years now. There are thousands of people right  now who are still awaiting their day in court from the 2016 coup. Not  knowing if any of these folks were actually connected to the coup, they  rounded up teachers, journalists, law enforcement individuals--just  everyone they could round up that they had any suspicion of and  imprisoned them and said: We will bring charges to you later. Thousands  are still waiting for ``later.''   I happened to be in Turkey in December of 2016 to personally meet  with the Ministry of Justice in Ankara to talk about Andrew Brunson, an  American swept up in that time period who had nothing to do with the  coup that happened in 2016. President Erdogan solely had the ability to  get him released but held him for years with all kinds of wild  accusations against an American missionary who had been there for  decades.   Turkey continues to be able to focus on the Kurdish Syrians just  south of their border. I have to tell you, there are a group of the  Kurds whom I understand President Erdogan should be attentive to. There  is a certain group called the PKK. The United States also considers  that Kurdish group terrorists and have for decades. That particular  group of Kurds who are in Syria have traveled into Turkey and carried  out  [[Page S6577]]  car bombs and have killed hundreds of people in terrorist attacks in  Turkey. President Erdogan has every reason to pay attention to that  particular group of Kurds, and I understand his frustration that the  United States partnered with them to take out ISIS, but the fact was,  Turkey would not come across the border to help us take out ISIS, and  so we found partners who would take on ISIS with us--and they did.   Now Erdogan wants to push those folks back. His methods are quite  brutal in the process. When we went into Afghanistan, we understood  that all Afghan people were not our enemy--the Taliban was, al-Qaida  was. That was our enemy, and they found their way among the  populations. We were exceptionally careful when we went into  Afghanistan to protect the Afghan people, yet find ways to take the  battles to the Taliban and to al-Qaida. Erdogan's methods were to come  across the border with tanks and heavy artillery and start shelling  cities in Syria, knowing there were some PKK in those villages, and so  they just shelled them all. Erdogan and some of his thugs also came  across with some of the other groups who were working with the Turks.  We also have footage of them taking prisoners and shooting them beside  the road and leaving their bodies there. These people had already  surrendered. They were people who had already been handcuffed, and they  executed them beside the road. That is a war crime that we should  follow up with, and I hope President Trump had a very frank  conversation with President Erdogan about following up on war crimes.    Just to add to all of our difficulties right now with President  Erdogan, in the past couple of years, he has shifted his attention  toward Russia and has now completed a purchase of a Russian air defense  system. They are the very first and only NATO country ever to purchase  Russian military equipment. That equipment is not interoperable with  the rest of NATO. This is Russian equipment that is specifically  designed to take the fight to the F-35. Turkey believes it is going to  purchase the F-35 from the United States, and they also believe they  can purchase the S-400 from Russia and have them side by side. Well,  they are wrong. Years ago, Congress passed the Countering American  Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, commonly known as CAATSA. It was a  very clear message to anyone who buys Russian military equipment that  there are sanctions coming to your country, and it is clear. We have  applied those sanctions in the past, and those sanctions need to be  applied to Turkey now.   In addition to that, Senator Shaheen and I have partnered together to  pass a bill to block Turkey from taking any of the F-35s--not trained  in the equipment, not simulators, no F-35s can go to Turkey. If they  are interested in buying Russian air defense systems, they understand  clearly what that means because we have made it clear to the Turks for  2 years now: If you buy Russian equipment, you cannot also have the F- 35. President Erdogan was aware of that. His administration was aware  of that, and I hope President Trump made it clear to him today, as  clear as this Congress has made it clear, on a bipartisan basis, that  Turkey cannot have the F-35 and also have Russian military equipment at  the same time. That is incompatible. We will continue to make that very  clear in the days ahead in our legislation, and I believe a vote will  not even be close to send a message to Turkey that we are interested in  maintaining our friendship and our NATO ally, but our NATO ally needs  to make a decision if they are a NATO ally or if they are a Russian  ally because those two are not congruent.   I hope that was the conversation that happened today. We will find  out in the days ahead, but even if it was not, I hope President Erdogan  and the Turkish Embassy hears it clearly now. This Congress would look  forward to partnering with Turkey again in the future, as we have for  decades in the past. We have had an economic relationship, a military  relationship, and a genuine friendship with Turkey, but we do not know  who Turkey is anymore. We don't recognize the Turkey of today from  Turkey 5 years ago. We would never come to your country and beat up  protesters in the street as President Erdogan's security thugs did last  year in the United States. We would never do that to your country. We  would never counter NATO just to spite you, and we would certainly stay  aligned with a friend who has been a friend for decades.   To the Turkish people, our beef is not with you. Our frustration is  with the regime that is currently directing your country away from its  traditional allies. We continue to reach our hand out to the Turkish  people, and we continue to say to President Erdogan: This can be  different in the days ahead, as it has been in the past, but some  things need to change, and we are not the ones who walked away.   I yield the floor.    If there is no further business to come before the  Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned under the  previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:40 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, November 14, 2019, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
