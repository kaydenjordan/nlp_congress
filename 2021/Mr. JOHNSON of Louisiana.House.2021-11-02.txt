 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend, Ranking  Member Luetkemeyer, and all of our Republican colleagues on the Small  Business Committee for leading this very important discussion this  evening. And this is very important.   Madam Speaker, the Democrats' radical multitrillion-dollar agenda is  bad for America. It just is, and we can all see it. The voters can see  that, too. In fact, while we are here right now, there are still voters  lining up just down the road in Virginia. They cannot wait to vote for  their next Governor. It is a race that is currently classified as a  toss-up but it appears to be going very, very well for the Republican  candidate.   The reason this is so noteworthy, the reason everybody in the country  is watching this, the reason that everyone is so excited that it is a  toss-up election is because this is in a State that President Biden won  by 10 points just several months ago. And there are simply no  conclusions to draw other than that the Democrats are leading our  country down the wrong path. That is what the polling says and even the  mainstream media outlets have had to report on that in the last few  days.   It is the content of this tax-and-spend agenda, and not just the  cost, that is especially dangerous for American families and our  economy overall. You just have to think about the harmful effects the  Democrat bill is going to have on our local businesses, many of whom,  by the way, we all know are already operating on shorter hours due to  the current labor shortage. But specifically, the legislation that is  being debated and pushed through even this week is that the Democrats  want to increase OSHA penalties, increase penalties on small  businesses. That is a tax. They want to reduce the pass-through  deduction. That is a tax. They want to increase the regulatory burden  on small business owners at the worst possible time. You know what this  amounts to? A tax. They want to make the child tax credit pay the same  whether you are working or not, which what will that do? Logically, it  will exacerbate the current labor shortage.   So let me repeat. The Democrat bill, in spite of what they are  saying, will definitely increase taxes while prices  [[Page H6107]]  are soaring. It will increase workplace penalties while companies are  trying their best to get back to work, and it will encourage people not  to work while the job market struggles, and our supply chain is slowed  down due to a lack of workers in these critical positions.   There are nearly 32 million small businesses in the United States.  About 350,000 of those are in my home State of Louisiana. They are our  main employer. They employ more Louisianians than any big company or  the government. This is the mainstay. This is the lifeblood of our  economy. You are talking about deli managers and barbershop owners, and  bookstore owners. You name it.   Small businesses across the country had to fight tooth and nail to  survive the COVID-19 pandemic. The last thing this Congress needs to do  is make it more difficult for these businesses.   But that is exactly what our Democrat colleagues are trying to do. As  for the rest of the bill, well, they are still working on it, they tell  us. We heard today there may be some deal on prescription drugs. Who  knows? We have to see how that goes. There have been lots of promises  broken--made and broken--here the last few weeks.   Meanwhile, the Democrats are still trying to include amnesty in this  spending bill. What that has to do with the reconciliation, we have no  idea. Hopefully, the Parliamentarian on the Senate side will put  another kibosh on this. But they want to include tax breaks for wealthy  New Yorkers and just a bunch of terrible ideas.   I have to digress for just a moment and talk about this amnesty  problem, because not only will that be another burden on our small  businesses; not only will it really take jobs away from law-abiding  citizens, but you have to consider the insatiable appetite that our  friends on the other side of the aisle have for amnesty.   We spent about 13 hours in the Judiciary Committee about 3 weeks ago  working on their effort. The Democrats pushed that through to graft  amnesty onto the spending bill. And after all of those hours, near the  very end--late at night--we asked them if there was any end to this  appetite they have for amnesty. We are talking about as many as 10  million illegals who have come across the border. And we brought a few  amendments and we talked about this in our Conference, but we said, you  know, gee, if you are going to grant amnesty and you all have the votes  in the committee to move this through, we understand that, but we just  want to see if there is any limit on who you might include in amnesty.   So we brought an amendment to the bill and said: What if someone is a  known MS-13 gang member? Surely, you would want to exclude them from  your amnesty plan. And I will tell you, every single Democrat on our  committee voted that amendment down. Of course, every Republican voted  ``yes.''   Then we said: Well, well, wait a minute. What if somebody is a  convicted is sex offender, somebody coming from another country and  they are a convicted sex offender? Surely, you would not want to  include them in your amnesty plan. Every single Democrat voted ``no''  on that amendment. So I brought an amendment. I said: What if someone  is a convicted criminal, and they are convicted of DUI, driving under  the influence of alcohol and drugs, a terrible crime, as you all have  said in your speeches in recent years? It kills thousands of Americans  every year. It maims hundreds of thousands. Surely, if someone has been  convicted of at least one DUI, you would not want to include them in  your amnesty plan. Every Democrat voted it down.   So we tested it a little further. Okay, what if they have two or more  DUI convictions? Every Democrat voted it down. So I went to 10 or more  DUI convictions, would they be excluded from your magical amnesty plan?  Every single Democrat voted ``no'' on that amendment. Every single one.  There is no limit to what they want to do with this.    The one thing they do know, they want to spend trillions and  trillions of our tax dollars before we know the score on all of this,  before the actual text of the legislation has even been read. They are  ready to roll. Democrats have a mere three-seat majority in this House.  We have a 50-50 split in the Senate. They are acting as if they have  some sort of big majority to radically transform the country, as they  keep telling us. And what they have presented is the most partisan,  most expensive legislation package in the history of this country,  using the slimmest majority possible, and before they even tell the  American people what is in it.   Make no mistake, a toss-up election in Virginia is just a taste of  what is to come for congressional Democrats in 2022 if they do not  immediately ditch this ridiculous spending plan and harmful government  overreach.   I just say this: Today we have a battle that comes down to competing  ideologies and agendas. It is now free-market capitalism versus Big  Government socialism.    Will the gentleman yield?    So I wish that that proposal had been on  the table before we got out of that particular hearing because we  certainly would have liked to have heard about that. But if you add  that up, you are talking about perhaps $1 million per family, and $1  billion in cost overall, more costs to the American taxpayer.   And by the way, that little payment that the illegal migrants would  be given by the American taxpayer is more than we give to Gold Star  families, persons who have been lost in the line of duty, as you know.  It is more than the victims of 9/11 that they have received for their  pain and suffering. And, of course, those separations are permanent,  not temporary. It is just not right.    That is what it means, and convicted sex  offenders, and multiple DUI-convicted felons, and everybody else. They  have included them all. There is no limit to it at all. Isn't that  outrageous?    It is incredible. You can't make this stuff  up.                                time  1815
