 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on  strengthening America's elections and the democratic process.   The task we face is very simple: Congress should secure elections  from foreign interference and break down barriers that prevent  Americans from accessing the ballot. And the SHIELD Act, which Congress  will vote on this week, protects elections from foreign meddling by  increasing oversight of campaign contacts and online political  advertising.   U.S. citizens have a right to be fully informed of their ballot box  choices without concerns of foreign interference. The 2016 election  taught us in the United States many lessons as foreign governments  sought to influence the outcome of our election.   The SHIELD Act builds on lessons learned from the 2016 election by  creating an obligation to report contacts between campaigns and foreign  nationals.   Additionally, the SHIELD Act presents modern-day solutions for the  problems of manipulative online political advertisements by ensuring  the same standards applied to other political ads will extend to these  new advertisements.   Mr. Speaker, the House will vote on the SHIELD Act this week, and I  urge Members of the House to vote for the SHIELD Act to strengthen our  country's democracy.                            ____________________
