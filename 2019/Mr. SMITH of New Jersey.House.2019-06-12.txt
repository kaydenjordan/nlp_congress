 Mr. Speaker, the bill under consideration  today reverses several--at least nine--life-affirming, pro-life  policies, including conscience protection, Title X reform, the  Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance, and more.  [[Page H4449]]    This is a pro-abortion piece of legislation on steroids. But passage  won't be the last word.   Trump will veto it and we will sustain that veto.   No one, including doctors, nurses, and LPNs, Mr. Speaker, and no  entity, like hospitals or health insurance plans, should ever be  compelled against their will into performing, facilitating, or  subsidizing abortion.   This bill eviscerates the administration's conscience protection  rule. In late February, HHS promulgated the Protect Life rule to  reassert portions of President Reagan's original Title X regulation to  end colocation of abortion clinics with family planning clinics under  Title X. It also requires financial separation. That, too, is reversed  by this piece of legislation.   Among its provisions, the Protect Life rule also seeks to protect  against child abuse, child molestation, sexual abuse, and human  trafficking.   H.R. 2740 also guts the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance  policy, which ensures that our foreign aid holds harmless unborn  children. It, again, is a Ronald Reagan policy expanded and reiterated,  and it prevents taxpayer funds from going to--and this is grant money-- foreign NGOs that perform or promote abortion as a method of family  planning.   Mr. Speaker, the shocking number of unborn children killed in America  is unconscionable--approximately 61 million dead babies since 1973--a  death toll that equates to the entire population of Italy. All of this  when our knowledge about unborn children and the breathtaking miracle  of life before birth is unparalleled.   Mr. Speaker, anyone here, parent or grandparent, knows that the first  baby pictures today are of the child in the womb, the ultrasound  pictures that go up on our refrigerators, so proud of the new baby. It  is not that you are going to be a parent; you are a parent during those  9 months.   Yet the pro-abortion movement, like a modern day Flat Earth Society,  continues to cling to outdated, indefensible arguments cloaked in  euphemism.   Even the seemingly benign word ``choice'' withers under scrutiny.  Choice to do what? Dismember an unborn child piece by piece. Anyone who  watched the movie ``Unplanned'' saw an ultrasound-guided abortion where  the child was decimated right on the screen for all to see.   Then there is, of course, RU-486, which first starves the baby to  death, and then the baby is expelled from the womb. Then there are  injections of chemical poisons--all of it violence against children.   That is what the choice is all about: the choice of killing an  innocent, defenseless, unborn child.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman very much  for his amendment and for yielding.   Mr. Chair, in 2009, Nurse Cathy DeCarlo was ordered at Mt. Sinai  Hospital in New York, to assist in the abortion of a 22-week-old unborn  child.   Under threat of being fired, she said the hospital ordered her to  assist in the ``bloody dismemberment of a baby,'' her words, ``and  accounting for the body parts afterward,'' which must be done during  these abortions.   She said this coercion caused her intense emotional pain and she has  had ``nightmares about babies crying in the dark . . .'' ever since.   She appealed to the HHS Office for Civil Rights, but her pleas to  enforce her civil rights fell on deaf ears.   No one, Mr. Chair, should ever be pressured or threatened or coerced  to perform or facilitate in the killing of a baby.   Abortion is not healthcare.   HHS recently promulgated an essential new regulation to enforce 25  congressionally-enacted conscience laws and provisions to protect  individuals, healthcare entities, and providers from discrimination.   H.R. 2740 stops this regulation by not allowing funds to be used to  implement it.   Let me point out that HHS points out that the rule will robustly  enforce investigations, supervising compliance, making enforcement  referrals when necessary to Justice, and remediate  [[Page H4531]]  the effects of discrimination in coordination with other funding  components in HHS, which may include withholding Federal funds as  appropriate.   We need to be serious about conscience rights.   We cannot coerce and tell someone like Cathy DeCarlo or nurses in my  State of New Jersey who are told, under condition of losing their jobs,  they had to assist in abortions.   Abortion takes the life of a baby. It includes dismemberment and  chemical poisoning.   And just think about this: my friends on the other side of the aisle  just simply refuse to acknowledge that there is a baby. And that baby  deserves respect and protection.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote for the Cole amendment.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, Lyme disease is the most  prevalent vector-borne disease in the United States today.   If not diagnosed and treated properly, Lyme can lead to disseminated  infection that can affect every system in the body, including the  central nervous system. Later symptoms of Lyme include neurological  problems, memory loss, brain fog, and heart systems such as heart block  and inflammation of the heart muscle.   Lyme has been reported in every State in the United States. My State,  for example, has a particularly high incidence of new cases and old,  about 50,000 new infections each year.   While grossly undercounted for decades, new scientific evidence shows  that the number of new cases of Lyme is now estimated to be between  291,000 to 437,000. Remember, these are new cases of Lyme disease.   Since 1998, Mr. Chair, I have introduced comprehensive legislation on  tick-borne diseases, including Lyme. At the core of it was the creation  of a working group or a blue-ribbon commission to try to figure out  what is going on and to have Lyme-literate participants because there  has been a culture of denial about Lyme disease, particularly chronic  Lyme, for decades.   With the support and strategic help of Republican Leader Kevin  McCarthy, we succeeded in our goal and added the Tick-Borne Disease  Working Group to the 21st Century Cures Act. I am thankful to Fred  Upton, as well, for his leadership on this important initiative.   I would point out that that Working Group was dead over in the  Senate, and again, it was Kevin McCarthy who said the 21st Century  Cures Act doesn't come back unless that is in it. That made it happen.   The Working Group is charged with reviewing current research efforts  and identifying the gaps in the study, education, prevention, and  access to care for patients with Lyme and other tick-borne diseases.   In their inaugural report to Congress, the Working Group said,  ``Americans need help, yet progress has been hampered by a lack of  attention at the Federal level and by divisions within the field.'' I  include the executive summary of the Working Group's report in the  Record.        [Tick-Borne Disease Working Group, 2018 Report to Congress]                             Executive Summary         Tick-Borne Diseases have rapidly become a serious and       growing threat to public health in the United States. Despite       many scientific unknowns, experts agree that the incidence       and distribution of tick-borne diseases are increasing. Over       the past 25 years, reports of Lyme disease have increased       steadily with estimated annual cases approximating 300,000       (Hinckley et al., 2014; Nelson et al., 2015 ). The number of       U.S. counties now considered to be of high incidence for Lyme       disease has increased by more than 300% in the Northeastern       states and by approximately 250% in the North-Central states.       The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)       currently recognizes 18 tick-borne pathogens in the United       States. However, researchers and health care practitioners       continue to discover emerging disease agents and new medical       conditions associated with tick bites.        While most Lyme disease patients who are diagnosed and       treated early can fully recover, 10 to 20% of patients suffer       from persistent symptoms, which for some are chronic and       disabling. Studies indicate that Lyme disease costs       approximately $1.3 billion each year in direct medical costs       alone in the United States. A comprehensive understanding of       the full economic and societal cost remains unknown. It is       likely orders of magnitude higher and potentially a $50- to       $100-billion-dollar problem for the United States, although       more research is needed (Vanderhoof & Vanderhoof-Forschner,       1993; Zhang et al., 2006).        Prompt diagnosis and treatment of tick-borne diseases are       crucial to prevent long-term complications. Today, available       diagnostic tests can be inaccurate and complex to interpret,       especially during the earliest stage of infection when       treatment is most effective. Unlike in other infectious       disease settings, tests to directly measure the presence of       the infecting organism, such as cultures or tissue biopsies,       are not available for some tick-borne diseases such as Lyme       disease. This leaves physicians without the tools needed to       diagnose; and without an accurate diagnosis, it is       challenging for physicians to provide early treatment.        Persistent symptoms after treatment of Lyme disease can be       severe, yet their cause(s) remains unknown and debated. There       are currently no uniformly accepted or validated treatment       options for patients with these chronic symptoms. As a       result, uncertainty surrounding appropriate clinical care has       led to polarization within the medical community, and       patients are often left suffering in limbo without a clear       path to illness resolution or even symptom management (Rebman       et al., 2017). The lack of a clear path for treatment of       persistent symptoms in some patients with Lyme disease  [[Page H4539]]       and other tick-borne diseases not only amplifies patient       suffering but also significantly increases health care costs.        This report outlines an integrated, multipronged approach       to the growing public health challenges posed by tick-borne       diseases in the United States. It contains nine main       chapters, including Background; Methods; Epidemiology and       Ecology; Prevention; Diagnosis; Treatment; Access to Care,       Patient Outcomes; Looking Forward; and Conclusion. The       Background and Methods chapters explain how the report was       developed. The other chapters present the main challenges,       key issues, and recommendations specific to the broader       topics.        To understand tick-borne diseases, we need to first       understand tick ecology and how ticks transmit diseases. Due       to the lack of a coordinated national surveillance program,       currently there are significant gaps in information on local       distribution of infection-causing ticks, especially in       regions beyond the Northeast and Upper Midwest. Nationwide,       standardized approaches for tick, animal, and human       surveillance are needed to understand the geographic       distribution of infectious ticks in order to understand the       spread of disease and predict where people are at risk.       Advanced technologies and systematic studies are also needed       to rapidly identify new disease agents that pose emergent       risks to public health, including to the blood supply. Given       that seven new tick-borne pathogens have been shown to infect       people in the United States since 2004,this is a priority.        Effective prevention relies on multi-pronged strategies. To       reduce exposure to ticks, we need a comprehensive       understanding of the biological drivers behind the continued       spread of tick-borne diseases, so that effective tick- and       infection control methods can be identified and validated.       Need also exists for the transparent development of a safe,       effective human vaccine to prevent Lyme disease, the most       common of these illnesses. In the absence of effective       strategies for controlling ticks and blocking the       transmission of tick-borne pathogens, it is crucial to       educate health care leadership are needed to reverse the       alarming professionals and the public about tick-borne       disease prevention, especially best practices for protection       from tick bites. Outreach efforts to promote prevention and       raise awareness among physicians and the public must be       expanded at both the Federal and state level to ensure       accurate, effective, and consistent messaging.        Clinical research priorities must include the development       of new technologies and approaches to improve diagnosis of       tick-borne diseases and monitor response to treatment. There       is a critical need for sensitive and specific direct-pathogen       detection strategies that are broad enough to cover multiple       potential tickborne pathogens. Understanding the etiology and       pathogenesis of ongoing symptoms after initial treatment       should be a clinical research priority. Investigations are       also needed into the potential roles of immunologic       responses, bacterial persistence, and coinfecting pathogens       in order to design and test new therapies and, ultimately,       improve outcomes and care for patients with ongoing symptoms.        Americans need help, yet progress has been hampered by a       lack of attention at the Federal level and by divisions       within the field. The recommendations in this 2018 report of       the TickBorne Disease Working Group represent a longterm       investment in tackling the rise of tick-borne diseases in       this country. However, immediate changes are also required to       help patients already suffering from tick-borne diseases; to       protect them from discrimination; and to address the       inflexible, inconsistent, and often unaffordable care that       patients frequently encounter in the current health care       system.        Increaseed Federal funding, prioritzation, and leadership       are needed to reverse the alarming trends associated with       tick-borne diseases. Despite several decades of research,       prevention, and educational activities, Federal funding for       tick-borne diseases is less per new surveillance case than       that of other diseases. The U.S. National Institutes of       Health (NIH) and CDC spend $77,355 and $20,293, respectively,       per new surveillance case of HIV/AIDS, and $36,063 and       $11,459 per new case of hepatitis C virus, yet only $768 and       $302 for each new case of Lyme disease. Federal funding for       tick-borne diseases today is orders of magnitude lower,       compared to other public health threats, and it has failed to       increase as the problem has grown.        It is also essential that funding and resources be       allocated to support a comprehensive, interagency program to       address the mounting challenges identified in this report.       All research, prevention, and education initiatives should be       inclusive of special populations such as children, who suffer       disproportionately from tick-borne diseases. Patients whose       lives continue to be disrupted by the lasting effects of       these illnesses are counting on emerging scientific research,       evidence-based policy, and the health care establishment--      including the Federal Government with Congressional and       Executive leadership--to provide solutions. We must act now.'     Mr. Chair, much of what we have argued about  for a quarter of a century has now been scientifically validated by the  Working Group, including the fact that massive numbers of people are  getting seriously ill from ticks and that the Federal response has been  woefully inadequate.   Let me point out to my colleagues that this amendment very simply  boosts the amount of money that CDC will have to spend. Again, it was  the Working Group that pointed out that in terms of prevalence, the  number of diseases that are charted, no other disease, no other  disability gets less funding for CDC or for NIH. I would say that is  because there has been such a culture of denial by certain  organizations about the prevalence of Lyme over the years, and that has  really prevented the necessary work from happening.   We are talking about, in 2017, $11 million for CDC and $28 million  for the National Institutes of Health. That is a drop in the bucket for  this infectious disease.   CDC has recognized that there are 18 tick-borne pathogens in the  U.S., and researchers and healthcare practitioners continue to discover  emerging agents.   The Working Group's report was able to underscore a fact many of us  have believed to be true, and now it is further validated, that 10 to  20 percent of patients suffer from persistent symptoms, which are  chronic and disabling--in other words, chronic Lyme.   The diagnostic tests--and this is, again, where the research dollars  can make a difference--are also often inaccurate. The report points out  that in about 50 percent or more of the cases, when people do blood  tests they are told they don't have it. Those are false negatives. They  do have it.   There are other tests that go deeper into the bands to discover this.  It is very expensive. We need a world-class diagnostic tool.   Mr. Chair, I would point out to my colleagues that the  disproportionate number of people who are infected--mal infected, to be  more accurate--are children who are out in the backyard. This report  points out that most people get Lyme in their own backyards. Of course,  if people play sports, are hikers, or are out in the wilderness, they  are also further at risk.                                time  1700    So this amendment increases CDC's funding it by $1 million for Lyme.  It is a modest amount but a step in the right direction.   I have also introduced legislation with Collin Peterson, and I would  ask my colleagues to take a look at it. It is called the TICK Act, H.R.  3073, and it would create a national strategy like we have done with  Alzheimer's and like we have done with other diseases to bring the  needed Federal resources to the fight against Lyme.   Mr. Chairman, I do ask Members to support the amendment and take a  look at the TICK Act.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
