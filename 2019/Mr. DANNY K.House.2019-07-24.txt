 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support  of the Butch Lewis Act, and I do so because we are not talking about  bailing out savings and loans. We are not talking about giving tax  breaks to the wealthiest 1 percent.   We are talking about protecting the benefits of hardworking men and  women who have worked for decades: truck drivers, bakers, grocery  clerks, coal miners, people who have given their all to make sure that  our communities continue to live and thrive.   I commend Chairman Neal and Chairman Scott, the Democratic  leadership, for bringing this bill to the floor. I urge that everybody  vote for it.   Vote for the men and women who have kept America strong.
