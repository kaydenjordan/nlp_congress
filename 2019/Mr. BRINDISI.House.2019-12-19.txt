 Madam Speaker, I want to thank the chairman for  yielding and thank him for his work and the work of the Trade Working  Group for their tireless effort to get this deal done.   I rise today in strong support of this legislation and for swift  approval of USMCA.   We need to make sure that New York's workers, farmers, and small  businesses have a fair shot at success. That is why I worked hard with  Members on both sides of the aisle and the administration to get this  deal to the finish line.   There are many reasons to support this agreement, such as stronger  labor and environmental standards, but I will use my brief time to  highlight the impact this will have on upstate New York's dairy  farmers.   I have heard from dairy farmers across upstate New York about the  need to get more milk to market, boost milk prices, and crack down on  unfair Canadian price supports, which USMCA will do.   USMCA will help family farms, help manufacturers, and protect  workers, and I urge swift passage of this agreement.
