 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H. Con.  Res. 3.   This resolution is further proof of my colleagues' hypocrisy and  their obsession with controlling a woman's inherent right to bodily  autonomy.   This resolution ignores the long-documented history of violence  against abortion providers, their staff, and their patients.   Violence is what Amanda Eid from Texas suffered when doctors could  not induce labor after her amniotic fluid was leaking. Her doctors were  prohibited from providing the treatment she urgently needed because of  Texas' anti-abortion laws. Amanda's life will forever be changed, and  that is the real violence.   The American people are overwhelmingly in support of protecting  reproductive freedom. Women and the American people across this Nation  have spoken loud and clear. They do not want the government interfering  with their reproductive healthcare.   On behalf of all women in my district and across this country, I  oppose this extreme resolution.
