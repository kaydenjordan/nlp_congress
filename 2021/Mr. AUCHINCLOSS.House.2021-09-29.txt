 Madam Speaker, I rise today to correct the record.   Yesterday, while proselytizing about the ongoing case of Stuart  Scheller, one of my colleagues demonstrated a concerning  misunderstanding of armed service to one's country.   Stuart Scheller did not ``stand up to incompetence.'' He broke his  oath, one that all Marines take that explicitly outlines our duty to  obey the President's legal orders; the same oath I took when I was  sworn into the Marine Corps 11 years ago. Yesterday, the Chairman of  the Joint Chiefs spoke directly to this understanding: the principle of  civilian control of the military is critical to this republic.   A marine who posts videos of himself saying ``follow me and we will  bring the whole system down'' is not a martyr. Stuart Scheller is a  liability to our national security, and he will be provided the same  due process that our fellow Marines have fought for and died to  protect.                            ____________________
