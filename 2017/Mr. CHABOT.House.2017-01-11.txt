 I thank the chairman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5, the Regulatory  Accountability Act.   In response to the previous gentleman's comments, I would just note  that none of the regulations that we are considering today--the  legislation--is going to do away with regulations altogether or even  significantly, especially, regulations that have to do with people's  safety. We are not trying to do anything that is going to affect the  safety of the American people. We are just trying to make sure the  regulations are smarter, and that is what this is all about.   I am also pleased that title III of H.R. 5 is a bill that I sponsored  last term and in this Congress--the Small Business Regulatory  Flexibility Improvements Act. The Committee on Small Business, which I  happen to chair, and the Committee on the Judiciary have crafted this  bill with bipartisan input over many years.   I thank Chairman Goodlatte for working with us on this important  legislation, and I thank him for his leadership.   Small businesses are found in every congressional district and in  every industry. They provide livelihoods for millions of workers and  for their families. Small businesses employ nearly half of the private  sector workforce and generate two out of every three new jobs in the  private sector today. The Federal Government should be doing everything  it can to encourage these small but mighty job creators. Unfortunately,  oppressive red tape has had the opposite effect of discouraging  investment, expansion, and job growth. I am not saying that all  regulations are bad, but there are too many rules. For too long,  agencies have ignored their true effect, their true impact, on small  businesses. Small businesses are at a real disadvantage because they  have fewer resources and rarely have in-house counsel, the regulatory  compliance staff that would be necessary to guide them through this  maze. Generally, small businesses just don't have that.   So shouldn't regulators, at the very least, examine the effects of  new rules on small businesses and consider ways to reduce excessive  burdens?   Of course they should. There is a law, the Regulatory Flexibility  Act, or the RFA, which requires agencies to conduct this commonsense  assessment when they regulate. Even though the law has been on the  books for over 36 years, agencies too frequently just ignore its  requirements.                                time  1430    The Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act, which is  title III in this bill, eliminates loopholes that agencies like the  Internal Revenue Service have used to avoid compliance with the RFA. It  also forces agencies to analyze not only the direct, but also the  indirect effects of rules on small businesses, just as agencies are  required to do when promulgating major rules affecting, for example,  the environment. It gives small businesses additional opportunities for  early input on proposed rules and regulations and strengthens the RFA's  requirements for agencies to periodically review old rules.   Nothing in our legislation today takes away an agency's ability to  issue a rule or a regulation, but it will force the rulemakers to think  carefully before they act. It is great legislation, and I urge my  colleagues to support it.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I offer this amendment to address a longstanding problem: agencies  not fully analyzing the effects of regulations on small businesses.   Under the current Regulatory Flexibility Act, an agency may certify a  rule if it expects that the rule will not have--and I am quoting the  current law here--``a significant economic impact on a substantial  number of small entities.''   When an agency certifies a rule, it does not need to perform a full  regulatory flexibility analysis. This provision makes sense because not  every rule affects small businesses.   Unfortunately, agencies appear to be abusing this provision.  According to a recent study, agencies only prepared analyses for  approximately 8 percent of rules finalized between 1996 and 2012.   A recent example of this occurred with the controversial waters of  United States rule. The Environmental Protection Agency and Army Corps  of Engineers certified that rule despite the significant and direct  consequences for farmers, ranchers, and home builders. Most of those  are small businesses.   Although the Small Business Administration Chief Counsel for Advocacy  sent a letter to the agencies stating that the certification was  improper and urging them to withdraw the rule, the agencies ignored the  Chief Counsel and proceeded to finalize it anyway.                                time  1530    This amendment addresses this problem by requiring agencies to  include--and I am quoting my amendment--``an economic assessment or a  summary thereof that is sufficiently detailed to support the agency's  certification.'' This will be published in the Federal Register as part  of the detailed statement and certification for the proposed rule.   This approach mirrors the one used in the National Environmental  Policy Act. When an agency finds a project to have no significant  impacts on the environment, it is required to provide an environmental  assessment or a summary of it. Since agencies are required to provide a  threshold analysis when they issue a finding of no significant impact  for actions that could affect the environment, it just makes sense to  extend the same type of requirement to rules that could affect small  businesses. Small businesses, after all, are the folks that are  responsible for creating two-thirds, or about 70 percent, of the new  jobs created nowadays. So anything that burdens these small businesses  is something that is, by definition, bad for the economy and bad for  job creation.   This particular amendment, I think, improves the underlying  legislation. It makes sense. I urge my colleagues to support this  amendment, which will further strengthen the RFA and ensure that  agencies' decisions are supported by data.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I will be brief, and then I will invite my colleague from Virginia to  respond.   Just a couple of quick points. First of all, relative to this  significant economic impact language that my distinguished colleague  from Georgia is talking about, that is already in the existing law, so  we are not changing anything there. We are not saying it ought to say a  significant economic impact. It already says that in the existing law.  Both the bureaucrats and the courts are used to determining what the  terminology like ``significant'' means under the rule or regulation or  the law, just as what a reasonable man is. ``Reasonable'' is quite  common throughout the legal structure.   We are also not giving discretion to Ms. McMahon, the soon-to-be head  of the SBA. It is to the Chief Counsel, and he is independent.   I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte), our chairman.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Just a couple of points. First, before speaking in opposition to this  amendment, I would note that the ranking member, Ms. Velazquez, and I  worked very much in a bipartisan and cooperative manner on a whole  range of issues. We have done that when she chaired the committee and I  was the ranking member, and we do that now that I am the chair and she  is the ranking member. I commend her for that cooperation. We have  actually gotten a lot of things done in the Small Business Committee on  behalf of small businesses all across the country in both Democratic  and Republican districts.   That being said, I would also note that this particular language, in  essence, replaces our H.R. 5, title III, with Ms. Velazquez's version.  She mentioned that hers is bipartisan. Ours is as well. Mr. Cuellar was  a principal cosponsor of this particular legislation, so, by  definition, it is bipartisan. I would also note that we have dealt with  this a number of times over the years, and we have included a  significant number of Democratic amendments already in our underlying  bill as well. So it truly is bipartisan.   The gentlewoman from New York's amendment would essentially strike  title III of the bill, and it would replace it with alternative  language. While I am heartened that she agrees that the Regulatory  Flexibility Act needs to be improved, this amendment just does not go  far enough to address, in my view, most Federal agencies' habitual  disregards for small businesses. We know that the bureaucracy does  disregard small businesses time and time again. That is why we feel so  strongly about this bill.   Ms. Velazquez's amendment includes a few of the reforms that the  current title has, but, unfortunately, it fails to include many other  important ones. Her amendment does not close the loophole the IRS uses  to avoid complying with the RFA, for example, and it does not provide  additional opportunities for small businesses to provide input on  proposed rules through the Small Business Advocacy Review panel  process.   It does not require the Chief Counsel for Advocacy to issue  government-wide RFA compliance regulations that all agencies must  follow. Without these compliance regulations, agencies will just  continue to develop their own interpretations of the RFA to avoid  complying with the law's requirement.   America's small businesses deserve more meaningful reform, and the  current title III of the bill, in our view, does just that; therefore,  I would urge my colleagues, respectfully, to oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I don't think we need to increase  bureaucracy or hire a whole lot more people to implement this. We have  plenty of people right now who work for the Federal Government, and I  am sure that we can shift some resources around, people can work harder  and smarter, and we can be leaner and meaner. The bureaucracy has grown  far too large over the years.   That money comes from somewhere. Where does it come from? It comes  out of the hardworking taxpayers of our country. A lot of those folks  are small business folks, and they are folks that  [[Page H351]]  have gotten the short end of the stick far too often.   Hopefully, this Congress will move legislation that comes out of this  body in a direction where, rather than throw roadblocks, hindrances,  and more problems in the pathway of small businesses, we are going to  help them. I know the last thing they want to hear is: I am from the  government, and I am here to help you.   The fact is the government does exist, and to the extent we can help  them, we ought to do that. But most of the small businesses that I talk  to, what they say is: just get the heck off my back. Quit telling me  how to do what I know how to do best.   So we are not anarchists over here. We are not saying that we don't  need any bureaucracy, we don't need any government, and we don't need  any regulations. We do need some regulations, but we overregulate now.  Hopefully, this is just one step in scaling back on the overregulation  that comes out of Washington and is like a wet blanket over small  businesses all over the country and like a wet blanket over the  American economy. So let's get that wet blanket off, let's get the  economy moving, and let's Make America Great Again.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, a longstanding position of the Chief  Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration has been that  land management plans developed by the Forest Service and by the Bureau  of Land Management are rules and that they are subject to analysis  under the RFA. The same conclusion--that a land resource management  plan is a rule--has been reached by the Government Accountability  Office.   Given the potentially significant consequences to small businesses  that rely on public lands and small communities that border those  lands, the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management should  assess the impacts of their plans on these small entities. That is all  this does.   We are saying: How is this going to affect small businesses? Seventy  percent of the new jobs created in America are created by small  businesses? Should we care about what the bureaucrats are doing, how it  affects those folks that are creating all these jobs?   Common sense says yes, we ought to do that.   This bill already includes a reform to prepare those agencies to  prepare regulatory flexibility analyses when they are developing  changes to resource management plans to determine how small businesses  and small communities would be affected.                                time  1715    Striking this provision from the bill would do away with a needed  reform for small businesses, such as farmers and ranchers and their  small communities, especially those located in the Western United  States, which contains the vast majority of Federal lands.   I would also note that my esteemed colleague talks about Republicans  trying to destroy health care in this country. That is obviously  absurd. We are trying to save health care. We are trying to make sure  that Americans aren't forced to pay a heck of a lot more and have  higher deductions, things they can't afford. Plans right now they are  in, they are paying for plans and oftentimes get zero health care out  of those plans because the deductibles are now so high under ObamaCare  that they can't even use it.   I think there are a whole lot of people, when this was forced through  this Congress on a purely partisan vote by my colleagues, the Democrats  at that time, and by this President, there were a lot of Republicans  who would have loved to have joined with them to do something to help  people get health care who didn't have it. That is a worthy cause. But  that could have been done without screwing up everybody else's health  care in this country. That is what they failed to do when they did  this. We are hoping, in a bipartisan way, we can work together to  improve health care for lots of folks in this country. We will see if  that is going to work out or not.   I would also note that there is nobody on this side of the aisle who  thinks we need no government at all, we need no regulations, we need no  rules; but we don't want to overregulate the job creators in this  country so that they can't create jobs. Those jobs  [[Page H362]]  that people don't get, those are real people; or people who get knocked  out of that employment are real people, and they have families. We  ought to be supporting them. Overregulation kills those jobs.   I would finally note, relative to climate change, what we are saying  is that if we are going to do something, let's do it in a smart manner.  Let's not try to save some things and then knock thousands, probably  millions of Americans out of their jobs. There is a smart way of doing  it and there is a wrong way of doing it. We would like to do it the  smart way.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
