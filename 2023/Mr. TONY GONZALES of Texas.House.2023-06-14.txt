 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my  amendment.   This amendment is simple. Any time a Federal agency proposes a new  rule, it must also submit a constitutional authority statement. This  would force any administration to remain in compliance with the most  sacred document in the American government, the U.S. Constitution.   Congress follows this simple principle every time a new bill is  submitted. The White House should be held to the same standard.   Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues on both of sides of the aisle to  support this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
