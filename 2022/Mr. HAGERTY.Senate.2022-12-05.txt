 Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Mrs. Blackburn, I  ask unanimous consent that the following remarks be placed in the  Congressional Record in recognition of Dr. Thomas Zacharia, Director of  the Oak Ridge National Laboratory--ORNL.   For 35 years, Dr. Zacharia has provided transformative scientific  leadership that has established ORNL as one of the world's premier  research institutions, fulfilling national missions in diverse fields,  including advanced materials, nuclear science and engineering, neutron  science, and high-performance computing.   Dr. Zacharia's vision guided the creation of the Oak Ridge Leadership  Computing Facility and established ORNL as the Nation's leading  supercomputing institute with the deployment of 10 supercomputers,  including  [[Page S6959]]  the launch of Frontier in 2022, the first machine to break the exascale  barrier.   Under Dr. Zacharia's leadership, ORNL has operated a research reactor  with the highest neutron flux in the United States, the most powerful  accelerator source of pulsed neutrons for materials research, the  largest and most advanced additive manufacturing equipment, and  facilities that produce, purify, and ship the most isotopes. He has  positioned the laboratory to play a central role in our Nation's  pursuit of breakthrough technologies for energy, cybersecurity,  quantum, and other diverse fields.   Dr. Zacharia has also expanded the Laboratory's impact in the Oak  Ridge Corridor by leading new ventures to attract technology startups  and create a pipeline for the next generation of scientists and  engineers.   I hope our colleagues join us in recognizing Dr. Zacharia for his  tremendous contributions to the Nation, and on behalf of the U.S.  Senate, we wish him the best in his future endeavors.                            ____________________
