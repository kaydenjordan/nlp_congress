 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember  and honor my friend and former colleague, Michael Fitzpatrick. Former  Congressman Mike Fitzpatrick passed away on January 6 after a 12-year  battle with cancer.   He served as chairman of the House Committee on Financial Services'  Task Force to Investigate Terrorism Financing. Over a 2-year period,  the task force investigated the financial mechanisms used to fund  terrorist activities.   Mike was a leading voice in Congress on medical device safety,  pressing the FDA after dangerous medical devices remained in use after  causing serious injury and death. He was an Eagle  [[Page H71]]  Scout from the Bucks County Council and former president of that  council and was honored with the Silver Beaver Award for his service to  scouting.   Mike retired in 2017 and was consistently ranked among the most  bipartisan Members of Congress.   I lift my prayers for Mike's wife, Kathleen; their six children; his  brother, Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick; and the Fitzpatrick family  during this difficult time.   Mr. Speaker, it is also appropriate to celebrate the tremendous  accomplishments and difference Congressman Mike Fitzpatrick made in a  relatively short life.   Well done, my friend. Rest in God's loving arms.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce).
