 Mr. Speaker, the chairman of the committee got it right,  this is historic. This bill is overdue, bipartisan, and bicameral, as  it should be.   Today, I rise in support of H.R. 8454, the Medical Marijuana and  Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act.   Representative Blumenauer and I have jointly cosponsored this bill  for four Congresses. Talk about overdue. Although we disagree about  recreational marijuana--he supports it; I oppose it--we both concur  that in regard to medical marijuana, we need to do the rigorous  research to answer the questions.   As a physician, I realize that if we are going to have marijuana  legal in over three dozen States for medical uses, we really ought to  be able to do the research on it to see what it can and can't be used  for. Many claims are made about it--some are legitimate, some will be  found to be illegitimate--but the American public deserves to know  whether medical marijuana and cannabidiol work for those claims that  are being made.   This bill makes it easier to do the necessary, rigorous medical  research just like is done for any other drug that has a claim of  efficacy in this country. The American public deserves to know what  medical marijuana is useful for, because for anyone with those  conditions where it is found to be useful, it could be a godsend. But  for other conditions where the claims won't be found to be valid with  rigorous research, it would be found to be ineffective, and that would  help protect American patients as well.   This would modernize our research methods, bringing medical marijuana  up to the scientific standards we use for every other type of  medication that is sold as a drug in this country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
