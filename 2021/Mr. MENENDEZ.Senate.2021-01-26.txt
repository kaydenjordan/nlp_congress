 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up  to 5 minutes.    Mr. President, I just remark how quickly you have risen  in the Senate. So we welcome you here.   I rise today in support of Tony Blinken's nomination to be Secretary  [[Page S140]]  of State. I want to thank Senator Risch for working with me  expeditiously to get this nomination to the floor, and I appreciate his  work and common cause to achieve it.   We all know Mr. Blinken has impressive credentials. He was confirmed  by the Senate as Deputy Secretary of State, and before that, he served  as the Deputy National Security Advisor and as the staff director at  the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. But apart from his extensive  experience, he showed in almost 5 hours of hearing testimony that he is  thoughtful, willing, able to grapple with the most complex challenging  issues facing our country, and committed to engaging Congress, and he  did so on both sides of the aisle.   Not surprisingly, the Foreign Relations Committee reported him out by  an overwhelming bipartisan vote.   Now, some in this body may not be aware of Mr. Blinken's family  tradition, which reflects the best of this country in two ways: our  history of welcoming those in need of refuge and the contributions that  immigrants and refugees have made in the service of our Nation.   Mr. Blinken's family came here fleeing persecution. His grandfather,  Maurice Blinken, fled Russian pogroms. His father's wife, Vera Blinken,  fled communist Hungary, and his late stepfather, Samuel Pisar, survived  Nazi concentration camps and met the first U.S. soldiers he saw with  the only English words he knew: God bless America. And from that  family, our country has benefitted from the service of two Ambassadors,  an Assistant Secretary, and a Deputy Secretary of State--what a  testament to the power of the American Dream.   Mr. Blinken must be confirmed so we can start addressing the  challenges we face abroad. Every day there is an event or calamity  across the globe, and whether it is a massacre in Ethiopia or  democratic protests in Russia, we need U.S. leadership and engagement  to chart our foreign policy through these troubling times.   We now have a COVID vaccine, but troubling new variants and strains  are appearing in the United Kingdom and South Africa. We need a  confirmed Secretary of State and a robust State Department to  revitalize the traditional U.S. role as a leader on global health  issues. This is just one of the many things we have to do to bring this  pandemic to an end both in this country and abroad.   It is also important that Mr. Blinken be confirmed to help address  the challenges we face closer to home. The State Department is  suffering from a historic crisis stemming from low morale, the  departure over the past 4 years of many of our most experienced  diplomats, and the lack of accountability for the political leadership  at the top during the last 4 years. Mr. Blinken's experience and  expertise is necessary to begin to repair the damage and rebuild the  State Department.   Moreover, the Office of Secretary of State is fourth in the  Presidential line of succession and is one of the most important  national security positions in the government. To paraphrase former  Secretary of Defense James Mattis, if we do not support diplomacy, our  Armed Forces will ultimately need more ammunition. He was right. Robust  diplomacy means that we are less likely to have to send our sons and  daughters to fight wars, and it means more opportunities for Americans  and American businesses abroad.   I strongly support Mr. Blinken's nomination today because he is the  right person for the job and because we cannot afford to leave this  post vacant any longer. I hope my colleagues will all join me.   With that, I yield the floor.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I have 2 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committees are authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:              COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION    The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation is authorized  to meet during the session of the Senate on Tuesday, January 26, 2021,  at 10 a.m., to conduct a hearing on nominations.
