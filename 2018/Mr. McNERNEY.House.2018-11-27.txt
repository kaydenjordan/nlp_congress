 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, my friend, for  yielding.   I want to thank my colleagues here tonight, Mr. Payne, Mr. Schneider,  and especially Mr. Garamendi, who has been an absolute fierce advocate  for action on climate and other issues. He is untiring, and I really  have a lot of respect and admiration for that.   Let me talk a little bit about the report first. This is a scientific  report. It was created over a period of years by scientists. It is not  an opinion paper. It is a paper that is based on facts, and it is based  on modeling.   If you do modeling, then you know what happens is you create a model.  You test it against the facts. You adjust the model. You test it  against the facts. You adjust it, and you reiterate until your model is  pretty accurate. Then you make predictions.   That is what has happened here. They have some very well-tested  models that are predicting very bad things. So it is an important piece  of scientific literature, and I think science should be at least  involved in the decisionmaking in our great country.   Now, I think it is almost laughable that the administration tried to  limit the exposure of this report by putting it out on Black Friday. I  guess that didn't work because a lot of people are excited in a  negative way about this report and what it says.   I think most Americans recognize that there is a problem here. Most  all Americans recognize it, especially the millennials and the younger  Americans. They know because it is going to affect their lives. Their  lives are going to be directly affected more and more as we go forward,  so they are very engaged in this issue.   I think everyone knows in their hearts that there is a problem here,  but I think one of the things that is a challenge is: How do we move  forward on this?   People don't like change. People like to assume that their lives are  going to go on, and they will do things the way they have always done  them. But I think one of the things they are worried about is jobs.                                time  2030    Well, let's talk about that for a second. Mr. Garamendi mentioned  that I worked on windmills. I worked on windmills for 25 years. I  climbed a lot of windmills. It is a pretty exciting thing to do. You  are up there working on something that is cool. You are looking down on  the natural environment around you. If I was a coal miner, I would say:  That is a pretty good alternative to going down into coals mine and  breathing dust as to go up on windmills--kind of cold sometimes--but to  go up on windmills and work your heart out and create clean energy.   So another thing to think about is the number of jobs per energy  produced. Renewable energies create a lot more jobs per unit of energy  produced. That is an important consideration.   So why can't we move forward?   I think the economy is going to improve if we reduce our consumption  of fossil fuels. It will create jobs. It will make the environment  cleaner. We will have less health impacts than we are seeing from  fossil fuels, from coal, from oil, and certainly see a lot less climate  impacts.   There are a lot of really good reasons to move forward on this. I  think if you can look at what America and the world would be like if we  weaned ourselves off fossil fuels, it is a beautiful picture. We will  have a lot of clean energy. We will have people employed. We will have  people using electricity for transportation. We will have energy  generated from windmills, solar, geothermal, and from all of these  technologies that are there today that are economic and cost-effective.  In fact, wind and solar are more than competitive with fossil fuels.  You can produce more energy per cost of energy with wind and solar than  you can with oil and coal.   They say natural gas is a great transition fuel, but if you only lose  2 percent of natural gas emissions in the process of creating energy,  then you are already undoing the energy efficiency advantage of natural  gas because natural gas methane is so effective as a climate change  gas.   I think we have a lot to look forward to if we determine and decide  that we are going to move forward with this transition.   One last thing. I want to say I have a challenge to the President.   Mr. President, we know that climate change is happening. If you want  to go down as a great President, if you want to go down in history as  someone that changed history, as someone who changed history for the  better, than embrace climate change action. Make a difference.
