 Madam Speaker, there is perhaps no greater threat to  our future than the climate crisis.   House Democrats understand the severity of this existential threat  and the harm it poses to the American people, our health, our national  security, and our economic prosperity.   That is why House Democrats have championed comprehensive and  sustainable investments in a clean energy future. Our efforts were  relentless to secure passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which  includes historic investments in climate action. By investing in smart  policies for clean, secure American energy production, this law makes  monumental strides in fighting the climate crisis, all while creating  millions of good-paying jobs.   While congressional Republicans remain occupied with lining the  pockets of Big Oil, global corporations that saw record profits while  Americans struggled to make ends meet, Democrats remain steadfast in  putting people over politics as we continue to work to protect our  planet and a strong, prosperous future for working families.                            ____________________
