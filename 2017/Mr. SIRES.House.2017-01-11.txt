 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Union City  Public Schools for their outstanding achievements.   Having come to the United States from Cuba as a child, I experienced  the challenges of assimilating into a new community firsthand. As the  representative of one of our Nation's most diverse districts, many of  my constituents experience these challenges every day. Giving  immigrants the tools they need to succeed is not only beneficial to our  country, it is sound policy.   According to The Wall Street Journal, Union City Public Schools  ``have become a model for ushering low-income English-language learners  into the mainstream.''   With a student body that is 95 percent Hispanic, one of the keys to  Union City Public Schools' success is their English as a second  language program and their early childhood programming. The programming  has become a model for educators in the U.S. and as far away as Europe.  Graduation rates have also increased by nearly 10 percent, in just 2  years, in the district.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent a school district that has made  tremendous strides in easing the transition of immigrant youth into our  society and become the foundation of success for thousands of children  and young adults.                            ____________________
