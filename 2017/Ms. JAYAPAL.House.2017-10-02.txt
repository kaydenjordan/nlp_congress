 Mr. Speaker, my heart goes out to the victims and the  families impacted by the horrific shooting in Las Vegas. Gun violence  is a public health crisis that has claimed thousands of innocent lives,  and we  [[Page H7653]]  must do everything we can to address it.   Mr. Speaker, the American people are tired of being outraged, of  sending thoughts and prayers, of seeing men, women, and children die  because the gun lobby puts profit over people. That is not what our  Founders intended by the right to bear arms.   With rights come responsibilities: the responsibility to stop gun  sales loopholes, to enact protections that make sure our kids and those  with severe mental illnesses don't have access to guns, to address  funding for mental health, and to oppose any efforts to make it easier  to purchase silencers.   Mr. Speaker, 87 percent of gunowners and 74 percent of NRA members  support those commonsense solutions, like criminal background checks.   I have a plea for gunowners across this country: urge the NRA to  represent your views; show them that you mean business by speaking out  or even terminating your NRA membership; show them that you care about  your fellow Americans. Act now. Enough is enough.                            ____________________
