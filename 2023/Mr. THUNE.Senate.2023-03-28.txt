 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, providing for the common defense is one of  the core responsibilities of the Federal Government. It is, in fact, a  primary reason why the Federal Government exists. In fact, the  Constitution states:         The United States shall guarantee to every State in this       Union a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each       of them against Invasion.    So how do we do that? How do we protect our Nation and ensure that  Americans can live in peace and safety? The answer can be summed up in  one word: ``strength.''   As Ronald Reagan said, ``We know only too well that war comes not  when the forces of freedom are strong, but when they are weak. It is  then that tyrants are tempted.'' Or to put it in the words of another  President, our first, speaking 200 years earlier, ``To be prepared for  war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace.'' That is  from President George Washington.   We secure peace by maintaining our strength. So what does that mean  in practice? At its most basic level, of course, it means maintaining a  strong military and national intelligence apparatus. It means ensuring  that our military is well-funded, sufficiently manned, and fully  equipped to meet current and future threats. Unfortunately, we are not  doing the best job at that right now.   We have military services that are struggling to meet recruiting  targets. There is a persistent pilot shortage, and in a number of  cases, we have too few mission-capable aircraft. Under the President's  budget, Navy ships would be retired faster than we can replace them in  our limited shipyards. War-gaming analysis suggests we would run out of  certain long-range and precision munitions in conflicts with a great  power much sooner than any American should be comfortable with. On top  of that, last month, the spectacle of a Chinese spy balloon flying over  U.S. military bases made it clear that there has been an alarming gap  in NORAD's--the North American Aerospace Defense Command--monitoring of  U.S. airspace.   Our current situation isn't being helped by the fact that the  President is deemphasizing investment in our military. The budget he  just introduced for next year requests a massive hike in nondefense  spending compared to a mere 3.2-percent increase for defense.   In fact, the supposed increase in defense spending isn't really an  increase at all. The increase the President is proposing fails to keep  pace with current levels of inflation, which means that his defense  spending hike is really a defense spending cut--and not for the first  time.   In November of 2018, the bipartisan National Defense Strategy  Commission released a report warning that our readiness had eroded to  the point where we might struggle to win a war against a major power  like Russia or China. The Commission noted that we would be especially  vulnerable if we were ever called on to fight a war on two fronts.   We have made some progress since then, but we are definitely not  there yet. We have to make continued investment in our military and our  readiness a priority. We need to be prepared to meet any threat because  that will allow us to deter almost any threat.   Reducing investment in our military--as the President has proposed-- would leave us in a situation where we could have difficulty defending  our Nation or our Nation's interests if attacked.   It is worth noting, too, that while the President deemphasizes  funding for our military, hostile powers are not doing the same.   China recently announced that it is increasing its defense budget by  7.2 percent this year, after increasing it 7.1 percent last year.   We need to continue to reinvest in our military, address recruitment  challenges, and ensure that our men and women in uniform--and our  intelligence personnel--have what they need to meet and deter the  threats of the 21st century.   The most basic requirement of national strength is a strong military.  And that isn't the only requirement. Investment in our military and  national security apparatus needs to be accompanied by commitments to  border security, energy security, and more. Border security--and here,  I am talking not just about physical security at our borders but also  enforcement of our immigration laws--is an essential part of keeping  our Nation secure.   Porous borders--or lax immigration enforcement that allows things  like visa overstays--are an invitation to criminals, terrorists, and  others who would seek to harm our country.   The fact that 16 individuals on the terror watch list were  apprehended attempting to cross our southern border illegally in  February alone should be all the reminder we need that people who do  not wish us well are seeking to enter our country.   And we need to ensure that we are enforcing our immigration laws and  maintaining our borders to stop them.   I also referenced energy security as a component of national strength  and security.   What does energy security mean? It means developing our domestic  energy resources--both conventional and renewable--to ensure a stable  and reliable supply of energy that does not depend on imports from  hostile countries.   The energy challenges and soaring costs countries like Germany have  faced over the past year owing to their heavy reliance on Russian  energy are a timely reminder of the importance of developing domestic  energy supplies.   Depending on imports from hostile nations or unstable regions not  only enriches those nations, it places us in a position of  vulnerability.   So far, I have talked about what we should be doing domestically to  build the kind of strength that will protect our Nation and deter  aggressors. But security is not just a matter of working at home to  strengthen our military and secure our borders. We also need to engage  globally--to build relationships with allies, support free nations, and  stand against hostile actions by hostile countries.   Now, standing against hostile actions or hostile nations doesn't mean  fixing every country's problems or getting militarily involved in every  conflict around the globe. We are not--and cannot be--police officer to  the world.   But an isolationism that would recede from any world event unless it  directly and immediately affects us is dangerous and contrary to our  national security interests because sooner or  [[Page S978]]  later, world events--particularly those that involve powerful and  hostile nations--do affect us.   We ignore the importance of security challenges, like Ukraine, at our  peril. Putin is already making it clear his ambitions don't end with  Ukraine. He is also occupying territory in Georgia and, seemingly,  working on asserting Russian influence in Moldova and the Balkans.   A Putin victorious in Ukraine would be on the doorstep of four former  Soviet satellite states--now NATO members whom we are bound by treaty  to protect--and he would likely be emboldened. War could spread, which  would compound the existing humanitarian catastrophe cost, cost U.S.  lives, and spell economic disaster not only for European countries but  for the United States, which trades heavily with Europe.   For the sake of our own security, we cannot afford to sit by and  ignore the Ukrainian conflict. Helping Ukraine fight its fight degrades  Russia's capability and helps ensure that the United States and NATO  troops won't have to fight a war with Russia. And it sends a clear  message to Russia and other nations with imperial ambitions that  aggression will not go unanswered away.   I would also note that along with isolationism, we need to be wary of  the tendency to focus on one global threat to the exclusion of others.  China, which is flexing its military and economic power and threatening  the safety of Taiwan, should rightly be a major focus right now.   But it cannot be the only one. For those who, for example, contend  that U.S. support for Ukraine is a distraction from the threat that  China represents, I would argue that the outcome in Ukraine and  upholding Ukraine's sovereignty has significant implications for China  and Taiwan.   It appears Japanese Prime Minister Kishida would agree, as he  traveled to Kyiv 1 week ago--a trip not undertaken lightly given that  Japan is neighbors with Russia, China, and North Korea.   We know that Chinese leader Xi Jingping is watching the West's  response to the war in Ukraine closely. And our support--and NATO's  support--of Ukraine can send a powerful message to General Secretary Xi  that he should think twice before making any move across the Taiwan  Strait.   In addition to confronting the dangers posed by great powers, we also  need to continue to maintain focus on threats in the Middle East and  Africa, including ISIS and Iran and their proxies.   In the past week, there have been multiple strikes on American forces  in Syria, with attacks tracing back to Iran-backed militia groups. And  we need to continue to make it clear that hostile action against  Americans--like last week's attacks--will not be tolerated.   Iran is fomenting unrest in the Middle East, moving closer to  enriching weapons-grade uranium, and sending drones to Russia to  support its war on Ukraine. Meanwhile, it is looking likely that Russia  will supply Iran with modern fighter jets, making Iran an even more  deadly presence in the Middle East.   We cannot afford to ignore Iran any more than we can ignore China,  Russia, or any other serious threat to peace and stability. We need to  remain engaged on the global stage--always pursuing peace but always  ready to respond to those who would jeopardize it.   Above all, we can't be afraid to call evil by its name. Ronald Reagan  never declared war on the Soviet Union. But he helped bring down the  Evil Empire, in part, by not being afraid to speak with moral clarity.   There will always be threats to peace and security. And it must be  our job to ensure that the United States always has the strength to  meet them. There is no surer way of preserving the peace or protecting  the heritage of freedom that we have been given.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
