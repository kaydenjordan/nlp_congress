 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of  America's fiscal future as it is envisioned in the RSC budget.   For the first time since I have been here in 5 years, we have managed  to assemble a very reasonable path forward to fiscal stability for our  country.   I have language in this bill reflective of the crisis at the border.  My legislation, H.R. 2729, the Finish the Wall Act, is included in the  language of the underlying bill.   On President Biden's first day in office, he halted the use of border  security funds allocated by Congress, ended all ongoing construction of  the border wall, and implemented very weak border policies that have  had dire consequences for our Nation.   We have had over 1 million illegal crossings thus far this year. In  history, it has never been this high. We have had surges here and there  in 2014 and 2019, yes, under various administrations for various  reasons. But we have never had 1.1 million illegal crossings into our  country.   Our border has created layers of crisis, and we must deal with it. We  must act. We must force action from our executive.   The debt that we face as a nation is crippling, and the generations  yet unborn will not survive a $31 trillion debt that we are looking at  right now. America will not continue to exist as we know it with that  type of crippling debt. But we won't get there. We won't get to our  grandchildren and great-grandchildren as a strong American nation if we  allow the sovereignty of America to be destroyed in the course of one  Presidential term.   Madam Speaker, we are trending over 2 million illegal crossings this  year. We cannot allow this to happen. I urge my colleagues to take a  reasonable look at the RSC budget.
