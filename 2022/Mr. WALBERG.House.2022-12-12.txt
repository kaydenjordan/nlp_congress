 Madam Speaker, while the baby formula shortage no longer  draws as many headlines, parents are still suffering as a third of  American families still struggle to find baby formula, according to  recent Census Bureau statistics.   Countless parents are still searching store after store in hopes of  finding formula to feed their children. That is unacceptable. Parents  deserve both solutions and answers.   Months ago, the Energy and Commerce Committee unanimously advanced my  resolution calling for the Biden administration to release documents  related to the recall of infant formula and potential impacts on the  infant formula supply chain.   Let me reiterate. This was passed unanimously in committee with  support from both sides of the aisle. I am urging the Speaker and  Democrat leadership to allow a full vote on this resolution  immediately.   We need to hold the administration accountable and ensure that this  level of failure never happens again.                            ____________________
