 Mr. Speaker, this is one of those--you have already  touched on C.T.'s resume. But I get to do something that is a little  unique right now. I am not going to give his resume again.   He was my neighbor. He and Mary were my friends.   Have you ever had someone in your life, and they are just sort of an  acquaintance, and they just ooze something really unique called love.   C.T. was a big guy, powerful voice. He could sing and the rafters  shook. Every time he gave the prayer at a Kiwanis meeting, or a  Republican meeting, or something else, I almost felt like I was going  to do an altar call. And being Catholic, that is actually a little odd.  I thought that would be funnier.                                time  1645    He and his wife did something amazing. They were involved in  everything from my school board to the Arizona clemency board.   The fact of the matter is he had a powerful impact on a lot of us who  live in an upper income suburb on the side of Scottsdale, Arizona. It  is a beautiful place.   I remember sitting down with him and saying, ``Okay, C.T., you are my  neighbor. You are my friend. Why are you a Republican?'' In this  powerful voice, ``David, son, I am going to be part of that  abolitionist party,'' and then he went on to explain his history, his  life.   I know often we break down into partisan this, partisan that, but to  have someone who didn't look like every other suburban person in this  neighborhood, and yet, his intellect, his love, his wife Mary's love-- they became icons in the community because of their intellect, because  of their love, and because of their leadership.   It proved so powerful for the community because so often when there  was something happening, one of the first things we all did was say:  Well, we have to ask Dr. Wright. What does he think? What does he feel?  What is his understanding of what is going on?   We lost him a couple of years ago, and the community has mourned and  felt a little bit more hollow since. By naming our post office, I am  hoping my 7-year-old daughter and my now-10-week-old son will see the  plaque and will tell the story, and it will become part of the heritage  of my little town, Fountain Hills, Arizona.
