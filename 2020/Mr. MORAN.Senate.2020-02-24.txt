 Madam President, I am pleased to have arrived on the  Senate floor just a bit early to have heard the Senator from Arkansas,  Mr. Boozman, pay tribute to the DAV, Disabled American Veterans, and I  very much want to join in his comments.   I will also take a moment to thank him for his continual service for  veterans, not only for those of Arkansas but of our Nation, and to  recognize that he and I, since our days in the House of  Representatives, have worked together on veterans' issues and both now  find ourselves in positions in the hopes that we can do even more.   To Senator Boozman, I say thank you for his continued efforts in  making sure that all who serve our Nation have a better future and that  the Department of Veterans Affairs, as well as the American people, do  everything they can to make sure that what they are entitled to they  will receive. So I thank the Senator from Arkansas.
