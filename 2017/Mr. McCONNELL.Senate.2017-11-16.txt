 Mr. President, during the past decade, many in the  middle class struggled to make ends meet. The economy was sluggish,  paychecks were often stagnant, and jobs for many were too hard to  find--perhaps not on the coasts, where the well-to-do were able to  flourish under the Obama economy--but in middle America, in States like  Kentucky, the pain was real.   Hard-working families across the country deserved better. They  continue to deserve an economy that reaches for its true potential, one  in which more Americans can find a good job to support their families  and achieve the American dream.   So now this is our chance to set a new course. This is our  opportunity to jump-start the economy and boost job growth. Passing tax  reform is the single most important thing we can do right now to  support those left behind by the Obama economy.   Though obvious, it is worth repeating: Our Nation's Tax Code is  broken. First, the rates are too high. Americans are sending too much  of their hard-earned money to Uncle Sam. Second, the structure is too  complicated for most Americans to understand, and it is too easy for  the wealthy and well-connected to exploit. Third, the incentives are  often outdated or simply make no sense at all--like those that actually  encourage American jobs and companies to move overseas. That is bad for  our country, bad for the middle class, and bad for small business.   In my home State of Kentucky, a small business CEO wrote a column in  a publication about her experiences with our broken tax system, calling  for  [[Page S7270]]  tax reform to fix it. Here is what she said:         The federal government takes too much. Our small       businesses--which according to the U.S. Small Business       Administration total 96.5 percent of Kentucky's employers--      often face the greatest tax burden.    This Kentuckian continued:         If we want better lives for the nearly 700,000 employees       across the [C]ommonwealth who work for small enterprises, we       must lift this weight off their backs.    Small businesses deserve a tax code that works for them. Middle-class  families and individuals deserve the same. That is why we are working  so hard to enact tax reform. Over in the Senate Finance Committee,  Chairman Hatch has laid down a tax reform proposal that is premised on  a single idea; that we should take more money out of Washington's  pockets and put more money in the pockets of the middle class.   It cuts taxes for middle-class families. It doubles the child tax  credit. This plan does a lot of things, including providing relief for  businesses so they can create more jobs here in America and then keep  them here. The Nation's leading small business advocacy organization  endorsed this legislation, saying that it ``will provide much needed  tax relief to enable small businesses to grow and create jobs.''   There is another important provision of the Finance Committee's tax  reform proposal as well. It will deliver relief to low- and moderate- income families by repealing ObamaCare's individual mandate tax. In  other words, we can deliver even more relief to the middle class by  repealing an unpopular tax from an unworkable law. It just makes sense.   I would like to once again thank Chairman Hatch for his commitment to  an open process and regular order. The Finance Committee will report a  bill soon. Before it does, however, it will continue to consider a  number of amendments from both sides of the aisle. In fact, the  chairman's modified mark already incorporated amendments from both  Republican and Democratic members of the committee.   I look forward to the Finance Committee completing its work on this  crucial legislation very soon. As it does, our colleagues in the House  will continue working on their own tax reform legislation. I commend  Chairman Brady and the members of the Ways and Means Committee for  their efforts. I look forward to the full House passing their bill.   Once both Chambers pass their tax reform bills, we will keep working  together to get a bill to President Trump's desk for his signature.   I am also grateful to Chairman Murkowski and members of the Senate  Energy and Natural Resources Committee for reporting bipartisan  legislation yesterday to secure our Nation's energy future. By further  exploring the responsible development of Alaska's resources, this bill  can help grow our economy, support high-paying jobs, and strengthen our  national security. I look forward to promoting American energy  independence through this legislation.                            ____________________     On another matter, today, the Senate will continue to  fulfill its important responsibility of providing advice and consent on  President Trump's nominations. So far this week, we have confirmed  talented individuals to important positions in the Departments of  Transportation, Labor, and Defense.   Yesterday, the Senate advanced the nomination of Joseph Otting to  serve as Comptroller of the Currency. Mr. Otting's experience as a  leader in various financial agencies has helped prepare him to serve in  this new role. I look forward to voting to confirm him later today.   Next, the Senate will consider two well-qualified nominees to serve  on Federal district courts. Donald Coggins and Dabney Friedrich both  have the experience and temperament to excel as judges. Both of these  individuals have stellar legal credentials. Their careers demonstrate a  serious commitment to the law, and by confirming them both, the Senate  will continue to ensure the Federal judiciary fulfills its particular  role in our constitutional system.   I would like to thank Chairman Grassley for his leadership of the  Senate Judiciary Committee, which reported both of these nominees on a  voice vote. I look forward to advancing their nominations very soon.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as in legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that, notwithstanding rule XXII, the Senate proceed  to the immediate consideration of H.R. 4374, which was received from  the House. I further ask consent that the bill be considered read a  third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table; further, that at a time to be determined  between the majority leader and the Democratic leader, the Chair lay  before the Senate the conference report to accompany H.R. 2810, and the  Senate vote on the adoption of the conference report with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that,  notwithstanding rule XXII, at 1:30 p.m. today, the Senate proceed to  legislative session and the Chair lay before the Senate the conference  report to accompany H.R. 2810, as under the previous order, and that  there be 15 minutes of debate equally divided between the managers or  their designees prior to the vote on the adoption of the conference  report; further, that following disposition of the conference report,  the Senate resume executive session and all postcloture time on the  Coggins and Friedrich nominations be yielded back and the Senate vote  on confirmation of the Coggins nomination immediately, and that the  confirmation vote on the Friedrich nomination occur at 5:30 p.m. on  Monday, November 27; finally, that if the nominations are confirmed,  the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table  and the Senate be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the votes  following the first vote in this series be 10 minutes in length.    Mr. President, I yield back the time on the Otting  nomination, and I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 481, Gregory Katsas.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum call be waived.    Mr. President, just a moment ago, the Senate acted to  send the President one of the most important policy bills we consider  each year--the National Defense Authorization Act.   Not only will this legislation authorize the resources, capabilities,  pay, and benefits our men and women in uniform need to perform their  missions, but this year's bill also goes further. It takes a notable  step toward authorizing the resources needed to start rebuilding our  military and restoring combat readiness.   It will help improve our missile defense capabilities and better  prepare us to deal with cyber threats. It will authorize a well- deserved pay raise for our men and women in uniform while providing for  continued reform of the benefits they and their families rely upon, and  it will support the thousands of military servicemembers and families  serving at military installations in Kentucky and in the Kentucky  National Guard.   Further, this bill strives to bring reform to the Pentagon. As  Senator McCain said of the NDAA a few months ago, it will ``[build]  upon the sweeping reforms that Congress has passed in recent years.''  He is right, and none of this would have been possible without him,  without his leadership.   I think I can speak for everyone in this Chamber when I say that our  friend Senator McCain has served with distinction as chairman of the  Armed Services Committee. I know the ranking member on his committee,  Senator Reed, thinks so as well. I know a lot of Members on both sides  of the aisle do too.   Senator McCain's commitment to our men and women in uniform is  obvious, and it is unwavering. He respects these brave Americans  immensely; he cares about them deeply; and he understands better than  just about anyone how important a bill like this is to them, not only  on a policy level but on a personal level as well.   The NDAA he worked so hard to pass has now cleared both Chambers. It  is headed to the President's desk. Soon, it will become law. When it  does, it will stand as yet another testament to the hard work,  dedication, and unflappable determination of our colleague and friend  Senator John McCain--truly, an American hero.    Mr. President, I listened carefully to the excellent  remarks of the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, outlining the  history of the blue slip. I am going to say to the chairman that he has  outlined a sensible use of the blue slip, which involves consultation  but does not lead to a one-Senator veto of a nominee.   I thank the chairman for the history lesson. It is a history lesson  that the Senate needed to hear.   I also thank the chairman for the spectacular job that he has done  all year long with this new administration in processing and bringing  forward highly qualified nominees. For generations to come, Americans  who follow the third branch will be indebted to the chairman for the  way he has handled these nominations, processed them, moved them out on  to the floor, and given the Senate the opportunity to express its will.   I wish every Member of the Senate had been able to hear the  chairman's remarks, but I am certainly going to call these remarks to  the attention of our Members every opportunity I get, and I thank the  Senator from Iowa.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the en bloc consideration of the following nominations:  Executive Calendar Nos. 461, 462, 464, 478, 479, 480, 488, and 490.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolutions be agreed to, the preambles be agreed to, and the motions  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, all en bloc.

There being no objection, the Senate, at 5:45 p.m., adjourned until  Friday, November 17, 2017, at 11 a.m.                            ____________________
