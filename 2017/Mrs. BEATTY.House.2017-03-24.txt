 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my opposition to  TrumpCare and my strong support for the Affordable Care Act.   Since the ACA was enacted seven years ago, more than 20 million  Americans have gained access to affordable and high quality health  insurance, including nearly one million Ohioans.   We thought 129 million Americans with pre-existing conditions would  be able to keep their health care coverage. We thought 105 million  Americans would no longer have to worry about annual or lifetime  limits. Yet, we are here today winding back the clock on all the  progress we have made based on a bill that wasn't released to the  public until last night.   What's the rush to pass a bill that affects so many people without  letting the public view it? What's the rush to pass a bill that affects  so many people without a new CBO score?   Mr. Speaker, we know that TrumpCare will cause Americans to pay more  for less coverage. We know that TrumpCare will provide a massive tax  cut to the super rich 400 families and leave the other 99.9 percent of  people behind. We know that TrumpCare will cause 24 million Americans  to lose their health insurance, including tens of thousands of my  constituents in the Third Congressional District of Ohio. We know that  TrumpCare will slash Medicaid funding by $880 billion. We also know  that TrumpCare will put 13 million children, people with disabilities  and adults just one emergency visit away from financial catastrophe.   Mr. Speaker, these cuts hurt people all across the country. TrumpCare  will not make healthcare more affordable.   Democrats believe healthcare is a right, not a privilege. I join my  colleagues in fighting for affordable healthcare for all Americans. I  will vote no, and urge all my colleagues to vote no as well.
