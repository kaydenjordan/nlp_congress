 Madam President, I rise this afternoon to offer a path  forward on the SECURE Act--the way that I think we could actually do  some legislating around here and pass a constructive bill.   A little brief history, I think, is in order and helpful for context.  About 3 years ago, the Senate Finance Committee passed a reasonably  similar legislation out of committee unanimously. It was never  considered on the Senate floor. The House took up some of these ideas  and passed their own legislation.   My own view is that most of the substance of this legislation is very  constructive. Most of what it does is it makes it easier for middle- class families to save for their retirement. That is constructive.  However, the bill that came over from the House is different from the  bill that came out of the Senate Finance Committee and was never  considered on the Senate floor. The House bill dropped a number of  provisions that had bipartisan support. They added some provisions that  had never been vetted by anybody on the Senate side, at least not in a  procedural way.   There is a proper way to resolve these kinds of differences, and that  is to put this bill on the Senate floor, open it up for amendments, and  allow the Senate to work its will. The Senate will almost certainly  pass some version--probably very similar to the House bill--and then we  can iron out whatever little differences there are.   This is the way we legislate. That is what I am suggesting we do  today. To do otherwise would be to treat this body as just a  rubberstamp for the House, and that is not the purpose of having two  legislative bodies.   I should also note that our Democratic colleagues have frequently  criticized Republican leadership and the Republican majority for not  legislating. Sometimes they have a point. The minority leader has said  that the Senate is a legislative graveyard. He has criticized Leader  McConnell for not putting bills on the floor and at one point Senator  Schumer said:         We want to debate these other issues. . . . We are not       saying our Republican friends are going to think exactly as       we do, but let's have a debate and vote.    I couldn't agree more. I think we should have a debate. I think we  should have a series of votes. I think we could bang this out in a day,  at the end of which we would pass the SECURE Act, preferably after  considering amendments from both sides. That is what I am proposing. In  fact, we have been proposing this for weeks.   We have shared with our Democratic colleagues several amendments that  the Republican Senators would like to offer. One is mine. I have other  colleagues who would like to offer them. We have been asking our  Democratic colleagues for their list of amendments. What things would  they like to do? What amendments would they like to consider? We have  restricted our amendments to those which affect the Tax Code. We have  suggested that they do likewise.   Amazingly, to me, we haven't heard a single suggestion yet from our  Democratic colleagues. It is amazing because I have heard plenty of  criticism about our Tax Code from our Democratic friends, including  criticism about the limitation we put on State and local tax  deductions. I know there are Democratic colleagues who would like to  extend the electric vehicle credit. There are some who have proposed  new taxes on wealth. Chairman Wyden has a proposal to put a tax on  unrealized market-to-market gains on assets. There is a long list of  ideas we have heard from the other side.   This is the opportunity to have some votes and find out whether there  is support and to what extent there is support for these things. On our  side, we are willing to vote. Every Republican Senator is in favor of  this proposal that I am going to suggest in a few moments, whereby we  would have specific amendments on our side and allow the Democrats to  have an equal number on their side. I don't know what could be more  reasonable than this approach.   Quickly, my amendment fixes a technical drafting error in our tax  reform. It is called the QIP. It is the acronym that is used for it. It  stands for ``qualified improvement property.''   Here is the problem. Due to a drafting error, businesses are now  forced to recognize the cost of improvements over a long period of time  rather than to expense them in the years in which the expenses  occurred. It was a drafting error. Everybody acknowledges it was a  drafting error and was unintended.   Thirteen of my Democratic colleagues are cosponsors of my legislation  to fix this, and every Republican Senator supports fixing this error.  Those are 66 Senators right there. I am not asking for a guaranteed  outcome. I am just asking for a vote. Let's have a vote on it. I have  other colleagues who would also like to have votes on their amendments.  As I said, our proposal is that the Democrats pick an equal number of  items that are important to them, and let's have votes on those. It  would look a lot like legislating. It would be good to get back to  legislating. In a moment, I am going to make a unanimous consent  request to do exactly that.   Before I do, I yield the floor to my colleague from Texas, Senator  Cruz, for his thoughts on this.    Madam President, I yield to the Senator from Ohio.    Madam President, in reclaiming my time, as in legislative  session, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be determined by the  majority leader, in consultation with the Democratic leader, the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 1994, the Setting Every  Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act of 2019, the SECURE Act,  which is at the desk.   I further ask that there be a period of general debate on the bill to  be limited to 10 hours, equally divided between the two leaders or  their designees, and that following the use or yielding back of that  time, the only amendments in order on the Republican side be the  amendments to be offered by Senators Toomey, Lee, Burr, Braun, and Cruz  or their designees, the texts of which are at the desk, and five  amendments that propose changes to the Internal Revenue Code to be  determined by the Democratic leader, with the concurrence of the  chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Finance.   I further ask that debate on each amendment be limited to 30 minutes,  equally divided between proponents and opponents, and that each  amendment, unless it would be considered germane postcloture, be  subject to an affirmative 60-vote threshold and that following the use  or yielding back of time on each amendment, the Senate proceed to a  vote on each amendment.   Finally, I ask that following the disposition of those specified  amendments, the bill, as amended, if amended, be read a third time and  that the Senate vote on the passage of the bill, as amended, if  amended, with no intervening action or debate.    Madam President, reserving the right to object, I just  will say briefly that this is very disappointing. What we are hearing  from our Democratic colleagues is that the Senate is supposed to be a  rubberstamp for what the House has done. We are not supposed to  consider and deliberate ourselves as a body. We are not supposed to,  apparently, entertain amendments--equal numbers from both sides--to  attempt to reflect our constituents' interests and get to a legislative  solution that would inevitably have broad bipartisan support. I am very  disappointed.   Of course, I would reiterate, no Republican has ever asked for a  guaranteed outcome on any amendment. All we are asking for is a vote,  and apparently that is asking too much, according to our Democratic  colleagues. I object.
