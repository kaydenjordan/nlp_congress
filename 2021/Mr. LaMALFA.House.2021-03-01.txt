 Madam Speaker, the top priority bill of the House of  Representatives this year for the Democrats seems to be H.R. 1, known  as the For the People Act.   What people is this going to benefit? For the politicians act, you  might call it. It helps politicians and hacks like The Lincoln Project,  not the people.   For example, if this bill passes, a political candidate raising  approximately $800,000 in their campaign under certain guidelines could  have the Federal Government match funds up to $6 million that could be  used for anything put into campaign--$6 million of your Federal dollars  going into a single congressional race under the right conditions.   These formulas are geared to ratchet up from the previous election  cycle. As we know, campaigns get more expensive each time; so does the  match.   Also, under this bill, the Federal Government would hand out $25  vouchers to every voter in three chosen States to donate to candidates.  How much will that cost just to administer a program like that? We know  the Federal Government doesn't do that cheaply, maybe $25 per check to  give each $25 contribution.   If you hand a bureaucrat a hammer, they will see everything as a  nail. The new system fines more people in order to raise funds for this  campaign giveaway. The fines will go up, and businesses will be hurt,  all in order to provide something not for the people.                            ____________________
