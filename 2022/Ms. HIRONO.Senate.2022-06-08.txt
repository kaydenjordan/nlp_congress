 Madam President, I want to thank the chairman of the  Judiciary Committee for his remarks just now. I, too, sit on the  Judiciary Committee, and I listened to Garnell Whitfield talk about his  86-year-old mother, who was murdered, and his charge to us to do  something, because basically he said: If you are not going to do  something in the face of all this gun carnage in our country, what are  you doing here?   I think that is a question that each of us should ask: What the heck  are we doing here if not to protect America's citizens?   One of the questions that I asked of the panel, which consisted of  two invitees from the Republican side and three panel members of  Democratic invitees--I asked them: Is the easy access to guns in our  country a major part of the gun violence and the massacres and the  killings in our country? And they each said yes. They acknowledged that  the easy access to guns, regardless of ideology, is what makes our  country the outlier country among all developed nations. What that says  to me is that we need to be very, very committed and very serious about  the need to enact sensible gun safety legislation.   As I listened to one of my other colleagues a little bit earlier  talking about inflation, yes, inflation is a problem, but certainly it  is not the answer to just blame the Democrats. I would like my  Republican colleagues to make a commitment to do what we need to do and  at least get a start in ending the gun violence in our country. As I  said at yesterday's hearing, Hawaii has among the strongest gun safety  legislation in the country. We have the lowest gun violence in the  country. There is a cause and effect here.   As Mr. Whitfield charged us with yesterday, do something. That is our  responsibility.                        Honoring Our PACT Act of 2021    Madam President, turning to another subject, over decades of  conflict, millions of American servicemembers have been exposed to burn  pits and other toxic materials. These men and women risked their lives  in service to our country, and we have a duty to ensure they get care  for conditions caused by these toxic exposures.   For months, my colleagues and I on the Veterans' Affairs Committee  have worked to craft a bill that meets our responsibility, our duty to  our veterans, and now we have the responsibility to pass this  legislation here in the Senate and deliver for our veterans.   This legislation is a bill named for SFC Heath Robinson from Ohio,  who served tours of duty in Kosovo and Iraq, where he was exposed to  toxic burn pits. A decade after returning home, Sergeant Robinson  developed a rare form of lung cancer caused by his toxic exposure.  Tragically, he passed away in 2020.   The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act is  historic, comprehensive legislation that provides the care toxic- exposed veterans like Sergeant Robinson deserve. This bipartisan  legislation extends VA healthcare eligibility to millions of post-9/11  veterans, including nearly 3.5 million who were toxic-exposed. It also  adds nearly two dozen conditions to the VA's list of service  presumptions and strengthens the VA's ability to provide the high- quality care and benefits these veterans need in a timely manner.  Altogether, this bill delivers the historic investment in caring for  our Nation's veterans.    The Honoring Our PACT Act is the latest step we are taking to support  our veterans in Hawaii and across our country. Just yesterday,  President Biden signed legislation to name the state-of-the-art VA  clinic under construction on Oahu after the late Senator Daniel Akaka.  He also signed our  [[Page S2859]]  bill to expand access to breast cancer screening and treatment for  veterans, helping ensure every VA patient can get the care they need.  By passing the Honoring Our PACT Act, we can continue building on this  progress and delivering for our veterans.   I would like to thank Chairman Tester, Ranking Member Moran, and  Chair Mark Takano in the House for their leadership in this effort, and  I would like to thank all the veterans and their loved ones who have  shared their stories and advocated for so long to help us get to this  moment.   This is an important and long-overdue step toward honoring our  Nation's veterans, caring for them. I urge my colleagues to pass this  bill without delay.   Madam President, I yield the floor.
