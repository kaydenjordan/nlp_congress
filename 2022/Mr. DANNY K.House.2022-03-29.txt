 DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I strongly support the  Securing a Strong Retirement Act because it will strengthen the  retirement coverage and savings of millions of Americans. I applaud the  many provisions included to expand retirement coverage and savings,  such as automatic enrollment in the retirement plans, modernizing the  Saver's Credit, creating new incentives to small businesses to offer  retirement plans, and increasing charitable donations permitted through  an IRA.   I thank Chairman Neal for including my bill, the Retirement Parity  for Student Loans Act, that promotes increased retirement savings  through an employer match for employees making student loan payments.  By allowing employers to contribute an employer-match into a retirement  plan based on an employee's student loan payment, younger workers who  currently cannot afford to save for their retirement will begin saving  much sooner.  [[Page H3949]]    Although over three-quarters of Americans have access to an  employment-based retirement savings account, few Americans can make the  maximum contribution of $19,500 to their retirement savings. Any  contribution to retirement savings is particularly limited for  millennials struggling with heavy student loan debt. The average  student loan balance for 2019 graduates was $32,731, and only 30  percent of young workers use 401(k) programs to save for retirement.  This policy is an important tool for employers to retain their  workforce and for workers to improve retirement savings and lower  educational debt.   I urge passage of this bill that does so much to expand retirement  coverage and savings to improve workers' long-term financial well- being.
