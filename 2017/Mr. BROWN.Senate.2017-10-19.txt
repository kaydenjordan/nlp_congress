 Mr. President, we yield back the time.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of  the amendment be dispensed with.    Mr. President, I ask for support of the Patriot  Corporation Act amendment. It is all pretty simple. Over the years, we  have seen companies shut down production in Mansfield, OH, or Dayton,  OH, and move to Tijuana, Mexico, or Hunan, China, and then sell their  production back in the United States.   Under this simple idea, the Patriot Corporation Act, companies that  do the right thing--companies that pay their workers decent wages;  companies that do the right thing by their workers in terms of  benefits, healthcare, and pensions; companies that make their products  and keep their production in the United States--will get a tax break.  They will pay a lower tax rate.   Yesterday at the White House, about 15 Senators met with President  Trump. I talked to him about the Patriot Corporation Act. He said he  likes the idea.   It is about time that U.S. companies that do the right thing should  be rewarded instead of those companies that shut down production and  move overseas and sell their products back. It is the right thing to  do. It is a simple idea. Its time has come, Mr. President.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
