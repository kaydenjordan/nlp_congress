 Madam Speaker, I rise today, on day 27 of the Trump  shutdown, to talk about the real-world impacts on those in my  congressional district, ordinary Americans who hope and pray for an end  to this manufactured crisis.   This week, I held a tele-townhall to hear personal stories from my  constituents. I heard from an 80-year-old grandmother who is worried  sick about what a long-term shutdown means to her Medicare.   I heard from a TSA officer who struggles to make ends meet on his  $23,000 salary and wonders how he will ever survive if he misses  another paycheck.   I heard from folks who worry about their tax refunds and their SNAP  benefits, their rental assistance and their home loans. And I heard  from people who wonder how much longer will their children be able to  get a warm meal when they get to school each day.   Madam Speaker, enough is enough. It is time to stop the partisan  games. Most of all, it is time for the Senate and the President to do  their job and shut down this shutdown.                            ____________________
