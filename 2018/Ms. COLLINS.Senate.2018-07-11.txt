 Mr. President, Ensuring that more Americans are better  prepared financially for retirement is one of my top priorities.   That is why I rise today to introduce the SIMPLE Plan Modernization  Act with my colleague from Virginia, Senator Mark Warner. Our  legislation will provide greater flexibility and access to both  employees and their employers seeking to utilize the popular SIMPLE  plans as an option for saving for retirement.   According to the non-partisan Center for Retirement Research, there  is an estimated $7.7 trillion gap between the savings American  households need to maintain their standard of living in retirement and  what they actually have. A recent Gallup poll found that only 51  percent of working Americans believe that they will have enough money  to live comfortably in retirement. Though this is the highest  percentage of confidence in nearly a decade, we must continue to work  to ensure that even more Americans will have the resources they need to  enjoy their ``golden years.''   Another contributing factor is that employees of small businesses are  much less likely to participate in employer-based retirement plans.  According to a study by the PEW Charitable Trusts, roughly 30 million  U.S. private-sector full-time workers continue to lack access to a  work-based plan to save for retirement.   SIMPLE retirement plans were established in 1996 to encourage small  businesses to provide their employees with retirement plans that are  less costly and easier to navigate. A business with 100 or fewer  employees can create a SIMPLE retirement savings account so long as it  does not offer another employer-sponsored retirement plan.   The SIMPLE Plan Modernization Act would help to expand access to  SIMPLE plans by increasing the contribution limit for most small  businesses. This would achieve two important goals, Mr. President:  first, it would encourage more small businesses to offer a retirement  savings benefit to their employees; and second, it would allow  employees of small businesses to save even more for retirement each  year on a tax-deferred basis.   This legislation is a win-win proposition for retirement security.  There are many small employers that simply cannot afford a 401(k) plan.  For them, this legislation would provide enhanced savings  opportunities. At the same time, the legislation is carefully  constructed to prevent employers with a 401(k) plan from dropping that  plan to adopt a SIMPLE plan. And the legislation preserves strong  incentives for small businesses that become more successful to move  from a SIMPLE plan to a 401(k) plan. We believe our approach will  encourage businesses and their employees to take steps to save for  retirement, and eventually move towards a more substantial retirement  package, like a 401(k) plan.   In my home state of Maine, the vast majority of businesses are  eligible to sign their employees up for SIMPLE Plans. Financial  advisors from Presque Isle to Portland have shared their concerns that  neither employees nor their employers are in a good position to save  for retirement. We must give  [[Page S4918]]  small businesses and employees a better opportunity to save for  retirement and this legislation will provide such an opportunity. I  urge my colleagues to join Senator Warner and me in supporting the  SIMPLE Plan Modernization Act. Thank you, Mr. President.                            ____________________     Mr. President, Ensuring that more Americans are better  prepared financially for retirement is one of my top priorities.
