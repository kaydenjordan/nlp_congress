 Mr. Speaker, our truckers are the heartbeat of  America, transporting about 70 percent of the United States freight. We  depend on our truckers more than the left cares to admit or realize.  Now they want to attack our truckers, even after the trucking industry  has come to the table time and time again, Mr. Speaker.   In 1998, one truck emitted what 60 trucks emit today. They have  removed 98 percent of what comes out of the tailpipe. Still, the  climate activists and converts will continue pushing their radical  green deal on Americans invariably and inevitably damaging our economy  and making us reliant on, guess who, China.   The Biden administration should be ashamed of taking a page from  California's radical playbook to ban gas-powered vehicles. Over 200,000  Texans are heavy-duty and tractor-trailer truck drivers. Now, let me  tell you: We don't want the Federal Government messing with our way of  life and our livelihoods in Texas. This dangerous EPA rule would  increase costs for the trucking industry and, in turn, would increase  costs for communities that rely exclusively on trucking for their  freight.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to vote in favor of S.J. Res.  11 to reverse the Biden EPA's new burdensome trucking regulations in  order to protect small business truckers and to prevent more inflation  and supply chain issues. This is a matter of life and death for our  truckers.
