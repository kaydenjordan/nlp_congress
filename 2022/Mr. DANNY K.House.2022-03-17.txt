 DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, the Putin regime  requires every strategy and every action that we can muster to put a  stop to Russia and restore sanity to our world order.   Russia's aggressive and brutal behavior, brutal actions towards  Ukraine is beyond what I call the pale. We have no other choice but to  step in and put a stop to it.   Madam Speaker, I strongly support this resolution.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the  gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Stansbury).    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I have been taught and  told from an African proverb that when a tall tree falls in the forest  it makes a lot of noise, it gathers a lot of attention, everybody and  every entity in the forest knows that something has happened.   A few days ago, a tall tree fell in the ``Chicagoland'' community  where I live. A gentleman, Mr. Pervis Spann, spent the last day of his  life. Pervis Spann, to all of us, is known as the ``blues man'' because  he was a great artist who projected, promoted, and entertained us for  years.                                time  1700    Pervis was born in Itta Bena, Mississippi. Like many other African  Americans who were born in Itta Bena, Mississippi, and anyone else in  Mississippi, individuals migrated to other places. Thousands and  thousands and thousands of them made their way to Chicago, Illinois.   As a matter of fact, we fondly say that the only place where there  are more Mississippians than there are in Chicago is in Mississippi  itself. Many individuals left the delta area. So did Pervis Spann. He  went to Michigan; worked in Gary, Indiana; and joined the military. But  eventually he made his way to Chicago.   He came to Chicago and used his GI Bill to go to broadcasting school,  and he got to be very good at it, not only as a broadcaster but also as  a promoter.   Ultimately, the Stack brothers bought a radio station, and they named  that station WVON. Eventually Mr. Pervis Spann, Vernon Jarrett, Wesley  South and a woman named Gwendolyn Hayes ended up acquiring the station.  Spann was the blues part of it. As a matter of fact, he entertained and  promoted, entertained and promoted.   The station also became a pioneer in talk radio. As a matter of fact,  before there was talk radio, Wesley South, one of the partners, had a  talk radio program called ``On Target''. And this was years and years  and years ago. ``On Target''. It is hard to believe that talk now  dominates in many places. So WVON was a pioneer of talk radio.   It also has become the powerhouse of communication in the Chicagoland  area, especially for African Americans. Talk all day long about  whatever is going on in the community, whatever is going on in Chicago,  and whatever is going on in the world, WVON. As a matter of fact, many  of my neighbors and friends wait to wake up in the morning so that they  can listen to WVON especially, beginning at 6:00 o'clock in the  morning.   But not only was Pervis Spann a tremendous promoter, but he also was  a tremendous businessman period. Ultimately the station came into the  hands of his daughter, Melody Spann-Cooper, who has taken it to new  heights. If it is not heard on VON, it did not happen if it was not  part of the discussion on WVON. So it is much more than entertainment.  It is the community's townhall all day long, every day, whatever it is,  WVON leads the way.   So I simply wanted to express condolences to his family on his  passing and also let his family know how much Pervis Spann has meant to  Chicago, how much it has meant to the socialization of the community,  how much it has meant to the business promotion of the community, and  how much it has meant to the spirituality of the community. On Sunday  afternoons there is kind of a gospel-political atmosphere created, so  that some people can hardly wait to get home from church so they can  turn on VON so they can listen to  [[Page H3816]]  the ``Gospel with Pam Morris Walton'' show.   So Pervis may have been the bluesman, and he may have entertained all  the greats. Pervis Spann was noted and known as the person who named  Aretha Franklin the ``Queen of Soul''. He gave her that designation,  and it stuck. So Melody will carry on in the tradition of her father as  VON is the voice not just of the Negro--that was what the VON stood  for--but the voice of the Nation, WVON, Pervis Spann.   Of course, Mr. Speaker, this month is Women's History Month, and we  celebrate Women's History Month because of the tremendous progress that  has been made.   I am always reminded that when a group of men sat in the room and  stated that we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are  created equal, they didn't really mean all men. They meant some men.  They meant the men whom they felt had enough knowledge, enough  resources, and enough interests to make decisions for the country.  Therefore, all men were not in the room.   As a matter of fact, African-American men who were in slave States  were not even considered as a full man. African-American slaves were  considered as three-fifths. They had something called the three-fifths  compromise which meant that they would only count African-American  slaves as three-fifths of a person when they were counting up for the  Census, not all men and no women.   As a matter of fact, women didn't get the right to vote in this  country until a little more than 100 years ago. Yet, as a result of  suffrage, protests, struggle, and changes, now a woman is the Vice  President of the United States. So there has been movement, although  not nearly enough and not nearly what there has to be. So the struggle  will continue so that ultimately there will be levels of equity in this  country for women, Blacks, and other citizens who don't have it and  have not had it.   The woman that I chose to mention at this time is a woman, Merri Dee,  who was an icon in broadcasting and philanthropy. Merri Dee was born in  Chicago in 1936, the youngest of six children. She was only 2 years old  when her mother died. Her father ultimately became sick and, of course,  he had remarried. She was adopted by her stepmother, and she maintained  that life was pretty rough for her until she got to the fifth grade and  met a wonderful teacher who helped to change her life.   She stated in an interview that this teacher, a Mrs. Robinson, told  her that she would be great. She believed in that teacher, and then she  went on and became great.   She graduated from Englewood High School, went back to New Orleans  and enrolled in Xavier University where she studied business  administration. She, of course, dropped out and took a job at IBM to  help her other brothers and sisters. She then worked, got married, got  divorced, had a daughter, got a good job, and she just felt that she  was spending too much time away at her job and from her child, so she  quit that job, and somebody told her: You have a gift for gab.   She decided to study broadcasting and journalism.   She did, and she got so good at it, eventually she got her first  show, a radio show. She did that for a bit, and then she got a  television show, became excellent at it, and became one of the top  female broadcasters in the United States.   As a matter of fact, she was so good, she did that, then she ran into  a little difficulty. She and one of her guests were kidnapped leaving  the show, robbed, shot, left for dead, and with two bullets in her head  she crawled up to the highway where someone picked her up, took her to  the hospital, and she stayed hospitalized for a year.    As a matter of fact, she was told that she wouldn't make it and had  two last rites given to her, one by the Reverend Jesse Jackson who was  indeed a friend of hers. But she prevailed and lived and was in the  hospital for a year. She came back, got hired by WGN Television, and  she became an anchor. She did that for 11 years. Then they asked her to  take the job as director of community relations and public affairs and  their children's charities, and she did.   She generated $31 million for the charities and for the philanthropic  work. She just kept doing it. I have never known anybody who was more  open and more giving. I must have gone to at least hundreds of  charitable events over the years where Merri Dee was the announcer. She  was the facilitator. She was the person making it happen.   So when we design and define what greatness is, Merri Dee was  obviously a great woman, a great broadcaster, a tremendous  communicator, and a person who could stir audiences and groups and  convince people to give thousands of dollars for needy causes.   So, Mr. Speaker, I salute Merri Dee. I salute her, and I revere her.  I know that if people go up that way, that she is up there walking  among the angels and putting on events and activities and waiting for  other people to come.                                time  1715                        Remembering Harold Washington     DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, finally, I will mention,  although it is Women's History Month, I will mention now an African- American male who was a transformative figure in the life, especially  of a big city that was the third largest city in the United States of  America, a gentleman named Harold Washington, who became the first  African-American mayor of the city of Chicago.   Harold, if he was alive now, would be celebrating his 100th birthday.  He would be 100 years old.   Harold was a transformative figure in the political life of Chicago.  Chicago was known as the city of the big shoulders, known as many  things. But it was a patronage-laden city. Patronage guided the  politics of Chicago.   For a long time, it had a tradition that if somebody went to city  hall or to State government or county government to get a job, the  saying was: ``Don't bring nobody, didn't nobody see it,'' basically  meaning that unless you had a letter from a ward boss or from some  elected official who was part of the system, even if it was a job that  you had ten times the qualifications for, you wouldn't get it. You  wouldn't get it because you didn't have the hook-up; you didn't have  the connection.   We actually convinced Harold Washington, I am sure, to run for mayor.  He had become a Member of Congress. He had been the Democratic lead on  the voting rights bill. Of course, in the mid `60s and `70s, that was  still hot, just as it is hot today.   It is amazing that we can't get the voting rights extension granted,  especially when all politicians in this country basically suggest that  they believe in democracy, that they believe in democratic principles,  and that they believe that everybody should have a right to participate  and express themselves. Then we go through this process of wrangling to  make it happen.   But somehow or another, there seems to be a block. I don't know;  maybe people have changed their minds from what they learned in grammar  school or in high school or what they read in the Constitution and all  of that. It seems that way.   Nevertheless, Harold Washington was convinced by people like Lou  Palmer, people like Vernon Jarrett, people like myself and others, to  run for the mayor of the city of Chicago. He said: Well, if you guys  really want me to run for mayor, you have got to show it. If you don't  show it, I won't do it. You have got to get some people registered to  vote, and you have got to raise some money.   I remember sitting in a room in Lou Palmer's basement, eating  watermelon, as a matter of fact, about 10 or 12 of us. We then said to  Harold Washington: Well, Harold, you can go on to your next meeting.  And we set out to generate the conditions and meet the conditions that  he had set.   Harold was so astute, such a charmer, such an intellectual, but he  also liked to walk the streets and talk to people in the alley and talk  to people who other people probably wouldn't.   I never will forget that I had set up a meeting with a bunch of  motorcycle riders for Harold to go to, and some of his campaign people  didn't want him to come. Motorcycle riders, the Born Losers, the  Buzzing Bees, and Dragons. Harold said: I will be there. Of course, he  came, and everybody had donned their leather jackets and all those  things.   After he got elected, we ended up with some plaques that the  motorcycle  [[Page H3817]]  riders gave to Harold and to me. I don't know what happened to his.  Mine is still around.   But when Harold got elected, the city council organized against him.  There were 29 people on the other side and 21 of us. We called it the  29-21. Ultimately, we ended up with a 25-25 split. Every item that came  up, there would be 25 votes for it and 25 votes against it. Then, of  course, Harold would get a chance to break the tie.   He had such a sense of fairness that he went all over the city  assuring every community that they would be treated the same as every  other community, that they would get a part of the infrastructure  money, that their schools would be prepared, and that their sidewalks  would be repaired and fixed.   He became bigger than life. As a matter of fact, when Harold died,  people celebrated in the streets and spent days walking through to pay  reverence. That is because he helped people understand that government  belonged to them, and they did not necessarily belong to government.   When people ask what was the transformation, the transformation was  that the patronage system was seriously diminished. The transformation  was the greatest participation, in terms of turnout in elections, would  occur, because the people felt that they had somebody in the highest  office who respected and recognized what they had to say.   Harold would stop on the street and have a townhall, and 15, 20  people would gather around. It wasn't his intent to stop on the street.  He just stopped and would spend time.   Someone asked me what was one of my fondest memories or stories about  Harold Washington. I told them it was the fact that I drove a car for  19 years. In 19 years, the car had sort of rusted in the floor, and I  put a plank there. We were someplace and Harold wanted a ride to tell  me something or ask me something, so he told his guys to go ahead and  he was going to ride to the next stop with me. When he got in the car,  the plank had shifted. He looked down and said: ``What the . . . ''   I said: ``Mr. Mayor, don't worry about that. Just push that plank  back over, and you won't even know that there is no floor.''   He said: ``Why don't you buy yourself a car?'' Well, I didn't get one  right then. Eventually, I did.   Harold Washington transformed the politics of Chicago. Harold  Washington gave being an elected official in Chicago a new meaning,  that it was not just about glad handing and backslapping. It was about  trying to serve and serving the people.   Harold, you did your job, you did it well, and we pray tribute to you  even during Women's History Month.                   Recognizing Chicago's Ukrainian Village     DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, as I prepare to close, I  can't help but be reminded that I represent a community in Chicago that  we fondly call Ukrainian Village. That is because most of the people  there are of Ukrainian heritage.   We have a rally every week. We have everything that you can possibly  have, with the hope and with the faith that our President, that our  country, will stay on the course. We have no doubt that we will  continue to protect Ukraine as a part of the humanity that this  country, ``My Country, `Tis of Thee,'' needs to express, because we  know that so goes Ukraine, so goes the other countries nearby, and,  ultimately, so will go the United States of America.   Ukraine is a part of us. We are a part of Ukraine. Together, I think  we will beat back the murderous, cowardly pact. We will be pressed to  the wall, but always, as Claude McKay would say, always, always  fighting back.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
