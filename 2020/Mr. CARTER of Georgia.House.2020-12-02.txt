 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Truitt Eavenson from Carnesville, Georgia, on his retirement after 36  amazing years at Georgia Power.   Truitt began his career at Georgia Power in 1984 as a distribution  engineer, and he remained faithful to the company's values and  operations ever since.   He held a variety of leadership roles within Georgia Power,  including, most recently, serving as the southeast region vice  president since 2017.   He was instrumental at fostering good working relationships with  elected State officials, other Georgia companies and industries, and  Georgia Power field office managers when he served as their vice  president of governmental and regulatory affairs.   He has been a leader in his community throughout his work with  numerous organizations, including the Ossabaw Island Foundation,  Savannah Area Chamber of Commerce, Savannah Economic Development  Authority, and the University of Georgia Alumni Association.   Mr. Speaker, I am thankful for Truitt's years of faithful service to  Georgia Power and his community, and I wish him and his family the best  as he begins his retirement.   Congratulations, my friend.                            ____________________
