 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Today I rise to offer my strong support for the joint resolution led  by my friend and colleague, Congresswoman Susie Lee.   On the Education and Labor Committee we are taking action on behalf  of students who were fleeced by predatory for-profit colleges.   Secretary DeVos has ignored hundreds of thousands of pending claims  from defrauded borrowers and taxpayers. That includes almost 3,000 from  my home State of Massachusetts. Despite having authority to provide  full and immediate relief, the Secretary's borrower defense rule does  not make students whole.   Her new, partial-relief formula to determine debt forgiveness adds  further insult to injury. We tested that formula in committee with the  secretary and exposed how flawed it is, how it severely restricts the  relief one can receive.   H.J. Res. 76 is necessary to block efforts to weaken key consumer  protections against crushing student debt and useless degrees.   I thank Congresswoman Lee and the committee for taking legislative  action, and I call upon my colleagues to support defrauded students in  this joint resolution.
