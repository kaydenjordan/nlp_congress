 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I will have my remarks, but first I will  do a little bit of housekeeping.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand there are two bills at the  desk due for a second reading en bloc.    In order to place the bills on the calendar under  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceeding en bloc.    Mr. President, in a democracy, no right is more sacred  than the right to vote. And yet, across the country, Republican- controlled State legislatures are conducting the most sweeping and  coordinated attack on voting rights in generations, fueled by Donald  Trump's insidious Big Lie that the election was stolen.   In several States, limits have been placed on voting hours, polling  locations, and methods of voting. Barriers have been raised to make  voting by mail, absentee voting, afterhours voting, and early voting  harder.   Republican legislatures are not only making it harder to vote, they  are making it easier to steal an election. They actually believe that.  Donald Trump does the Big Lie, everyone knows it is a lie, and now  Republican legislatures are acting on that Big Lie and saying we could  steal an election. What is happening to our democracy? Stripping  independent election officials of power, giving partisan election  bodies more control, even firing members of county election boards,  this is what Republican legislatures are doing, not for fairness, not  for bipartisanship but to jaundice elections.   And if the consequence is Americans of all parties feel that the  elections are not fair, what is going to happen to this sacred and  wonderful democracy? Republicans are actively dismantling all the  barriers that prevented Donald Trump from subverting our elections in  2020. Imagine if they hadn't been in effect. Imagine.   All of these efforts have an Orwellian logic. Under the guise of  ``election integrity,'' Republican legislatures are sowing more doubt  about our elections through phony audits and fact-free claims of voter  fraud, lying claims of voter fraud. They are lying. I just saw on TV  this morning how the Trump lawyers are being lambasted in court. And  even Rudy Giuliani has lost his license to practice because they lied  about the election, that they perpetrated the Big Lie in legal  documents. The same thing is happening everywhere. What is happening to  this Republican Party? What is happening? When Donald Trump, the  biggest liar we have ever had as President, sets the tone and they  follow in those lies, repeat those lies, sometimes even embellish on  those lies, what is happening to that party, the party of Abraham  Lincoln?   Falsely claiming that the election was ``stolen,'' Republican  legislatures are making elections easier to overturn, even under the  falsest and biggest  [[Page S4836]]  of lies. And what happens here? Our Republican friends here in  Washington have chosen a path of supine compliance, refusing to stand  up to the Big Lie, bowing down before it, bowing down before Donald  Trump, the biggest liar that we have ever had as an American President,  except when the Capitol Building is literally under siege.   And, by the way, just parenthetically, I commend to my colleagues and  to all Americans--the New York Times did a video of the siege. They  even had some--they showed the siege; they showed the violence; and  they had some Republican Congressmen saying it was like tourists. It  was incredible. I recommend everyone should watch this. And I hope-- Republican colleagues, just watch it. You were there. Just watch it. I  commend the New York Times. They did a great job on it.   Anyway, the effort to fight this wave of voter suppression and  Republican election rigging is strong and growing. I want to be very  clear about that.   In Texas, where the Republican Governor has called a special session  to reconsider one of the most restrictive voting laws in the Nation,  Democrats are doing all they can to block the dangerous partisan bill.  They are brave. They are bold. They are courageous, and history will  show them on the side of right and the Republican Governor--I saw him  on TV this morning--on the side of deep, dark, ugly wrong. Many of  these lawmakers from Texas have come to Washington. I will be meeting  with a group of them today to plot out strategy and to praise them for  what they are doing.   President Biden will also address the issue of voting rights in a  major national address in Philadelphia, using the bully pulpit to draw  the Nation's attention and announce ways in which his administration  can defend Americans' fundamental rights.   And next week, Senator Klobuchar--always on the ball on these  issues--will lead the Senate Rules Committee to the State of Georgia-- your State, I say to the Presiding Officer--for their first field  hearing in 20 years. It will be an opportunity to shine a spotlight on  the consequences of the Big Lie and show the American people just how  far Republicans have gone in order to make it harder--harder--for  people to vote in the 2020 election.   The bottom line is this: Democrats will not stop fighting to protect  voting rights and defend our democracy. As I said, the vote in June was  the opening gun, not the finish line.   Last month, all 50 Senate Democrats united for the first time this  Congress to move forward on a strong voting rights bill. Shamefully,  shamefully, Republicans refused to even allow debate on voting rights  legislation, hiding behind some of the exact same States' rights  arguments, and very similar arguments, that southern Senators used in  the 1960s to oppose the Voting Rights Act. How do you feel about that,  Republicans and Republican leadership? How do you feel about using the  same arguments that were used by some of the arch segregationists to  stop voting rights in the Senate in the 1960s?   Last month, as I said, the vote represented the starting gun, not the  finish line, in the fight to protect voting rights. As majority leader,  I reserve the right to bring back voting rights and democracy reform  for another vote on the Senate floor                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, on another issue, infrastructure and  climate. Over the past few weeks, we have seen an awful heat wave hit  Oregon and Washington. Those States in the beautiful Northwest, always  known for their cool summer breezes, had temperatures like 115 degrees.  It was just astounding, not just a little temperature bump but  dramatically unusual.   Temperatures in the Pacific Northwest climbed so high that power  cables melted and roadways cracked in two. At the same time, in the  American Southwest, the lack of rainfall and depleted reservoirs have  led to a historic lack of water. According to the National Drought  Mitigation Center, more than 77 percent of the great State of New  Mexico is in a state of severe drought.   As climate change continues to worsen, extreme weather like this,  unfortunately, is only becoming more common, putting our agriculture,  our infrastructure, our economy, and our people's health at grave risk.   That is why I have made addressing the climate crisis in a bold way a  primary focus of our upcoming debate on infrastructure. We are working  with great urgency to make this happen. And we are going to do it in  two ways:   First, climate change has forced us to repair and rebuild our  infrastructure in a way that takes into account our new reality. Our  infrastructure must become more resilient to extreme weather. In New  York, I insisted that the Hurricane Sandy aid, for which New York and  New Jersey got $60 billion, focus on resiliency. And as we rebuild from  Hurricane Sandy using those Federal dollars, we have done it in a way  that makes flooding in downtown New York City and Long Island less  likely. We need to repeat that effort across the country to deal with  heat waves, droughts, wildfires, more powerful hurricanes and even  more.   But, second, we must use infrastructure investment to combat climate  change itself, not just make ourselves more resilient. If it keeps  getting worse, resiliency goes up, global warming gets higher-- resiliency goes up. We need to have this go down. That is so, so  important.   And what are we doing? In President Biden's proposal and in the  proposals Democrats are putting forward, we are investing in green  infrastructure, clean and renewable power, electric vehicles and  charging infrastructure, and retrofitting our economy to reduce carbon  emissions and slow climate change in both urban, suburban, and rural  areas. Investing in both elements--resiliency and green  infrastructure--that will create thousands upon thousands of good- paying union American jobs in the process.   So as discussions continue on both a bipartisan infrastructure bill  and a budget resolution, Senators of both parties must understand that  the issues of climate change and infrastructure cannot--cannot--be  separated from one another.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, pursuant to S. Res. 27, the Committee  on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions being tied on the question of  reporting, I move to discharge the Committee on Health, Education,  Labor, and Pensions from further consideration of the nomination of  Jennifer Ann Abruzzo, of New York, to be General Counsel of the  National Labor Relations Board.  [[Page S4844]]     I yield the floor.
