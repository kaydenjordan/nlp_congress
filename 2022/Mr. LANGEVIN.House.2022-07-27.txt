 Madam Speaker, yesterday marked the 32nd anniversary of  the Americans with Disabilities Act.   When I was 16 years old, an accidental gunshot left me permanently  paralyzed. That was 1980, 10 years before the ADA was enacted into law.   Then on July 26, 1990, President George H.W. Bush signed the ADA into  law, and my life and the lives of millions of others were transformed.   For 32 years, the ADA has broken down barriers and helped millions of  people with disabilities to reach places in society that were  previously unattainable. No longer do Americans with disabilities face  legalized discrimination in places of public accommodation, employment,  transportation, and so much more.   In fact, without the ADA, I would not be here today proudly  representing the Second Congressional District of Rhode Island as the  first quadriplegic ever elected to Congress. Yet, our fight for  universal accessibility and inclusion is far from over.   Millions of Americans with disabilities are counting on this body to  do what is right and continue the battle for accessibility and  inclusion. I hope to be a partner in that fight for many years to come.                            ____________________
