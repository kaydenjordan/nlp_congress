 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate this time on the floor to speak  about making the District of Columbia the 51st State.   I am not going to simply glow about how important that would be for  my district, because we have found that most Americans believe we  already have the same rights they do.   I want to describe one of the oldest cities in the United States, a  city that is bigger than two States, that is to say, has more residents  than two States, more residents than Vermont, more residents than  Wyoming, and about as many residents as seven States of the Union.   The people I represent, 700,000 of them, are number one in taxes paid  to support the Government of the United States, yet they have no  representation whatsoever in that body down the hall, the Senate of the  United States.   In fact, I am grateful that the House understands that I should vote  in committee, where most of the work is done, but when a bill comes to  the House floor, even if that bill singularly affects the residents of  the District of Columbia, every Member of this body, except the Member  who represents the District of Columbia, can vote on that bill.   That is not justice, that is un-American, and it offers strong  evidence, I think, of the underlying reasons why the District of  Columbia should become the 51st State of the Union.   We are making progress. We have got almost all the Democrats on our  statehood bill. And if there is Democratic control of the next  Congress, I will seek a vote on D.C. statehood on the House floor.   I got a vote on D.C. statehood when I first came to the Congress. It  is time to have another vote on D.C. statehood.   We have more than half of the Democrats in the Senate, and I will get  all the Democrats in the House and all the Democrats in the Senate  before the end of the 115th Congress.   Most Members of the House come to this place knowing little about the  Capital City. I don't blame them. I don't see why they should know much  about it, except that it is the tourist mecca of our country; that 30  million  [[Page H5010]]  people from around the world, including from their States, come to see  the extraordinary monuments in our city.   So Members shouldn't know any more about my district than I know  about their districts, and yet Members come to this floor to not only  vote on matters affecting my district, but on laws that would take away  or overturn laws passed by the legitimate government of the District of  Columbia.   When Members come, I greet them, offer them help in finding housing  and the rest, and that is about the end of it.   So if they come to the House to vote, they don't know anything more  about the city, except if they happen to stay here, and we welcome  them, than they did when they walked in the door.   But every Member needs to know that 700,000 Americans host them, and  they need to know, when they are called upon to interfere with the  local laws of the District of Columbia, they should treat our local  laws the way they would have their local laws treated.   I particularly speak of my Republican colleagues, who are the chief  proponents of local control. They don't want the Federal Government  into not only their business, but sometimes they try to get the Federal  Government out of Federal business, and yet it is my Republican  colleagues who are the chief abusers of what we call District Home  Rule, what Americans call the right to self-government.   I need to give you examples of what I mean when I say Members try to  overturn our laws, and I need to say that I often am able to keep them  from doing so, even without a vote on this House floor, because of the  way I think through what my role is.   I have got to think of a way to keep people who overwhelmingly  outnumber me, obviously, and are the majority in this House, from  overturning my own local laws. We have barely succeeded in doing so,  but I will give you an idea of what I mean.   I should begin by saying that because this is a city, a big city,  that its laws would be more progressive than in many other parts of the  United States.   For example, the District of Columbia government has passed a Death  With Dignity Act. This is a controversial bill. Six States have passed  it, including States represented by the Republican leadership of this  House. It is a bill that allows a person to take his own life with  minimal help from a physician. It is very controversial. Six States  have passed it; so has the District of Columbia. It is nobody's  business but theirs.   I have kept this law from being overturned, but I have had to fight  to do so for at least three years.   Let me give you another example: the Local Budget Autonomy Act. Why  would there be a Local Budget Autonomy Act? Everybody knows that if you  levy your own local taxes, no one should have anything to do with that,  but the District of Columbia does not have the right to have the final  say on its own budget, because any Member of the Congress can try to  overturn the District's budget.   Are they interested in the budget? Do they try to overturn the budget  itself? No. But when the budget comes here, Republicans use it as a  vehicle to overturn laws that they don't agree with, and that is why  our budget is here, this budget that was raised by the residents of the  District of Columbia, this local budget.                                time  1315    In order to keep our budget from coming here at all--what is it doing  here--a referendum overwhelmingly passed by residents called the Local  Budget Autonomy Amendment Act essentially said, that is it. It  shouldn't come here.   The House has tried to repeal that at least three times. I have saved  it from being repealed largely from marching over to the Senate.   Perhaps the most persistent attempt on the part of the Congress are  efforts to wipe out the District's gun safety laws. It is a big city  and, yes, big cities are where you have most of the gun violence, so  the District has tough gun safety laws. And yet, every single year I  have to protect our gun safety laws from Members of Congress who are  not answerable, are in no ways responsive, to the people of the  District of Columbia.   Our residents can't vote them out of office. They can vote only me  out of office. They can't touch them. If that doesn't fly in the face  of American democracy, I can't tell you what does.   Senator Marco Rubio has introduced a bill to wipe out all of our gun  safety laws since 2015. I have saved D.C. gun laws from being  eliminated. But Senator Marco Rubio from the State of Florida, where  the Parkland youngsters are, who have taken nationwide their own  campaign to get this Congress to pass sensible gun laws.   Yet Senator Rubio, aided by Representative Tom Garrett of this body,  would eliminate all of the District's gun safety laws, including the  District's ban on guns in schools; including making the District of  Columbia a unique exception to a Federal law called Gun-Free School  Zones Act, which means you cannot have a gun within a school zone.  Everybody could have that except the District of Columbia.   Senator Rubio and Representative Garrett would repeal the District's  ban on assault weapons and large-capacity magazines. Assault weapons in  the Nation's capital? Imagine who would be endangered if there were  assault weapons here? And I do not refer to the residents of the  District of Columbia alone.   Anyone who visits our city will often find traffic stopped while  caravans of high-level officials go by. Sometimes they will be Members  of Congress. More often they will be world figures. Imagine if just  anybody could have an assault weapon in the Nation's capital,  particularly today.   Yes, I have been able to stop it. But why should I have been put to  that effort when I represent 700,000 tax-paying citizens of the United  States who had already done it?   I do have to show you how low or laughable these efforts can become.  I have stopped a bill that prohibited my city from using its own funds  to keep certain kinds of flushable products from being sold in the  District of Columbia. They stop up toilets.   The Member who proposed this, Representative Andy Harris of Maryland,  perhaps because it is so laughable, ultimately withdrew it. We came on  the House floor to expose it.   But I cite the flushable wipes amendment to show these anti home rule  efforts know no bounds. You might ask, well, why would Representative  Andy Harris want to do this? I don't know for sure, except that there  is a manufacturer of those wipes that has surfaced and, as you may  know, many Members get campaign funds from people who ask them to place  matters in bills. They don't ask them to put them in our  appropriations, but that is what happened, and I had to get that one  out. I do want to publicly thank Representative Harris for withdrawing  his amendment.   To give you some sense, though, of how the District of Columbia has  to pay attention, not only to its own local laws and preserving them,  but has to ask its Member to do what every other Member does a lot on  national matters. So while I am working on national bills, during the  first year of the Trump Presidency, I had to defeat 15 bills to  overturn the District's gun laws.   I had to block bills that would gut the public school system laws by  making D.C. use its own local funds for private schools. Yet Congress  has defeated an education bill that defeated amendments to an education  bill that would have allowed school districts to spend its own money on  private schools.   They took private school vouchers out of the national bill, but a  Member tried to put vouchers on the District. Defeated that one. And  there are others, but I won't go down the list of them all.   Understand that that work is important to my District, but it is work  that no other Member has to pursue because you cannot interfere with  the local laws of any other Member.   At the same time, however, for example, I had and did get full  funding to rehabilitate the Memorial Bridge. That happens to be  important because millions of Americans use that bridge. They come to  Arlington Memorial Cemetery and use that bridge to get there. They come  to the Nation's Capitol to see our iconic sights, and they use that  bridge. Now that was a national bill. That is the kind of bill, Federal  bill, that most Members work on that they are proud of.  [[Page H5011]]    I bring it up because that work, which as a Member of Congress I must  do for the Nation, as well as my city, is quite apart from protecting  the local laws of my city.   Let's take the affordable healthcare act. Virginia has just signed  on, belatedly, to the affordable healthcare act. I am in the national  fight with most Members, certainly on my side of the aisle, to maintain  that law. And we have maintained that law. In spite of President  Trump's attempt to overturn it. In spite of more than 40 attempts by my  Republican colleagues to overturn it.   D.C. needed it, because with the ACA, 96 percent of D.C. residents  are now covered by healthcare. That means virtually everybody. But in  that effort I am in league with other Members on a national law. That  is what I should be paying attention to, first and foremost.    Another example of a national law which is important to the Nation  and to me is passage of the Dream Act, to protect these children who  were brought to the United States as infants or small children by their  parents, who know no other country, and now face deportation because  technically they, of course, are not citizens; even though they don't  know El Salvador or Mexico or any other of the countries from which  they would have come.   Of the 800,000 Dreamers, 800 of them are in the District of Columbia,  so I am like many Members who come to the floor on that issue. But that  is a national bill. That is what I am supposed to do in the Congress.   In our city, if somehow we could not save the Dreamers, that would be  $50 million annually gone from our economy; that is how productive they  are. I have had a town meeting with them. These are the most impressive  young people I have ever seen speak to our residents.   Mr. Speaker, could I ask how much time I have remaining.    After you have heard all of these abuses of American  democracy, you may have some understanding why I believe that the  District of Columbia should become a State, and why statehood is the  only remedy for the abuses that I have described.   But, do not think that there are no Republicans who understand some  of the issues I have described. I regret that my good friend, a  conservative Republican, Representative Darrell Issa--and I say I  regret, because I don't think that every Republican should be put in  the same category.   I cite Rep. Darrell Issa, because he was chair of a committee on  which I serve, and decided to have a hearing on our local jurisdiction.  He asked the Mayor to come, the chair of the City Council, and those  who handle the budget. He listened and he indicated his surprise to  know that the District's financial condition and reserves and its  growth as a local economy, were among the best in the Nation.   After that hearing, learning, for example, that our budget was the  envy of the States, Representative Issa himself endorsed budget  autonomy and worked tirelessly with me and with local officials, as  well as Republican interest groups, to try to secure at least the  autonomy over our budget; at least over our budget. These are what we  call the components of statehood.   So even if my Republican friends are not for statehood, there is no  reason not to be or to stand against the elements of statehood. And we  certainly may well get those before we get statehood itself.   For example, clemency. The President has the authority of clemency  over the District of Columbia. Well, he doesn't know a thing about the  District and, as a result, when clemency comes out, normally the  District inmates are not even included. That is a classic matter for  local governments.   Yes, budget autonomy is one of them. Even the District's local laws  have to come here and sit for 60 days, 30 days, or for criminal laws,  60 days, to see if anybody wants to overturn these laws. This is a  remnant of more than 200 years ago, when the District had no home rule,  as we called it, or self-government.   Of course the Congress doesn't choose to use that section, so they  could get rid of this legislative autonomy because they reserve their  energy for the budget. With a budget here, they use that as the vehicle  to overturn the District's laws.                                time  1330    What I think most Members of Congress do not know is that the  District's local economy is one of the strongest in the Nation, and let  me prove that.   It has got a $12.5 billion budget. That is larger than the budget of  12 States. My district has a $1.75 billion surplus. That kind of  surplus, that large surplus, almost $2 billion, is the envy of the  States.   My district has a per capita income higher than that of any State,  higher than that of California, of Massachusetts, of New York. That is  one of the reasons why the people I represent pay the highest taxes per  capita in the United States.   The total income of the residents of the District of Columbia is  higher than the income of seven States. Its consumption, given its  income expenditures, is higher than those of any State. And, of course,  what we are seeing is a city that is flourishing. Its population growth  rate is the highest since the 2010 Census. In fact, the District now  has a larger population, as I indicated, than two other States that  have representation to vote on this House floor.   DC would only qualify for one vote, and Vermont and Wyoming, have two  Senators as well--even with fewer residents than the number who live in  the Nation's Capital.   One way to understand why the residents of the District of Columbia  resent being treated as second-class citizens is to understand its  highest tax rate, Federal tax rate--the highest in the Nation--amounts  to $12,000 per resident, more per capita than any residents of any  States. Yet no matter what the bill, no matter how impacted the  District is, I will not vote on that bill.   What hurts more than the failure to allow the District to vote on  most bills is the failure to allow the District to vote on bills to go  to war. The residents of this city have fought and died in every war,  including the war that created the United States of America.   Please remember the slogan that the Framers and the residents threw  up to win their freedom. It wasn't, ``Freedom in the large.'' It was,  ``No taxation without representation.''   We ask for statehood based on the original understanding of the  Founders of our Nation who were willing and, indeed, did go to war for  the principle of no taxation without representation. Well, the people I  represent have gone to war without a vote to go to war and without a  vote upon returning from war.   The sacrifices should be clear to see. World War I--and here we are  talking about casualties--more than three States. World War II, more  casualties from the District of Columbia than four States. And then it  only goes up. The Korean war had more casualties than eight States.  And, of course, the Vietnam war had more casualties than 10 States.   That ought to be reason enough for the District of Columbia to be  made the 51st State. More important than paying the highest Federal  taxes per capita, more important than being excluded from a vote on the  floor of the Senate, it is the sacrifices our residents have made for  their country that speak loudest, most prophetically, about the right  of residents to be treated equally.   May I inquire of the time remaining, please.    Mr. Speaker, it is not as if the Congress of the United  States has never understood the injustices before you. The reason I  come to the House floor today is because there is turnover in the House  all the time and many Members have never heard this until now.   And why not? Because you don't listen to what happens to somebody  else's district. You are too busy dealing with your own district.   That is how we like it, and that is how we would like to make it for  every Member of the House.   Yes, almost 45 years ago, the House understood the injustice of what  was then the case. The District had no self-  [[Page H5012]]  government. It intermittently had some self-government in the 19th  century--and may I add, that the height of that self-government was  about the same as the District has now: a Delegate Member of the House  and the right to local government.   And who gave them that? It was the post-Civil War Congress, which was  a Republican Congress.   The Republicans lost their way, and they are chiefly responsible now  for the District's not having what their own party understood should  happen after the Civil War. They had fought a Civil War for democracy  for everyone, and they, indeed, began the home rule process that was  lost after Reconstruction and renewed again almost 45 years ago with  the 1974 Home Rule Act.   Here again in the 20th it wasn't the Democrats who were solely  responsible. Yes, it was a Democratic Congress, but it was a Republican  President, President Richard Nixon. He said, in signing the Home Rule  Act: ``As a longtime supporter of self-government for the District of  Columbia, I am pleased to sign into law a measure which is of historic  significance for the citizens of our Nation's Capital.''   Remember, this is President Nixon talking, saying: ``I first voted  for home rule as a Member of the House of Representatives in 1948, and  I have endorsed the enactment of home rule legislation during both my  terms as President.''   Then he went on to say: ``. . . it is particularly appropriate to  assure those persons who live in our Capital City rights and privileges  which have long been enjoyed by most of their countrymen.''   That was a Republican President and a Democratic House acting in a  bipartisan way to give the District self-government, a self-government  which it has handled better than most of the State and city governments  since.   And that is not the only example of Republicans working with us to do  what almost surely will take some bipartisanship. Representative Tom  Davis of Virginia worked with me on a bill that, in fact, got a vote in  both houses and, indeed, we would now have in the District, a House  vote if that bill had passed.    I was in the minority. Representative Tom Davis was in the majority  as a Republican. I regret that he has resigned from Congress to go on  to higher and better things, as he saw it. He worked with me and had  hearings. What he discovered was that the State of Utah, a very  Republican State, had missed getting a vote it thought due that State,  and Representative Davis discussed with me the possibility of pairing  the District of Columbia with Utah--one Democratic vote and one  Republican vote--and nobody would gain if the District got a House  vote.   Now, Representative Tom Davis was not for statehood, but he did not  believe that we would call it the people's House without giving the  residents of the District of Columbia a vote in that House.   The Governor of Utah came to testify for it. The Republican Members  from the House and the Senate voted for it. It was a one-to-one, and it  was perhaps the best chance for voting rights, certainly, that we have  had since the creation of the Republic.   Well, if we got that kind of bipartisan support for at least the  House vote, why doesn't the District of Columbia have a vote on the  House floor as I speak? The answer is that the National Rifle  Association succeeded in getting a Member to attach to the bill, in the  House, an amendment that, in exchange for the House vote, the District  would have had to give up all of its gun safety laws.   I have just indicated to you the kinds of sacrifice that would have  meant. The assault weapons ban would be gone, just to name, perhaps,  the worst of them. That is an offer we had to refuse, and it is the  closest we have come to equal rights as a Federal district.   But it is not the closest we will ever come. We will give priority  during the next Congress to budget autonomy, autonomy over our own  budget; legislative autonomy, to keep our legislation from having to  come to this floor.   A local prosecutor--the DA who everyone associates with your local  jurisdiction is not who enforces criminal law in the District of  Columbia. It is the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia who does  both local law, local criminal law, and, of course, Federal law.   Mayoral control over the National Guard; your Governor can call out  your National Guard because only he knows the ins and outs of safety  when there are issues affecting the National Guard. The National Guard  is usually used for things that are local in nature, such as hurricanes  and flooding.                                time  1345    The President knows almost nothing about that or about the authority  to grant clemency, as I mentioned earlier in these remarks. Also, of  course, control over the appointment of local judges and the operations  of the local courts. Yes, D.C. courts are title I courts. What that  means is that these judges who handle only local matters--local  criminal and civil matters--are appointed by the President of the  United States and have to stand in line to get approved by the Senate  of the United States.   I have simply summarized some of the hardships of not being treated  as an equal jurisdiction under the Constitution of the United States  and some of the benefits of citizenship that the District would obtain  if such equality were indeed granted.   It is true that the District has never achieved this equality, but I  do not fret that it is out of hand. When the next Congress resumes, I  have indicated any number of things I will pursue. In addition, if my  party controls this Chamber, I will ask for a vote on the House floor.  I will ask for that vote, even though I am not certain by any means  that that vote would result in statehood. I will ask for that vote,  because I want to put it to this body exactly what it means not to have  the same rights they have.   When my party controlled this House, I did not get statehood, but I  was able to get what is called the vote in the Committee of the Whole.  That is a vote on some business on the House floor.   My Republican friends actually sued the House for allowing the  District of Columbia, whose residents are number one per capita in  Federal taxes, this vote on the House floor. They went to the Federal  District Court, then to the Court of Appeals, but they did not have the  gumption to go to the Supreme Court.   So I voted for my District at least on some matters in the Committee  of the Whole. And I will seek that vote, even short of statehood.   I represent one of the Nation's oldest cities. I represent 700,000  residents who have overpaid their dues--have overpaid them in war, have  overpaid them in taxes. We are overdue as we pursue democracy for other  people around the world in assuring that there is democracy for  everyone in our own country. We should begin with the residents of our  own proud Nation's capital.   I ask the House to think deeply about what lies in your hands, and  that is not only the ability, but the obligation to make the 700,000  residents of the District of Columbia whole by making the District of  Columbia the 51st State of the United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
