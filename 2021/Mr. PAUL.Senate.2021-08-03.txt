 Madam President, Dr. Joseph Peter Cangemi lived a  life unmatched in experiences. With his wife Amelia by his side, he  traveled throughout the world doing what he loved most: consulting with  business professionals on how to be better leaders. This was the  perfect profession for Dr. Cangemi, as he was a natural leader. When he  spoke, you listened because what was about to be said contained  something important, something that could be of value either in that  moment or down the road. In addition to consulting services, Dr.  Cangemi also had a passion for teaching young people at Western  Kentucky University, many of whom are now successful in business as a  result of the life lessons he shared. He brought textbooks to life by  weaving in his own unique experience. This was what made his classes  some of the most sought after at WKU. He wasn't offering theory alone,  but real-world experience with actual Fortune 500 companies. Few can  gracefully navigate the demands of academia for extended periods of  time. Joseph saw egoes come and go, but always stood the test of time  at WKU. He had a career spanning over five decades where he won  countless awards, including the Excellence in Teaching Award from the  College of Education and Behavioral Sciences three times, Distinguished  Public Service Award, and the Excellence in Research and Creativity  Award. Along with numerous awards, Dr. Cangemi was also editor of the  International Journal of Leadership and Change.   Aside from his professional feats, Dr. Cangemi was also unmatched as  a family man. He and his wife Amelia traveled all over the world  bringing back stories and mementos to share with the grandkids. Primary  to traveling, they prioritized spending time with family. He and Amelia  rarely missed a basketball game his grandson played in, or a recital  his granddaughters took part in. It wasn't unusual for Joe to bring his  grandchildren to his classes where they would actively participate.  They were his pride and joy, and he never missed an opportunity to see  them. He and his wife Amelia would have celebrated their 59th wedding  anniversary this year.   Dr. Joseph Cangemi was born on June 26, 1936, in Syracuse, NY, and  surrounded by his family, died peacefully on June 13, 2021. While we  are sad to lose such a valued member of the community, we look at the  success of his students and family members and are reminded of the  positive impact he had on our world. May Joe rest in peace.                            ____________________
