 Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a bill for  the private relief of Shirley Constantino Tan. Ms. Tan is a Filipina  national living in Pacifica, CA. She is the proud mother of 20-year-old  twin boys, Jashley and Joriene, who are U.S. citizens. She is married  to Jay Mercado, a naturalized U.S. citizen.   Ms. Tan faces deportation to the Philippines, which would separate  her from her family and jeopardize her safety. I believe Ms. Tan merits  Congress's special consideration for this extraordinary form of relief  because her removal from the United States would cause serious, undue  hardship for her and her family.   Ms. Tan experienced horrific violence in the Philippines before she  came to the United States. When she was only 14 years old, Ms. Tan's  cousin murdered Ms. Tan's mother and sister and shot Ms. Tan in the  head. The cousin was eventually prosecuted, but he received a short  jail sentence. Fearing for her safety, Ms. Tan fled the Philippines  just before her cousin was due to be released from jail. She entered  the United States legally on a visitor's visa in 1989.   Ms. Tan faces a deportation order because of negligent counsel. Ms.  Tan applied for asylum in 1995. When her case went before the Board of  Immigration Appeals, her attorney was supposed to file a brief in  support of her case, but the attorney failed to do so. As a result, the  Board of Immigration Appeals dismissed Ms. Tan's case and granted her  voluntary departure from the United States.   However, Ms. Tan's negligent counsel never notified Ms. Tan that the  Board of Immigration Appeals issued an order granting her voluntary  departure. Because she did not know about the order, Ms. Tan did not  depart the United States, so the grant of voluntary departure  automatically led to a removal order. She learned about the deportation  order for the first time on January 28, 2009, when Immigration and  Customs Enforcement agents took her into immigration custody.   Because of her attorney's negligent actions, Ms. Tan was denied the  opportunity to present her case in immigration proceedings. She later  filed a complaint against her former attorney, who had similar  complaints from other clients, with the State Bar of California.   On February 4, 2015, Ms. Tan's spouse, Mr. Mercado, a U.S. citizen,  filed an approved spousal petition on her behalf. On August 20, 2015,  U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services denied her application due to  the fact that she still had a final order of removal. Ms. Tan must go  back to the immigration court and ask for the court to terminate her  case and then reapply for her green card. Ms. Tan still faces the  threat of deportation while she seeks to close her case before an  immigration court.   In addition to the hardship that would come to Ms. Tan if she is  deported, her deportation would be a major loss to her community and  would cause serious hardship for her two children, Jashley and Joriene,  who are U.S. citizens.   Ms. Tan used to run an in-home daycare, and she is now a homemaker  caring for her husband and two sons. Ms. Tan and her family are heavily  involved in their community in Pacifica and own their own home. The  family attends and volunteers at Good Shepherd Catholic Church. They  also volunteer with the Mother Theresa of Calcutta's Daughters of  Charity. Ms. Tan has the support of dozens of members of her community  who have shared with me the family's spirit of commitment to their  community.   Joriene is a junior at Stanford University and is premed, majoring in  human biology. In addition to his studies, Joriene is involved in  Stanford's Pilipino American Student Union. Jashley is a junior at  Chapman University, majoring in business administration.   If Ms. Tan were forced to leave the United States, her family has  stated that they would go with her to the Philippines or try to find a  third country where the entire family could relocate together. This  would mean that Jashley and Joriene would have to leave behind their  education and the only home they have known.   I do not believe it is in our Nation's best interest to force this  family, with two U.S. citizen children, to make the choice between  being separated or relocating to a country where they may face safety  concerns or other serious hardships.   Enactment of the legislation I am introducing on behalf of Ms. Tan  will enable this entire family to continue their lives in California  and make positive contributions to their community.   Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support this private bill.   I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the  Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3297         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR SHIRLEY CONSTANTINO                     TAN.         (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of       section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C.       1151), Shirley Constantino Tan shall be eligible for issuance       of an immigrant visa or for adjustment of status to that of       an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence upon       filing an application for issuance of an immigrant visa under       section 204 of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1154) or for adjustment of       status to lawful permanent resident.        (b) Adjustment of Status.--If Shirley Constantino Tan       enters the United States before the filing deadline specified       in subsection (c), she shall be considered to have entered       and remained lawfully and shall be eligible for adjustment of       status under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality       Act (8 U.S.C. 1255) as of the date of the enactment of this       Act.        (c) Application and Payment of Fees.--Subsections (a) and       (b) shall apply only if the application for issuance of an       immigrant visa or the application for adjustment of status is       filed with appropriate fees within two years after the date       of the enactment of this Act.        (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Number.--Upon the granting       of an immigrant  [[Page S8868]]       visa or permanent residence to Shirley Constantino Tan, the       Secretary of State shall instruct the proper officer to       reduce by one, during the current or next following fiscal       year--        (1) the total number of immigrant visas that are made       available to natives of the country of birth of Shirley       Constantino Tan under section 203(a) of the Immigration and       Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)); or        (2) if applicable, the total number of immigrant visas that       are made available to natives of the country of birth of       Shirley Constantino Tan under section 202(e) of such Act (8       U.S.C. 1152(e)).        (e) PAYGO.--The budgetary effects of this Act, for the       purpose of complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of       2010, shall be determined by reference to the latest       statement titled ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation''       for this Act, submitted for printing in the Congressional       Record by the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee,       provided that such statement has been submitted prior to the       vote on passage.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a bill for  the private relief of Shirley Constantino Tan.
