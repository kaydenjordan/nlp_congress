 Mr. Chairman, I strongly oppose this amendment.   I am acutely attuned to concerns about fiscal responsibility. While  Congress has struggled with fiscal concerns, the consistent attacks on  the critical EAS program demonstrate a complete lack of concern for the  realities of life across rural America.   Supporters of this amendment claim that, in many cases, an  alternative airport is a short drive away. This incorrectly assumes  that point-to-point miles on a map are the same as road miles.   The truth is that EAS is a vital economic engine that remains just as  important today as when it was created. It supports economic  development in small and rural communities by connecting businesses to  larger markets.   Page, Arizona, in my district, is just one example of the need for  this type of critical infrastructure. The challenges are real, but so  is the promise in Page. Taking away vital EAS dollars at a time when  Page and places like it all over the country are trying to attract  business and capital would be devastating and undermine the critical  work being done.   Let's work to support these communities, not exasperate the stark  economic disparities in rural America. Mr. Chairman, I urge my  colleagues to reject this shortsighted amendment.
