 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I am  pleased to come to the floor to salute him for his leadership as chair  of this very important subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations  that makes things happen for us in the Capitol to do the people's  business.   The United States Capitol has always been a beacon of freedom,  liberty, and justice to America and to the entire world. Here,  lawmakers and staff, institutional workers, the Capitol Police, and  members of the press enable the functioning of our very democracy. It  is vital that we ensure that this institution has the funding and  resources needed to serve the people.   The most exciting part of it is when children come to the Capitol  safely and curiously and excited about seeing where laws are made and  what our Founders' vision was and what our men and women in uniform  fight for as we see in their eyes their aspirations to the future which  is our charge for the children.   That is why today I am proud to rise in support of the Legislative  Branch appropriations bill which meets these needs. I thank the  committee chairwoman, Ms. DeLauro, and subcommittee chair, Tim Ryan,  for their leadership. This takes a lot of attention and a lot of  specificity and meticulous attention to detail, and I thank the  distinguished chair of the committee for his brilliant attention to all  of that.                                time  1600    This funding bill not only funds the legislative branch, it  strengthens it. It does so by advancing a more diverse and inclusive  congressional workforce. It has long been a priority for many of us to  ensure that the Halls of the Capitol reflect the beautiful diversity of  our Nation at every level.   The bill provides for strong funding for paid internships to support  more hardworking interns from middle-class families. This has been such  a priority  [[Page H4161]]  for many of us because these internships are an opportunity for young  people. But if they are unpaid, they already self-select as to who can  participate. We have seen this over time, where that opportunity cannot  be taken advantage of unless there is funding for it.   It also provides funding for the Wounded Warrior program, which gives  our heroes who served in uniform an opportunity to serve in  congressional offices.   Proudly, it allows Dreamers to work in the legislative branch. Our  Dreamers make America more American, and it is vital that their voices  are heard here in the Capitol.   Most importantly, this bill is about security, and that is a moral  imperative, funding and supporting our United States Capitol Police  force, the heroes. In this legislation, we secured strong increases in  funding for the Capitol Police force, which will provide for the hiring  of over 2,100 sworn officers and 450 civilian members of the Capitol  Police.   It also improves training and bolsters wellness support for the  Capitol Police, many of whom are still suffering from the January 6  domestic terrorist attack on the Capitol complex.   Just yesterday, we heard from four heroic members of law enforcement  who suffered horrible injuries and trauma that day. That trauma  continues, not just among the Capitol Police, not just among Members of  Congress, not just among Capitol staff, congressional staff, but those  people who maintain the Capitol, who make it all work for us, custodial  and maintenance people in the Capitol.   Every hero of that day needs and deserves our support. Now that the  Senate has announced their agreement on a security supplemental, we  will work to ensure that the need of the Capitol and congressional  community, as completed in the Honore report, and included here, are  met. I thank the chairman for the work that was done on that  supplemental.   Of course, what we sent to the Senate is much stronger than the  response we will get from them, but we must start, and we must  continue.   This legislation honors our heroes. It respects our values. It  directs removal of statues or busts in the Capitol of Confederate  traitors, as well as statues of white supremacists.   As I have said many times, the Halls of Congress are the very heart  of our democracy. The statues on display should embody our highest  ideals as Americans, expressing who we are and who we aspire to be as a  Nation.   Removal of these statues is long overdue. That is why, as Speaker, I  have led the passage of legislation now twice to do so. In fact, I took  down the pictures in the Speaker's Lobby months ago as an example.   At the same time, this afternoon, we are considering the foreign ops  bill. I call it the foreign ops bill. When I was the ranking member it  was called foreign ops. Now it has a bigger name and a Democratic  chairman.   The bill makes important investments to strengthen Congress and,  therefore, strengthen America, and it should be passed.   In that spirit, I also support another appropriations bill to  strengthen America, H.R. 4373, which advances our leadership in the  world, as it defends our values.   As a former ranking member of the State and Foreign Operations  Appropriations Subcommittee, I am proud of this bill, and I salute the  chair, Barbara Lee, a lifelong champion of global health and human  rights, including through her leadership on PEPFAR and the Global Fund  to Fight Aids.   This funding bill makes clear that, as President Biden has said,  ``America is back.'' It is a strong statement of America's leadership  in the world.   With this legislation, America is once again taking the lead in the  climate fight, with over $3 billion to address the climate crisis,  including through first-ever appropriations to the Green Climate Fund.   We are setting an example for the world on public health, providing  over $10 billion to support families' health around the world and  prevent future pandemics, focusing on surveillance, detection, and  response capabilities.   Also, in terms of public health, we are proud to be permanently  repealing the global gag rule, a dangerous rule that deprives the  poorest families in the world of basic healthcare and family planning  services.   We are investing billions in initiatives for maternal and child  health and fighting infectious diseases, including, still, HIV/AIDS  through PEPFAR.   This funding honors our values by investing in human rights with the  Global Equality Fund and other initiatives to support the LGBTQ  community and support for disability rights, gender equality, and  protecting persecuted religious minorities; humanitarian assistance,  with billions for migration and refugee initiatives and disaster  assistance; and protecting democracy and the rule of law around the  globe. It contains billions in security and economic support to  partners and allies to advance peace, prosperity, and stability.   We are proud of its strong support for Israel, which is in our  national security interests.   We are also proud that this legislation helps implement the ALLIES  Act, passed last week by the House to expedite Afghan Special Immigrant  Visas.   The local Afghan partners who have worked shoulder to shoulder with  the American military and our diplomatic personnel are heroes. They  have been vital to the safety of American lives and the success of our  mission. We made a promise, and now we are keeping it. We must be there  for them as they were for us.   These two funding bills demonstrate and defend American leadership at  home and around the world. I urge a strong bipartisan ``aye'' vote for  both.    I thank the leadership of Rosa DeLauro, Barbara Lee, and Tim Ryan.
