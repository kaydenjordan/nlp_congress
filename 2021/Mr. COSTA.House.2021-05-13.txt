 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in light of the recent rocket  attacks launched by Hamas against our close friend and ally, Israel.  Those of us who have visited Israel many times know that Israelis like  to say that they live in a tough neighborhood. It is a volatile region  with hostile neighbors.   Israeli citizens and children live under the shadow of an everlasting  threat of rocket attacks, suicide bombings, and looming violence.  Israel is really the only true democracy in the region, and they have a  right to defend themselves from attacks, and they must. These attacks  over the last weeks are just the most recent examples. They mark the  worst escalation of the conflict since 2014 resulting in the deaths of  over 70 people.   As Hamas' incessant rocket barrages continue, more civilian lives are  put at risk, including innocent Palestinians. They also further  endanger any possibility of peace. That is their goal.   As a key ally in the region and a longtime friend of the United  States, we must support Israel's right to defend itself and deescalate  the violence and use our influence to do whatever we can to support our  friend.                            ____________________
