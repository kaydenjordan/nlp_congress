 Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues.  At this juncture, it is hard to find the words. How many more  shootings, how many more individuals have to die before we take action?  And I rise because the Senator--my colleague, the great Senator from  Connecticut--was identifying these names as a form of prayer, which I  could not have said that better, because this is about recognizing  those we have lost in order to prevent future loss of life.   So I join them to recognize individuals across the country and in my  home State of Nevada who have lost their lives: Vincent Brown of  Colorado; Zaimier Bell of New Jersey; Anthony Stanley of Missouri; Bao  Yang, Minnesota; Daisy Navarrete of Texas; David Camacho, Rhode Island;  Deonte Minor, Washington, DC; Ronald B. Williams from Indiana. All of  these individuals were killed by gun violence. And just those names  would be too many. Yet they represent a few and a heartbreakingly long  list of victims, families, and communities whose lives have been ripped  apart by senseless gun violence just this year.   Sadly, my home State of Nevada has been no stranger to this pain. In  Las Vegas, on October 1, 2017, a gunman opened fire on a crowd of  thousands of people at the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival. He killed  58 people that night. Two more victims have since died from injuries  they received that evening. And hundreds, hundreds more were injured-- people who just wanted to enjoy an evening of celebration with their  friends and family.   I know the fear and the trauma that so many families experienced that  day. My niece was at that concert, and my family and I are incredibly  grateful that she made it home safely. But I will never forget--never  forget--on that Monday after the horrific shooting that took place,  sitting at the Reconciliation Center in Las Vegas with the families,  with the parents, the uncles, the aunts, the siblings, who were waiting  to find out what happened to their loved one.   Can you imagine? It is the most horrific thing any family member  could go through. You are waiting to hear what happened to your family  member--your child, your son, daughter, your niece, your nephew, your  father, your mother--and you are hoping that as time and the clock  ticks away, your child is not one that is in the backroom with a  coroner right now.   I cannot tell you how heartbreaking it was to be with those families  and talking to them and the fear and the anxiety and the helplessness  and the hope that still they clung to that they would find out that  their child or their brother or their mother or sister was really safe  somewhere in one of the hospitals in Las Vegas.   No one can imagine that, and no one should have to imagine it. And no  one should ever have to go through that. But that is what families and  loved ones have been going through over the years because of the  senseless gun violence that is happening across this country.   Every day, more than 100 families lose a loved one to gun violence.  Austin Cooper Meyer, age 24, from Sparks, NV; Brennan Lee Stewart, age  30, from North Las Vegas; Cameron Lee Robinson, age 28, from Las Vegas;  Charleston Hartfield, age 34, from Henderson, NV, a police officer;  Erick Steven Silva, age 21, from Las Vegas; Laura Ann Shipp, age 50,  from Las Vegas; Neysa Christina Tonks, age 46, from Las Vegas; Quinton  Joe Robbins, age 20, from Henderson--those are just 8 of the 60  Americans who lost their lives during the Route 91 Harvest festival  shooting in Las Vegas on October 1, and their names and stories will  stick with us forever.   But we also have to remember the loved ones they have left behind. So  [[Page S1752]]  many of these names I know now not just because of the horrific  shooting but because I have met their family members whom they have  left behind--children who were left behind, children who lost their  parent to this horrific gunfire, husbands and wives, mothers and  fathers. It just goes on and on and on.   In the next few minutes, I want to share some stories of Nevadans  whose lives have been altered by gun violence. Many of these stories  are heartbreaking, and they stem from the October 1 mass shooting that  took place in Las Vegas.   Before I talk about them, however, I have to also recognize and  praise the many heroes who stood up and worked to protect our community  that night.   After the bullets stopped raining down on the Las Vegas Strip, a  former marine turned a truck into a makeshift ambulance and drove more  than two dozen people to one of our hospitals. A couple provided CPR to  injured victims on the site. And hundreds of concertgoers risked their  lives carrying fellow concertgoers to safety.   In fact, many younger attendees already had a sense of what to do to  stop the bleeding from bullet holes and knew to run for safety in the  breaks in between the sounds o gunshots because of training they had  received in their schools and workplaces.    But after the shooting, I received a letter from a constituent who  survived the Las Vegas shooting, and she wrote:         On October 1st, 2017, our life was forever changed. . . .       My husband and I attended the Route 91 Harvest Festival. We       were having the time of our lives, enjoying the different       bands we got to see and singing along with all our favorite       songs. [My husband] and I were so moved when [one of the       bands] led the audience singing God Bless America. Who would       have known that just a few hours later our lives would be       changed forever?        When the shooting . . . started, I thought it was       firecrackers. We looked around and then there were more       shots. My husband pulled me to the ground, laying on top of       me, shielding me from gunfire. He laid there tense waiting to       be shot while I laid there waiting for him to go limp. We       prayed and told each other we loved [one] another. I prayed       we would live to see our children raise their children and I       felt Jesus' hands covering us. During a pause in the       shooting, my husband pulled me up to start running. I was       terrified, [because] we could hear bullets whizzing by and       [we] could smell gun powder. There were three people, that I       know of, who were shot right around us. The shooting       continued for what felt like forever. We continued running       and ran across Las Vegas Boulevard while the shooting       continued. There was so much confusion and we didn't know if       there were more shooters.        By the grace of God, my husband [and] I are unharmed       physically. Our emotional scars are still to be determined.       Sleeping has been difficult. I have had periods of       uncontrollable shaking. I have chronic stomach pain and have       . . . difficulty eating. All of this seems trivial compared       to the families who have lost mothers, fathers, sons, and       daughters and the hundreds of people still suffering with       physical injuries.    Now, I read that letter because it is not just, as I have said  before, about the lives we have lost, but it is about the lives who are  affected by gun violence. Reading that letter is just heartbreaking-- and to think that her trauma is experienced by so many other Americans  from Las Vegas, from Parkland, from Orlando, and from Boulder. It is a  stain on our Nation.   And I have, since that shooting, been able to meet so many incredible  survivors of this shooting, including two sisters, the Marano sisters,  who were at the concert that night and are still living with the  emotional scars from being there in that horrific shooting.   Geena Marano has learned to prepare herself for Independence Day and  New Year's Eve, when the sounds of fireworks can sound eerily similar  to gunfire. But if a car backfires unexpectedly, she has to start the  process of reminding herself: ``You're safe. It's OK. Don't worry.''   And her sister Marisa, who was also at the festival, says her own  daughter has picked up on the habit of reacting to loud noises. She  said: ``It breaks my heart because my trauma has [now] passed on to  her.''   The fear resurfaces for these sisters in so many situations: on  anniversaries, including of all the shootings since then; at high  schools, where Geena was doing outreach to students and feared that she  was putting herself at risk of another shooting; passing the Strip,  eerily during the COVID pandemic, like it was on the day of the  festival, because the Strip was shut down. Anywhere there is darkness  and music, even on an evening out, the sisters still feel the  repercussions of that night at the concert.   And they are not alone. While the tragedy of the Route 91 shooting  may be 3 years behind us, for many survivors a moment can bring it all  roaring back, and many more live in fear that it could happen again.   Telemachus Orfanos, a survivor of the Route 91 Harvest Festival  shooting, was killed when a gunman entered the Borderline Bar & Grill  and shot 12 innocent people on November 7, 2018.   What happened to Telemachus and other October 1 survivors in the  restaurant that night was a uniquely American phenomenon that we should  not be proud of. We keep having these mass shootings in our country,  and it is past time that we acted. It is not only what our Nation  deserves. It is what these families and these survivors and those who  lost their lives deserve.   The Nevadan who shared her October 1 experience with me ended her  letter by stating:         I am urging you to pass thoughtful, reasonable controls       that will enhance the safety of our society. It is time to       take . . . action to protect our mothers, fathers, sons,       daughters, nieces, nephews, cousins, and friends. Please, do       not sit back and do nothing.    And she is right. We cannot sit back and do nothing. We must pass  commonsense gun legislation, like universal background checks that we  have passed in the State of Nevada. That will help keep Americans safe.  We owe it to our friends and families and all of the victims who have  already been irrevocably marked by gun violence to take action.   Thank you.
