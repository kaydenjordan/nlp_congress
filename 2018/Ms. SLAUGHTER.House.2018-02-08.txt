 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   We saw a shutdown just over 2 weeks ago, and here we are again; I  believe this is the fifth one since September. And since the  Republicans control every branch of the government, we have to wonder  what is going on here.   I stood in this same spot after midnight in 2013 and announced that  the great government of the United States was closed for business. At  that point, they were closed for business for 16 days, which means all  the Federal buildings and parks were closed. The vendors who had little  mom-and-pop stores, newspaper kiosks, and things at Federal businesses  lost all the money, a lot of it, people with lunchrooms. The estimate  was $24 billion was lost to the Federal Government.   As I recall that particular one, that was because Senator Cruz, a  Republican from Texas, didn't like the Affordable Care Act and  apparently was not in favor of giving healthcare to the American  people.   The first shutdown that occurred when I first came here was during  the Clinton administration, when Speaker Gingrich shut down the  government of the United States because he was unhappy with the plane  seat in Air Force One that had been assigned to him.   And 2 weeks ago, it was blamed on the Democrats, which is very  strange, since the Democrats do not have the vote to shut down the  House. Only the majority has those votes. And this is the first  shutdown in history, as far as we can find, that the group of persons  who control the House, the Senate, and the White House have given  themselves a shutdown. It is a pretty sad day for us.   So here we are, 3:30 a.m., 3\1/2\ hours after a government shutdown  once again. We have really got to stop this. I tell you, our fellow  Americans are in a state of nervous anxiety. The stock market dropped  1,000 points in a single day, twice this week. We have perplexed the  entire United States of America as well as large parts of the world.   And I would think that a reasonable person, looking at all this,  would be understood to believe that perhaps Republicans are incapable  of running the government because it is purely, purely government by  nothing but crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the  rule to bring up H.R. 3440, the Dream Act. This bipartisan, bicameral  legislation must pass before the time runs out on hundreds of thousands  of young people who were promised, by a previous administration, that  if they registered and paid $500, they could stay in the only country  they know.   Without any warning, the new President invalidated the program and  their lives. The things that they were promised were taken away, and  those young people, a part of our lives, are living in fear. I really  hope that we can do something about that. It is past time.   But I think what happened to them was most un-American.   So I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the  Record, along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote  on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from New York?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham) to discuss our  proposal.   Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I stand here  this morning for Nicole, Miriam, Antonio, Karen, Leo, Adriana, and  hundreds of thousands of other young Americans who dream and pray for  only one thing: that this esteemed body of elected Representatives,  endowed with a solemn responsibility to enact laws, will see a piece of  themselves in them; that they will see beyond the circumstances by  which they came to call America home and, instead, see the American  values that they hold deep in their heart of hearts.   I would surmise that there isn't one congressional district that  isn't home to a DREAMer, and, by God, we are all lucky for it because,  to our kids, DREAMers are their friends; to our students, DREAMers are  their teachers; and to our seniors and elders, DREAMers are, in fact,  their caretakers.   DREAMers are entrepreneurs with the grit and determination to do  something with nothing, following in the footsteps of intrepid  explorers who forged new paths that led us to amazing discoveries.   To our economy, DREAMers are a well-oiled engine of valedictorians,  doctors, software engineers, and technicians hoping to give back to  their communities. Their imagination and determination is a driving  force in the offices of Fortune 500 companies and the Main Streets of  our towns and cities.   And every year, for the next decade, DREAMer ingenuity and tenacity  will quite literally pump billions into our economy. Their efforts help  America grow faster and stronger. And collectively, for our Nation,  they represent our future and are a reflection of our values.   DREAMers are wide-eyed American optimism. They work so hard because  they are so grateful and, despite setbacks, they persevere. Despite  struggles, they overcome, just as Americans always have. And in the  face of unbelievable adversity, DREAMers beam the hopefulness and  dynamism that gives meaning to the American promise.   Our Founders knew that our democracy wasn't perfect, but they  believed that, as lawmakers and representatives, we would work every  day to live up to the ideals they set forth. And today, we have an  opportunity to do just that.   All we have to do is enshrine the promise that unlocked the  incredible potential of these young Americans by passing the Dream Act  now. With one vote, we have a chance to unite our country around young  people who embody our belief that hard work actually pays off.   So I ask my colleagues to vote against the previous question so that  we can immediately bring the Dream Act to the floor and provide  certainty for Americans like Nicole, Miriam, Antonio, Karen, Leo, and  Adriana who want to continue to contribute to the country that they  love, the only country they have ever known. We cannot afford to wait  another day.                                time  0340     Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Polis), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), a distinguished member of the Committee  on Rules.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to  me.   Mr. Speaker, I rise because I believe we ought to help the DREAMers.  My Republican colleagues have said they want to help the DREAMers as  well, yet they have done nothing.   I am deeply frustrated, angry, and disappointed that in the greatest  deliberative body in the world, we are constantly prevented from  deliberating.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  defeat the previous question so we can bring up the Dream Act so we can  help nearly a million people in this country, mostly young people who  came here when they were very, very young, who know no other country  but this country as their own.   We ought to find a way to protect them, to give them peace of mind.  That shouldn't be a radical idea. Yet we can't seem to ever bring to  the floor a remedy, a solution to help these people.   Speaker Ryan, when he took the gavel in 2015, promised a return to  regular order. He said: ``We need to let every Member contribute.'' He  also said: ``We ought to open up the process and let people  participate.''   Well, there is a bipartisan group here who believe we ought to  protect the DREAMers, who have a solution: the Dream Act. Let us bring  it to the floor, have a debate, and vote on it. If my Republican  colleagues don't want to vote for it, they can vote ``no.'' But we  ought to have a debate on this.   This is a big-enough deal. This is an important enough issue where we  ought to have this debate. It really is frustrating that at this late  hour we can't even get a commitment from the Speaker of the House to  bring this issue to the floor.   This spending bill that we are talking about, this budget deal, would  pass overwhelmingly. All Democrats, I am sure, would support it if the  Speaker would just make one promise, and that is that we can bring a  bill to the floor, a bill that we think is appropriate, to help the  DREAMers. That is it.   If my Republican friends don't want to support it, they can vote  ``no.'' But to not let an issue like this be debated on the floor, to  not think it is important enough to bring before the full House, is  unconscionable.   I don't know whether my friends on the other side of the aisle have  met DREAMers or not, but they have been here. They have been knocking  on your door. These are incredible people. They contribute to this  country in so many ways. They have led efforts to help protect people  who have been victims of hurricanes all throughout this country. They  have saved lives. They serve in our military.   All we want is a vote. That is it. And I just, for the life of me,  can't quite understand why this is such a heavy lift.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Massachusetts.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the  previous question so we can have this debate. I am tired of all the  excuses. I am tired of all the reasons that we are being given why we  can't debate this issue. This is important. These are real people.  These are members of our community. They are our neighbors. The time  has come for us to act.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous  question. Let's have this debate. Let's protect the DREAMers. Let's do  the right thing. But enough of the excuses. Enough of the excuses. It  is time to vote.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the Democratic leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the Democratic leader.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire of my colleague if he has  any further speakers?    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield  myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, let's acknowledge that a deal like this could have come  much sooner if the majority tried bipartisanship from the very  beginning. Instead, our Nation has had to go through four short-term  funding fights and two government shutdowns to arrive at where we are  this morning. All of that was entirely preventible. It was brought on  by the majority's inability to get its work done.   It was little more than a week ago that President Trump stood in this  Chamber and gave his State of the Union Address. In it, he proclaimed:  ``I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out  common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the  people.''   That was Tuesday. But the following Tuesday, the President said that  he would love to see a shutdown. He keeps injecting incredible  confusion and uncertainty as to what he actually would be willing to  sign into law. I am aware that my colleague, Mr. Sessions, did assure  us that he wants to sign this bill.   Mr. Speaker, it has been an awful long night, and it didn't need to  be. We don't need to take up every crisis to the very brink. Since you  control every lever of power in this government, you have failed the  most basic responsibility: to run this government in a sensible and  intelligent way. Everybody--all of us--know, whether we want to admit  it or not, that this is no way to run a government and certainly not a  government as important as the one we were sent here to represent.   I also urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question so the House can  take up the Dream Act because time is so quickly running out on those  young people. It would be a blot on our conscience for the rest of our  lives if we did nothing to help.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule  XX, this 15-minute vote on ordering the previous question will be  followed by 5-minute votes on:   Adoption of the resolution, if ordered; and   Suspending the rules and passing S. 96, if ordered.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 224,  nays 186, not voting 20, as follows:                               [Roll No. 67]                                 YEAS--224       Abraham      Aderholt      Allen      Amash      Amodei      Arrington      Babin      Bacon      Banks (IN)      Barletta      Barr      Barton      Bergman      Biggs      Bilirakis      Bishop (MI)      Blackburn      Bost      Brady (TX)      Brat      Brooks (AL)      Brooks (IN)      Buchanan      Buck      Bucshon      Budd      Burgess      Byrne      Calvert      Carter (GA)      Carter (TX)      Chabot      Cheney      Coffman      Cole      Collins (GA)      Collins (NY)      Comer      Comstock      Conaway      Cook      Costello (PA)      Cramer      Crawford      Culberson      Curbelo (FL)      Curtis      Davidson      Davis, Rodney      Denham      Dent      DeSantis      DesJarlais      Diaz-Balart      Donovan      Duffy      Duncan (SC)      Duncan (TN)      Dunn      Emmer      Estes (KS)      Farenthold      Faso      Ferguson      Fleischmann      Flores      Fortenberry      Foxx      Frelinghuysen      Gaetz      Gallagher      Garrett      Gianforte      Gibbs      Gohmert      Goodlatte      Gowdy      Granger      Graves (GA)      Graves (LA)      Graves (MO)      Griffith      Grothman      Guthrie      Handel      Harper      Harris      Hartzler      Hensarling      Herrera Beutler      Hice, Jody B.
