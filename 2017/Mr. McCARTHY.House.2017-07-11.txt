 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I am  from California, but I happen to be from Bakersfield, California. I  thank the gentleman for his creative use of the lyrics. Merle would be  proud.   Mr. Speaker, when you take a look back at American history, you can  see figures standing tall who spoke for the everyday working man.  Following the long tradition of Whitman and Twain, Merle Haggard was a  man who knew America instinctively because he lived an American life.  It wasn't a life of the movies, but it was all the more compelling  because it was all the more real. That is the reason they called him  ``The Poet of the Common Man.''   Merle Haggard didn't have it easy. At the height of the Depression,  his family searched for opportunity out West. Merle grew up with little  means and lived with a past of mistakes and regrets.   So he sang. He sang in ``Branded Man'' of the stigma of prison,  crooning ``I held my head up high, determined I would rise above the  shame.''   He sang in ``Working Man Blues'' of the grind of doing his duty to  his family, ``working as long as my two hands are fit to use.''   And he sang of his roots, not of power or wealth or status, but of  pride in being ``an Okie from Muskogee,'' a place of leather boots,  football, and Old Glory.   He found success and, more importantly, redemption in the music he  shared with his country.   Now, the Bakersfield Sound changed country music, and it is a  testament to Merle Haggard's talent that when you listen to his hits,  from ``Branded Man'' to ``Mama Tried,'' to ``Big City,'' to ``Working  Man Blues,'' or even to ``Okie from Muskogee,'' you not only hear the  hardship and wisdom of a well-lived life, but you can hear the roots of  so much of the music we still listen to today.   From a man who went from Bakersfield High School to San Quentin  prison, to the Country Music Hall of Fame, a building doesn't seem like  much. But I hope that when people pass by the Merle Haggard Post Office  Building in  [[Page H5403]]  downtown Bakersfield, they will remember an icon of our community, an  artist who never backed down, a man whose honesty above his own  failings and willingness to pick himself back up inspired music that  lifts our spirits and feeds our souls.   Merle Haggard's name will live on in this building, but his spirit  will live on in his music that calls us to do the best we can every day  God gives us.
