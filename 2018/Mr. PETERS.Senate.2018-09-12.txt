 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 80th  anniversary of Detroit Diesel Corporation, a subsidiary of Daimler  Trucks North America in Detroit, MI. I appreciate the opportunity to  speak about this truly significant milestone in the history of the  Detroit brand, as well as speak to the importance of this anniversary  to the greater legacy of Detroit as the ``Motor City.''   Established by General Motors in 1938, as the General Motors Diesel  Division, Detroit Diesel produced the company's flagship engine, the  two-cycle Series 71 engine or ``two stroke.'' The two-stroke engine was  introduced as a  [[Page S6138]]  cylinder inline engine and in a V-configuration in 1957.   Detroit Diesel played an important role during World War II as an  essential contributor in the U.S. ``Arsenal of Democracy,''  manufacturing engines for the Allied forces. These engines were used  for construction equipment, power generation, agriculture, and military  operations.   In 1955, Detroit Diesel evolved to meet the demands of the commercial  trucking market. Introduced in 1957, the Series 53 engine was GM  Diesel's first heavy-duty engine. The powerful Series 53 engine was  made for multiple applications in various industries. It has powered  the American timber industry, propelling logging skidders through deep,  dense woods. The Series 53 became an indispensable tool on construction  sites all over the United States and around the globe. With greater  sophistication and power, building from the simple two-stroke Series 71  of 1938, the Series 53's heavy-duty capabilities provided operators  with the muscle needed to break ground in many infrastructure projects  through the United States. The Series 53 engine's versatility has been  trusted for years in the aviation industry to haul packages and tow  planes, and has been relied on to safely transport our troops on  unforgiving terrain.   In 1965, General Motors Detroit Diesel consolidated into the Detroit  Diesel Engine Division and introduced the Series 149 engine, which  would be used to power tugboats and mine haul trucks. Over the next 20  years, the Detroit Diesel Engine Division combined with General Motors'  Allison Division, becoming the Detroit Diesel Allison Division. From  the mid to late 1960s to the late 1980s, the Detroit Diesel Allison  Division would continue to innovate and strengthen its position as a  leader in the field. During this time, the division created and  introduced the Series 92, which would increase its capabilities in  marine transportation. In the 1980s, Detroit Diesel Allison would hit  yet another milestone: producing its first four-cylinder engine.   In 1987, Detroit Diesel introduced the heavy-duty, four-cylinder  Detroit Diesel Series 60 engine. The Detroit Diesel Series 60 engine is  known for its fuel efficiency as a heavy-duty engine. As the company's  namesake, it would become one of its most well-known engines.   In 1987, General Motors partnered with another Michigan brand, Penske  Corporation, and created the Detroit Diesel Corporation. As Detroit  Diesel Corporation, the company experienced exponential growth in the  on-highway market from the late 1980s to the late 1990s, up until  Detroit Diesel Corporation was acquired by Daimler Chrysler in 2000,  where they became a subsidiary of Daimler Trucks North America LLC.   In addition to cementing Michigan as an industry leader throughout  the Nation and world, Detroit Diesel Corporation, now known as the  Detroit brand, powers economic and community development through its  network of more than 800 locations throughout North America. In 2005,  Detroit Diesel Corporation invested millions of dollars in expanding  engine production in Michigan through its Renaissance project. The  Detroit brand launched another major investment in Detroit in 2012;  both initiatives have created thousands of jobs for hard-working  families in Michigan.   As much as Detroit Diesel Corporation is the Detroit brand, at its  very core, it is America's brand. I applaud its commitment to creating  quality cutting-edge technology, ensuring that Michigan, as well as the  United States, continues to be at the driver's seat of innovation as  the automotive capital of the world. I ask my colleagues to join me in  congratulating Detroit Diesel Corporation on its longevity and the  immense impact it has made on communities here at home in Michigan and  across the country. I wish Detroit Diesel Corporation many more decades  of success.                            ____________________
