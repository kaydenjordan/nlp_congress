 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to remember the  life of a remarkable public servant, leader, and educator, Dr. Terrance  Newton.   Today, family, friends, and his beloved Warner School community are  saying good-bye to a person who they called Newt.   Dr. Newton was a fixture in the Delaware education system for  decades, himself a product of Wilmington's East Side, a Kappa Alpha Psi  man, and a Delaware State University man.   Newt would become known to his students as their most fervent  advocate and ally. Every morning, he would stand on the front steps of  Warner Elementary and greet students as they passed through the front  doors, hugging them, high-fiving them, and inspiring every child.   Dr. Newton was always looking for unique and impactful ways to  connect with his students, going so far as to open a barbershop where  he could cut the students' hair in school, giving them a safe space to  talk about their academics, their communities, and their lives.   It is no exaggeration to say that Dr. Terrance Newton was a powerful  pillar of the community, a real-life superhero who spent every day  devoted to the next generation of Delawareans.   We have lost Dr. Terrance Newton far too soon, but because of all the  energy, inspiration, and love that he poured into his students, family,  and community, his legacy will live on for a lifetime.   To his family, colleagues, students, friends, I send sincere  condolences.   Madam Speaker, I close with some words from Dr. Newton himself. He  said of his students: ``When I see them, I see me. So, my goal is to  change the world.''   Indeed, Dr. Newton, you did.                            ____________________
