 Mr. President, the crisis at the United States       southern border is raging out of control. Unlike Joe Biden, I have       traveled down to the southern border to hear from local leaders, law       enforcement, and our brave Border Patrol agents. I had the opportunity       to talk with Border Patrol in Arizona and Texas and listened as they       told me about how hard their job has become thanks to Joe Biden's       radical open border policies.        Let me just say, these men and women are absolute heroes. In places       like Yuma, Border Patrol agents are encountering illegal migrants every       day, some of whom are dangerous criminals, traffickers, drug cartel       members, and even terrorists. Others are just families victimized by       the cartels.        I encountered a family from Haiti during my last visit. I watched       them cross the border through a massive hole in the border wall caused       by Joe Biden's decision not to complete the already paid-for wall.       These families are victims of the cartels. Once in America, many of       them live a life of indentured servitude and debilitating debt in which       they have to send nearly all of their money back to these savage       cartels. These people and their families are owned by the cartels, and       Joe Biden is letting it happen. Many of the children are trafficked,       made to pose as the children of people they don't even know. And we       know that so many women and children who make this journey are brutally       victimized and raped.        But still the cartels push these families over the border. It is all       just money to them. Joe Biden is making the cartels richer.        That is what our brave Border Patrol agents are up against. What       makes you mad is that while all of this is happening, massive piles of       supplies to complete the border, already paid for by the American       taxpayers, are just sitting in piles in the desert going to waste. The       Biden administration refuses to use these materials because they want       an open border.        Secretary Mayorkas testified in the Homeland Security Committee that       the border is closed. Really? Look at El Paso. I told Secretary       Mayorkas that he might be the only person in America who actually       believes the border is secure. He is it.        The truth is, as many of my colleagues and I know and have seen with       their own eyes, the border is wide open. Since Joe Biden took office,       more than 5 million people have illegally crossed our southern border.        I am afraid it is going to get a lot worse with President Biden       allowing title 42 to end. Thank God the Supreme Court has kept title 42       in place, at least for now. We are hearing reports that up to 18,000       people a day will be illegally storming across our border every day       once title 42 is lifted--and Joe Biden still doesn't have a plan.        Don't forget the Biden administration once said--the Obama-Biden       administration once said that just 1,000 attempted crossings a day       would be a crisis. So what does President Biden call 18,000 a day? It       is his call to make. He created this disaster.        So that is why I am here with my good friend from Iowa, Senator Joni       Ernst. We think it is time to end the madness on the southern border,       and if Joe Biden doesn't do his job, we should let the States take care       of it themselves.        I was a Governor, so I know I might be a little biased, but I think       Governors know what works best for their individual States way better       than the Federal Government does here in Washington, DC.        Remember I mentioned the massive piles of wall material that the       Biden administration refuses to use? Our bill, the BUILD It Act, would       force the Federal Government to transfer any material associated with       the construction of the southern border barrier to any State upon       request so these States can do what Joe Biden refuses to do: finish the       wall.        As Senator Ernst has noted, since President Biden's order in January       2021 to cease construction of the southern border barrier went into       effect, the Federal Government began paying contractors over $3 million       a day to look over unused border material. It is estimated that roughly       one-quarter of a billion dollars in taxpayer-funded materials are       sitting--just sitting--on our southern border. So instead of doing his       job upholding our laws and securing the border, President Biden is       burning $3 million of your tax dollars each and every day so people can       babysit wall materials that he refuses to use.        By passing this good bill today, we are giving States the ability to       provide what Biden has failed to deliver: border security and a       fighting chance to get this massive humanitarian and national security       crisis under control.        In Florida, we are proud to be an immigration State. We love       immigration, but it has to be legal. Illegal immigration threatens our       safety, undermines our legal process, and hurts those who have been       waiting to come through legal channels. But under President Biden's       system of open borders and illegal immigration, we are seeing dangerous       individuals trying to come into this country, and drugs are pouring       across the border.        More than 100,000 Americans have died from fentanyl and opioid       overdoses in the last year, and more are dying every day. Doesn't Joe       Biden care about this?        Our Democratic colleagues do not have the luxury of ignoring this       crisis any longer. American families cannot take this loss and       heartbreak due to the incompetence of Washington any longer. We must       act to secure the border now.        Floridians and all Americans want to live in safe communities where       their families can thrive and prosper all across this great country.       Unfortunately, Joe Biden's policies have opened the borders and amnesty       has been a total disaster for our Nation. He has laid out the welcome       mat for traffickers and cartel members, and has ignored U.S. laws       designed to keep American families safe.        We can't stand for it any longer because the American people deserve       better. I hope our colleagues will stand with Senator Ernst and me       today to pass this bill. Then we can work with the House to start truly       addressing this crisis before it is too late.
