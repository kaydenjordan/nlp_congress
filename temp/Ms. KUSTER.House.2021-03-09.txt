 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of the  American Rescue Plan Act, ambitious and urgently needed legislation to  end the COVID-19 epidemic and to facilitate our economic recovery.   The Federal Government has a responsibility to provide support to  millions of families struggling because of lost work or grieving  because they lost a loved one.   And this American Rescue Plan fulfills this responsibility, providing  $1,400 relief checks to Americans that are hurting financially.   For the Americans who have lost their job during the pandemic, the  bill extends critical unemployment benefits so they can get back on  their feet.   For children and families who are approaching 1 year of remote  schooling, this bill provides $125 billion to safely reopen our schools  and protect teachers and students.   For small businesses that have been hit hard, this legislation could  increase funding for the Paycheck Protection Program and other support  loans and grants.   For over 25 million Americans who are struggling to put food on the  table, this bill increases SNAP benefits so families do not go hungry.   For nearly 10 million Americans who are behind on rent and utilities,  this bill provides funds to keep a roof over their head and the lights  on.   And I am very pleased that this bill includes funding modeled after  my legislation to ramp up and fund the manufacturing and distribution  of the COVID-19 vaccine.                            ____________________
