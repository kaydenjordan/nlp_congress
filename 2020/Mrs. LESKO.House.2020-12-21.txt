 Madam Speaker, I am glad that we finally have a  bipartisan deal for COVID relief, but the process has been absolutely  terrible.   I have to tell you that we have, what, 6,000 pages? And what did we  get?   We got it, like, maybe 2 hours ago, the text of it. We were waiting  all night.   In fact, Speaker Pelosi had called Members back last week. We thought  we were going to be doing this last Wednesday. Instead, we were doing  all these suspension bills. People had to fly from all over the  country--all the Congress Members--in crowded airports, crowded planes;  not really good for mitigating COVID, if you ask me.   Madam Speaker, I will say, though, that I am glad that, finally,  after months and months of Republicans asking for a bipartisan COVID  relief bill that could actually get signed into law, we are actually  here today, even if it is a couple days before Christmas. And it is a  bill that will help small businesses and their workers, will help the  airline industry, will be a solution to Americans who are struggling  with surprise medical bills.                                time  1630    For those who are unemployed because of the coronavirus, because the  governments have shut down the businesses, it will give unemployment  insurance relief. But there will be protections in there to make sure  that the people are really unemployed and that they will accept a  reasonable offer for a job.   Also good in the bill is that there is not only money for vaccine  procurement but for distribution of the vaccines.   On that note, I want to applaud President Trump for his action in  Operation Warp Speed and for working with the private sector to get  vaccines done and out the door in record time. This has never been done  before in history. Normally, it takes years and years for vaccines to  be done.   Thank you, President Trump, for your hard work for the American  people.
