 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Madam President, some economists have another name for  the recession that we are living through, the one that was caused by  the COVID pandemic. They call it a ``she-cession'' because the economic  hardships and job losses have fallen disproportionately on women,  especially on working mothers. It is ironic that we are having this  conversation the day after Mother's Day and reflecting on the current  state of American families in the midst of a pandemic but, equally  important, on the state of American families and the state of the  mothers of those families and the economic realities that they face.   There are 2.5 million American women who have dropped out or were  pushed out of the workforce since the start of this pandemic. In a  recent ABC News poll, 25 percent of women said they are worse off  economically now than they were a year ago compared to 18 percent of  men. A survey last fall found that almost 40 percent of working mothers  in my State of Illinois--40 percent--lost their jobs or are working  reduced hours. Nearly half of all working mothers of color reported the  same.   There are many reasons that this recession has been so economically  devastating for so many women, but the two biggest reasons are these:  Women are overrepresented in the industries that have been hit the  hardest by the pandemic: restaurants, retail, leisure and hospitality.  Women are also the primary caregivers--in some cases, the only  caregivers--in the vast majority of American families. With schools and  childcare programs closed, what choice does a working mother have  besides stepping back from work?   For millions of American mothers and their families, the stimulus  payments, the enhanced unemployment checks, the increased child tax  credits, and other economic benefits in the American Rescue Plan have  literally been a lifeline. They have enabled these mothers and families  to feed their kids and to keep their homes during the worst recession  since the Great Depression.   So it has come as a bit of a surprise that our Republican colleagues  would choose to start Mother's Day weekend by vowing to end enhanced  unemployment benefits for more than 8 million American workers. They  cite the April jobs report as their justification. After we added  770,000 jobs in March--a strong showing--we learned last week the U.S.  economy added only 266,000 jobs in April. Immediately, our Republican  colleagues cited the disappointing jobs numbers as proof that the  recovery has clearly stalled and that we have to do more to get people  back to work, as if it justifies ending enhanced jobless benefits.   They seem to think that additional unemployment benefits make  American workers lazy. They imply that Americans would rather sit at  home, watch nonstop Netflix, and eat chocolate-covered cherries rather  than go back to work. They must not know many American workers.  Americans want to work. Americans work longer and harder than their  counterparts in almost every nation in the world. We should be proud of  that work ethic and what it has meant to America.   The reason many workers haven't returned to the workplace isn't  because they are lazy. People remain afraid of this coronavirus. They  lack adequate, affordable childcare. They may be caring for older  family members or be dealing with personal health conditions. That is  the reality of life in families and, particularly, in struggling,  working families. Taking away the enhanced unemployment benefits they  need to be able to feed their kids and  [[Page S2401]]  pay their rents or mortgages does nothing to change that reality except  to make it worse.   Our Republican colleagues will say that the April jobs report is the  reason for their renewed determination to stop sending these enhanced  checks to the jobless families. The truth is--the real truth is--these  Republicans think the Federal Government ought to do the bare minimum  to help working families weather this pandemic. That is their credo:  Government isn't the solution; government is the problem even during a  once-in-a-century health crisis. Whether the economy is adding jobs  quickly or slowly, whether the COVID infection and death rates are  rising or falling, the Republicans have fought to scale back Federal  unemployment benefits for workers.   Not one of our Republican colleagues--let me repeat that--not one of  our Republican Senate colleagues voted for the American Rescue Plan.  Remember that one? That was the plan by President Biden that put more  money into the purchase of vaccines; that finally set up a nationwide  effort to administer those vaccines; that sent the $1,400 cash check to  working families--a check that had been promised by the previous  administration--that gave an additional helping hand to small  businesses to get through the pandemic; and that did, in fact, increase  or, I should say, lengthen the period of time that people would be  eligible for unemployment benefits.   That is a pretty good, important package; don't you think? When you  look at what it did for America, it came just in the nick of time for  many. You would have thought, wouldn't you, with 50 Republican  Senators, that one--one--Republican Senator would have supported those  things. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case.    There are things we can do to get this economy moving again. We need  to encourage more Americans to get vaccinated, No. 1. President Biden  has done a remarkable job, but we still have work to do. We shouldn't  sit back and relax. Every person vaccinated is another person  protected. Also, the people around them are protected. The fundamental  fact remains, as we talk about all of the economics and all of the  government philosophy, our economy cannot recover completely until this  virus is under control.   In addition, if the Republicans want to solve the problems facing our  workforce, there are pretty obvious answers: Sit down, and talk to a  working mother who lost a job, who has a child at home, perhaps a young  child, and ask her: Well, how soon can you get back to work?   Her question back to you: Senator, how soon can you take care of my  little boy? How much is it going to cost me?   That is the reality. The daycare center is probably closed, and the  babysitter may not be available. There are lots of reasons. It just may  be too expensive. That is the reality of work for American workers  today. That mother isn't lazy. That mother faces a challenge that not  one of us wants to see in our families. Either our children or  grandchildren, we don't want them to be pawns in this whole public  debate about when we are going to start or stop helping families.   We need to face this workforce problem because it is really key to  it, this childcare crisis in this country. Do we care enough about  families and children to make sure there is affordable daycare?  President Biden does. He is talking about a program nationwide, thank  goodness, which will finally address this issue and put a goal in place  to keep the cost of daycare manageable for every family regardless of  its means.   So what did the Republican Senate leader say last week? He said he  was 100-percent focused--100-percent focused--on stopping the Biden  administration. That is an echo of what he said in the first, early  days of the Obama Presidency. He came to the floor, and instead of  talking about what we could do to work together to try to find some  bipartisan ground, he said that he hoped to do everything he could to  make sure that Barack Obama was a one-term President. It didn't take  him long to come back with a similar statement with regard to the Biden  Presidency.   It is not encouraging, but I am encouraged by the fact that there are  some Republicans who just don't agree with it. I hope that they will  step up. I hope that they will show that we can still work on a  bipartisan basis. This ``100-percent'' stopping the Biden  administration from Senator McConnell cannot be the basis for a  successful congressional session.   The Senate Democrats have an agenda; it is true. We are 100-percent  focused on getting this pandemic under control and building a better  future for our families. We would like to work with our Republican  colleagues to do it. Although they didn't join us, for example, on the  child tax credit, I do believe that they really care about the children  in America, particularly the poor children in America, and care enough  to want to help them with daycare, with early kindergarten classes,  with extending the school year beyond the 12th grade for skills that  are needed.   The Presiding Officer knows this well because we come from the same  State. Last week, I had an exciting visit in Normal, IL. Things are not  normal in Normal, IL. They are exceedingly beyond normal. I visited the  Rivian plant. The Rivian plant has an incredible story.   It used to be the Mitsubishi auto plant. Six years ago, it closed.  One thousand workers were on the payroll at the time they lost their  jobs, good-paying jobs. And there sat that empty factory out on the  cornfields just west of Bloomington-Normal.   The mayor of the town, Chris Koos, called me a year after the  Mitsubishi plant had closed and said: ``Senator, I think I've got a  buyer.'' I said: ``Chris, what are you drinking?'' ``No,'' he says, ``I  really believe there's a new company that makes electric vehicles  that's really interested in the Mitsubishi plant.''   Well, he was right, and thank goodness he was. Fast forward 4 years  later, and a visit last week, he showed this amazing facility, which is  now going to be expanded because of the plant that is going to build  electric vehicles. They already have models on the floor that you can  see of SUVs, trucks, and delivery vans for Amazon. Amazon is a major  investor in Rivian.   And we are not just seeing it in Normal. We are seeing evidence that  our State, the State of Illinois, has a chance to become an EV State.   I looked up in the Will County area. The Governor was there last  week, talking about help for a plant that is going to build the heavy  trucks and buses that are needed--electric vehicles for the future.   Go to Libertyville, IL, and there is a Dutch supplier of power  generating equipment that is relocating some of its facilities in our  State.   And at the same time, Argonne Laboratory has been doing research on  battery technology and leading the Nation in doing it for years, and we  believe it is a combination that really pays off.   So how will our State or any State tap into this new economy? With  trained and skilled workers, with families that don't have to worry day  in and day out about daycare.   We have to make sure that we are ready in Illinois and across the  Nation for this opportunity. President Biden does. He understands it  because he understands the challenges to working families.   I can't understand the opposition of the Republicans in Congress to  President Biden. They seem to be determined to make sure that America  always finishes a solid second. The Biden administration disagrees, and  I do too.   We have the capacity to continue to lead the world and to continue to  lead the world's economy, but it isn't by sitting back and patting  ourselves on the back and talking about who won the last election. We  have to roll up our sleeves on a bipartisan basis and get this  workforce ready and stand behind our families that send these workers  into the plants that are going to create the products that are going to  make a success story out of the 21st century. That is what President  Biden is for, and I couldn't agree with him more.   I want to sit down and talk with any Republican who is willing to be  honest and serious about doing this together, and we also ought to take  on the other issues that we know plague our economy and our families-- reducing the cost of prescription drugs, building an infrastructure for  the 21st century.  [[Page S2402]]    The truth is that last week's job report is a ringing endorsement for  the American Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan of President  Biden.   Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, more than 220 million shots have  been administered, and more than 100 million Americans have been fully  vaccinated, allowing businesses all across America to start to reopen.  We need to build on the success of the American Rescue Plan, not  dismantle it piece by piece. We need to work together to invest in  workers and families for the 21st century, not grind Congress to a  halt, as some might prefer.   The American Jobs Plan will enable American workers and businesses to  build on those successes. It will help reduce barriers for entry to  many workers. It will direct billions of dollars toward helping  dislocated workers develop new skills and secure a stable, well-paying  job, building wind turbines or electric vehicles or making other  American-made goods that will be in high demand in the years to come.   Another priority for Democrats is throwing a lifeline to working  parents. Fortunately, we have made some progress on that front with the  child tax credit expansion and other provisions in the American Rescue  Plan. Those policies put more money in the pockets of middle-class and  low-income working families in the midst of the worst economic  recession we have seen in decades.   When President Trump left office, 30 million Americans couldn't  afford to put food on the table. Think about that. Just 1 month after  the American Rescue Plan, that number was reduced to 17 million, and we  should never accept that or any number as acceptable in the future. We  have cut the number of Americans going hungry by nearly half since  President Biden took office, but we still have work to do.   We need to provide more relief to parents so they can work a full- time job, if they choose, without having to worry about finding a safe,  reliable place for the kids. We have to ensure that low- and middle- income families pay no more than 7 percent, that is what President  Biden is asking, no more than 7 percent income on high-quality  childcare. And that is on top of billions of dollars in funding the  American Jobs Plan would invest in building and retrofitting childcare  facilities across our State and Nation.   Last week's job report is a wake-up call. We can't just wish this  crisis away. We have to act and act together. We can't reopen our  economy fully until the virus is under control, and then we can't wait  for 10 years to get back on track to where we were a year and a half  ago.   We can't build a prosperous economy for the future unless we address  some of the systemic shortcomings that prevent too many workers from  participating fully. Even if next month's job report exceeds  expectations, such as the one in March, we need to rebuild our economy  and put working families at the center of it, and make bold investments  in the future right now.   We can keep good jobs in America and build industries that have a  future if we are ready to invest in American families.   I hope our Republican colleagues will not say: Let's go slow; let's  be satisfied with second. You know, maybe we just can't compete with  some other countries in the world.   I don't buy it. If we believe in America and its workers, we need to  invest in them and their future. It is time to think bigger. It is time  to believe that this country has a future which is going to be bright  if we come together and do our job to stand by working families and the  men and women--and, in this moment, particularly the women--who need  that helping hand.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr.  Heinrich) and the Senator from Washington (Mrs. Murray) are necessarily  absent.    Mr. President, last month, we lost a generous and  beautiful soul with the passing of Claire Serdiuk Anderson. Claire  devoted her life to public service. During her 46 years on this Earth,  she changed it for the better. As an Illinois native, she advocated for  candidates and causes that pushed our State and country to be more like  her: kind, gentle, and accepting.   Claire was driven, in part, by her Catholic faith. She believed in  her sacred responsibility to help others, and she encouraged her  friends and family to do the same, with a warm smile and a loving  heart.   Anyone would have been lucky to sit in the same room as Claire. She  would captivate any audience with her gifts as a storyteller and her  instincts as a comedian. In addition to graduating summa cum laude from  Loyola University, Claire also studied at another venerated Chicago  institution: The Second City Comedy Club. She used to say that her  background in comedy and improvisation prepared her well for a career  in politics. And I can think of more than a few politicians who would  be lucky to have half of her charm and charisma.   Claire played key roles in the careers of President Obama and other  national leaders. She was the financial director for his first campaign  for U.S. Senate. Claire also raised funds for my friend and colleague  Senator Duckworth when she first ran for Congress. In both instances,  Claire was there from the beginning, investing her time, talent, and  passion into two candidates who would go on to make history and inspire  a new generation of American leaders.   I came to know Claire during the early 2000s, when she worked in my  Chicago office as my State scheduler. As part of my team, she was  beloved for her tenacity and her good cheer. In her eternal wisdom, she  left my office in 2004 to help a skinny community organizer in the  South Side run for Senate but she remained, always, a treasured member  of the extended Team Durbin.   In her final act of charity, Claire donated her organs and tissues. I  would like to think that, right now, someone may be seeing the world  through Claire's wise eyes, perceiving all the possibilities for our  future, rather than settling for the ways things are today.   I hope all of us can learn from Claire's example. Loretta and I join  her husband Kurt, her son Henry, her parents Yvonne and Matthew, her  brother Andrew, and everyone in her extended family, and so many  friends, in mourning Claire's loss.   Thank you for your loving service, Claire. We will miss you.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
