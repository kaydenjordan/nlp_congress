 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I met with restaurant owners from all  over my State last month--from Seattle to Yakima, to Spokane--and we  talked about the American Rescue Plan and how important that was and  how that bill made recovery possible for so many restaurants in our  State--but not for everyone, and that is why I am on the Senate floor  today.   The American Rescue Plan was absolutely a lifeline. It designated  more than $28 billion to establish a Restaurant Revitalization Fund  that gave restaurant owners the financial support they needed to keep  their doors open, to rehire workers, and to deal with the continued  effects of COVID-19.   More than 3,500 Washington State businesses have received over $9  billion in Federal loans and grants and debt relief since the start of  the pandemic. That is not even considering the flexible dollars that we  provided local governments to help local small businesses. Now, that  really made a difference and helped a lot of folks keep their doors  open and their employees on the payroll, but for many restaurant  owners, the funds were gone before they were able to get the same  relief their neighbors got.   I don't think it is right that a business on one side of the street  in Seattle got Federal dollars from the Restaurant Revitalization Fund  but another mom-and-pop shop just next-door and just as qualified--that  also got approved--didn't get the money because the funds ran dry.   Now, I know this is true for communities in red States and in blue  States--that our restaurants are often the heart of a community. They  serve their local favorites that remind us of home. They sponsor our  sports teams and community causes. They allow us to get together and  share a meal and celebrate with family and friends and make memories.  Making these businesses whole is critical for our economy, but it is  essential to preserving what makes Seattle ``Seattle'' or Spokane  ``Spokane.''   I know many of my Republican colleagues feel the same way. So I want  us to look at every possible option to replenish the Restaurant  Revitalization Fund and get help to every restaurant that applied and  got approved but didn't get the same help as everyone else.   We have got good bipartisan bills to get this done. Our legislation  would help hard-to-reach businesses and communities apply for the  assistance because I really want to make sure we are helping actual  small businesses, not giant corporations that don't need it.   Any Senator who has spoken to local restaurant owners knows they are  dealing, still, with really tough challenges right now: increased costs  from inflation and shortages of everything from straws to chicken  wings, and it is not easy to find wait staff and cooks and a lot more.  That is why it is so urgent that we get a bipartisan small business  relief package--that makes our restaurants whole--over the finish line  as soon as possible. So let's do whatever we need to do to get this  done and keep our restaurants open.    Mr. President, right now, we are in the midst of a  strong economic recovery and record job growth.   But despite the progress we have made, the fact remains that during  this pandemic, corporations and rich CEOs made huge profits, while  workers still struggle to make ends meet and put food on the table.   If we want to build back an economy that works for everyone, not just  those at the very top, then we need be taking action to lower costs,  like Democrats have been pushing for, and we need leaders at the  Department of Labor who are committed to ensuring workers get every  cent of the paychecks they earn and holding corporations accountable  when they try to take advantage of workers and commit wage theft.   Dr. David Weil has a long history as a champion for workers, and I  come to the floor today to make clear: He is the exact right person to  lead the Wage and Hour Division of the DOL.   Dr. Weil is an exceptional choice for this role with just the right  experience for the job; in fact, he has already served in this position  under the Obama administration. During his past tenure, he proved  himself a capable leader, with a steadfast commitment to a simple goal:  ensuring workers across the country are paid the wages they earn.   It was under his leadership that the Wage and Hour Division boosted  its efforts to enforce the critical set of laws that protect workers  against employers undercutting the minimum wage, failing to pay  overtime, forcing workers to work ``off the clock,'' and so much more.   These are protections that workers depend on, especially workers who  earn low wages, women, and people of color who most often face wage  theft.   So we have got to make sure corporations are following them--and that  is exactly what David Weil did. He cracked down on corporations who  violated the law and denied workers the pay they were owed, and at one  point, the division even uncovered an investigation into garment  factories that secured $1.3 million in back pay for cheated workers.   While leading the Agency, he also worked to expand overtime pay for  12 million more workers, close loopholes to help stop employers from  misclassifying workers in order to pay them less, and crack down on  Federal contractors who weren't following the law and paying fair  wages. It has been frustrating to see the previous administration  undermine these efforts and reverse this progress, but confirming David  Weil to return to the Wage and Hour Division is an important step to  put workers first and get us back on the right track. A vote for Dr.  Weil is a vote to put wages back in workers' pockets and a vote to hold  corporations accountable for wage theft.   So I urge all my colleagues to join me today in sending Dr. Weil back  to the DOL.                            ____________________
