 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3076, the  Postal Service Reform Act.   The United States Postal Service has been part of our society since  Benjamin Franklin was appointed the first Postmaster General in 1775.  However, with the ever-advancing digital economy, the Postal Service's  financial difficulties are well known in modern times.   This bill takes the necessary steps toward addressing the financial  and operational issues facing the Postal Service and properly updates  them for the 21st century. A first-class postal system is critical for  businesses and our economy; it keeps 330 million Americans connected.   This bill also seeks to repair the Postal Service's unsustainable  health and retirement benefits by coordinating an enrollment into  Medicare. Under current law, the Postal Service is required to annually  prepay future retirement health benefits, an obligation Congress does  not require of most other public or private entities. The Postal  Service is bound by statute into this unmanageable system while still  being required to work like a private business.    Congress tied their hands. We created this problem, and now it has  been returned to sender. The package will not stamp out all the Postal  Service's problems overnight, but it is grounded in established  practices and will help deliver first-class-level results worthy of the  legacy of Ben Franklin.
