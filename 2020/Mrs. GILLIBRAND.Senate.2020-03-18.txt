 Madam President, across New York State and around  the country, schools are closing and businesses are shutting their  doors as we face this unprecedented crisis. This public health  emergency has exposed the weakness in our economy and in our system. We  are not doing nearly enough for workers, for their families, and those  who need to deal with medical and financial emergencies that this virus  has caused.   Congress has a duty to look out for families who are staring down  uncertainty, fear, and financial ruin. Our top priority must be  strengthening our public health system and ensuring that hard-working  Americans, who are facing this crisis due to no fault of their own, can  keep their jobs while taking care of themselves and their loved ones.   We must also ensure that businesses, many of which have been forced  to close their doors in the name of the public good, do not have to  cover these unexpected costs alone. The PAID Leave Act ensures that  every worker in America has full paid sick and family leave. It  strengthens their financial footing. It gives certainty and confidence  to businesses. Congress has a responsibility to pass this legislation.  It is not only a health imperative but a financial one too.   Unfortunately, our colleague, Senator Johnson--his amendment is  cynical and counterproductive. This amendment would eliminate paid sick  and family leave provisions in favor of providing coronavirus-infected  people with unemployment compensation. So what he is saying is you have  to actually lose your job if you need to stay home to care for a loved  one or because you are sick yourself, and that is just wrongheaded  because, the truth is, we want people to keep their jobs. We want  people to have their jobs be there when they get better or when their  family member gets better. We want them to have their jobs after they  recover themselves. This is why paid leave and sick leave is such a  better solution than just straight-up unemployment insurance.   Workers deserve protections so they don't lose their job just because  their kids' school closed, and they need to be home to look after them.  Wouldn't any employee in America today prefer to keep their job and  have paid sick leave rather than having to quit and take unemployment  insurance? Wouldn't every Member of this body and President Trump  himself want to keep unemployment numbers from exploding any further  than they are already?   While the unemployment system will continue to play a very important  role for those who have lost their jobs, it cannot be the only answer.  I thank Senator Murray for her leadership and her steadfast advocacy  for family and medical leave and paid sick days. This amendment is  crafted to provide extraordinary economic stimulus and support to our  businesses when they need it absolutely the most, and most of all, it  is giving certainty because people are afraid. They don't want to have  to spread coronavirus to every person they work with. They don't want  to have to leave their children unattended at home. They would love to  stay at work, but under the circumstances, they cannot.   Allow them to keep their jobs. Allow them to draw down on paid leave  while their child is at home for a week, a month, or 3 months. If they  themselves are sick, God forbid, make sure they are not in the  community spreading this virus, make sure they can be home getting  better and reemerging to do their work when they are well.   Democrats stand ready to work with Senate Republicans to pass this  important bill. We need to meet the needs of the American people today.  This is our duty in this grave time of need.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I strongly disagree with both of my  colleagues' statements because, in fact, there is no administrative  burden given to the small businesses.   In fact, our bill is doing exactly what the small businesses want,  which is to provide direct payments to the businesses--not a tax credit  that they get many months in the future but direct payments to them.   I don't think unemployment insurance given to the States is going to  result in immediate relief for the employees who need it. Again, you  are creating a false structure. Requiring people to quit their jobs so  they can care for a child who has been sent from school is absurd. It  is far better to have a national paid leave program in this country.  And unlike what my colleague said, it is not permanent; it is  temporary, and there is no administrative burden.   I yield the floor.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1559
