 Madam Speaker, I would ask to draw the House's  attention to a terrible disaster that occurred in Alabama and Georgia  on Sunday, March 3.   At 4 o'clock in the afternoon, we had an F-4 tornado with winds  exceeding 170 miles per hour touch down in Alabama and stay on the  ground a mile wide. For the next 70 miles, it plowed through Alabama  and into Georgia.   This tornado took the lives of 23 innocent Alabamians and injured 90  people. It destroyed, just in Alabama alone, more than 120 homes, and  then went into Georgia and did enormous property damage.   It is my hope that we, first of all, take note of the fact that the  first responders in both of our States did an exemplary job in the  search and rescue during the first 2 days following the storm trying to  find all those who had been lost and, since then, in the recovery mode.   The money and attention that this country and this Congress have  invested in our first responders having the training and equipment they  need to deal with these disasters, whether they are man-made or  natural, was demonstrated again in this horrible disaster.   At this time, Madam Speaker, I would like to ask a moment of silence  for us to ask God's grace and blessings on these families as they try  to recover from this horrible disaster.                            ____________________
