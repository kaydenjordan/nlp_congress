 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Education and the Workforce be discharged from further  consideration of the bill (H.R. 6964) to reauthorize and improve the  Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, and for other  purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.
