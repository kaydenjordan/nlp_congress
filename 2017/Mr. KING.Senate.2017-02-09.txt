 Mr. President, I am a former Governor, and as such, I have  an inclination to support the Executive's nominees for their Cabinet-- for their Secretaries or Commissioners in my case, in Maine. I think  that is an  [[Page S1053]]  important principle, and it is how I start when I approach the analysis  of any nominee to any position put forward by the Executive, whether  the Executive is Donald Trump or Barack Obama or anybody else. That is  a kind of starting point, and that is how I started this January. And,  indeed, thus far, as we have voted here on the floor, I have supported  five of the seven nominees who have come before us, plus I supported  two additional nominees in committee which have not yet come to the  floor, but whom I will support on the floor.    So I am not in total opposition: Don't vote for any nominees. I don't  think that is the way our system works, and it is certainly not the way  I intend to approach these issues. I have approached them one at a  time, looking at the position of the nominees, their policies, their  views, their hearings. I have tried to follow the hearings as closely  as possible, including their answers to questions. Again, I start with  a bias toward approval, perhaps because of my experience as a chief  executive myself.   But I can't support nominees who are fundamentally opposed to the  mission of the agency they have been asked to lead. To me, that just  doesn't make sense. That is why I voted against Betsy DeVos 2 days ago  because I didn't believe that she had the best interests of American  education--particularly public education--at heart. Her whole career  has been about attacking and undermining public education by trying to,  in effect, voucherize it, provide vouchers to people to use in other  schools which, by the way, in a rural State like Maine, simply wouldn't  work as a practical matter. So I could not support her because I felt  she was hostile to the very premise of the agency that she was being  asked to lead.   Today, I come to the floor to talk about Dr. Price. I think he falls  into the same category. I understand policy differences, and I  understand the election took place, and I understand elections have  results and that there are going to be different policies, but his  policies on the fundamental mission of the Department of Health and  Human Services are just inimical to what that Department was  established to do for the American people. The title is Health and  Human Services, and that is the role that Department has played and  should play and will play in the future of America.   Now, my problems with Dr. Price and his positions--and there is no  doubt about his positions on various issues. He has a long record in  the House of Representatives writing and legislating and advocating, so  there is not much argument about where he stands, and there are really  three areas that I want to touch on tonight. One is Medicare, one is  Medicaid, and one is the Affordable Care Act. I want to try to put  these all in the context of my home State of Maine.   Health care in Maine is an enormous part of our economy. It is  somewhat higher, actually, as a percentage of our GDP than it is  nationally. We are at about 20 percent of GDP. One-fifth of our economy  is health care. In part, that is because we have a great number of  seniors who, of course, require more health care expenditures, but it  is a very important part of our economy, which I will touch on a little  bit later. But let's talk about Medicare.   First, Medicare in Maine: 306,000 people in Maine are Medicare  beneficiaries. The expenditure in Maine by Medicare is $2 billion. Now,  when we are talking about cutting or changing Medicare, of course we  focus, as we should, on those 306,000 people--and I will talk about  them--but we also need to talk about that $2 billion. If we are talking  about savings--savings don't just evaporate, they occur in real life,  and those are funds that don't go to support medical care for seniors  in Maine and don't go to our hospitals and don't go to our  practitioners. So $2 billion is a very significant part of our GDP, and  that is just what Medicare spends in Maine, 306,000 people.   Now, I want to touch on an aspect of this that I don't think has been  discussed much in these debates; that is, the burden of anxiety about  health care and the cost of health care that was lifted from  generations of seniors in this country by the passage of Medicare, now  some 50-plus years ago. As you get older, there is anxiety about  retirement, there is anxiety about income, there is anxiety about your  health, but there is also anxiety about the cost of health care. The  miracle of that Medicare was that it lifted that burden of anxiety from  our seniors. It was one thing they didn't have to worry about. ``I have  Medicare'' have been the words that have comforted thousands and  millions of people in this country since 1965.   To change the fundamental premise of Medicare, which is what Dr.  Price has advocated for vigorously and continuously, from the current  system, which is, if you get sick, if you have hospitalization, if you  need medical care and you qualify for Medicare, it is paid for. To  change that to a system which is essentially a voucher, which is capped  at some level of inflation but not the health care level of inflation,  is a cruel trick on our seniors. What it will do is, through  compounding of interest, if inflation is 2 percent a year, and medical  inflation--the cost of medical treatment--increases at 4 or 5 or 6  percent a year, which is typical of what has happened in the last 15 or  20 years; there have been ups and downs, but 4, 5, 6 percent is about  where medical inflation has been. So if inflation is at 2 percent, and  that is what your voucher is going to increase to, and medical costs  increase at 6 percent, that gap is going to grow to the point where we  are back where we were in 1964, before the passage of Medicare. Then,  seniors suddenly have to worry about how they are going to pay for  their health care. They are going to have an added burden of anxiety,  and they are going to have an added burden of money, of finance, of  cost.   You can call it all kinds of highfalutin things. You can call it a  voucher program, whether or not it is privatization. There are all  kinds of ways to paper it over, but what it really is, is shift and  shaft. It is shifting the cost from Medicare to seniors, and over time  that shift and shaft is only going to increase. I think that is  unconscionable, and there is no reason for it.   Yes, the cost of Medicare is going up as a percentage of our budget.  That is because we are getting older. That is because we have a  demographic bulge going through our society for people who were born in  the 1940s and 1950s--the baby boom generation--but that is anticipated,  that is understood. There are things we can do to deal with that issue  without the radical solution of essentially shifting the cost over to  the seniors. It makes the Federal books look good, but it is not going  to make the household books in Maine look good.   That is what really bothers me about this policy. We are trying to  improve our miserable budget situation by shifting a great deal of  these costs off to individuals. That is just wrong. Medicare is too  important financially, emotionally, psychologically. It is too  important as an essential part of the promise that we have made to each  generation of Americans for the past 50 years. And to fundamentally  change that and realize, I believe cynically, that as the gap increases  over time, the percentage of the premiums that is being shifted onto  seniors is going to grow over time, until at some point--and you can do  the arithmetic--it is going to eat the whole thing. And the Federal  share, yes, will be capped--or capped at some lower level, and the  share that is paid by the individual, by the family, by your mom, by  your dad is only going to be greater. That is wrong. That is a breaking  of the promise that we made to our seniors.   The second piece where Dr. Price, I believe, is fundamentally at odds  with the premise, with the mission of the agency, is in Medicaid. He  has talked about various programs. First, let's get rid of the  expansion of Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act and then let's block- grant Medicaid and send it to the States. It is the same principle: It  is shift and shaft, only this time you are shafting the States. You are  taking a program which now says, if you have medical expenses and you  are qualified, they are paid for, and you are saying, OK, in the  future, we will give you a fixed amount of money, but if the medical  expenses go up, it is on you, Mr. State; it is on you, State of Maine  or Michigan or California or Georgia or Florida, or anywhere in this  country.  [[Page S1054]]    It is simply, again, repairing the miserable books of the Federal  Government because we are not facing up to our responsibility to pass  reasonable budgets. It is fixing those books at the expense of somebody  else. Those moneys they are talking about: a $2 trillion cut in  Medicaid. Great, Medicaid is going to look a lot better, but that $2  trillion doesn't evaporate and doesn't go anywhere. It is not like  everybody is going to say: Well, they are cutting Medicaid so we are  going to charge less for our hip or for our surgery or for our  treatment of drug abuse. It is going to have consequences. It is going  to come out of treatment. It is going to come out of health.   There is something about Medicaid that often isn't observed. I  learned this as Governor. People think of Medicaid as a kind of welfare  program, and there are these people who are taking advantage of it, and  perhaps there are. There are always people who take advantage of  programs.   The truth is, the majority of the funds for Medicaid go to people in  nursing homes--your parents, your uncle, your aunt. Nursing home  expenditures for the elderly are a significant cost for Medicaid.  Medicare doesn't pay nursing home expenses except for a limited period  of time, but a great deal of Medicaid expenses go to nursing homes. You  are going to cut Medicaid? You are going to have people who aren't  going to be able to afford to stay in nursing homes. That is going to  shift that cost back on to the family.   The other majority of people on Medicaid are children. They are  children who are covered who wouldn't have coverage otherwise.   One of the best things in this country is the combination of Medicaid  and CHIP, which has resulted in an enormous increase in the covered  health coverage of children. And it is so important because health  problems in children that can be dealt with when they are young, when  they are children, when it is covered by insurance, can save us  enormous costs later on.   So, again, what does Dr. Price want to do? Cap, eliminate ACA  expansion of Medicaid, and block-grant it.   Let's not kid ourselves. Block-granting is shifting and shafting to  those elderly people who would lose coverage for nursing homes, to the  children who need the coverage, but most especially, to the States. As  a former Governor, I can see the impact of this on my State of Maine.  It is a difficult issue, and if we limit it, the only option will be to  limit coverage or to cut back.   Of course, Medicaid is one of the places we are covering the  treatment of opioid addiction. The greatest public health crisis in  this country in my lifetime is the opioid crisis. We are losing 1  person a day in the State of Maine to overdose deaths--1 person every  day. I met a young man at Christmastime at a treatment center. I went  to the Christmas party and met his family and he was hopeful and he was  under treatment. I learned this week that he is gone. He is gone, taken  by the scourge of drugs.   These are real people. These are real people. These aren't just  numbers and statistics. In the next hour, as we are here debating this  nomination, four people in America are going to die of overdoses--four  people an hour. And when you think of how we mobilized this country and  the money we spent to deal with Ebola where one person died--one person  in the whole country--and yet we have this horrible disease and scourge  that is just decimating our societies and we are talking about cutting  back one of the basic props for providing treatment. We have cases  where we--there is a huge backlog of treatment beds.   I have been working on this problem in Maine for a long time. One of  the things I have learned is that once a person who is addicted reaches  a stage where they are willing to ask for help, we have to be there-- then. To say to that person there will be an opening in 3 weeks or 3  months is akin to a death sentence because they might not be able to  make it 3 weeks or 3 months; yet that is the situation in much of the  country today. That is the situation, and we are talking about knocking  one of the props out from under our ability to deal with this horrible  public health crisis that is devastating this country in every State,  but particularly in rural States. It is taking people out of the  workforce that we need, it is tearing families apart, and it is  affecting everybody. It is not just certain people in certain places.  It is everybody. It is middle-class families. It is people of all ages.   To blithely talk about we are going to block-grant Medicaid and fix  the amount--it is the same as what I said about Medicare; the iron law  of the percentage changes. If you fix it today and inflation continues,  then ultimately it withers away, and it is not going to meet the needs  of our people. Yet that is what the nominee for the Department of  Health and Human Services wants to do. I don't get it.   Finally, there is the Affordable Care Act. I have talked on this  floor before about the Affordable Care Act and why I feel so  passionately about it, how having insurance when I was a young man  saved my life, how not having insurance costs lives.   The mathematics is pretty clear. There have been a number of studies:  For every million people who don't have insurance, there are a thousand  people who die prematurely. The Affordable Care Act now covers  something in the neighborhood of 22 million people, so here is the  arithmetic: 22,000 premature deaths a year. This isn't ideology. These  are people. To ignore that and say we want free markets and free  choice--free choice means death for a lot of people. It meant death for  a young man who had what I had 40 years ago and didn't have insurance,  didn't get a checkup, didn't have surgery, and he is gone and I am  here, and that is not fair. That is not fair.   I have said since I got here that the Affordable Care Act isn't  perfect. It can be changed; it can be fixed. I hear every now and then  that my colleagues are saying: Let's repair it. I am all for it. Let's  repair it. Let's get over this talk about repeal. But Dr. Price has  been one of the leading voices, if not the leading voice, in the  Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act. I don't know his exact  voting record, but I suspect he voted for every one of those repeals in  the House 60, 70 times over the last couple of years: Repeal, repeal.  Well, you are repealing people's health care.   He doesn't want to have the patient protections in the Affordable  Care Act, the ones that keep it so that you can't discriminate against  women in health insurance because they are women. And there have to be  preventive services. Preexisting conditions--he says: They have to  insure; they have to keep you on for the preexisting condition. But if  you lose your health insurance for a few months, sorry. The clock  stops, and you can't get it again because of a preexisting condition.  That is one of the most important and fundamental promises of the  Affordable Care Act, yet he wants to get rid of it.   Here is the reality in Maine. We are a rural State. We have a lot of  rural hospitals. I urge every Member of this body to talk to their  hospitals. I have done it. I have gone to the hospitals and sat down  with them. I did it as recently as 2 weeks ago with a small rural  hospital, the Penobscot Valley Hospital in Lincoln, ME. They told me  the repeal of the Affordable Care Act would cost them $1 million a  year, and they can't afford it. I have been to the Bridgton Hospital. I  have talked to people from--not all, but many of our small hospitals,  and 50 to 60 percent of our rural hospitals are running in the red  right now. The Affordable Care Act has provided insurance coverage to  people who are the customers of those hospitals, and the estimates are  that repeal of the Affordable Care Act without a reasonable replacement  would reduce their revenues anywhere from 5 to 8 to 10 percent. These  hospitals can't stand that kind of cut, and they have told me there are  only two choices: One is to shrink their services to their communities,  and the other is to close their doors.   In Maine, in our rural State, we have only 16 counties. In 8 of our  16 counties, the hospital is the largest employer in that county. I am  sure that is true in all of the States in our country that have these  small rural hospitals; the hospital is the major employer. So again,  when we are talking about cutting the Affordable Care Act and all these  policy things and ideological things, what we are doing is cutting jobs  in small towns that can't afford to lose them, and they are good jobs.  If that is what you want to do, fine. But fess up and understand that  is the consequence of policies that are espoused  [[Page S1055]]  enthusiastically by this nominee for the Department of Health and Human  Services. It doesn't make sense to be putting someone in charge of an  agency that is supposed to be looking out for the welfare and the  health of our citizens who is diametrically opposed to maintaining the  health and welfare of our citizens.   In Maine, we have 75,000 people on the Affordable Care Act. I know  people who have it who couldn't have coverage otherwise without those  subsidies. But he is not going to allow those subsidies anymore. It is  every man for himself. Every man for himself means a lot of people fall  by the wayside, and that is wrong. That is wrong in Maine, and I can't  vote for somebody who is going to put a dagger in the heart of these  citizens of Maine. I cannot do it. My conscience will not let me.   So on Medicare, shift and shaft to the seniors. On Medicaid, shift  and shaft to the States. On the Affordable Care Act, shift and shaft to  those people who need health insurance and the hospitals in  our communities, the hospitals in those communities. If you take paying  customers away, it is a double whammy: You lose the revenues from the  customers, and then you have to treat them as charity care. It makes  the bottom line in these hospitals even worse. As I said, they have  told me in my State--and I suspect this is true practically  everywhere--50 to 60 percent of our hospitals are skating on the edge.  They are in negative territory. They are in the red, and we are going  to cut their revenues by 8, 10 percent? It is unconscionable. It is  truly unconscionable. That is a word used around here sometimes, but  this is it.    All in the name of some kind of ideology, we want to go back to the  health care--I can't believe we are debating Medicare, a program that  has been so successful and so important to seniors throughout the last  three to four generations. We are now debating it? It doesn't make any  sense. To put somebody in charge of the Department of Health and Human  Services that is inimical to Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable  Care Act--this guy is a wrecking ball. He is not a Secretary. He is  going into this agency to destroy it. He wants to undercut and diminish  and, in some cases, literally destroy some of the major underpinnings  of providing health care to people in this country.   If we were sitting in this body and somebody walked by me and was  stricken by a heart attack and fell on the floor, I would help him.  Every one of us would help him. I suspect Dr. Price would help him. He  would be the first one there. But by these changes, what we are doing  is having people fall by our side and ignoring them in large scale  across the country. It is just as real as if it is happening right  before our eyes. Twenty-two thousand people will die if health  insurance is lost prematurely. Seniors will take on a burden of anxiety  and fiscal drain that they can't afford that they have avoided for 50  years.   The final point is that this man's policies are at odds with those of  his boss. Through the campaign, President Trump issued pretty much  ironclad guarantees to seniors that he was going to maintain Medicare,  maintain Social Security, but then he appoints a guy whose whole  professional career has been aimed at undermining Medicare. I think  they had better get on the same page. I don't always agree with  President Trump, but in this case I think he is right. I wish he would  whisper into the ear of his nominee: You can't have it both ways. You  are either for it or you want to gut it. That is what we are facing in  this vote.   This is a vote of conscience for me. It is also a vote about my  State. I love those people. I know them. I started out as a legal  services attorney in a small town in Maine. My first boy was born in  that town, in a little, rural hospital that is struggling. I can't  stand by and see someone take over this Department who is going to do  harm. That is the medical creed, isn't it? Do no harm; that is the  oath. But we are talking about harm to seniors, to children, to people  with insurance who will not have it. We are talking about real harm.   That is why I come to the floor tonight to urge my colleagues to  reject this nominee. If the President wants to put somebody forward who  is conservative and has ways of fixing some of these things and thinks  some improvements should be made--and we don't have to do everything  the way we have always done it. I'm not arguing that. But goodness,  gracious, don't give us a nominee whose whole career has been spent  aimed at undermining and diminishing and gutting the very programs that  have meant so much to the people of America.   I am voting no on this nominee. I believe my colleagues should do so  as well.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, that Kevin Concannon retired is not  news--he has done that several times before--and each time he moved on  to more exciting and challenging positions.   In 2016, Kevin Concannon retired from the USDA as the Undersecretary  of Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services after 8 years of service.   Kevin is a tireless advocate of people--all people. His work to  assure that every effort was made to address hunger in this country is  an indicator of his compassion, understanding of both the issues and  solutions, and his unwavering faith in the ability of this great  country to care for those who are struggling--whether it is food  insecurity or earlier in his career on mental health issues, long-term  care, and child welfare.   At USDA, Kevin worked tirelessly to increase options for SNAP  beneficiaries to access fresh local foods at farmers markets; he was  determined that children should have more access to nutritious foods in  WIC, schools and child care--while Kevin and I agree on that goal--I  must add--that as a native Mainer, Kevin may have missed the mark on  where white potatoes fit into those meal plans.   Kevin Concannon came to USDA with an amazingly broad spectrum of  experience. From 1987-1995, he served as the director of the Oregon  Department of Human Resources, after having served as Commissioner of  the Maine Department of Mental Health and Corrections. In 1995, I was  fortunate to be able to bring him back to his home State of Maine to  serve as the commissioner of Maine's Department of Human Services. At  the time, I commented that he was the Dan Marino of commissioners and  welcomed him back. I would point out that Dan Marino is now serving as  the vice president of the Dolphins, and I expect that, in the same way,  Kevin Concannon will find ways to continue his public service--and that  will benefit us all.   Kevin led efforts throughout his career to improve child welfare,  expand Medicaid and child health insurance, integrating programs of  public health and medical care, improving systems for long-term care  for elders and people with disabilities. Many of those efforts were  national in scope, and he was selected by his peers to serve as the  president of the American Public Welfare Association from 1994-1995.   In every role, in every effort, Kevin Concannon has been an exemplary  public servant and leader.   Margaret Chase Smith said it best: ``Public service must be more than  [[Page S1070]]  doing a job efficiently and honestly. It must be a complete dedication  to the people and to the nation.''   Kevin Concannon is the personification of total dedication, honesty,  and determination to make the world a better place; that has been the  hallmark of his work each and every day.   Congratulations and best wishes to Kevin Concannon and welcome  home.                            ____________________
