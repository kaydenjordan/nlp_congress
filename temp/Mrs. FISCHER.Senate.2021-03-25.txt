 Mr. President, every Senator depends on their staff to  provide them with information and advice on the issues. Every Senator  knows the importance of having good staff who can respond to the  questions and concerns their constituents may have in dealing with the  Federal bureaucracy. And every Senator believes that their staff  members are the most prepared, the most conscientious, and the most  caring people in the U.S. Senate.   I know that my staff is. I have been fortunate with the people who  have joined my team to work for the great State of Nebraska. I have  been extremely fortunate that Joe Hack has been a member of Team  Fischer since my very first day as a U.S. Senator.   Joe officially joined my team as my communications director on that  first day. He was not new to the Senate; he had first arrived here as  an 18-year-old intern. On our first day in 2013, he immediately got to  work with his new boss in getting out press releases, reaching out to  State and national media, and helping me continue my practice of  writing a weekly column for media back home.   Joe never missed a beat. He helped guide me through the traditions  and inner workings of the Senate and through the tunnels of the Russell  Building.   After 2 years, Joe Hack became my chief of staff, the youngest chief  in the Senate at that time. Joe set the tone I wanted for my office: Be  professional, take your job seriously, be honest, get along with your  colleagues, always respond to constituents, gather all the information  we need on an issue and then get more, and work hard. Joe's closing to  every email and every staff meeting was always, ``Work harder.'' And he  set the example for all of these.   Joe was involved in every major piece of legislation we have  accomplished, from passing the first-ever paid family leave law to the  FAST Act, our Internet of Things work, broadband, infrastructure, and  agriculture issues. He guided the Omaha VA clinic from inception to  completion, and he will see the Lincoln VA clinic open and the Offutt  Air Force Base runway completely rebuilt. He knew the importance of  securing funding for Nebraska highway and water projects and for the  continued growth of our university system. He was part of every  success.   Joe knows Nebraska, and Nebraskans know Joe. He knew instinctively  that the people of our State are why we do this work. We represent  them. Joe has attended statehood dinners in our Capitol Rotunda, driven  a combine in Grand Island, had meals at Ole's Big Game Bar, and gone to  Husker tailgates and games. He loves browsing at Cabela's and a good  meal at Rosita's. He knows which Nebraska hotels have the best gym,  where every Runza drive-thru is located in the State, and where to find  the best steaks. He has shared BBQ at our ranch with family, neighbors  and the U.S. Secretary of Ag. He is also addicted to Colby Ridge  popcorn balls. He buys them in bulk, and he doesn't share.   He has attended countless Nebraska breakfasts and constituent  meetings in Washington. He has worked hard for the people of Nebraska.   Joe has traveled the vastness of our State, understanding its  diversity and standing in awe while viewing our skies, sunrises and  sunsets, our clouds, and the majesty of our night stars. He fell in  love with ``The Good Life''. A New Jersey guy became a Nebraskan.   Joe has been by my side since my very first day in the Senate, and  now, he is moving on to new opportunities. He has been a mentor to  many, my trusted policy and political adviser, and a leader whose  admonition to ``work harder'' became our office mantra. Joe has  smoothed the waters and ruffled feathers.   Joe Hack is a friend. He is family. I wish him only the best as he  meets new challenges and faces new adventures in his life.   Thank you, Joe.                            ____________________
