 Mr. President, I would like to expand on my recent  comments on the need to stand up to Putin to prevent future aggression  and the death and suffering it causes. Specifically, I would like to  address the calls from well-meaning people for a diplomatic solution.   Many people understandably want an end to the killing in Ukraine. I  certainly do. So why not sit down and talk? As I have said before, we  tried that after 2014, and it didn't work. We ended up with a full- scale invasion a year ago.   More fundamentally, it is important to consider what there is to  negotiate over. To start with, what is the nature of the disagreement?  In other words, assuming you could get Putin or his representative to a  negotiating table, what are the opposing positions and the potential  middle ground?   Vladimir Putin has continued to repeat his original stated war aims,  ``demilitarization and denazification.'' Denazification in the context  Putin uses it clearly means regime change. It is pretty clear that  Putin thought he could take out the current elected government and  install a puppet regime. President Biden publicly released the  intelligence we had to that effect before the war began, which I think  was a smart move.   Demilitarization means that Ukraine has to give up its right to  defend itself, allowing Russia a free hand to intervene with force if  Ukraine ever again tries to assert its right to act independently of  Russia.   Obviously, President Zelenskyy cannot ever agree to meet those two  demands. No President of a sovereign country could. Of course, in  Putin's mind, Ukraine is not a sovereign country. That is the problem.  Putin repeats a false version of history that says Ukraine is an  artificially created country and rightfully part of Russia.   Ukraine has a long history of independence before it was ever  conquered by Russia, in fact long before Russia even existed. But, for  decades, Putin has pushed a warped, imperialistic view of history that  is all too common among Russians.   When Putin repeatedly invokes Peter the Great, we should be  concerned. Remember, Peter the Great was a Russian expansionist emperor  who conquered lands like Finland and the Baltics from Sweden.   It may be comforting to buy into Putin's propaganda that he feels  concern for the people in parts of Ukraine where they speak Russian and  that perhaps those people want to be Russian. That makes his motives  seem like they might have some justification. It also lulls us into the  belief that Putin will be appeased once he cleaves off a chunk of  eastern Ukraine. There is absolutely no reason to believe that, nor has  Putin actually said that. The Russian Federation in its current borders  has subsumed many non-Russian ethnicities and languages from past  imperial conquests. Not speaking Russian never stopped them before.   In 1939, the Soviet Union attacked Finland in the Winter War despite  its language and culture being very, very different from Russia. It was  a nakedly imperial quest to reconquer lost territory of the Russian  empire. Finland fought back and kept its independence, but Russia kept  a big chunk of Karelia. This is an area that spoke a dialect of Finnish  and was not historically Russian in any deep cultural or linguistic  sense. Sadly today, in that region, Karelians maintaining their native  language and culture represent a tiny minority of the population. Over  the years, it has been thoroughly russified.  [[Page S453]]    In Ukraine, mass graves and reports of widespread rape from areas  liberated from Russian occupation should suffice to dispel the myth  that Ukrainians welcome occupation or that Russians see Ukrainians as  brothers. The fact that many people in eastern Ukraine speak Russian  never made them Russian, just as English-speaking Irish citizens do not  long to be governed by London. Eastern Ukraine was subject to a policy  of russification under the Russian Empire and then under the Soviet  Union, when many Russian workers were imported to the area.   But it should be clear to everyone now that the Ukrainian national  identity cannot be easily suppressed, regardless of the language they  speak at home. Still that does not stop Russians from trying. Thousands  of Ukrainian children from Russian occupied areas in eastern Ukraine  have been forcibly deported to Russia and adopted into Russian  families. Members of the Putin regime talk openly about how these  children came with pro-Ukrainian attitudes but have now been  brainwashed to adopt pro-Russian sentiments. This alone meets the  definition of genocide.   In Putin's 2007 Munich Security Conference speech, his critique of  the United States included the assertion that we seek a unipolar world  where we impose our values on others, and called for a multipolar  world--in other words, one with different spheres of influence.   When Putin talks about countries like Ukraine and other formerly  Russian dominated countries, it is clear that he sees them as either in  his sphere of influence, or someone else's. Putin cannot accept that  Ukrainians might want to leave behind the corrupt, Russian dominated  post-Soviet system where oligarchs get rich and the average person's  economic and political freedom are limited.   Putin talks about ``NATO expansion'' into the Baltics as though NATO  is a rival empire. In reality, the Baltic countries begged to join  NATO. And they were admitted at a time of naive optimism in the West  that Russia was becoming a peaceful democracy. The Baltic countries are  actually a useful case study to understand how many Russians think  about their former imperial subject countries.   This month, Estonia and Lithuania celebrate the 106th anniversary of  the birth of their republics in their current independent form. It is  important to understand that the Baltic countries are historically  Western in their culture and outlook. Like Ukraine, they experienced  attempts at russification, during the Russian Empire and the Soviet  Union, including importing of Russian-speaking workers, threatening  their unique cultures and languages. After regaining their freedom from  Soviet occupation in 1991, the Baltics quickly built thriving, free  market democracies.   Given their history, it is natural that they sought to protect their  way of life from Russian domination by joining the most successful  defensive alliance in history. Putin and many Russians speak with  resentfulness about the Baltics. Their very existence as prosperous,  Western-style free-market democracies not dependent on Russia  politically or economically is clearly threatening.   Russian state media tries, absurdly, to convince Russians that their  prosperity is due to development efforts under the Soviet occupation or  that they are about to become failed states any day now. Many Russians  are convinced that their joining NATO makes them U.S. puppets,  reflecting the spheres of influence worldview.   Again, joining NATO was their fervent wish, not some policy of  expansion for expansion's sake on the part of NATO, and their  populations are some of the most pro-American anywhere in the world.  Putin dismisses the wishes of his smaller neighbors as irrelevant to  great power geopolitics. He thinks they are inevitably pawns to be  bartered over by big empires. Given our origin as a tiny collection of  Colonies seeking independence from a powerful empire, Americans ought  to think differently.   Putin is threatened by NATO expansion not because he believes NATO  countries might attack the Russian Federation. Our NATO allies  bordering Russia did not host any long-term deployments of troops from  other allies before Russia's 2014 invasion of Ukraine. Multiple NATO  allies have since provided small rotational forces to our eastern flank  allies intended to deter Russian aggression. Those forces have  naturally grown since the full scale invasion of Ukraine in February.  But, frankly, they are still insufficient to repel the kind of full- scale invasion we saw in Ukraine, much less pose any kind of threat to  Russian territory.   Putin's military leaders, for all their mistakes in Ukraine, are not  stupid. They do not see NATO as a military threat to current Russian  territory. Rather, Putin sees NATO as a threat to his dream of  reconstituting the Russian Empire. President Macron of France has  suggested offering Putin security guarantees. That plays into Putin's  false propaganda that he faces any kind of threat from NATO.   When Putin talks about security guarantees, he has made clear that he  means a dismantling of NATO in areas he sees as his rightful sphere of  influence, enabling him to bully them. Keep in mind that, when he  invaded Ukraine initially in 2014, Ukraine was militarily neutral, but  seeking closer economic relations with the European Union. In February  2014, months of popular protests by ordinary Ukrainians culminated in  what Ukrainians call their ``Revolution of Dignity.'' The Ukrainian  President at the time yielded to pressure from Putin and refused to  sign an association agreement with the European Union after it passed  overwhelmingly in the Parliament.   The Ukrainian Parliament ultimately voted to remove the President. He  then fled to Russia, but not before violent confrontations between  special riot police and protestors. Putin has falsely claimed this was  a U.S.-sponsored coup rather than a grassroots rejecting of his  meddling in Ukraine's sovereign affairs. Russia then invaded Eastern  Ukraine and Crimea.   To be clear, the 2014 Russian invasion of Ukraine had nothing to do  with NATO, the U.S., or any military threat to Russia. Rather,  Ukraine's decision to seek closer economic ties to Europe threatened  Putin's sense of entitlement to have Ukraine dominated by Russia.   Putin has said ``true sovereignty of Ukraine is possible only in  partnership with Russia.'' This reflects his notion that Ukraine can  never be truly independent. In his mind, Ukraine is either in Russia's  sphere of influence, which he sees as its natural state, or it is  somehow controlled by shadowy Western forces. We should not fall into  the same imperialistic trap of sidelining or minimizing the wishes of  Ukrainians. President Biden has said, ``nothing about Ukraine without  Ukraine,'' and he must stick to that.   We must also be clear-eyed about what is and is not possible to  negotiate with Putin. As I have said before, Putin only understands  strength and weakness is provocative. As Ursula von der Leyen, the EU  Commission President and former German Defense Minister under Angela  Merkel said, ``We should have listened to the voices inside our Union-- in Poland, in the Baltics, and all across Central and Eastern Europe-  they have been telling us for years that Putin would not stop.''   President Biden should take that lesson to heart as well.   Estonian Prime Minister Kallas puts it this way: ``History shows that  appeasement only strengthens and encourages aggressors and that  aggressors can be stopped only with force. As the prime minister of  Estonia, a frontline NATO country that endured half a century of Soviet  occupation, I know what peace on Russia's terms really means. Russian  peace would not mean the end of suffering but rather more atrocities.''   I wish it was possible to negotiate with Putin to put an end to  Ukraine's suffering. But what he wants is domination of Ukraine, and  that is not ours to offer.   We have only two options left. We could sit on the sidelines and  watch Ukraine get slowly crushed, which would embolden Putin and open  the possibility that he would eventually attack one of our allies. Or  we can support Ukraine's victory and independence.   As I have said before, backing a Ukrainian victory comes with costs  and risks. But the risks and costs of not stopping Putin now will be  much higher. That makes repelling Russia's invasion of its sovereign  neighbor in the U.S. national interest.   The Russian threat will not go away, so for our national interest and  in the  [[Page S454]]  interest of long term peace in Europe, supporting a decisive victory  for Ukraine is the right thing to do.                            ____________________
