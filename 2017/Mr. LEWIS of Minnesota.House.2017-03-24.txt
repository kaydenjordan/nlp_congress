 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  American Health Care Act, and I ask the other side: Just what is it you  are trying to preserve by voting ``no?''   Premiums rising double digits for years for the last 7 years? In my  home State of Minnesota, back-to-back premium increases of 50 to 67  percent?   Young, healthy people being priced out of the insurance market, 8  million in 2014, choosing to pay the penalty instead of buying  insurance?   That is the genesis of the death spiral in the insurance markets.  That is what this bill is trying to correct.   Deductibles, copays--I had a deductible on my own individual policy,  a skyrocketing deductible. There are deductibles of $13,000. That is  not health care. That is not even access.   Drug formularies being tightened to save money, so people are denied  prescription drugs, a prescription drug tax; thousands of Minnesotans  losing their plans, 100,000 when a big insurer dropped out; 1,000  counties with one insurer--that is what you are trying to preserve on  the other side, people voting ``no'' on this bill?   Emergency State legislation trying to prop up MNsure in my home State  because it is failing, and $1 trillion in taxes and spending that is  bankrupting the country--that is what the other side is trying to  preserve.   Those voting ``no'' on this bill, we have a choice today. You can  embrace the status quo and see the markets spiral out of control  completely, or you can vote for change and do the right thing.
