 Mr. President, this year marks the 100th anniversary of  the establishment of the Legislative Drafting Service, which we now  know as the Office of the Legislative Counsel. In recognition of the  anniversary, I would like to make a few comments about the history of  the office.   During the first 130 years of Congress, 1789-1918, legislation for  Congress was drafted by Members of Congress, congressional staff,  Executive agencies, and outside individuals and groups which sometimes  led to legislation that was not always clear, consistent, organized,  and well written.   In 1911, Columbia University established a Legislative Drafting  Research Fund to conduct research and work toward the better drafting  of statutes and sent Professor Middleton Beaman and Thomas Parkinson to  Congress to demonstrate the feasibility and value of the use by  Congress of a full-time staff of professional legislative drafters.   The positive experiences of committees, Members, and staff of  Congress, including the Ways and Means Committee of the House of  Representatives, in working with professional legislative drafters led  to the introduction and consideration of legislation to establish a  Legislative Drafting Bureau, including S. 1240, 63rd Congress, which  was reported to the Senate on June 17, 1913.   During the debate on the establishment of a Legislative Drafting  Bureau, Senator Elihu Root of New York argued in favor of establishment  citing the use of counsel by the British House of Commons and stating  that ``[t]he fundamental idea . . . to give the benefit of a trained,  experienced student in the preparation of bills. . . . We need trained  and intelligent assistance in the drafting of laws.''   On February 24, 1919, Congress enacted section 1303 of the Revenue  Act  [[Page S764]]  of 1918, 2 U.S.C. 271 et seq., which established the Legislative  Drafting Service.   The House of Representatives and the Senate were initially served by  a single office with two branches that received a single appropriation  that was equally divided and transferred employees between the branches  to meet special needs.   The two individuals who carried out the demonstration by the  Legislative Drafting Research Fund became the first Legislative  Counsels of the Legislative Drafting Service with Middleton Beaman  appointed in February 1919 as the first Legislative Counsel of the  House of Representatives branch of the Service and Thomas Parkinson  appointed in March 1919 as the first Legislative Counsel of the Senate  branch of the Service.   In 1924, the name of the office was changed from the Legislative  Drafting Service to the Office of the Legislative Counsel.   The House of Representatives and the Senate branches of the Office of  the Legislative Counsel began to evolve separately during the 1930s  when the Senate branch, while continuing to meet the drafting needs of  Senate committees, began to devote a significant part of the resources  of the Office to the drafting requests of individual Senators while the  House branch continued to limit the services of the branch to  committees of the House.   The House of Representatives and the Senate branches of the Office  continued to separate in 1958 when, for the first time, the two  branches received separate and not equal appropriations and were  officially separated in 1970 when a separate charter was established  for the Office of the Legislative Counsel of the House by title V of  the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970, 2 U.S.C. 281 et seq.   The first attorneys joined the Office to work only for a session or  on a particular project and then moved on to other positions, with  Thomas Parkinson, the first Legislative Counsel of the Senate, and John  E. Walker, the successor of Parkinson, each serving fewer than 2 years  and Frederic P. Lee, the third Legislative Counsel of the Senate, being  the first to serve a substantial term of about 8 years.   The career tradition of the Office of the Legislative Counsel of the  Senate was established with successors to Frederic P. Lee who served  the Senate in the Office for their careers or long periods of  employment, including Charles Boots--1922-1961, 32 years; Henry Wood-- 1926-1943, 17 years; Stephen Rice--1933-1950, 17 years; John Simms-- 1936-1966, 30 years; Dwight Pinion--1942-1969, 27 years; John Herberg-- 1947-1971, 24 years; Harry Littell--1947-1980, 33 years; Douglas  Hester--1952-1990, 38 years; Francis Burk--1970-1998, 28 years; James  Fransen--1975-2014, 39 years; Gary Endicott--1981-2018, 38 years; and  Bill Baird--2010-present, 33 years, who served as attorneys of the  Office and Legislative Counsels of the Senate.   During the 100-year history of the Office, the Office of the  Legislative Counsel of the Senate has served the Senate well by  providing a steady, reliable source of nonpartisan and nonpolitical  professionally drafted legislation for committees, Members, and staff.   The attorneys and staff members of the Office have established and  maintained traditions of professionalism and dedication that have  helped to provide to the Senate a sense of continuity and institutional  memory.   There has been a dramatic growth in the use of the Office by the  Senate where, during the 66th and 67th Congresses--1919-1923--704  requests were drafted by three attorneys for an average of 117 drafts  per attorney for both Congresses, to the most recently ended 115th  Congress--2017-2018--where 72,106 requests were drafted by 37 attorneys  for an average of 1,948 drafts per attorney for that Congress.   To deal with its increasing workload, in 1990, the Office established  teams with multiple attorneys per team that were responsible for  drafting legislation under the jurisdiction of one or more Senate  committees which has provided the Office with the flexibility and  resources to respond to and meet the growing demands placed on the  Office for ever-changing areas and complexity of active legislation.   Attorneys in the Office and the House Legislative Counsel's Office  use a uniform drafting style to improve the quality and consistency of  Federal legislation and Federal law, including whenever practicable  plain English, brevity, consistent organization and terms, and captions  and subdivisions to organize drafts and make the drafts more readable  and improve the administration and interpretation of and compliance  with laws enacted by Congress.   After the anthrax attacks on the Senate in October 2001, the Office  of the Legislative Counsel of the Senate continued to draft legislation  for the Senate by working in temporary facilities outside the Office  while the Dirksen Senate Office Building was decontaminated for 1 month  and has since developed an effective long-term capability to deal with  emergencies, reflecting the can-do attitude of the Office.   The role of the Office in the legislative work of the Senate is not  often acknowledged, but it is understood and appreciated by all  Senators.   The 262 current and former employees of the Office have worked very  hard over its first 100 years to provide consistently a high quantity  of high-quality legislation for the committees, Members, and staff of  the Senate.   As the Office of the Legislative Counsel of the Senate celebrates its  100th anniversary, the Office is well prepared to continue to provide  the Senate and its committees and officers quality drafting service and  sound legal advice with the spirit of quiet professionalism that has  been the tradition of the Office throughout its history.   I know that all Senators join me in congratulating the Office of the  Legislative Counsel of the Senate on the 100th anniversary of the  founding of the Office.
