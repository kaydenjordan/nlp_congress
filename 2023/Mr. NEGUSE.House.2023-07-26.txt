 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman, my  friend from Pennsylvania, for the customary 30 minutes, and I yield  myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman said, today's rule provides for  consideration of three bills. The first of those bills is H.R. 4366,  the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies  Appropriations Act, 2024.   Mr. Speaker, this is typically a bipartisan bill, one of the most  bipartisan bills that we consider in the United States Congress. That  is not the case this year. Why? Because House Republicans decided to  inject into this bill extreme policy riders that threaten the freedoms  of each and every American. They have kicked off appropriations season  by doubling down on funding bills that endanger essential services.   Just to speak frankly, neither this bill nor any of the others that  they will bring to the floor on the appropriations  [[Page H3968]]  side have any chance of becoming law. My colleagues across the aisle  know that.   Today, they come to the floor to proudly tout a bill that would slash  $1.3 billion--not my number; their number--from military construction  programs that support quality-of-life services for members of the Armed  Forces and their families.   Democrats fight against cuts to vital programs that help the American  people. Unfortunately, House Republicans are doing the opposite.   We saw this cycle many times, Mr. Speaker. Throughout the last 7  months, it has been hard to understand what my colleagues across the  aisle truly want.   At the beginning of this Congress, the other side of the aisle voted  for a House rules package that promised an open rules process for  amendments. Yet, here we are, debating another rule structured by  Speaker McCarthy and Republican leadership.   Now, House Republicans threaten to shut down the government in order  to fulfill an unpopular agenda full of far-right policy riders that  undermine equal opportunity, restrict access to abortion, and more.   We are going to hear a lot from my colleague, my friend on the other  side of the aisle, about what he claims this bill will do. It is  important for the American people to understand three simple things.   It cuts military construction by $1.3 billion. Think about the impact  that will have, Mr. Speaker, on servicemembers across the country.   It funds no infrastructure backlog for the Department of Defense. Mr.  Speaker, we have a $100 billion infrastructure backlog in the  Department of Defense for installations across the world, across the  country, and in our districts. The President asked for $2 billion to  start to address that backlog. House Republicans said no. How much did  they give? Zero.   Finally, the bill does nothing to address toxic PFAS contamination-- not a thing. Last year, House Democrats, under President Biden's  leadership, appropriated $200 million toward PFAS remediation to  address the toxic chemicals that are literally killing people across  the country. This bill appropriates how much? None.   Those are the facts.   If that weren't enough, as the gentleman said, we are considering two  other bills today. The American people watching this might think that  perhaps House Republicans would decide to bring a bill to the floor to  lower costs, address inflation, try to reduce the cost of healthcare,  grow the middle class, build safer communities, or address school  safety. No. House Republicans have declined to put any of those bills  on the floor. Instead, what are we left with? Hearings and bills on gas  stoves and, today, bills on the lesser prairie-chicken and the northern  long-eared bat. That is what we are here to debate, Mr. Speaker.   I think the American people would be deeply disappointed at the  choice of priorities that House Republicans are pursuing. Let's get  back to the core issues at hand. Let's negotiate in good faith. Let's  do the people's business.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, let me just say that only in Washington can  politicians demand recognition after being shamed into doing the right  thing. That is what we just heard.   We all know that the default on America act that House Republicans  pursued was primed to cut veterans benefits. House Democrats, President  Biden, and Senate Democrats led the charge to convince our colleagues  to come back from the brink, and now they have the audacity to demand  that we thank them for it.   By the way, Mr. Speaker, this comes from the same party that  overwhelmingly voted against the Honoring our PACT Act, the most  comprehensive healthcare legislation for veterans in my lifetime, the  proudest vote I have taken since I was sworn into the United States  Congress.   Mr. Speaker, 174 of them voted against it, including the gentleman  from Pennsylvania. Now they have the audacity to claim that they are  fighting for veterans?   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina  (Mr. Clyburn), the distinguished assistant Democratic leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New Mexico (Ms. Leger Fernandez), a distinguished member of the Rules  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I understand it is a little empty on the other side of  the aisle. There are perhaps not many Members who want to come to the  floor to defend the propriety of this bill that cuts military  construction funding, and I don't blame them.   The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Reschenthaler), whom I respect,  has the unenviable task of trying to make the case for a bill that cuts  military construction funding, does nothing to address the  infrastructure backlog, and cuts PFAS toxic exposure remediation, to  say nothing of the many other ills within the legislation.   We heard a lot earlier about the supposed work that House Republicans  are doing on the appropriations front. Of course, this is the first  appropriations bill that has come to the floor. However, we still can't  get House Republicans to commit to protecting Social Security and  Medicare, as House Democrats have championed. Of course, we know why.  It is because they have been unabashed about their efforts to cut both  vital programs.    Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment that we have offered before to the rule to provide for  consideration of a resolution which unambiguously states that it is the  House's duty to keep our solemn promise to American workers and seniors  to protect and preserve Social Security and Medicare and reject any  cuts to these critical programs.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment into the Record along with any extraneous material  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Ms. Scholten) to discuss our very important proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Michigan.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman talked about facts. Again,  these are not my numbers. These are their numbers. This year in this  bill, House Republicans appropriate $17.5 billion for military  construction. That is $1.5 billion less than the current level. In  other words, it is a decrease. It is a cut of $1.5 billion to military  construction, which is used for housing for our servicemembers.   Under current levels, there is $200 million dedicated to PFAS  remediation. In this bill, there is none.   President Biden requested $2 billion to address the infrastructure  backlog in our military. Under this bill, there is none.   These are not my numbers. These are their numbers.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record an  article from The Hill today titled: ``Senate GOP fears House actions  could lead to shutdown: It's going to be a problem.''    Mr. Speaker, that article is quoting a Republican Senator  from the gentleman's region, his neighbor, Senator Shelley Moore  Capito.                                time  1300    When House Republicans shut down the government in 66 days, which  they seem committed to doing, the American people will be right to ask  the question, they will be justified to ask the question of why House  Republicans decided to focus their time on the northern long-eared bat  and the lesser prairie-chicken. It is a fair question for the American  people to ask.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Again it feels like Ground Hog Day. Again, I have great respect for  my friend from Pennsylvania, but I don't understand what numbers he is  looking at.   Does he deny that in statute we appropriated last year $19 billion  for military construction?   He is an appropriator. I am happy to engage in a colloquy with him to  the extent that he wishes to clarify that.   Last year, military construction was funded at $19 billion. This  year, it is funded at $17.5 billion. Not complicated, and, of course,  the gentleman knows that because half of his caucus is bragging about  the fact that they have cut military construction and a variety of  other programs, juxtaposed against the levels that were set by  Congressional Democrats.   This is not disputed anywhere but apparently during this particular  debate. They are cutting military construction. They are not funding  military infrastructure backlog needs that the President has requested  of this Congress; and they have zeroed out any dedicated funding for  PFAS remediation. Those are the facts.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. McGarvey).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time remains on  both sides.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Again, I thank my friend and colleague from Pennsylvania for the  respectful debate. I understand that we don't see eye to eye on the  bills that this House will unfortunately be considering this week but,  nonetheless, I appreciate his courtesy.   Mr. Speaker, today marks 200 days since House Republicans gaveled us  into this 118th Session of the United States Congress; 200 days that  they have been in control; 200 days that they have had the gavels here  in Washington, D.C.   The American people would be justified in asking how have House  Republicans spent those 200 days. Any bills to address inflation, to  lower costs for working families, any bills to grow the middle class,  to build safer communities? The answer is none.   Instead, they have pursued extreme policy after extreme policy, and  this MILCON appropriation bill is no exception. Gas stoves, the  northern long-eared bat, the lesser prairie-chicken, and whatever other  issue House Republicans conjure up when we are back in session, that is  how they have chosen to spend their time and taxpayer dollars.   When House Democrats were in control, working with President Biden  and our colleagues in the upper Chamber, we focused on issues that  mattered to the American people:   A bipartisan infrastructure law that, unfortunately, most of my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle in this Chamber voted against  that is rebuilding bridges and roads and highways across this country  from Pennsylvania to Colorado, ensuring folks have clean water to drink  and clean air to breathe;   The PACT Act, the most comprehensive veterans' healthcare legislation  enacted in my lifetime, that 174 Republicans in this Chamber voted  against;   The Inflation Reduction Act, capping insulin costs at $35 for seniors  participating in Medicare across the country. That is how we spent our  time.   As I said earlier, we know that in 66 days, House Republicans will  shut down the government. They are telegraphing that. Many of their  Members have said publicly that they want to shut down the government;  that, in their view, a shutdown of the government is the desired  outcome; 66 days.   Mr. Speaker, in 72 hours, Republicans will gavel this Chamber out of  session. They will adjourn this Chamber for a 45-day recess.   Mr. Speaker, 66 days until the government runs out of funding, 45-day  recess, 72 hours until that recess, and we are here debating the lesser  prairie-chicken and the northern long-eared bat.   It is deeply disappointing, and it does not comport with how the  American public expects us to operate here in Washington, D.C. We can  do better, and I would challenge my Republican colleagues to come back  from the brink that I described earlier, work with us in good faith.  Help us deliver for the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this rule, and to  vote ``no'' on the underlying bills. If you support cutting military  construction, if you support not addressing military infrastructure  backlog, if you support zeroing out PFAS remediation then, by all  means, vote for the MILCON bill. But if you oppose those draconian  cuts, as I do, then I hope you will vote ``no.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
