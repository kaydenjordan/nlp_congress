 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Joe Biden promised that, if elected, there would be ``no more  drilling on Federal lands.'' ``No more drilling,'' he said, including  offshore. He said ``no ability for the oil industry to continue to  drill, period.''   Joe Biden is known for his multiple gaffes, but these weren't gaffes.  This was intentional. He said it again and again and again on the  campaign trail.   Here is another one. He said:         I guarantee you we're going to end fossil fuels.    Joe Biden, on the campaign trail, guaranteeing they are going to end  fossil fuels.   During one Democratic debate, Joe Biden was asked a specific  question. He was asked if he would sacrifice ``hundreds of thousands of  blue collar jobs'' right here in America to get rid of traditional  energy.   Joe Biden said:         The answer is yes.    Yes, happy to sacrifice hundreds of thousands of blue-collar, good  hard-working jobs of the American people. And today, the American  people are living with the consequences of Joe Biden's decisions.   Joe Biden is already the most anti-American energy President in  American history. His policies against American energy have resulted in  much higher prices for American families. One in five American families  this past year have had to cut their spending to pay their energy  bills. They have had to change the way they drive, the way they eat,  the way they shop. They have changed, and in many ways had to change,  their dreams and their aspirations as their anxieties continued to  increase as prices increased but wages didn't keep up.   Yes, prices have gone up in 12 of the 13 months since Joe Biden has  taken office. This month, we have seen the highest gas prices ever. The  Biden energy crisis is already the worst energy crisis in nearly half a  century. So far, Joe Biden hasn't proposed a single solution, too busy  blaming everyone other than himself.   Well, the Joe Biden blame game isn't working with the American  people. The American people remember Joe Biden's campaign promises, and  we have seen him wage war on American energy for 14 consecutive months.   When Joe Biden took office, the price of gas was $2.38 a gallon. By  the time Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, prices had already gone up to  $3.53 a gallon. Today, across the country, the average price is $4.24.   The increase before Putin's invasion was a lot larger than the  increase after Putin's invasion. Month after month after month, prices  have gone up, and at the same time, Joe Biden has doubled down.   First, he shut down the Keystone XL Pipeline, shut down oil and gas  leases on Federal lands, and he shut down exploration for energy in  Alaska. Now his political appointees in the government are making it  impossible to build gas pipelines. As a result, we are producing 1.3  million fewer barrels a day, in America, of oil than we were just  before the pandemic. Lower supply, higher prices--that is the law of  supply and demand.   So why is supply down? Well, the Biden administration hasn't held a  single auction for oil and gas leases since Joe Biden has taken office.  At this point in the Obama administration, there had been more than 30  of those auctions. After 14 months in office, there should have been  more than 50; in Joe Biden's term, zero.   Courts have said that the President's Executive orders on Federal  lands, they said, are illegal. That is the Federal courts. The  President stubbornly refused to open up our Federal lands--ignoring the  courts--failed to open up the lands to American energy production.   In Western States like my home State of Wyoming, this is devastating.  Half of Wyoming is Federal land, and Wyoming is sitting on a treasure  trove of American energy. We have it all--oil, gas, coal, uranium for  nuclear power. We have wind. We have sunny areas as well. We have it  all. We need it all. Joe Biden wants us to keep Wyoming energy in the  ground.   The White House claims we don't need to drill more, explore more for  energy because there are some leases that have not yet been used.   So why aren't they used? I mean, that is a legitimate question to  ask. Well, half of them are waiting for Joe Biden's permission to  drill. Just because you paid for a lease doesn't mean you have  permission yet to explore for energy on that area. You have to ask  permission of the Federal Government after you pay the Federal  Government for the lease. It is like renting an apartment and saying:  Well, they are not going to give you the key to move in yet.    The Biden administration has to know that, but they continue to try  to mislead the American people to say they are not being used.   Many of the leases that are still available are tied up in court by  environmental activists, and they can't explore for energy using those  areas until the court cases are resolved. That is a normal ploy of the  environmental extremist groups that are lined up with the Biden  administration to try to keep American energy in the ground and keep  American workers off the job.   So it seems that the percentage of leases being used that they can  use is where you would want it to be, but there are more that need to  be used, but Biden is tying them up.  [[Page S1282]]    American energy workers are doing their part. It is time for  Democrats in Washington to start doing theirs. Instead, Democrats seem  to be taking actions that are going to make this Biden energy crisis  and high-energy prices even worse.   Last year, Joe Biden proposed more than a dozen tax increases on  American energy. A bipartisan majority in this body--in the U.S.  Senate--blocked the tax increases from ever becoming law. Now Democrats  are trying to raise taxes on American energy again--again.   There is a bill in this Senate right now to raise taxes on American  energy and then send out government checks. That is a bill that is  going to make inflation worse. And, by the way, inflation is already at  a 40-year high. People are suffering under the inflation like they  haven't in a long, long time. Paychecks are not keeping up. People are  feeling the pain.   I heard it at the grocery store in Casper, WY, on Sunday; heard it at  the airport in Casper, WY, on Monday.   The Democrat's bill will do nothing to increase the supply of energy.  In fact, higher taxes would only decrease the supply. Government checks  would increase energy demand. You put the two together, it is an  inflation nightmare.   Other Democrats have proposed a pause on the gas tax, saying that  might actually lower the price a little bit--not much, a little bit.  Oh, the ones who cosponsored this, they are all running for election  this year, and the plan, of course, is to put the gas tax back in place  right after the election.   The gas tax is what is used to pay for work on Federal roads and  highways. It is called the highway trust fund. It is how we fund these.  I chair the Environment and Public Works Committee, bipartisan work  with Senator Carper. We know how the funding goes to build the  highways, the roads, and the infrastructure of this Nation. That is  part of it. It is a gimmick.   Even Democratic economist Larry Summers called the idea--I called it  a gimmick; he called it ``goofy and gimmicky.'' This is Larry Summers.   Other Democrats in the House are asking Joe Biden to declare a  climate emergency. They want him to tighten his choke hold on American  energy production. It is going to drive up prices even more. It is  going to drive supply down and prices up. But not one of the ideas that  the Democrats are proposing will actually bring down the cost of energy  for American families who are struggling today under the inflation of  Joe Biden and the Democrats' policies. Not one of their ideas would  increase the supply of American energy. So the contrast could not be  clearer.   The debate in this country today is a debate between the Biden blame  game and American energy production. It is a debate between climate  elitists and working families. It is a debate between Democratic  gimmicks and Republican solutions.   The only solution, the real solution to the high energy prices is  more supply, and the supply is more American energy. It is not going to  Iran; it is not going to Venezuela; it is American energy supply. We  have the resources. We have the expertise. We have the workers. We have  the energy in the ground. The Biden administration and the Democrats  will not let us get it out of the ground. The solution is for Joe Biden  and the Democrats to get out of the way so we can get American energy  out of the ground, and it can be used here at home in America.   Earlier this month, I sent a letter to the President, the morning  after the State of the Union Address. I sent it along with every  Republican who serves on the Energy Committee. I am the ranking member  of that committee. We sent President Biden a to-do list, 10 action  items that he could take today to restore American energy dominance-- because we were energy dominant the day he came into office, and we are  now energy dependent. That is how you get such an increase in gas  prices and the pain at the pump for the American people.   Step 1 is to open up our Federal lands to energy production. The  President ought to auction off leases right away, and he has a lot of  catching up to do. He should also approve the 4,600 drilling permits  that are today stuck in limbo and stop putting barriers to pipelines  and infrastructure that are used to move oil and gas to market.   Our Nation is an energy superpower. It is time we began to act like  that again.   I yield the floor.
