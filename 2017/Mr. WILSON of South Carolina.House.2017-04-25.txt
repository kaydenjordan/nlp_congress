 Mr. Speaker, through my service to  South Carolina's Second Congressional District and as past Cayce-West  Columbia Rotary Club president, I appreciate Rotary International's  work in promoting worldwide Service Above Self.   In coordination with national governments, Rotary International  created the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, producing Polio Plus  as one of the most successful public-private health initiatives in  history. The initiative has provided immunizations for more than 2.5  billion children, spared 15 million from disability, prevented over 1.5  million deaths, and has reduced polio illnesses by 99 percent.   Earlier this year, I introduced H. Res. 165, recognizing Rotary  International's work on the Global Polio Eradication Initiative and  supporting their ongoing services.   While we have made remarkable strides, more work remains. I am  grateful to support the current president of the Global Polio  Eradication Initiative with Rotary International President John Germ  and past Vice President Anne Matthews of Columbia, South Carolina.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. Our sympathy to the  family of National Review conservative stalwart Kate O'Beirne.                            ____________________
