 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the incredible life  and heroic service of Sergeant Carl Mann.  [[Page H4397]]    This past week, on the 75th anniversary of D-day, I visited Normandy,  France, where Sergeant Mann and more than 150,000 American troops  stormed the beaches to gain a foothold in mainland Europe.   For his heroic service, Sergeant Mann, a native of Mount Vernon,  Indiana, received three Purple Hearts and seven Bronze Stars while  serving in the 5th Infantry Division of General George S. Patton's 3rd  Army.   In fitting fashion of a true hero, Sergeant Mann was laid to rest in  Arlington National Cemetery on June 6, this year, the 75th anniversary  of D-day. Today, I take a moment to honor the selflessness that he and  the Greatest Generation made so that we and future generations of  Americans may enjoy boundless freedoms.   My prayers are with his children and grandchildren that carry on his  legacy. His memory will forever be a reminder of a day of great  tragedy, but also of triumph.   Rest in peace and God bless.                            ____________________
