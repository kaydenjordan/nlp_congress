 Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, the underlying bill is a significant step forward in  supporting community mental health efforts, which I applaud.   As a former social worker and former law enforcement officer, I have  seen the devastating impact when communities fall short of meeting the  needs of persons struggling with mental health and substance addiction.   Florida is 49th in the Nation on access to mental health care. It is  not a position we are proud of, but many States across the Nation have  failed to adequately address these issues.   Law enforcement officers, as we all know, have a tough and dangerous  job, and I was proud to co-lead the Law Enforcement Mental Health and  Wellness Act, signed into law by President Trump, which recognizes that  addressing mental and psychological health is just as important as good  physical health.   My amendment is a simple one. It will insert reporting requirements  on available mental health and stress-related programs for law  enforcement officers and recommend additional tools that may be helpful  or necessary to identify, access, monitor, and improve the overall  well-being of our law enforcement officers.   I am proud to support this bill, as it is critical that we support  our community by boldly addressing mental health issues. I am proud to  offer this amendment that will support the men and women in blue who  support, protect, and serve us.   Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
