 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the growing  student loan debt in our Nation. Despite efforts by President Biden and  the Democrats to forgive student loans, they are still a major  financial commitment and should be treated as such.   Before taking out Federal student loans, proper counseling for  students should be required. We must ensure that our students are  equipped with the guidance needed to make an informed decision and that  they understand the process through which they pay these loans back.   This week I reintroduced the Know Before You Owe Federal Student Loan  Act with Representatives Feenstra, Hinson, Nunn, and Guest to require  institutes of higher education to counsel students before any Federal  loans are disbursed. This counseling would also require students to  manually enter the exact dollar amount of funding requested and require  that students receive regular loan statements throughout their  undergraduate career.   If we can help our students understand the process by which they  receive Federal students loans and the interest, we will be one step  closer to helping to relieve them of their debt through their career  choices--unlike President Biden's loan which claims to erase these  loans.   Unfortunately, we can't just erase loans taken out. They must be paid  back, just like a car loan or a mortgage. Erasing would only transfer  the debt to other hardworking taxpayers.                            ____________________
