 Mr. Speaker, Teddy Roosevelt once remarked that:         We have fallen heirs to the most glorious heritage a people       have ever received, and each one must do his or her part if       we wish to show that the nation is worthy of its good       fortune.    Passage of the Great American Outdoors Act proves we are worthy of  the good fortune and glorious heritage of our National Parks.   Future generations have been counting on us to ensure these treasures  can be visited for another 100 years and, with the funding secured in  this bill, we aren't letting them down.   In 1893, Katharine Lee Bates was inspired hiking up Pikes Peak, and  she penned the following lines:       O beautiful for spacious skies      For amber waves of grain      For purple mountain majesties      Above the fruited plain.      America, America      God shed His grace on thee      And crown thy good with brotherhood      From sea to shining sea.    Passage of this bipartisan bill is a triumphant act that will benefit  countless generations to come.    A Freedom Rider unshaken by threats and violence,  a leader in the struggle for voting rights who kept fighting even after  a broken skull, a courageous American undeterred by more than 40  arrests after standing up for what is right, John Lewis spent his life  fighting injustice and racism.   If it weren't for the bravery of John and men and women like him,  many of us wouldn't be in this Chamber today. And as a Black man, I am  not sure I would have had the same rights as my fellow countrymen.   John shaped this country in immeasurable ways. He never sat by when  he saw injustice. He never stopped fighting.   At a time when America is so divided, we should look at John's  courage for inspiration; we should look at John's bravery for  imitation; and we should look at John's words and follow them.   I lost a mentor. John's family lost a father, son, brother, and  husband. Our country lost an American hero.   Rest in peace, my brother.
