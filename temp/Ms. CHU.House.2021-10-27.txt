 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5661, the  Continued State Flexibility To Assist Older Foster Youth Act.   We have heard directly from foster youth that aging out of the system  comes with unique challenges, and that they are often left without  supportive services or families to help them if they fall on hard  times. This has been especially difficult throughout the COVID-19  pandemic, as older and former foster youth have experienced homeless,  been laid off from work, endured food insecurity, and navigated  negative impacts on their mental health.   But States like California have devised ways to help, like letting  foster youth who turn 21 continue receiving support and assistance  through the child welfare agency. Additionally, at the end of last  year, Congress provided States with additional funds in the year-end  omnibus specifically to help this population, many of whom were not  eligible for Federal stimulus payments. And in California, we are  working to get this funding directly to impacted youth via direct cash  payments. Unfortunately, the pandemic has made it harder to get these  funds directly into the hands of the young people who need them,  causing needless delays and hardship.   That is why I am happy to support H.R. 5661 to extend support to our  young adults and ensure that they have all of the tools they need to  make it through this unprecedented time. By extending the programmatic  flexibilities in the Chafee program, which helps current and former  foster youth prepare for independent adult living, we are keeping young  people safe and housed and also ensuring access to supportive services  for those youth affected by the COVID-19 crisis.   I have had the privilege to meet with foster youth from across the  country throughout the years, and I have been impressed with their  resilience and ability to advocate for themselves. But they don't have  to do it alone. I am proud to support this bill to help foster youth  shape a better future for themselves and our whole country.                                time  1230
