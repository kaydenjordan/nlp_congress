 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  of the late Jeanne Wood, who reached age 100, in our Chino Hills  community.   Jeanne dedicated herself to serving others. During World War II, she  enlisted as a second lieutenant Army nurse and was quickly promoted to  first lieutenant. She worked 18 to 24 hours per shift, with bombings  and air raids around her, to care for injured and starving  servicemembers.   After the war, Jeanne continued her career as a registered nurse and  became the only female commander in the history of American Legion Post  299 in Chino.   I am so glad Jeanne was able to celebrate her 100th birthday in Chino  Hills with her family and friends before she passed. My heart is with  her loved ones as we mourn this loss and celebrate a life well lived.                            ____________________
