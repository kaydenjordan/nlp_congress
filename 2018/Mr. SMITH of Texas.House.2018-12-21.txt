SEC. 306. UNITED STATES POLICY ON ORBITAL DEBRIS.

(3) Cooperation with former soviet republics.--Section 218       of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration       Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1993 (51 U.S.C. 50702 note) is       amended by striking ``Office'' each place it appears and       inserting ``Bureau''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on S. 3277, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Space Frontier Act is a missed opportunity, despite  months of negotiations. The House successfully added some positive  provisions to the bill, including:   Increased the stature of the Department of Commerce Office of Space  Commerce to a Bureau of Space Commerce, led by a Senate-confirmed  Assistant Secretary of Commerce;   Reduced from 120 to 90 days a determination for remote sensing  applications;   Remote sensing applications cannot be denied if a product will be  commercially available within 3 years;   Enhanced deadline enforcement for remote sensing applications;   Included a low-Earth orbit commercialization program authorized at  the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee's NASA  reauthorization level of $150 million.   This bill contains some improvements over current commercial space  law, but many bold reforms in the American Space Commerce Free  Enterprise Act, which passed the House unanimously, were not included  in this package.   We have not done enough to encourage commercial space activity, which  has the potential to transform research, development, discovery, and  access to space.   While remote sensing reform is marginally improved over current law  in the original version of the Space Frontier Act, it doesn't go far  enough. We set out to change how we think about remote sensing, a  growing, constantly advancing, and increasingly commonplace industry  that should be free to act unless there is a good reason to prevent  that. Instead, this bill only tinkers around the edge of a three-decade  out-of-date law.   This legislation will keep the government in strict control of  American companies' space access and actions, discouraging businesses,  and damaging American competitiveness and leadership in space.   Meanwhile, other countries are encouraging technology development in  an effort to overtake us and grab market share from American companies.  This represents a missed opportunity for American businesses that is  being stifled by parochial government interests.   In the bill before us, there is still room for government employees  to ignore the deadline enforcement mechanisms and drag out decisions  indefinitely. The bill also doesn't guarantee that remote sensing  companies will be given all relevant information explaining why their  applications were not approved.   There is also less of an assumption of approval for a remote sensing  license application than was included in my bill. Who knows what  capability will be quashed because we didn't fully empower private  industry. Congress must remain vigilant in its oversight of remote  sensing licensing, and any abuse of the approval process should be  challenged.   My biggest disappointment is that this bill does not establish a  self-certification regime for private space missions. American space  companies are moving overseas because current laws here don't enable  them to conduct business.   The House-passed bill intentionally made it easier to approve private  space missions. Regrettably, the Senate killed these provisions.   The Bureau of Space Commerce created in this bill needs to use its  authority to the maximum extent possible to  [[Page H10567]]  promote, support, and approve private space missions.   Mr. Speaker, there is much work left to be done to bolster American  competitiveness and foster innovation, and I hope Congress will act  next year to continue our leadership in space.   With this hope and expectation, I support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I have no other requests for time on this side, so I am prepared to  yield back if the gentlewoman from Texas is prepared to yield back.   Before I do, I just want to thank the ranking member of the Science,  Space, and Technology Committee, Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas, who  is, obviously, a Texas colleague and a longtime friend, for all of her  good work on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee while I have  been chairman of that committee. She has been instrumental in our  taking to the House floor and having passed on the House floor 35  bills. Of those 35 bills, 33 have been bipartisan, and that is largely  due to her contributions and her efforts to try to make those bills  bipartisan.   So I do appreciate having worked with her for the last 6 years. I  wish her well next year, and I want to congratulate her on being the  next chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
