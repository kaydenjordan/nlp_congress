 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 5332.   I want to first thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his work on  this bill. I am disappointed we were not able to come to a bipartisan  compromise. We worked for the better part of a year to try to achieve a  good product that could broadly be supported. This product does not  represent that work, sadly. Unfortunately, we didn't get there.   I believe that we are considering, today, a bill that is just another  attempt for House Democrats to socialize the credit reporting and  scoring industry. We are voting on a bill that will decrease  competition, increase fraud, prop up the trial bar, and expand  authority of an already unaccountable CFPB, Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau.   First, this bill directs the three nationwide credit reporting  agencies to create a shared online portal. This portal will allow  unlimited and free consumer access to credit information--this is  good--and credit freezes. This is good and allows consumers to initiate  disputes.   That all sounds very good. In fact, Republicans support a one-stop  shop for consumers to access important credit information. But we are  talking about the three largest players in the industry, and this bill  codifies their place--their oligopoly structure and their favored view  of the current marketplace--and enshrines them further into law with  this outsized authority.   This bill condones their market structure by mandating that many of  their services be merged into a single web portal. This doesn't make  things better; it makes it worse.   If Congress really wants to protect consumers, we should be working  to promote more competition in the credit reporting and scoring  industry. We should be promoting new ways to eliminate barriers to  entry, not promoting what really comes down to less consumer choice.   Second, this bill requires the complete Social Security numbers be  used to confirm the consumer's identity. So here is the problem: The  bill fails to set appropriate standards to protect that information.  Specifically, the bill directs the credit reporting agencies to match  all nine digits of a consumer's Social Security number before including  any information in consumer credit reports.   That sounds well, fine, and good, but we know hacks happen. As  Federal employees, we have had our information hacked and sold. Just  look at the credit reporting agencies. They have had their information  hacked and sold. This is why we wanted to come to a bipartisan  compromise.   There is something legitimate we should be doing, but today, not all  data furnishers collect full Social Security numbers for submission for  consumer credit information to the credit bureaus. That means this bill  has a requirement now that they collect all the Social Security  information to confirm the consumer's identity. This will potentially  have two negative consequences for consumers.   First, data that is not already linked to that Social Security number  will be excluded from credit bureaus. That means, under this bill,  accurate information will be removed for no other reason than it is  missing the Social Security number.   This will actually decrease the predictive power of credit files.  That is a negative for consumers. That, in turn, will jeopardize the  ability to get low-cost credit for consumers, especially for those who  are on the margin where much of their information is derived by being a  consumer and paying back regular consumer debt.   Second, data furnishers will start aggressively capturing and storing  Social Security numbers for consumers just so the data can be used in  the credit models. That means that our Social Security number will be  in more places and identity theft can then increase with more  opportunities to steal our information. It means that consumers will be  further at peril for fraudulent activities by bad and malicious actors.    So committee Republicans have consistently expressed concern with the  private sector and government use of Social Security numbers for  identity verification. I think we should all agree on that. This bill  will only exacerbate the problem by statutorily directing an increase  in reliance on this very highly personal information.   Next, this bill creates an additional opportunity for trial lawyers  to exploit the litigation system, ultimately raising the cost of credit  for all consumers.   The bill expands the private right of action under the Fair Credit  Reporting Act to allow for injunctive relief. It further provides  plaintiffs with compensation for attorney fees, and more litigation  means increased costs associated with credit reporting.   Additionally, this bill allows consumers to continuously dispute  information even if the account is verified as accurate, promoting an  endless cycle of frivolous reinvestigations and decreasing the  effectiveness of credit reporting.   Lastly, this bill continues the Democrats' goal of expanding the  statutory authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or the  CFPB. The bill creates duplicative ombudsmen in the CFPB for credit  reporting, something that they currently have, but the person has more  than just consumer credit reporting responsibilities.   Since its creation, congressional Republicans have fought to place  this unaccountable government agency under the annual appropriations  process and have argued that the single-Director structure is  unconstitutional. That is being litigated and will be decided by the  Supreme Court this summer.   While the current CFPB Director is working to increase the  accountability and transparency at the agency, we don't know what the  next Director will do, if he or she will abuse his or her power. We  should fix the CFPB before we expand their authorities.                                time  1530    Madam Speaker, I also want to take issue with a larger set of issues  here.   The Democrats' decision to report out a closed rule means that you  can't even have the ultimate goal of a bipartisan bill that can then  get action in the Senate and then, potentially, get a signature by the  President.   This, too, is a sad sign of the state of affairs in what seems to be  a highly broken legislative process that we are in the midst of. It  further demonstrates my point that my colleagues, in particular, on the  other side of the aisle have no interest in working with Republicans to  craft a bill that protects consumers' personal information.   I submitted amendments to the Committee on Rules that provide for  targeted solutions:   Eliminating this reliance on Social Security numbers;   Removing paid non-elective debt from credit reports--which this bill  fails to do;   Allowing parents to electronically freeze their minor's credit  report--which this bill fails to do;   Requiring sources for public record data in credit reports, which  would then expand credit files so that those who are on the margins for  creditworthiness would have enhanced credit potentially;   Prohibit the inclusion of adverse information relating to predatory  mortgage lending;   Financial abuse or fraud associated with private student loans in  credit reports. This bill does not act;   And directing the GAO to study and report to Congress on the use of  nontraditional data and credit scoring, this is something that has  bipartisan support in our committee and has been reported out in other  measures, but not in this one.   And so those are sensible measures that could have been included if  we had  [[Page H2563]]  an open amendment process. But then, again, we are wearing masks, we  are conducting business in this odd way, where Members can vote for  other Members that are not here on the House floor and we have to go  through this whole long process. So I understand they have a need to  rush, right, but this is an ill-conceived bill that will have a  negative impact on every American--every American--if this is signed  into law.   Madam Speaker, I think we need better consideration and a better  product that could actually achieve a bipartisan outcome.   Let's vote ``no'' on this, and let's get on with the real work of the  American people.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I highlight for the bill's sponsor that  first with the Equifax data breach, it is proof that the industry could  use better data standards.   Second, making sure that they have the fullness of the Social  Security numbers only means that when they steal that information, they  also steal our full Social Security numbers so they can have full  action for fraudulent activity and identity testimony. That, we know,  and it should have been addressed in this bill, and it is a failure of  this legislation and the reason why I oppose it.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Loudermilk), the ranking member on the Task Force on Artificial  Intelligence.    Will the gentleman yield?    What I am highlighting is the fact that, in one section  of the bill, you have the study to say whether or not using Social  Security numbers is good or bad. I think that is good. That was  laudable.   The problem is, in another part of the bill, you mandate immediately  that they need the fullness of the Social Security numbers in order for  the data to be included. That is what I am highlighting, and that is  one of the rubs that I have with the bill.    Will the gentleman yield?    I commend Chairwoman Waters for bringing the three CEOs  in.    We, on a bipartisan basis, beat them up, which is a rare  thing in Congress. We beat them up because they had a massive data  breach that exposed our data. That is why I sincerely wanted to get to  the bottom of this and have a bipartisan bill.   This is not a result of this product.    For sure, for sure. That is why I want to get to a  solution. This bill, sadly, incorporates none of the conditionalities  that I wanted.    The point is, we could have had a massive vote on  something that reformed them rather than bring them in and wag our  finger again.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   What I would say, very simply, Madam Speaker, is that we could have  had a bipartisan solution here. That is what I was offering. Give up  the private right of action, so you don't have more lawsuits, and give  up your view of a government-centric portal that basically enshrines  these big three. Those are two additions.   The final kicker is this: End the reliance on Social Security numbers  and put the date in the future, and the technology solution will be  there. That is an industry mandate that I offered as a matter of  compromise.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Budd), my colleague from Davie County, North Carolina, a great  leader on the Financial Services Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Riggleman).    Madam Speaker, I think that since this is such a  critical issue, we should count up how many hearings we had in the  Financial Services Committee. We had one in February of 2019.   We could have gotten to the bottom of these things if we actually had  multiple hearings to figure this stuff out. Instead, we got a parsing  bill on the floor that doesn't achieve the things that we needed to  achieve.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Steil).    Madam Speaker, I do.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), the ranking member of the Investor Protection,  Entrepreneurship, and Capital Markets Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  to close.   Madam Speaker, as I said in my opening, this is yet another attempt  by House Democrats to socialize the credit reporting and scoring  industry.   We had an opportunity for a bipartisan bill, and this is not the work  of that product. This bill will decrease competition in the industry,  increase fraud risk related to consumers' personal data, prop up the  trial bar, and expand the authority of the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau.   If Congress really wants to protect consumers, we should be working  together promote more competition in the credit reporting and scoring  industry. We should be promoting new ways to eliminate the barriers to  entry, not promoting what really comes down to less consumer choice.   We marked up this bill in the Financial Services Committee back in  December. The committee Democrats noted in their report on the bill:  ``It has been more than 15 years since Congress enacted comprehensive  reform of the consumer credit reporting system, and there have been  numerous shortcomings with the current system identified during that  time that need to be addressed.''   Yet, since the Democrats took over in 2019, the House Financial  Services Committee has held one hearing on credit reporting. We had a  bipartisan consensus on the things that needed to be done and the  challenges therein. This hearing featured a public grilling of the CEOs  of the three nationwide bureaus. The hearing discussed structural  problems within the industry, yet this bill just solidifies that  structure.   The number one complaint in the CFPB consumer complaint database is  about consumer issues with credit reporting.   Why are we reinforcing the current structure of this industry by  legislating that? We should promote more competition in the system, not  perpetuate an obviously broken one.   The Democrats took issue with the market failure in credit reporting,  an issue we agree on. However, their legislative response does not do  the things necessary to increase competition and consumer choice and  protect our data.   The fact that Democrat leadership decided this bill was perfect and  needed no amendments demonstrates my point. My colleagues on the other  side of the aisle have no interest in working with Republicans to craft  a bill that will really protect consumers' personal information. This  bill is about catering to their stakeholders.   Madam Speaker, I will reiterate, like I have with so many bills that  have passed the House: This bill has no chance of being passed by the  Senate or signed into law.   Preserving access to and making available low-cost credit options to  consumers should be Congress' priority. We should be working toward  bipartisan solutions, and we should prioritize those things. We should  be working toward those solutions, and that is why I urge a ``no'' vote  on this bill.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record letters in opposition to this  bill by the Consumer Data Industry Association, the Credit Union  National Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American  Bankers Association, the National Taxpayers Union, and the Consumer  Bankers Association.                              Consumer Data Industry Association,                                      Washington, DC, June 17, 2020.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi, Speaker,      Hon. Kevin McCarthy, Republican Leader,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leader McCarthy: As the House       prepares to consider HR 5332, the Protecting Your Credit       Score Act of 2019, CDIA and its members wanted to take this       opportunity to express our opposition to the bill.        We believe that this bill will have negative impacts on the       American consumer. Over the last decade Congress has       prioritized the ``ability to repay'' as the most important       part of underwriting a financial product, to fight predatory       lending and ensure that consumers are not able to borrow more       than they can afford. This bill will make it harder  [[Page H2568]]       for lenders to determine whether a consumer has an ability to       repay, increase loan losses and ultimately result in higher       prices, especially for those who previously received the best       prices on loan products after a lifetime of on-time payments.        The bill: could make the cost of borrowing more expensive       and limit access to credit; could introduce new threats to       consumers' information and physical security; and introduces       unnecessary and expensive burdens into the credit reporting       system, making it harder for consumers disputes to be       processed in a timely fashion.        The bill could make the cost of borrowing more expensive       and limit access to credit.        Section 4 of the bill could lead to higher costs of credit       for the overall market, and specifically for consumers who       pay their bills on time every month. This section of the bill       would allow consumers who have not paid their bills on time       to continue disputing information, even if the account is       verified as accurate. This would increase the likelihood that       that accurate, though negative information, will be excluded       from credit scores, thereby impeding lenders from making       adequate risk decisions.        This bill could introduce new threats to consumers'       information and physical security.        Section 6 would require CRAs to effectively mail a credit       report to a consumer every time an adverse action occurs in a       credit transaction. If, for example, a consumer applies for a       mortgage and receives a rate higher than the lowest possible       rate due to the consumer's higher credit utilization rate,       then each credit bureau would have to physically mail a       report to the consumer, whether the consumer requested it or       not. And if the consumer applied to several mortgage       companies, the CRAs would have to mail the report to the       consumer's last known address each time. This would create       data security issues, as thousands of credit reports would be       sent, by mail, to people who didn't ask for them, don't want       them, or don't need them. Also, tens of millions of consumers       move each year, increasing the likelihood that credit reports       would fall into the hands of persons other than the intended       consumer. Consumers today can receive free credit reports as       often as every week and have additional opportunities to get       their credit report under certain circumstances. CRAs should       not be mailing millions of credit reports with very sensitive       information to people who did not ask for them.        Section 2 of the bill could also harm consumers' personal       physical security. This section includes language giving       consumers new rights to opt out of sales of non-credit report       information. The identity information that also appears in a       credit report is critical for companies that need to confirm       identity, alternate names, and previous addresses, such as       criminal-background screeners. The effect of this provision       would be to allow someone to hide their relevant criminal       history from employers, volunteer agencies or other users of       criminal history reports. For example, someone convicted of       elder or child abuse could simply move to a new jurisdiction,       opt out of non-credit report sales and apply for jobs with       nursing homes or child-care centers. Today, when someone like       this applies for a job and discloses neither their old       address nor the criminal conviction, the background screener       would purchase an address history from a credit bureau to       identify jurisdictions in which to search for records. While       this method is not fool proof, it is the industry standard       and results in detection rates comparable to fingerprinting       by the FBI. Without it, employers, volunteer agencies, youth       sports leagues and other legitimate users of background       screening would be at the mercy of any convicted criminal who       is willing to lie on an application.        The bill introduces unnecessary and expensive burdens into       the credit reporting system, making it harder for consumers       disputes to be processed in a timely fashion.        The addition of a new ``consumer portal,'' also in Section       2, would create an unnecessary new government-mandated       website for consumers when existing options for consumers       already exist. Consumers currently can visit any of the       websites of the nationwide CRAs and file a dispute, set a       security freeze and exercise other rights that are guaranteed       by the Fair Credit Reporting Act. This provision is       unnecessary and could create additional data security issues.        Consumers who pay their bills on time would also be the       ones most impacted by the bill's requirement for full nine-      digit Social Security Number (SSN) matching. The FTC studied       this matching topic in an exhaustive report directed by the       2003 FACT A Act, and found that matching nine digits of the       SSN is not a viable solution, as it would not result in       greater accuracy of credit reports, but it would lead to       fewer consumers being approved for credit. By denying CRAs       the ability to anticipate and fix transcription errors,       consumers could end up having multiple fragmentary credit       reports, each one tied to a given SSN. Then, when applying       for new credit, a lender will not be able to see the full       picture of the individual, meaning that the consumer who has       paid their bills on time every month won't receive the       benefit accrued during their many years of hard work. And       some consumers will find strangers' files associated with       their SSN, complicating the lending process. The Consumer       Financial Protection Bureau supervises and examines the       nationwide CRAs and has not raised this issue as a concern;       this section of the bill will harm, not help, consumers.        We would also note that Section 5 of the bill includes       injunctive relief that exposes users of credit reports to       private enforcement for consumer notices and red flags. This       would be a significant change in practice that would expose       lenders to new liabilities from the trial bar.        This bill was the subject of a great deal of negotiation       and discussion with Representative Gottheimer, the bill       sponsor, before the Financial Services Committee passed the       bill. We appreciate his spirit of cooperation, but       unfortunately the bill before the House falls short of its       goals to strengthen the consumer credit market and protect       consumer credit scores.            Sincerely,                                                 Francis Creighton,      President & CEO.                                   ____                                Credit Union National Association,                                                      June 24, 2020.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Republican Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leader McCarthy: On behalf of       America's credit unions, I am writing regarding H.R. 5332,       the Protecting Your Credit Score Act of 2019. The Credit       Union National Association (CUNA) represents America's credit       unions and their 115 million members.        Accurate and complete credit reports are essential to       credit unions providing safe and affordable financial       services to their members. Whereas credit unions' field of       membership restrictions were originally designed as a       mechanism for determining borrowers' credit worthiness, today       credit unions and other financial institutions rely on credit       reports and credit scores to assess credit worthiness and       inform lending decisions. It is in the interest of all       stakeholders in the lending process for borrowers' credit       reports to be accurate and complete.        H.R. 5332 would require credit reporting agencies to create       an online portal for consumers to access free credit reports       and credit scores, and dispute errors. It would also direct       the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to impose and       enforce data security safeguards for the credit reporting       agencies.        While the legislation may be well-intentioned, we oppose       H.R. 5332 because the expansion of private rights of action       and allowing courts to award injunctive relief could increase       the frequency of meritless lawsuits under the Federal Credit       Reporting Act (FCRA). When entities are subject to frivolous       litigation, resources are distracted from providing services,       increasing the cost of service to all consumers. In the case       of credit unions, frivolous litigation means that access to       safe and affordable financial services becomes more expensive       and potentially less available for credit union members.        We also have concerns that the online portal mandated under       this legislation would pose significant cybersecurity risks       for consumers, financial institutions, and companies. The       portal created would have no direct owner and require its own       authentication and security, leading to the possibility of       consumers either being rejected from the portal or a       nefarious actor abusing the system.        Finally, we question the need for this legislation. Under       the FCRA, consumers can dispute the accurateness of       information on their credit reports. They can either raise       the dispute directly with the credit reporting agency or with       their creditor. The FCRA requires these disputes to be       resolved in a timely manner and, if the disputed information       is incorrect, the information in question is eliminated from       the report. As such, consumers already have significant tools       to dispute information and correct errors in their credit       reports.        On behalf of America's credit unions, thank you for the       opportunity to share our views.            Sincerely,                                                        Jim Nussle,      President & CEO.                                   ____                                          Chamber of Commerce of the                                        United States of America,                                      Washington, DC, June 23, 2020.        To the Members of the U.S. House of Representatives: The       U.S. Chamber of Commerce opposes H.R. 5332, the ``Protecting       Your Credit Score Act of 2019.''        The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) requires each consumer       reporting agency (CRA) to achieve maximum possible accuracy       in compiling a consumer report. Every CRA also has a legal       obligation to safeguard the personal information that they       hold.        This legislation would require companies to jointly       establish an online consumer portal with its own       authentication and security, without a specific owner. This       portal would create significant cybersecurity vulnerabilities       for consumers and companies--making it impossible for CRAs to       meet existing obligations. Further, the authentication of the       portal could potentially expose credit reports to abusive       credit repair. If the authentication is tuned too high, then       real consumers would be rejected from the website. If       authentication is too loose, then it could be abused.        The Chamber supports efforts to streamline access to credit       data for consumers; however, it must be done in a responsible       way that does not prevent access to credit. While we       appreciate the extensive efforts of  [[Page H2569]]       Rep. Gottheimer to resolve our concerns, the Chamber remains       opposed.            Sincerely,      Neil L. Bradley.                                   ____                                     American Bankers Association,                                      Washington, DC, June 23, 2020.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader McCarthy: The       American Bankers Association writes to express our opposition       to H.R. 5332, the Protecting Your Credit Score Act of 2020,       scheduled for consideration before the House this week.        We share the sponsor's interest in ensuring that credit       reports are complete and accurate and that consumers have       appropriate protections, including rights to challenge and       have corrected any inaccuracies in their reports. Though the       legislation is well-intended, we believe it will make credit       reports less predictive and useful by promoting the       elimination of negative but accurate information that will       weaken the underwriting process and thus increase borrowers'       costs and reduce people's ability to get loans. In addition,       allowing courts to award injunctive relief will promote       questionable lawsuits and replace the current single-      interpretation regime with inconsistent interpretations that       vary across the country.        The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) currently provides       consumers strong dispute rights to challenge the accuracy of       information in their reports--rights that are enforced       through supervision, government agency enforcement actions,       and civil lawsuits. Consumers may submit claims to either the       consumer reporting agency or directly to the furnisher of the       information. Disputes must be investigated and resolved       promptly. If not, the information is deleted. Thus, consumers       have ample legal means to challenge the accuracy of       information in their credit reports.        We are concerned about the abuse of these protective       provisions to remove accurate but negative information, not       only by credit repair organizations and those hoping to erase       accurate negative information from their report to improve       their ability to obtain credit, but also by individuals,       including those involved in organized crime, seeking to       defraud lenders.        H.R. 5332 will make it even easier than it is today for       individuals to flood consumer reporting agencies and       furnishers of information with false claims of inaccuracies       that must be resolved in a timely fashion or deleted. The       resulting degradation of the reports will reduce the ability       of lenders to evaluate an applicant's creditworthiness and       ability to repay, which in turn will increase what consumers       pay for credit and make it harder for many consumers,       especially the underserved, to get credit. Moreover,       resources and money spent to manage the increased volume of       false claims are better spent resolving legitimate disputes.        The bill will further undermine the consumer reporting       system by expanding private rights of action against users of       credit reports and by creating uncertainty about how banks       and others must comply with the FCRA. Allowing courts to       award injunctive relief means that multiple courts can       interpret this complicated statute differently from the       Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the primary agency       tasked with interpreting and enforcing FCRA. The result will       be a patchwork of inconsistent interpretations, uncertainty       about how to comply, and lawsuits of questionable merit.        While we appreciate Representative Gottheimer's efforts and       welcome discussion on these issues, we must oppose H.R. 5332       as currently crafted.            Sincerely,      James C. Ballentine.                                   ____                                         National Taxpayers Union,                                      Washington. DC, June 26, 2020.        The National Taxpayers Union urges Representatives to vote       ``NO'' on H.R. 5332, the ``Protecting Your Credit Score Act       of 2020.'' Though well-intentioned, this legislation would       cede more power to the unaccountable Consumer Financial       Protection Bureau, jeopardize consumer information, and       potentially weaken lending underwriting standards.        Accurate and complete credit reports are the foundation of       this country's robust and competitive consumer credit market.       Most, if not all, lenders rely upon credit history data found       in credit reports to identify and evaluate potential risks a       consumer may pose before entering into a financial       relationship with that consumer. That information is critical       for lenders to evaluate the applicant's ability to repay,       interest rates, and other loan terms. Since many home loan       borrowers will have their mortgage guaranteed by the federal       government, lawmakers must be cautious in their reforms to       the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) to avoid adding undue       credit risk onto the government-sponsored enterprises'       balance sheets.        Perhaps the most problematic provision of H.R. 5332 is the       requirement for the three major credit bureaus, which are       entirely private businesses, to jointly create an online       consumer portal for consumers to access their credit reports       and scores, dispute errors, and place or lift security       freezes. While a one-stop shop may seem to offer consumer       benefits, having one location containing every credit report,       personal information, and social security number of every       individual could have disastrous consequences in the event of       a cyber hack or data breach.        Secondly, this legislation provides no legal protection to       these entities in the event of a large scale cyber breach,       leaving these businesses vulnerable to big class-action       lawsuits. H.R. 5332 also changes how consumers dispute       adverse information found in their credit reports, allowing       individuals to flood reporting agencies and lenders with       false claims of inaccuracies that must be resolved in a       timely manner. Ultimately, this proposal shifts the burden on       dispute resolution from the individual onto the credit       bureaus.        Additionally, this bill establishes a second, duplicative       ombudsman at the CFPB who will have sole control over credit       reporting. The ombudsperson would have to help resolve       persistent errors in credit reports that aren't addressed in       a timely manner, and make referrals for supervisory or       enforcement actions against credit reporting companies. This       situation sets up a new opportunity for the CFPB to       specifically target certain companies that may become       ``unsavory'' and be subject to political targeting.        NTU also questions the need for such legislation, as the       FCRA currently provides consumers ample opportunity to       dispute inaccurate information on their credit reports. The       FCRA already requires these disputes to be resolved in a       timely manner and, if the disputed information is incorrect,       the information in question is eliminated from a report. In       essence, this legislation does not bring any new meaningful       benefits to the credit reporting process.        Roll call votes on H.R. 5332 will be included in NTU's       annual Rating of Congress and a ``NO'' vote will be       considered the pro-taxpayer position. If you have any       questions, please contact NTU Policy and Government Affairs       Manager, Thomas Aiello.                                   ____                                     Consumer Bankers Association,                                      Washington, DC, June 25, 2020.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker of the House,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      House Minority Leader,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leader McCarthy: On behalf of the       Consumer Bankers Association (CBA), I am writing to share our       views on H.R. 5332, the Protecting Your Credit Score Act of       2019. CBA is the voice of the retail banking industry whose       products and services provide access to credit for consumers       and small businesses. Our members operate in all 50 states,       serve more than 150 million Americans, and collectively hold       two-thirds of the country's total depository assets.        CBA opposes the Protecting Your Credit Score Act of 2019.       Section 5 of the bill, ``Injunctive Relief for Victims,'' is       especially concerning because it undermines the CFPB and       Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) primary authority to enforce       the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) in a manner consistent       with maintaining a nationwide credit reporting system that       benefits businesses and consumers. Congress enacted FCRA in       1970 with emphasis on ensuring fairness, accuracy, and       efficiency within the banking system, and in doing so       specifically protected federal regulators' sole authority to       pursue injunctive relief for violations, to avoid any       possibility of multiple courts issuing conflicting orders.       Undoing this deliberate design is unnecessary given the       serious fines and other existing penalties already in place       under the FCRA and court disrupt credit markets without any       positive impact on consumer credit reports. As depository       institutions supervised by prudential federal regulators with       deep expertise and experience in financial markets, CBA       members are concerned with the potential for unlimited       injunctive authority to impair nationwide financial systems.        CBA is also troubled by Section 4, ``Improved Dispute       Process for Consumer Reporting Agencies.'' The CFPB already       has authority to enforce fines for FCRA violations, and this       proposal would complicate existing cost effective and       efficient processes furnishers are mandated to use under       federal law to distinguish false or illegitimate disputes       from actual consumer problems that should draw focus and       proper inquiry. Safety and soundness considerations require       the highest standards for complete and accurate consumer       information in the underwriting process. Modifying or       deleting disagreeable, but accurate consumer information from       any report without proper input from furnishers will       interfere with prudent risk assessments and raise costs for       all consumers.        Furthermore, the ``Bureau Credit Reporting Ombudsman'' as       written under this section has seemingly unrestrained       individual authority that could make determinations on a       consumer's credit profile without the due process or appeal       mechanisms generally required under the Administrative       Procedure Act (APA). This unilateral decision-making       authority would have a serious and negative impact on a       bank's ability to determine risk and extend affordable       credit.        Thank you for your consideration of our views. CBA remains       eager to assist your efforts at improving outcomes for all       borrowers.            Sincerely,                                                      Richard Hunt,                                                 President and CEO.    Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H2570]]         Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume, and I rise in opposition to the resolution.   Madam Speaker, as I said, I rise in opposition to this resolution.  First, before I get into the contents of my discussion here, I want to  thank Chairwoman Waters for her steadfast and long-time leadership in  supporting minority, rural, low- and middle-income communities, LMI  communities. Her service in the California Assembly and Senate and  Congress has been commensurate with that work and that focus.   Committee Republicans share the chairwoman's goal of strengthening  [[Page H2572]]  these communities. For example, we know that community development  financial institutions and minority depository institutions play  critical roles in getting necessary funds to the smallest of small  businesses in these communities.   Committee Republicans support the efforts of the Paycheck Protection  Program to target small lenders as well as small businesses in  communities across America.   Committee Republicans believe the reforms made in the underlying  final rule promulgated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency  will continue to support minority, rural, and LMI communities into the  21st century.   Madam Speaker, the Community Reinvestment Act was enacted in 1977,  nearly 43 years ago. Its purpose was to ensure depository institutions  like banks and savings associations help meet the needs of their local  communities. The law tasks the OCC, as well as the other bank  regulators, with issuing rules to carry out that purpose. However, the  last time the CRA regulations were meaningfully updated was in 1995.   I think we can all agree that a lot has changed in the past 25 years,  including how banks can best serve their communities. Much of this  change has been driven by technology and innovation.   In 1995, it was cutting edge when you could call your bank and get  your balance and the last couple of checks that cleared your account.  Calling up and not having to talk with somebody and a computer tell you  the answer, that was cutting edge. And at that time, only 24 percent of  Americans had accessed the internet.   Since that time, we have witnessed a massive shift to online and  mobile delivery of banking services, and that is for good in many, many  ways. This virus has really enhanced that trend just in the last few  months. This means that where banks get their deposits doesn't  necessarily match up with where their branches are physically located.   Second, the number of bank branches has steadily declined since the  financial crisis, but the CRA regulations continue to place a very  heavy emphasis on banks' physical footprints rather than where they  truly serve.   At the same time, CRA exams have gotten more complex and less  transparent. Banks can only guess which of their community investments  will receive credit, because the exams are quite highly subjective. The  written evaluations can be thousands of pages long, and yet the  regulators and the public have no clear data to help understand where  all the CRA money has gone.   But there are, sadly, a few things that have not changed in the last  25 years--sadly--including socioeconomic conditions in the poorest  communities, economic opportunity, and the persistent lack of capital  in those communities. The CRA is intended to help address those issues,  and that is why it is a vital and important law and, properly  structured, can deliver in a better way.   But, clearly, we know the status quo is not working. It is not  working for the communities that we care desperately about giving  opportunity to, economic opportunity to, and that is really what this  is driven towards with this law.   Modernizing this regulatory framework is long overdue. Here are a few  aspects of the rule that I believe represent major improvements over  the old regulations.   First, the rule provides for a public list of activities that will  count for CRA credit so the community can understand, the banks can  understand, and we, as elected officials who have oversight of this  program, we can understand, too. And they will have that public list on  what counts for CRA credit.   This list will eliminate regulatory ambiguity and provide certainty  over the types of investments that will lead to a good evaluation. With  more certainly, banks will naturally make more investments. That is how  capitalism works. This change alone is likely to increase community  reinvestment across the board.   Second, the rule provides a better model for where the activity can  count. Banks will be incentivized to invest where they take deposits  instead of only around their branches. Let me explain.   Previously, a bank was only evaluated on its lending and investment  in an area around its physical footprint, but banking today is very  different than it was a generation ago when this regulation was  written. Banking today, with the help of new technology and innovation  has changed substantially. So, if an online bank chooses a headquarters  in one State--let me give you an example: Utah.   Utah has a lot of online banks and they domicile in Salt Lake City,  so that is where the community giving is around Salt Lake City, even if  they take most of their deposits from Chairwoman Waters' district or my  district. So, if you have that headquarters for an online bank, it  should not prevent them from making investments in other States or  localities that desperately need capital.   Under the final rule, banks will get credit for investing in so- called banking deserts. This has been a priority of mine for the last  decade, to help those who are in communities where they can't get ready  access. We know food deserts in urban areas, and if you can't get  access to fresh food, you can't have a healthy diet.                                time  1630    That is a huge issue. It is a huge issue in rural areas, it is a huge  issue in urban areas.   So we have banking deserts now, and this rule prioritizes those  banking deserts that don't have a branch or don't have many branches.  And those underserved places under this rule are distressed areas,  economically distressed areas, Tribal lands, folks that have been hit  by natural disasters, regardless of where they get deposits or if they  get deposits from those areas. I think there are some laudable changes.   Now communities without bank branches that were essentially invisible  under the current framework will be able to receive CRA investment.  This is a huge improvement.   Finally, the rule introduces objective metrics and transparent  evaluations. I think that is a really good thing for regulation.  Instead of a highly subjective exam and a 1,000-page evaluation,  examiners will be able to deliver more consistent, useful, and timely  CRA evaluations; ``timely'' meaning more frequent and more readily  available.   Clearer metrics and better reporting will enable banks, regulators,  and the public to have a better understanding of the CRA activities of  individual banks and of cross-sections of the industry. Consumers will  be able to see that and understand the type of institution they are  banking with as well.   I would also note that this final rule is a culmination of a  multiyear process. It reflects more than a decade of dialogue about how  to make the CRA work better, it builds on recommendations that Federal  banking agencies submitted to Congress in 2017 and recommendations  released by the Treasury Department in April of 2018 and more than 75  hard comments submitted during the rulemaking process that updated and  changed and made better the regulations that the administration put  forward.   Republicans and Democrats agree the Community Reinvestment Act is  extremely important, it is an important law. And because it is  important, the regulations need to keep pace with how Americans bank  today.   I believe this rule is a huge improvement over the status quo.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this resolution  and support the underlying rule.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Tipton), a great member from the Financial Services  Committee who also is the vice chair of the Western Caucus.     Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), my friend and the ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Investor Protection, Entrepreneurship, and Capital  Markets.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Michigan an  additional 1 minute.    Madam Speaker, I would just note for the Record that the  FDIC approved just this week this rule, the CRA, so that is, in fact,  they actually support this underlying rule.   Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Little Rock,  Arkansas (Mr. Hill), my colleague and friend, the ranking member of the  National Security, International Development and Monetary Policy  Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Janesville, Wisconsin (Mr. Steil).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close.   May I inquire if there are further speakers on the majority side.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   So, in closing, the Community Reinvestment Act, we agree, is an  important law that is intended to support underserved communities  across America. Maintaining the status quo also ignores the innovation  and the needs of our community.   The innovations taking place to financial services and to banking  over the last 25 years need to be addressed, but also the fact that we  are not actually meeting the needs desperately needed in communities  around our district, both the urban and rural.   The new regulations will increase investment and capital in  communities and provide more clarity and transparency to all parties  involved in the process. That is why it is a good update.   As we work to ensure a strong economic recovery for all Americans, it  is critical we encourage financial institutions to continue to provide  services for those most in need. The OCC's final rule will play an  important role in this recovery effort by encouraging more capital,  investment, and lending services in the communities hardest hid by  COVID-19. That is good.   The OCC took a very thoughtful approach, embracing input from other  agencies and stakeholders over the course of several years. The final  rule builds in nearly all of the constructive criticism the agency has  received through the open comment process. In fact, this shows the  agency is willing to compromise but not willing to settle for the  status quo.   The OCC's modernization of the CRA regulation is a long overdue  update that will help our communities come into the 21st century  stronger and healthier. The last time these regulations were revised  was in 1995, when banking received most of their deposits through  branches, and as such, the old regulations that are on the books still  rely heavily on branch locations.    Quite frankly, what we have seen over the last 100 days in America is  that branches are less vital than they were in previous generations,  because most of these branches have been shut down in our States  because our States are trying to do the right thing to address this  health crisis. That is why we are wearing masks, that is why we are  social distancing, and that is why we are trying to be responsible to  one another and be thoughtful in our approach to one another.   But, unfortunately, this bill before us is a very straightforward up- and-down. I will say let's not support the status quo. Let's support  innovation and an update to our regulation to meet the needs of our  communities and to meet the needs that are so desperately needed both  in the rural communities and the urban communities in America.   Vote against this resolution and support the underlying rule.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Will the gentlewoman yield?    I misspoke. I said they supported the CRA.
