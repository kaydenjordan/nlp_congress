 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 8956) to amend chapter 36 of title  44, United States Code, to improve the cybersecurity of the Federal  Government, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 8956         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``FedRAMP Authorization Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Ensuring that the Federal Government can securely       leverage cloud computing products and services is key to       expediting the modernization of legacy information technology       systems, increasing cybersecurity within and across       departments and agencies, and supporting the continued       leadership of the United States in technology innovation and       job creation.        (2) According to independent analysis, as of calendar year       2019, the size of the cloud computing market had tripled       since 2004, enabling more than 2,000,000 jobs and adding more       than $200,000,000,000 to the gross domestic product of the       United States.        (3) The Federal Government, across multiple presidential       administrations and Congresses, has continued to support the       ability of agencies to move to the cloud, including through--        (A) President Barack Obama's ``Cloud First Strategy'';        (B) President Donald Trump's ``Cloud Smart Strategy'';        (C) the prioritization of cloud security in Executive Order       14028 (86 Fed. Reg. 26633; relating to improving the nation's       cybersecurity), which was issued by President Joe Biden; and        (D) more than a decade of appropriations and authorization       legislation that provides agencies with relevant authorities       and appropriations to modernize on-premises information       technology systems and more readily adopt cloud computing       products and services.        (4) Since it was created in 2011, the Federal Risk and       Authorization Management Program (referred to in this section       as ``FedRAMP'') at the General Services Administration has       made steady and sustained improvements in supporting the       secure authorization and reuse of cloud computing products       and services within the Federal Government, including by       reducing the costs and burdens on both agencies and cloud       companies to quickly and securely enter the Federal market.        (5) According to data from the General Services       Administration, as of the end of fiscal year 2021, there were       239 cloud providers with FedRAMP authorizations, and those       authorizations had been reused more than 2,700 times across       various agencies.        (6) Providing a legislative framework for FedRAMP and new       authorities to the General Services Administration, the       Office of Management and Budget, and Federal agencies will--        (A) improve the speed at which new cloud computing products       and services can be securely authorized;        (B) enhance the ability of agencies to effectively evaluate       FedRAMP authorized providers for reuse;        (C) reduce the costs and burdens to cloud providers seeking       a FedRAMP authorization; and        (D) provide for more robust transparency and dialogue       between industry and the Federal Government to drive stronger       adoption of secure cloud capabilities, create jobs, and       reduce wasteful legacy information technology.

MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise  and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the measure  before us.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Connolly, the chairman of the  Subcommittee on Government Operations, and Ranking Member Comer for  working on this important bipartisan measure.   A version of this bill passed this House earlier in this Congress. It  has been improved after receiving technical assistance from the General  Services Administration and through discussions with the Senate  Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.   The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program Authorization  Act would codify and improve the existing FedRAMP program in the  General Services Administration.   First established in 2011, FedRAMP is an important program that  certifies cloud service providers that wish to offer services and  products to the Federal Government.   The FedRAMP certification process outlined in this bill is  comprehensive, facilitates easier agency adoption, promotes agency  reuse, and encourages savings.   The FedRAMP process uses a risk-based approach to ensure the  reliability of any cloud platform that hosts unclassified government  data.                                time  1445    One significant provision of this bill is the Federal Secure Cloud  Advisory Committee. This committee would be tasked with key  responsibilities, including providing technical expertise on cloud  products and services and identifying ways to reduce costs associated  with FedRAMP certification.   The Director of the Office of Management and Budget would be required  to issue regulations on FedRAMP and would ensure that agencies are not  using cloud service providers without authorization.   This bill supports a critical effort to keep our Nation's information  secure in cloud environments. I urge all Members to support this bill  and reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes  to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly), the distinguished  chairman of the Subcommittee on Government Operations and sponsor of  this important bill, H.R. 8956.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time to close.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 8956 and yield back the balance  of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 8466), to require the head of each  agency to establish a plan relating to the safety of Federal employees  and contractors physically present at certain worksites during a  nationwide public health emergency declared for an infectious disease,  and for other purposes, as amended.

The plan must include protocols to ensure workers have access to  protective equipment, clean facilities, limited workspace occupancy,  and on-site testing; that they are notified about exposures; and that  accommodations are available to high-risk individuals.   Federal workers showed great resilience as the Federal Government  adapted to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Living through the  pandemic for more than 2 years should make it clear that we need to  take precautions to prepare for the future, as COVID-19 is not the last  public health emergency we are likely to face as a country, and  government agencies need to be ready for that.   The plans required under this legislation would protect workers and  prevent the spread of disease. The agency must also prioritize in its  plan the continuity of operations and government services through a  public health emergency. The bill requires that safety protocols are  clearly communicated to all employees and publicly posted.   Holding agencies accountable for making these plans transparent to  Federal employees and the public will help make everyone feel safer and  better informed.   The bill also includes strong oversight measures. Inspectors general  at Federal agencies would assess implementation of these plans and  report to Congress.                                time  1500    The Government Accountability Office would conduct a study of the  lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic that can be applied to improve  agency plans and improve communication with employees throughout an  emergency.   I commend Chairman Connolly for his forward-looking bill that would  better prepare government agencies for future public health crises. I  urge my colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 8466.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes  to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly), the distinguished  chairman of the Subcommittee on Government Operations and sponsor of  H.R. 8466.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to  close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of  H.R. 8466, and I yield back the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and pass the bill (S. 3470) to provide for the implementation  of certain trafficking in contracting provisions, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 3470         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``End Human Trafficking in       Government Contracts Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. IMPLEMENTATION OF TRAFFICKING IN CONTRACTING                     PROVISIONS.         (a) Requirement To Refer Violations to Agency Suspension       and Debarment Official.--Section 1704(c)(1) of the National       Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (Public Law       112-239; 22 U.S.C. 7104b(c)(1)) is amended--        (1) by inserting ``refer the matter to the agency       suspension and debarment official and'' before ``consider       taking one of the following actions''; and        (2) by striking subparagraph (G).        (b) Report on Implementation of Trafficking in Contracting       Provisions.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Director of the Office of       Management and Budget shall submit to Congress a report on       implementation of title XVII of the National Defense       Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (Public Law 112-239;       126 Stat. 2092).     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and insert extraneous material on S. 3470.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 3470, the End Human Trafficking  in Government Contracts Act.   S. 3470 was introduced by Senator Lankford from Oklahoma and has  passed the Senate by unanimous consent. The bill would require the head  of an agency to make a referral for debarment of a Federal contractor  in response to Inspector General verification that the company has  engaged in any form of human trafficking, including labor and sex  trafficking.   Under current law, the referral is merely an action that the agency  head may consider. Putting stronger penalties on contractors creates  stronger incentives for them to be vigilant about eliminating human  trafficking from their business. This bill helps to ensure that we use  the U.S. Government's enormous purchasing power to combat human  trafficking.   Under this bill, the Office of Management and Budget would also  submit a report to Congress on Federal Government actions to end  trafficking in Federal contracts. Human trafficking is nothing short of  modern-day slavery. It is estimated that human trafficking is a $150  billion global industry. It must be a priority to ensure that the U.S.  is not contributing one dollar to perpetuate human trafficking through  Federal contracts.   Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this  straightforward legislation to further enforce zero tolerance for human  trafficking in Federal contracts.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I have no further  speakers on this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, combating sex  trafficking by any means, in this case with using the power of our  contracting system, is truly a bipartisan effort in this committee.   Mr. Speaker, I support and urge passage of this bill, S. 3470.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and pass the bill (S. 2551), to require the Director of the  Office of Management and Budget to establish or otherwise provide an  artificial intelligence training program for the acquisition workforce,  and for other purposes.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2551, the Artificial  Intelligence Training for the Acquisition Workforce Act, sponsored by  Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman  Peters and Ranking Member Portman. I am proud to have introduced the  House companion to this bill with Ranking Member Comer.   The AI Training Act would require the Office of Management and  Budget, in coordination with the General Services Administration, to  develop and implement an AI training program for Federal workers whose  jobs involve this technology, including acquisition and program  management employees.   The program would educate employees on the science underlying AI,  introductory concepts, potential benefits of the technology, and future  trends. Importantly, the program would also cover the risks posed by  AI, including discrimination and risks to privacy, and would teach  Federal workers how to mitigate these risks.   To ensure that the AI technology procured and employed by the U.S.  Government is reliable, safe, and trustworthy, it is critical that  Federal workers involved in procurement and management of this  technology are well-trained.   AI tools have become essential in the global race to solve societal  challenges, protect national security, and remain economically  competitive. At the same time, the algorithms that drive AI systems  present new challenges to oversight and accountability efforts. So we  need proactive approaches to ensure transparency and governance that  preserves privacy and civil liberties and protects the public interest.   The training program would be updated at least every 2 years,  ensuring it keeps up with the rapid evolution of this field.   I thank Ranking Member Comer for joining me in advancing this  legislation to require specialized Federal workforce training in AI  that will help ensure the responsible acquisition and use of this  technology that will have long-term benefits to the Government.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support S. 2551, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I have no further  speakers on this side, and if the gentleman is prepared to close, then  I am also prepared to close.    MALONEY of New York.

MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and insert extraneous material on H.R. 6967.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6967, the Chance to Compete  Act.   The bipartisan Chance to Compete Act was introduced by Representative  Hice along with Representatives Khanna, Foxx, and Mfume.  Representatives Mace and Subcommittee Chairman Connolly later joined  the bill, as well.   This bill aims to make evaluations more useful in assessing the  skills of candidates for Federal positions and alleviate inefficiencies  that have long hindered the hiring process.   The bill turns away from the current reliance on self-assessment and  attainment of an educational degree to determine candidate  qualifications in the Federal hiring process. Instead, subject matter  experts in agencies would design assessments that test knowledge  specific to a position for which the agency is hiring.   This overhaul to the assessment method would better match qualified  applicants with positions and expand employment opportunities to  candidates with more diverse professional and educational backgrounds.   The Chance to Compete Act aligns with the Office of Personnel  Management's guidance released in May to facilitate an executive order  to modernize the process of assessing and hiring Federal job  candidates. Establishing hiring methods that are more skills-based will  improve agency managers' ability to hire people who possess the  knowledge and experience to do the job and to hire from a wider array  of qualified applicants.   The bill also directs the Office of Personnel Management to create an  online platform for sharing candidate assessments between agencies and  maintain a portal for hiring managers to find candidates who have  already demonstrated their qualifications for certain positions but  were not hired.   Under this legislation, agencies may assemble talent teams to support  this assessment of job candidates and the hiring process.   The OPM director would be required to submit annual progress reports  to Congress on the use of the skills-based assessments. After 5 years,  the Government Accountability Office would conduct a study of the  implementation of the Federal job assessment reforms and their impact  on the Federal hiring process.   This bill streamlines the hiring process for Federal agencies and  shortens the time it takes to bring new, well-qualified employees on  board.   The Senate companion to this bill, introduced by Senator Sinema, also  enjoys bipartisan support.   I thank Representative Hice for his leadership in introducing this  bill that is the result of constructive collaboration by several  members of our committee from both sides of the aisle.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting it,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the  balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of  H.R. 6967, and I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6967, the Chance to Compete  Act.   This bill is a good first step in reforming how we find and hire  talent to the federal civil service and removes barriers that prevent  agencies from recruiting the best talent.   The bill specifically eliminates antiquated hiring assessment tools,  improves federal agencies' hiring process, and allows qualified  applicants to compete for open positions across government. This bill  will move government away from a focus on academic parchment to a  prioritization on skills and expertise.   I'm proud to be a cosponsor of this bill, introduced by my Ranking  Member Jody Hice and my Oversight colleague Ro Khanna.   The bill came to us from the Senate, less than perfect and opposed by  the Administration.   But parties across both chambers worked together to draft an updated  version of the bill that incorporates important feedback from the  Office of Personnel Management and the Office of Management and Budget.   As currently drafted, the bill would:   Redefine competitive-service hiring applicant assessments to help  agencies focus on candidates who can perform on the job.   Put subject-matter experts at the helm of hiring, empowering those  who can best distinguish practical performers from the field of  candidates.   Require OPM to begin a review of all federal ``duties'' that require  an educational achievement level for hiring purposes, and then  instructs OPM to make available online the data.   Clarify to agencies, Congress, and the public why some positions,  like a doctor at the Department of Veterans Affairs, must have an  advanced degree, while a cybersecurity expert at the Department of  Homeland Security would benefit from a seasoned specialist, trained  from the field.   Authorize ``talent teams'' in agency human resources offices-- ensuring each agency has a key group of staff focused on improving  federal hiring.   I thank Ranking Member Hice for working with me to improve this bill  and ensure it is policy that all stakeholders, including the  Administration and our union partners, believe will improve how we find  and recruit talent to the federal government.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6267) to designate the facility of  the United States Postal Service located at 15 Chestnut Street in  Suffern, New York, as the ``Sergeant Gerald T. `Jerry' Donnellan Post  Office''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise  and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this  measure.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support today of H.R. 6267, authored by my  good friend and colleague from the great State of New York.   This bill will designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 15 Chestnut Street in Suffern, New York, as the  Sergeant Gerald T. ``Jerry'' Donnellan Post Office.   Sergeant Donnellan was born on December 18, 1946, in Nyack, New York,  as the youngest of five children. He graduated from Albertus Magnus  High School and went on to major in English at Rockland Community  College and Texas A&M University.   During the height of the Vietnam war, Sergeant Donnellan was drafted  into the Army and began his basic training at Fort Gordon in Georgia.  After several months, he was deployed to Vietnam.   On the front lines, Sergeant Donnellan sustained life-threatening  injuries after an enemy grenade exploded in front of him. While in  recovery at Valley Forge, he received the Purple Heart.   After recovery, Sergeant Donnellan worked in the Veterans Service  Agency office of Rockland County as commissioner of veterans affairs  until his retirement in January 2018.   During his tenure, he created the local Chapter 333 of the Vietnam  Veterans of America, started a veterans' health clinic, helped create  Camp Shanks Museum in Orangetown, established the Rockland County  Buffalo Soldiers Award to recognize the contributions of African- American veterans, and established the Rockland County Public Service  Medal to honor those who served in Afghanistan, Iraq, and the global  war on terror.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring Sergeant  Donnellan, a Purple Heart recipient, by naming the post office after  him.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time  as he may consume to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jones), the  distinguished vice chair of the Committee on the Judiciary's  Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Internet.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I commend my  colleague and friend, Mondaire Jones, for his leadership on this bill  and so many other areas here in Congress. He certainly deserves this  name-changing for the post office there.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 6267, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6080) to designate the facility of  the United States Postal Service located at 5420 Kavanaugh Boulevard in  Little Rock, Arkansas, as the ``Ronald A. Robinson Post Office''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6080         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6080 to designate the  facility of the U.S. Postal Service located at 5420 Kavanaugh Boulevard  in Little Rock, Arkansas, as the Ronald A. Robinson Post Office.   Mr. Robinson was a graduate of the University of Arkansas at  Fayetteville, where he earned a bachelor's degree in journalism. He  went on to study public relations at Boston University's Graduate  School of Public Communications.   He served in the U.S. Air Force as a captain and was awarded a Bronze  Star in Vietnam. He also received the Air Force Commendation Medal in  1969 for his support of the Apollo 11 mission to the Moon.   Mr. Robinson, in 1970, joined the marketing and communications firm  Cranford Johnson Robinson Woods. After 26 years, he retired from the  firm as its chief executive officer. During his tenure, the firm became  the largest advertising agency in Arkansas, with notable business and  political clients.   In 1993, he was appointed to the U.S. Postal Service's Citizens'  Stamp Advisory Committee by the U.S. Postmaster General. In 2005, Mr.  Robinson was named chairman of that committee. During his 15 years  serving on the committee, Mr. Robinson was involved in the creation and  production of more than 1,750 postage stamp issues.   He used his influence to highlight Arkansas in several of the newly  issued postage stamps.
