 Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support the Reducing  Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017. This bill would restore congressional  intent regarding the relationship between FIFRA and the Clean Water  Act.   Historically, Congress has viewed FIFRA as sufficient to protect  human health and the environment. Until the early part of the past  decade, even the EPA interpreted its responsibilities related to  pesticide use as compliance with FIFRA would reduce the need for  duplicative permitting under the Clean Water Act. If pesticides were  used according to their regulation under FIFRA, then permits for  pesticide application under the Clean Water Act were unnecessary.   Unfortunately, this historic interpretation has been overturned by  activist litigation. In 2009, a decision by the Sixth Circuit Court of  Appeals upended the historic interpretation of the space between these  two laws. The Sixth Circuit order created a new permitting requirement  that provides no additional environmental or public health protection.   The goal of this legislation has been to address only those problems  created by the Sixth Circuit decision and to be consistent with  congressional intent and the EPA's long-held interpretation. It is a  commonsense solution to a court-imposed regulatory burden that Congress  never intended to be applied. I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.
