 Madam Speaker, I stand here today because the  [[Page H4256]]  United States Postal Service is under attack by the current  administration.   This is an assault on our democracy and our economy, and it is  hurting Americans across the country. It is hurting the veteran in my  district from Pasadena, Texas, who receives his medications from the VA  through the mail and who is now worried about what will happen to him  if his medications get delayed.   It is hurting my neighbor from Lindale Park who cares for her elderly  mother and didn't receive her Social Security check in the mail on  time, further stressing her financial situation and leaving her unable  to pay her mother's utilities.   And it is hurting the small businesses in my neighborhood in the  Houston region, already crippled by this pandemic, that depend on the  Postal Service to mail out payments and products.   Madam Speaker, we cannot stand by as people are hurting. The Postal  Service delivers money, medicines, merchandise, and, yes, mail-in  ballots.   Madam Speaker, we must keep the Postal Service running. People are  hurting.                            ____________________
