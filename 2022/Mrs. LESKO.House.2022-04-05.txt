 Mr. Speaker, we are at a crisis in America. We are at a  crisis in Arizona. The Biden administration and the Democrats have done  everything in their power to open the southern border.   On day one, President Biden stopped funding for the border wall.  Then, he took away all the good policies that the Trump administration  had put in place, and now he is taking away the very last tool that we  have to have some kind of semblance of border security at our southern  border. He is taking away title 42.   I have spoken to both Border Patrol counsel, and I have spoken this  morning to Secretary Mayorkas. We are going to see an even bigger flood  of illegal immigrants crossing our border.   The border is totally out of control, flooding our districts with  drugs, flooding our districts with people who have been charged with  criminal activity in the past, sex slavery.   Please, President Biden, secure the border now.                            ____________________
