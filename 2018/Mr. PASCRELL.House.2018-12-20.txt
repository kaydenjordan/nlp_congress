 Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today did not go  through committee like a bill this large should. We could have offered  amendments to address some of the most pressing issues with this tax  bill.   I would have started with how this bill cherry-picks winners and  losers, with many of the losers being in States like the State I live  in, the State of New Jersey.   This is, again, let me repeat, ``Weekend at Bernie's.'' They prop up  the dead tax bill, make it look alive, and then they bring in something  that makes it look even more dead.   That didn't work; this will not work. You didn't run on it; you will  not run on this.                                time  1615    Our State got slammed by the new cap on the State and local tax  deduction, better known as SALT, State and local taxes, the oldest  deduction in the books. The GOP tax scam took money from homeowners and  communities in my State and others to fund their massive giveaway to  big corporations. The data is there. It is clear. It is succinct. It is  definitive.   Republicans even bragged about using their tax scam to hurt New  Jersey and the region. Imagine that. Imagine bragging about  deliberately hurting millions of people. My amendment would have  restored this critical deduction, but it was blocked.   This bill before us today provides targeted relief to victims of  disasters, but only a select few. There have been 13 disasters since we  last held a committee meeting on a tax bill, and I  [[Page H10474]]  don't see them listed here, not to mention the tax relief that victims  of Hurricane Sandy never received in the first place.   There is a bill that would provide disaster tax relief to all  federally declared disaster areas automatically, which it should be, so  we don't have to play these partisan games of picking and choosing. If  we want to help people, let's vote on it.   There are provisions in this bill that I would have supported, but  our chairman made no such attempt to reach us. In fact, we didn't have  any witnesses. In fact, we didn't have any hearings. How about that for  democracy?   Instead, this is nearly $100 billion.   It is unpaid for; you are very good at that. It is undebated; you  think you know all of the answers. And it is very, very partisan. So  much for reaching out. And most important, it utterly ignores the needs  of workers in this country.   Mr. Speaker, did you hear that General Motors just announced 14,700  workers are losing their jobs? Does this bill do anything to address  that? No. In fact, the underlying tax bill they are trying to fix  today--remember Bernie?--did nothing to help those workers either.   General Motors moves American jobs to China and Mexico. They will be  paying a lower tax rate for the pleasure, from 21 percent to a minimum  of just 10.5 percent. How do you justify that?    And we continue to let them deduct the cost--get this.  We allow them to deduct the cost of moving their operations overseas.   How un-American do you get? We need to stop that.   There is a bill, by the way, to do that, if you noticed.   If you can believe it, General Motors saved more than $150 million so  far this year thanks to the GOP tax scam, and they appear to have  benefited by as much as $6.5 billion by the tax holiday for offshore  cash hidden in this GOP bill.   The data is clear, Mr. Speaker. Read it. Yet here they are shipping  jobs overseas just in time for the holidays.   You might think after they were repudiated at the ballot box that  Republicans would show some humility and extend a hand to work with us,  reach out. No. All they could do is smile and say: Bernie, it is your  year. Don't worry about it.
