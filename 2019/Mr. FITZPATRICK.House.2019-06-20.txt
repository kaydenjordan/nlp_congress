 Madam Speaker, it is with great sadness that I rise  [[Page H4999]]  today to recognize the life and memory of a law enforcement  professional who served the people of Bucks County, Pennsylvania, for  over two decades. Steven F. Hillias, chief of police to the Perkasie  Borough Police Department, passed away on Sunday at the age of 49.   Born in Allentown, Chief Hillias was a graduate of Allentown Central  Catholic High School and went on to receive a degree in management from  Penn State. Chief Hillias later attended the FBI National Academy and  received a master's degree in criminal justice from DeSales University.   Chief Hillias joined the Perkasie Borough Police Department in 1997  and was elevated to chief of police in 2014. Well-respected in the law  enforcement community, Chief Hillias was a member of the Police Chiefs  Association of Bucks County and the Fraternal Order of Police.   Chief Hillias was known as an approachable, community-oriented chief  who cared deeply about the Perkasie community. He worked tirelessly and  with empathy to combat the opioid epidemic and advocated for young  offenders in diversionary programs. He was a man admired for his  fairness and his compassion.   Madam Speaker, I send my deepest condolences to Chief Hillias' wife,  Tracy, and his children, Michael and Lauren. We thank them for sharing  him with our community.   May Chief Hillias enjoy his eternal reward for a life he spent  serving others.                            ____________________
