 Mr. Speaker, tomorrow morning James Comey will address the  Senate Intelligence Committee. I read his testimony today.   It is obvious to me that the President leaned on James Comey to try  to get him to take actions in the Michael Flynn situation that were  contrary to what Mr. Comey and I think justice would require, and that  is an open investigation for the benefit of the American people and for  the independence of the American Government in dealing with its  relations with Russia.   I commend James Comey for being strong after being looked down on and  at by the President, trying to get him to ask for his job or pledge  loyalty or commit to derail that investigation.   I thank him for his integrity. I thank him for his service to the  FBI. And I certainly hope that no one will try to disparage his  integrity or his honesty tomorrow.                            ____________________
