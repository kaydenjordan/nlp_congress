 Mr. Speaker, yesterday was National Agriculture Day, a day  to celebrate the contributions of America's farmers, growers, and  ranchers.   These hardworking men and women provide our families with the food,  fuel, and fiber we need each and every day. According to the USDA, the  agriculture sector contributed nearly $1.3 trillion to our GDP in 2021  and accounted for a tenth of all U.S. employment.   My district in southern Illinois is home to more than 10,000  producers, and one of the most diverse agricultural districts in the  region.   In addition to corn and soybean, southern Illinois produces rice,  specialty crops, livestock, dairy, wine, and more than one-half of the  horseradish in the United States.   But these aren't easy jobs. Farmers are often at the mercy of the  weather and other factors well beyond their control.   As a member of the House Agriculture Committee, I believe that the  new farm bill provides us a critical opportunity to put farmers first  and support programs like crop insurance to strengthen our food  security.   I am proud to cosponsor H.R. 235 designating March 21, 2023, as  National Agriculture Day, and I will continue to fight for our southern  Illinois farming families every day that I serve in Congress.                            ____________________
