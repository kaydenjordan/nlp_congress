 Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of June as  LGBTQ Pride Month.   As we celebrate the contributions of the LGBTQ community, we also  know that the fight for full equality under the law is far from over.   I call on Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to respect the clear  majority of Americans who believe that equality must become the law of  the land by taking up the Equality Act in the Senate.   We also must do more to ensure that we have the data necessary to  enforce key provisions in the Equality Act. That is why I introduced  the LGBTQ Business Equal Credit Enforcement and Investment Act, which  would help facilitate fair lending to LGBTQ-owned businesses and study  the issues affecting them by gathering data from financial institutions  about their lending practices toward these businesses.   If we are serious about our country's commitment to civil rights,  protecting minorities, and economic opportunity--and, for that matter,  about growing our economy--LGBTQ-owned businesses must have access to  equal capital.                            ____________________
