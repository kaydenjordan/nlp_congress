 Madam President, I rise this afternoon to celebrate the  passage of the ``Six Triple Eight'' Congressional Gold Medal Act. This  bill honors the women of the only all-Black, all-female unit to serve  overseas during World War II as part of the 6888th Central Postal  Directory Battalion.   Passage of this legislation is long overdue and will award the  Congressional Gold Medal to these brave women of the Six Triple Eight  for their devotion to duty, military service, and their extraordinary  efforts to boost the morale of personnel stationed in Europe during  World War II.   Today, it is easy to connect with our loved ones through text,  emails, or social media. Communication is more convenient, and  consequently, many of us take the ease of that communication for  granted. But during World War II, the only connection people like my  mom and dad had while my father was deployed in Europe was our mail  system. The mail delivered love and inspiration to our troops huddled  in foxholes and fighting for our freedom. The mail kept them going  through the dark and troubled times of World War II. The mail anchored  our troops and connected them to home.   The women of the Six Triple Eight delivered the mail although the  deck was stacked against them from the start. While crossing the  Atlantic to Europe, the troop convoy carrying the Six Triple Eight  encountered German U-boats, forcing the convoy to take defensive  actions and change course. Shortly after their arrival in the European  theater, a German V1 dove at them, forcing them to take cover out of  fear of being bombed.   Physical dangers aside, the women of the Six Triple Eight faced  sexism and racism. In Birmingham, England, the very same soldiers the  Six Triple Eight were committed to helping spread vial rumors just  because they were Black women.   On top of the physical dangers and the social injustice they faced  were the challenges of the mail mission itself. Handling and sorting  the mail was no easy task. The Six Triple Eight found warehouses  crammed from floor to ceiling with mail whose delivery was long, long  overdue, sometimes over years. They found giant rats tearing apart the  undelivered Christmas care packages. There was little, if any,  organization. They had to sort this mail in poor working conditions-- warehouses that were poorly lit, damp, and without heat.   Undeterred, the women of the Six Triple Eight rolled up their sleeves  and dug in. Fixing the mail backlog was estimated to take at least 6  months, possibly even a year. The Six Triple Eight organized the  millions of letters and packages in just 3 months. They firmly believed  in the motto ``no mail, low morale.''   Their diligence, their commitment to excellence, dignity, and class,  and their relentless drive to get the mail into the hands of the troops  won them admiration throughout the European theater. Their actions  boosted the spirits of thousands of soldiers like my dad by  reconnecting them with their family and friends back home and giving  them a renewed vigor to fight.   I want to thank Representative Gwen Moore and Representative Jake  LaTurner for leading this effort in the House, and I want to thank my  colleagues in both the House and Senate who have supported this bill  and made awarding the Congressional Gold Medal to these brave women  possible. There were lots of challenges: Black women serving in the  military--only ones seemingly willing to volunteer to go to Europe to  meet the needs of those who serve.   I would also like to thank COL Edna Cummings for her dedication to  make certain the stories of the Six Triple Eight are remembered and  honored.   In 2018, I was at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas to dedicate the Six  Triple Eight monument. I was honored to meet these women and was  inspired to make certain more Americans knew of their incredible  service during World War II.   Of the over 300 members of the Six Triple Eight, I would like to  recognize and thank the surviving members and make sure their names are  included in the Congressional Record: Hilda Griggs, Anna Robertson,  Romay Davis, Cresencia Garcia, Fannie Griffin McClendon, and Lena  Kings.   The Six Triple Eight served our country selflessly and were a crucial  asset in the war effort. This is one more way our Nation can say to  these incredible women: Thank you for your service. We respect you, and  we love you.   It is my honor to celebrate the passage of this bill today.                                   Ukraine    Madam President, Vladimir Putin is a thug and is solely responsible  for the  [[Page S824]]  invasion of Ukraine. Putin--I condemn him, and he is even being  condemned by his own people in Russia and a growing alliance around the  world.   There is nothing that justifies Russia invading Ukraine. This is the  most significant intrusion from one country into another since the  beginning of the 1930s in what resulted in World War II. I pray for the  safety of the Ukrainian people and a rapid end to this unprovoked war.   As we hear stories about their bravery and resolve, I am inspired by  their dedication to defend their freedom. The United States is making  it clear we stand with and support them.   This war is a terrible tragedy, but it is also a wake-up call for the  United States of America. When it comes to defense spending, energy  production, and humanitarian assistance, our commitments to these  issues demonstrate our commitment to global security.   We must recognize that we have adversaries who seek to use force to  recover claimed territory, possess weapons of mass destruction, and  otherwise destabilize our country and our allies and partners. For  those of us in Congress, to ignore these threats would be derelict in  our duty to preserve American security and prosperity. We would be  derelict to the people of the United States of America.   This recognition begins with a strong national defense. It is  unacceptable that we have failed to pass appropriations for the  Pentagon, State Department, and other national security Agencies  essential to protecting and projecting our strength abroad. As a  result, new programs necessary to meeting the challenges in the years  to come are stuck in limbo.   In classified briefings for the Appropriations Committee, we have  heard about the advances the militaries of our adversaries are making,  and it is alarming.   For 6 months, Congress has imposed a spending freeze while other  countries press ahead. When the latest continuing resolution expires in  10 days, we need an agreement on this spending, and we should not allow  and we cannot afford another delay.   As we prepare to receive President Biden's budget for the coming  fiscal year, it will be important that his top-line figure for our  Nation's defenses exceed inflation. MacKenzie Eaglen at the American  Enterprise Institute writes that $2 to $4 billion is being lost per  month to cover inflationary costs, reducing the buying power of our  military. President Biden must take this into account.   He famously said: ``Show me your budget, and I'll tell you what you  value.'' When it comes to our national spending, our enemies are  watching also. Our values extend to our concern for the people impacted  by this war. Russia's war with Ukraine is already a humanitarian  calamity. Children have been killed and wounded and families split  apart as some flee and some loved ones stay. As of today, this conflict  has created more than 400,000 refugees, and the U.N. predicts that  number can climb to 5 million.   I commend our European allies for their response in welcoming  refugees, and I expect our own Nation will be generous with financial  support for those seeking safety. But this war will have a humanitarian  consequence that goes beyond those directly impacted by the fighting.   Ukraine and Russia account for more than one-quarter of the world's  wheat production. It is impossible to believe that such production  won't be impacted by the fighting and sanctions, especially as we have  seen their ports close. This will make food shortages around the world  more severe. No government in the world is as generous with its  resources for international food assistance as the United States, but I  again point out the excess production of our American farmers that can  be shared. There really is no excess production; the need is so great,  whatever we produce will feed people. Our government should utilize the  resources of its farmers and promote stability where hungry societies  are fragile.   Russia's aggression must also be a wake-up call to our dependence on  foreign oil. Prior to the invasion, the United States was directly  paying Russia, our third largest supplier of oil, around $70 million  per day for oil and refined products, or over 700,000 barrels of  petroleum products per day. We are financing with our oil purchases the  ability of Russia to do harm around the world.   Combined with our European allies, who are even more dependent on  Russian energy, Putin's profit before the invasion was $330 million  each day. We are subsidizing aggression in Moscow, and it extends to  the Middle East as well. This must end.   I believe in an ``all of the above'' approach to energy production,  and our oil and gas producers must play a role. The Biden  administration should reinstate the Keystone XL Pipeline and promote  commonsense solutions that boost jobs at home and keep money out of the  pockets of our adversaries. It also would be helpful in our battle  against inflation here in the United States.   Each of these challenges can be met if we in the Senate are unified  in purpose. The American people and the world view this body as  divided, unable to come together on many important issues. I don't  believe it has to be that way. I certainly stand willing and able to  work with my colleagues to find common ground as we respond to this  invasion.   We know lots of examples we can point to where we do work together  and pass critical legislation. We must find compromise and immediately  move on sanctions legislation. We must pass defense appropriations. We  must focus on an ``all of the above'' energy strategy to address our  dependence upon foreign oil. We have done it before, and we can do it  again.   Winston Churchill--in my view, the most inspiring leader of the 20th  century--I thought of him as I watched Ukraine's own inspirational  President and the response of his people. I share today a quote from  Churchill that meets the occasion:         Very few wars have been won by mere numbers alone. Quality,       will power, geographical advantages . . . the command of the       sea, and, above all, a cause which rouses the spontaneous       surgings of the human spirit in millions of hearts--these       have proved to be the divisive factors in the human story.    Americans--Americans of all stripes--share that human spirit with  Ukrainians today.   I ask God to bless Ukraine and its people, and God bless the United  States of America as we do our part to support their people.   I yield the floor.
