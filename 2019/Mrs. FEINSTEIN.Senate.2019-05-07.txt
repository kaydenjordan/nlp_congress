 Madam President, today I wish to speak in support of  including provisions in any reauthorization of the Violence Against  Women Act that would ensure Tribal governments can prosecute heinous  crimes on their lands.   When Congress last reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act, also  known as VAWA, in 2013, we made historic advancements to address  domestic violence on Tribal lands. Those important steps must be  preserved, but we must also fix gaps in the law that the last  reauthorization left open. These gaps allow crimes against children,  the elderly, and law enforcement to essentially go unpunished.   As I have mentioned before, I support H.R. 1585, the bill passed by  the House to reauthorize VAWA. One of the reasons I support that bill  is because it addresses those gaps. Tribes should be able to address  violent crimes that happen on their lands and to their most vulnerable  populations.   According to a 2016 Justice Department report, ``more than four in  five American Indian and Alaska Native women have experienced violence  in their lifetime.'' That is disturbing. The report also found that 56  percent have experienced sexual violence; 56 percent have experienced  physical violence at the hands of an intimate partner; and 49 percent  have been stalked.   For me, these numbers are even more upsetting because California has  the largest Native American population in the United States. There are  almost 700,000 Native Americans living in California, which has 107  federally recognized and 50 unrecognized Tribes.   We must continue to respect Tribal sovereignty, to advance the very  core of what sovereignty means: the right of Tribes to exercise  dominion and jurisdiction over appalling crimes that occur on Tribal  land. For many years, Tribal governments were unable to prosecute  crimes committed by non-Indians on Tribal lands. Thankfully, that  changed when Congress reauthorized VAWA in 2013.   The 2013 reauthorization of VAWA allowed Tribes to exercise their  sovereign powers to prosecute, convict, and sentence both Indians and  non-Indians who assault Indian spouses or dating partners. In other  words, Tribes were finally able to prosecute anyone who committed  domestic violence against an Indian on Indian land. These measures were  not only necessary; they worked.   In just 5 years, under these new laws, there were 142 arrests, 74  convictions, and 24 more cases pending. These charges were processed  through Tribal courts that provided the requisite due process  protections under our Constitution. In fact, not a single conviction  was overturned because of a lack of due process. We must now build on  that success.   The VAWA reauthorization the House passed is a strong bill. I would  note that it passed on a significant bipartisan basis, with a vote of  263-158 and 33 Republicans supporting it. This was even in the face of  an active opposition campaign conducted by the National Rifle  Association.   But importantly, one of the reasons the House bill is a strong bill  is because of its Tribal protections. For example, the House bill  expands jurisdiction over non-Indians for crimes against children,  elders, and law enforcement.   We have a duty to prevent child abuse and elder abuse wherever they  occur. It is also only right that Tribes be able to prosecute attacks  on law enforcement officers. The people who protect the public deserve  protection as well.   These advancements ensure that Tribes are able to address acts of  violence, while respecting Tribal sovereignty. We should welcome the  opportunity to continue to build on our past successes. I look forward  to working with my colleague Senator Ernst on these provisions and hope  other Senators with significant stake in this area will join us.   There are several other provisions that I believe should be included  in a VAWA reauthorization. Chief among those is keeping guns out of the  hands of domestic abusers. I plan to speak about those provisions at a  later date, but I mention them now because I believe that we must have  a comprehensive approach to addressing domestic violence in this  country.   Simply put, all of the different parts of VAWA are linked. For  instance, ensuring Tribal governments can prosecute domestic violence  committed on Tribal lands is important, but keeping guns out of the  hands of domestic abusers will help protect victims on Tribal lands as  well.   The bill passed by the House takes this sort of comprehensive  approach by, for example, improving the law in the areas of housing,  Tribal protections, and gun safety.   I believe the Senate must do the same. There is no simple way to stop  domestic violence, but we have a duty to do all that we can. Thank you.                            ____________________
