 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition of H.R. 7, the  Paycheck Fairness Act.   We don't need the government telling business how much they can pay  their employees. Let's not forget that it is business that has lifted  us out of poverty, not the government.   As a former businesswoman who has actually signed the front of  paychecks, not just the backs, what you do as an employee and what you  produce as an employee matters, and what you produce should be  reflected in your outcome, not your gender.   Do not--please, do not insult me as a woman by lowering the bar for  me. And please, do not insult me as a business owner for forcing me to  lower the bar for my employees. Outcomes and hard work are what leads  to success, not your gender.   Gender discrimination is already against the law thanks to the Equal  Pay Act.   At a time when businesses are shutting their doors due to the  pandemic, we should be creating jobs and incentivizing people to work.
