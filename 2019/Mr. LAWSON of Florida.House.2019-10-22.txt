 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for  yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 2513, the Corporate Transparency  Act.   The bill would close loopholes that bad actors have taken advantage  of in order to aid terrorist organizations, corrupt officials, and  other criminal enterprises. Specifically, this bill requires that those  who form corporations must disclose who the true beneficial owners are  in order to thwart hidden criminal activity.   Instilling these measures in place will benefit consumers and small  businesses by preventing unfair contracting practices, including false  billing, fraudulent certifications, and defrauding taxpayers.   In addition, this bill will help to curb and prevent human  trafficking, which is very prevalent now, by eliminating anonymous  companies who hide the identities of criminals engaged in trafficking  enterprises masked by a legitimate business structure.   According to a study by the University of Texas, among over 100  countries studied, the United States ranked the easiest place for  suspicious individuals to incorporate an anonymous company.   Further, according to a 2017 GAO study, it found that GAO was unable  to identify ownership information for about one-third of the GSA's high  security leases.   Mr. Speaker, the Corporate Transparency Act will fix these issues and  provide much-needed transparency into the corporate governing  structure. I encourage my colleagues on both sides to support this  bill.
