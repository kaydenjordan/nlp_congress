 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. George Ramirez for  his extraordinary contribution to the culture and arts in Brownsville,  Texas.   Mr. Ramirez was the longtime president of the Brownsville Society for  the Performing Arts and founder of the Brownsville Latin Jazz Festival.  He has been invaluable in bringing quality cultural entertainment to my  community. Under Mr. Ramirez' leadership, the Brownsville Society for  the Performing Arts has produced hundreds of shows, concerts, and  cultural programs.   He dedicated his life to making the arts accessible to the people of  the Rio Grande Valley.   In June 2017, Mr. Ramirez established his own low-powered radio  station, which enabled him to bring music to everyone.   Mr. Ramirez helped create a number of cultural events, including the  Brownsville Guitar Ensemble Festival and Competition, the Brownsville  International Flamenco Festival, and the Ancient Cultures Festival.   He also spearheaded the efforts to bring Handel's ``Messiah''  concerts to Brownsville, Mozart's ``Requiem in D Minor,'' Bach's ``Mass  in B Minor,'' and the annual children's ``Hansel and Gretel'' opera  production.    A group of students in the University of Texas opera program had  never seen an opera, so he coordinated and funded a trip to take them  to the Houston Grand Opera. He was very active in helping students gain  exposure to the arts, offering several music scholarships.   Mr. Ramirez' latest accomplishment was playing a vital role in the  opening of the Brownsville Performing Arts Academy, a place that will  carry on the tradition of Mr. Ramirez' work.                            ____________________
