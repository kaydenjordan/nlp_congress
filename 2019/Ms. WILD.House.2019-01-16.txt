 Madam Speaker, last week, I spoke on this floor about the  first bill I introduced, a bill to fund our Coast Guard through this  government shutdown.   Incredibly, our Coast Guard is still not being paid. Yesterday was  payday, but they got nothing.   Just an hour ago, I spoke with Admiral Charles Ray, Vice Commandant  of the Coast Guard, who emphasized to me just how hard this is for  young members of the Coast Guard who have not yet accumulated savings.  As he said to me, these men and women do everything we ask of them. All  they ask is that we stand by them.   This is no way to treat those who put their lives on the line in our  defense. Members of every branch of our military, and the families who  serve alongside them, need to know that our government's commitment to  them is unbreakable.   Our government has betrayed the values of service and camaraderie  embodied by our military families. We need to remember and honor those  values. That means funding our Coast Guard and ending this crisis right  now.                            ____________________
