 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 11 a.m. tomorrow; and further,  when the House adjourns on that day, it adjourn to meet on Tuesday, May  15, 2018, when it shall convene at noon for morning-hour debate and 2  p.m. for legislative business.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on  Appropriations have until 6 p.m. on Friday, May 11, 2018, to file  privileged reports to accompany measures making appropriations for the  fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, and for other purposes.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give notice of my intent to  resign from the United States House of Representatives on May 12 and to  share a few words with my fellow Members and the American people.   It has truly been an honor and privilege to serve the people of  Pennsylvania's 15th District, and I am proud of my time in Congress. I  believe that I have made a difference and improved the lives of the  constituents whom I have served in Pennsylvania: from serving on the  House Homeland Security Committee and the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee, which is being very ably led by my good  friend from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster)--and his term is also coming to  its end. I want to commend him and congratulate him on his dedicated  service all these years--and to my current role as a senior member of  the House Appropriations Committee, chairing the Subcommittee on  Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies; and as  past chairman of the House Ethics Committee.   And I was delighted for my good friend Linda Sanchez, who just spoke  a few moments ago, serving with her. She was a wonderful partner on  that committee. So much of the staff, some of whom are here in the  Chamber today, I was so thrilled to be able to have that opportunity to  work with her and the staff, who are all so professional.   I also had the opportunity to serve as co-chair of the Tuesday Group  Caucus. I was very pleased with what we were able to accomplish in that  role. And as a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, I fought  to fulfill the basic functions of government, like keeping the  government funded and preventing default on our Nation's obligations.  At times, that has not been easy.   I see my good friend Mr. Cole is here, too. He has been a great  appropriator, a great leader, and a great mentor to me.   Unfortunately, due to disruptive political influences, increased  polarization has led the Congress to becoming more paralyzed and unable  to perform even our most basic and fundamental tasks. This phenomenon  manifested itself most clearly during the 2013 Federal Government  shutdown, but it continues today.   This political polarization has led to a disturbing trend where  fringe elements of both the far right and far left are emboldened and  empowered. And while the bases of both political parties are well  represented in Congress, the governing center has been under increased  pressure.   Too many Republicans expect unquestioning--blind, unquestioning-- loyalty and obedience to President Trump, no matter how absurd or  disruptive the comment or behavior. Constitutional separation of powers  is almost an alien concept, after relentlessly demanding Congress  assert its Article I powers during the Obama years.   On the other side, far too many Democrats offer unflinching  resistance and opposition to President Trump, even if they agree with  him on a given policy or position.   Separation of political parties has replaced separation of powers as  a guiding, governing philosophy. This dynamic is simply not  sustainable, and it is already having troubling consequences.   We have already seen a rise in the three-headed monster of  isolationism, protectionism, and nativism. These are not qualities of a  great nation. In fact, they dishonor the sacrifices and service of the  Greatest Generation, who delivered both victory during World War II  [[Page H3921]]  and the farsighted, outward-looking, post-war, rules-based order that  has brought unprecedented freedom and prosperity to America and its  friends, allies, and partners.   Furthermore, traditional democratic values--the rule of law, freedom  of press, an independent judiciary--are under unprecedented attack  throughout much of the world.                                time  1245    It is incumbent upon all of us to stand up and defend our way of life  and our institutions. In Congress, we need to reestablish a strong,  bipartisan governing center that will help restore order and stability  to Washington and that will also help alleviate a lot of concerns  throughout the country.   To be sure, there are a number of Members working towards that goal:  the members of the Tuesday Group, Republican Main Street Partnership,  the Blue Dogs, New Democrats, Problem Solvers Caucus, and there are  others. Many of these Members understand that consensus and compromise  are not capitulation or surrender but, instead, are essential to a  functioning republic.   We need to pursue real fiscal reform, both on the mandatory side and  the revenue side of the ledger. We need a Simpson-Bowles 2.0, with  teeth; and reforms must be bipartisan to ensure they are both durable  and sustainable, which we know won't happen on a partisan basis.   Additionally, we need to address other challenges, such as how to  increase access to and affordability for our Nation's healthcare  system, expanding educational opportunities for our children and our  grandchildren, and making needed improvements to our infrastructure  like so many around here are dedicated to, especially my friend  Chairman Shuster.   The administration must realize that America has to honor its  agreements if we ever hope to enter into new ones. We simply cannot  walk away from American commitments, even ones we may have voted  against or disagreed with, if we expect to continue to build new  coalitions and enter into new agreements.   Instead, we should double down on the multilateral rules-based order,  whatever the flaws, that America worked so hard to establish after  World War II by defending the institutions, alliances, and partnerships  we established or helped establish: NATO, European unity, and, yes, a  global trade regime through which we have advanced America's economic,  security, and strategic interests.   We should look at ways to open new markets and expand new  opportunities that unleash the power and benefits of the American free  enterprise system. All of us, Republicans and Democrats, need to work  together to move America forward as friends and partners who share  values, ideals, and common interests.   Whether confronting a revanchist, aggressive Russia; a terrorist,  theocratic Iranian regime; or China's mercantilist policies, success  can only be achieved by finding strength in unity.   And while I may be leaving the Halls of Congress, I am not retreating  from the battlefield. Some of you may regret that. I intend to continue  aggressively advocating for people and the policies of the sensible  center. I hope to provide an even larger voice in favor of responsible  governance and hope to foster a strong center-right movement that  embraces traditional conservative virtues of order, discipline,  stability, measured statements, and incremental change--not the  incendiary rhetoric, chaos, and dysfunction that we have,  unfortunately, grown accustomed to in recent years. Although my time in  Congress is drawing to a close, I know that our Nation's future is  bright.   Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and thanks to all my friends and colleagues,  again, some of whom are here today. I thank them all, my friends and  colleagues not only here in the House, but also in the Senate, for  their support, their guidance, their wisdom, and their friendship over  the years. It is truly very meaningful to me, and I have been  especially touched by some of the very nice things people have said and  other tributes that have been paid to me.   My wife said, after she heard a few of them, she is kind of waiting  to meet this guy that they are all talking about. But seriously, I  can't thank you enough.   I also want to give a special thank-you to all my staff, both past  and present, for everything that they have done dutifully to serve our  constituents in Pennsylvania and to my legislative and policy  priorities.   I should note, some of my staff are seated up in the gallery, past  and present. I am not supposed to do that, but, hell, it is my last  day, so I can do that.   I just want to again thank the staff for their dedication and work,  both my Washington and my district staff, who do a lot of work not just  for me, but all of our staffs. They do a lot, and sometimes they take a  lot of grief, and we don't say thank you enough to them. But the bottom  line is we could have never achieved as much as we did without their  dedication and their commitment.   And above all, thank you to the people of Pennsylvania's 15th  Congressional District for the trust they have shown in me time and  again. I have always said I don't know how many constituents would  allow their Member the amount of latitude they have given me to be  somewhat of an independent voice here and say what I felt needed to be  said. I really appreciated my constituents allowing me to do that. I  recognize in some districts that might not be case, so to them I say  thank you again. After my family, representing them and carrying their  voice to Washington has been the honor and joy of a lifetime.   Mr. Speaker, I say thank you, and I yield back the balance of my  time.                            ____________________
