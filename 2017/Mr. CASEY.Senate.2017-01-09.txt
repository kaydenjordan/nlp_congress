 Mr. President, I rise this evening to speak about the  Republican effort in the Senate, by way of a budget resolution, which  includes so-called reconciliation instructions to repeal the Patient  Protection and Affordable Care Act, in this case, unfortunately,  without any replacement for that legislation we passed a number of  years ago.   In a word, I think this is a plan for chaos--chaos certainly for  insurance markets but more particularly chaos and damage done to  middle-class families whose costs will go up. Of course, their coverage  will be affected adversely. A repeal act without replacement would  raise the price of prescription drugs for older Americans across our  country, put insurance companies back in charge of health care, cost  our economy millions of jobs, and devastate funding for rural hospitals  and rural communities in Pennsylvania and across the country.   I think, on a night like tonight, where we are just beginning a long  debate about how to bring affordable care to Americans and how to  continue that, we should reflect back on where things were before the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.   Over 50 million Americans were uninsured in 2009--50 million people.  People with any sort of medical condition were routinely denied health  insurance or were charged exorbitant rates because of their health  histories. Women in the United States were routinely charged more than  men for their health insurance. This is not an exhaustive list.  Finally, individuals who were ill were routinely dropped from their  health care coverage because they had reached arbitrary caps on the  amount of care an insurer would pay for a given year.   So let us talk about what has happened since then. Since the passage  of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, we have come a long way. More than  20 million Americans, including almost 1 million in Pennsylvania, have  received health insurance as a result of this one piece of legislation.  One hundred five million Americans are protected from discrimination  due to preexisting conditions. Those are 105 million Americans with  preexisting conditions who are no longer barred from treatment or  coverage as they were before. Nine million Americans have received tax  credits to help them cover the cost of their insurance. Eleven million  seniors have saved over $23 billion from closing the Medicare Part D  prescription drug plan's so-called doughnut hole. Doughnut hole is a  benign way of saying burn a hole--costs that were burning a hole in the  pockets of America's seniors.   Finally, hospitals in States like Pennsylvania are getting a lot of  help due to the legislation. In Pennsylvania, our hospitals have saved  $680 million due to reductions in uncompensated care. I think, in the  end, most of this is about real people and real families and their real  lives and, unfortunately, the real consequences that would adversely  impact their lives.   Among the 3 million Pennsylvanians with preexisting conditions, there  are two remarkable young women whose mother first contacted me in  2009--Stacie Ritter, from Manheim, PA. Stacie is a mother of four  children, including twin girls, Hannah and Madeline. That is a picture  of Hannah and Madeline a number of years ago. Hannah and Madeline were  diagnosed at the age of 4 with a rare and dangerous type of leukemia,  at such a young age.   Stacie and her husband went bankrupt. They literally went bankrupt  trying to pay for their daughters' medical bills. She wrote to me at  the time, saying that without health care reform ``my girls will be  unable to afford care, that is if they are eligible for care that is  critically necessary to maintain this chronic condition. Punished and  rejected because they had the misfortune of developing cancer as a  child.''   So said Stacie Ritter, one mother in one community in Pennsylvania in  2009. She was talking about her daughters being punished and rejected,  as if they had any control over the cancer they were diagnosed with.  Fortunately, Hannah and Madeline are healthy young women today.  Madeline and Hannah are freshmen at Arcadia University and are doing  well. The Affordable Care Act protects them by assuring they will have  access to affordable coverage, whether on their parents' plan or on a  plan in the market. Because of their medical histories, they have  ongoing health care needs, and they don't know what they would do  without the Affordable Care Act.   Here is a picture of them today, and you can see what a difference  health care makes in the life of a child--in this case, the life of two  children who are now young women and in college. I don't even want to  think about it, but we should think about what would have happened  without this legislation. We should not ever put children and their  families in that circumstance.   If you are talking about a new plan, you better have a plan that  would cover children like Hannah and Madeline, and you better be able  to pay for it. You can't just talk about it. You can't just promise it.  You have to be able to pay for it, as we did in this legislation.  [[Page S166]]    While we are on the question of costs, let's talk about it in human  terms--human terms meaning young women like Hannah and Madeline. We  have heard an awful lot from Republican Members of the Senate and  Republican Members of the House of Representatives. They have been  promising to come up with a ``better plan'' than the Affordable Care  Act since 2010. Since March of 2010, when this passed, you would think  that by now they would have a plan--a plan that would replace what they  had repealed. That is part one. Part two is a plan that is better,  because that is what they promised. They used other words to describe  it as well.   Now almost 7 years later--and it will be 7 years in March--where is  their plan? I don't think anyone has been able to find their plan. Some  Members of the Senate on the Republican side of the aisle have said  recently that they have a plan but they haven't released it yet, or  they have parts of a plan or different plans but they are putting them  together, and we will see them soon. Others don't seem to know whether  there is a plan or not. So they promised to replace the Affordable Care  Act only after they repealed it and only after millions of Americans  would lose their insurance.   Where is the plan after 7 years? You would think, if you were serious  about a matter of public policy--something as substantial and as  consequential in the lives of families--that after 6-plus, almost 7  years you would have a plan ready to go, and that plan would be  comprehensive, and that plan would cover at least 20 million people,  maybe more.   That plan would have all the protections that I spoke of earlier.  Young women like that, when they were children, would not have their  treatment capped. Someone with a preexisting condition would be  protected. Women would not be discriminated against. All of those  protections, including the coverage, would be part of that plan--you  would think.   It seems as if to find the Republican plan here in Washington, you  would need to hire a really good private investigator to look in every  corner of Washington. Maybe it is in some of the desks here. Maybe we  just haven't found it yet. So far, there is no plan--no plan. There is  a lot of talk and a lot of hot air about repeal but no plan.   What does the Brookings Institution say? They say that the number of  uninsured Americans would double if the act is repealed. To be precise,  that would leave 29.8 million people without insurance. It would go  from 28.9 to 58.7 million people. I started tonight talking about 50  million uninsured in 2009. If you repeal this legislation and you don't  replace it with something that is very close to comparable, that means  you no longer have 50 million uninsured like we did in 2009, you have  58.7 million--let's round it off to 59 million Americans without  insurance--despite all the gains we have made in the last number of  years.   What does that mean for Pennsylvania? Since the bill was passed,  956,000 Pennsylvanians stand to lose their coverage because that is how  many have gained it. The Congressional Budget Office, which is the  Congress's referee or scorecard, estimates that insurance premiums  would rise by 20 percent if the act is repealed without a replacement.   The Commonwealth Fund, in a recent report, estimated that repealing  the act would cost our economy 2.5 million jobs per year--not over 5  years or 10 years but 2.5 million jobs per year.   Pennsylvania is a State where, despite having huge urban areas in  both Philadelphia and Pittsburgh and a lot of cities in between, we  have millions of people literally that live in so-called rural  communities, rural counties. By one estimate of our 67 counties, 48 of  them could be categorized as rural counties. We have a lot of people  who live in, make their living in, and work very hard in rural  communities.   One of the headlines that caught my attention last week was from the  Fiscal Times. This is from January 5. You can't see it from a distance,  but the headline reads: ``Obamacare Repeal Could Push Rural Hospitals  to the Brink.'' It is all focusing on rural hospitals and the cost of  repeal.   We know that a couple of years ago there was a report by First Focus  that focused specifically on rural children and their health care. Here  is what the conclusion of that report was. As of 2012, the year they  examined, Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program covered  47 percent of rural children, compared with 38 percent of urban  children. Almost half of rural children, as of this report, received  their health care from Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance  Program. Both would be adversely impacted by both the repeal of the  Affordable Care Act and the implementation of the House Republican  budget, which I think is the most extreme budget ever proposed in  Washington.   That is the reality just for rural children and their health care  and, also, the predictions about what will happen to rural hospitals. A  lot of people employed in Pennsylvania--tens of thousands--are employed  in rural hospitals in our State.   One of the individuals who contacted us to talk about this issue in  the context of being in a somewhat rural community but someone who is  actually doing farming--and, of course, farming does not occur just in  rural areas--is Julia Inslee, from Coatesville, PA. That is in  Southeastern Pennsylvania, where we have a lot of farms, as well, just  like we do in the middle of the State and in the western, northeastern,  and northwestern part of the State. Julia turned her family's hobby  farm into a full-time operation. Here is what she wrote to her office  in November.         I am one of the millions of people who have benefited       greatly from affordable access to health care. I work part       time as a tutor at a community college and nearly full time       as a farmer. Neither one of these jobs provides me with       health care, nor do I make enough to pay several hundred       dollars in premiums per month. The government subsidy is what       makes it possible for me to have healthcare. If Obamacare is       taken away, I will most likely have to give up farming, and       if anything, we need more farmers, not fewer.    That is what she says. ``If Obamacare is taken away, I will most  likely have to give up farming.''   Why would we do that? Why would we say that to someone who has  achieved success in any profession or any job or any career--but  especially something as fundamental to the economy of Pennsylvania? By  one estimate, our largest industry is agriculture in Pennsylvania. Why  would we say to that farmer: They have this idea to get rid of  legislation in Washington. You are just going to have to come up with a  new profession. Why would we force people to give up farming in order  to meet the demands of some people in Washington?   Julia is facing the likelihood, if the act is repealed, of losing her  ability to support herself because her insurance would be too  expensive.   I have to ask: Is this a ``better plan''? Is this what Republicans  have come up with? We shall see.   Rebecca Seidel is a dairy farmer as well. She is from Douglassville,  PA. Rebecca co-owns a herd of dairy cows, and she talked with me just  last week about how dangerous farming can be and how scary it is not to  have insurance. She says:         As the daughter, granddaughter, and great-granddaughter of       Pennsylvania dairy farmers, I've seen my share of       agricultural catastrophes. Between equipment and large       animals, every day comes with potential hazards. Will I break       a rib getting between two cows who are fighting? Will a blade       come loose from the bedding chopper and hit me? Will my hand       be broken through miscommunication with someone operating the       skidloader? These are realities with which I live every day       and I am able to go about my job bravely because I know none       of these events would financially destroy my family.    She said the Affordable Care Act allowed her to work, and she wrote:         Threats to the ACA are threats to our future, Senator, and       to the future of small businesses, agriculture, and families.    Rebecca and her husband don't know what to expect with repeal of the  law. They want to start their own business, allowing their current  employer to hire more people, but they don't know what they will be  able to afford in such an environment of uncertainty. Rebecca and her  husband don't know if they will be able to realize their plans to start  a new business. How is this a better result for them, we would have to  ask.   Finally, we have a story of a businessman, Anthony Valenzano. Anthony  is a small business owner who has been successful with the hard work of  one employee who purchases an affordable  [[Page S167]]  and comprehensive plan through Pennsylvania's health insurance  marketplace. This is what Anthony said as a small business person:         It is my opinion that the Affordable Care Act is the best       thing the federal government has ever done for a real small       business like mine. This bill paved the way for entrepreneurs       to strike out on their own, knowing that they have a way to       get health insurance. The bill allowed these entrepreneurs to       attract professional employees who would otherwise have never       left a corporate job to join a small startup.    His business relies on his one employee--in this case, he has one who  is central to his business--being able to purchase affordable health  insurance, since, with only one employee, he cannot get her on  employer-sponsored coverage. He said, ``Looking forward, we plan to do  even bigger and better things, but she still needs health insurance to  do it, and if we lose the Marketplace, iQ Product Design will likely  lose its key employee and will be unable to create the next big market- changing product.''    He is asking: What is going to happen? Is there a replacement plan?  What happens to his employee? What happens to his business? We have a  long way to go to debate these issues. But I have to ask again, if  there is such a better idea here after almost 7 years now, where is  this replacement plan? We haven't heard one word about the details of  it. Where is it? I think that is what a lot of Americans are asking. We  know what Republicans want to do: Repeal the Affordable Care Act or  patient protections in the Affordable Care Act for all those people  with insurance who had much better protections solely because of this  legislation.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
