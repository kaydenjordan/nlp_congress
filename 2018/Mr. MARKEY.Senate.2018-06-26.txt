 Mr. President, I wish to discuss H.R. 5895, the Energy  and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans  Affairs Appropriations Act, 2019.   I thank Senate leadership and the Appropriations Committee for their  work on this legislation.   The Appropriations Committee's effort this year to return the Senate  to regular order on annual spending bills is commendable, and the  leadership of the committee honors a bipartisan commitment to keep the  most controversial policy language out of these pieces of legislation.   While we can agree that the legislation is indeed absent of unrelated  policy riders, that does not mean all of the appropriations it contains  and the resulting policy implications of those appropriations are good.   One such misguided priority within this bill is funding an  unnecessary, destabilizing, and thoroughly underexplained expansion of  America's nuclear arsenal.   In particular, the Fiscal Year 2019 Energy and Water Appropriations  Act contains $65 million in funding to develop a new so-called low- yield nuclear weapon warhead: the W76-2. This is a new nuclear weapon  that we simply just do not need. For this reason, I opposed this bill.   I made clear during Senate consideration of the National Defense  Authorization Act that developing the W76-2 low-yield nuclear warhead  creates a new nuclear weapon that is unnecessary to maintain America's  nuclear deterrent.   This need for a new low-yield nuclear weapon first came to light just  5 months ago in the Trump administration's Nuclear Posture Review.   I have seen no documents, reports, or studies justifying the W76-2 or  supporting its immediate development, and serious questions remain  unanswered.   Why are the hundreds of low-yield nuclear weapons that we already  have, like the B61 bomb and air-launched cruise missile, not adequate?   Where will these new W76-2 nuclear weapons be deployed?   On how many of our boomer submarines will we be placing these weapons  and on what schedule?   What targets will we no longer hold at risk with strategic nuclear  weapons to accommodate these new low-yield weapons?   Since this W76-2 low-yield nuclear weapon will be launched using the  same rockets as our strategic thermonuclear weapons and off of the  exact same submarines, how can anyone distinguish whether it is one or  the other?   Somehow, answers to these questions have not been written down  anywhere. Instead, we are simply told ``we need the low yield nuclear  weapon to deter the Russians and prevent an escalate to de-escalate  scenario.''   The United States already has plans to spend hundreds of billions of  dollars to upgrade our existing nuclear weapons systems as part of the  existing nuclear modernization program, systems that are in excess of  what we need to maintain our nuclear deterrence.   So it just makes no sense to spend money to develop new nuclear  weapons.   In doing so, we are making America and the world less safe, not more.  We are throwing away decades of American leadership trying to move the  world away from nuclear weapons and the existential threat they pose to  all of us.   That is why I filed an amendment to redirect funds that the Trump  administration would use to develop this wasteful and unnecessary low- yield nuclear weapon towards preparing for nonproliferation activities  that will be essential to helping denuclearize North Korea whether now  or at some point in the future.   I regret that my amendment was not considered during the floor debate  on this bill, but I still believe that Congress needs to seriously  consider the consequences of authorizing and appropriating funds for  this new weapon.   I am more worried than ever that this crucial debate has not and is  not receiving the attention that it deserves. I hope, moving forward,  we can change that and that the Senate will appropriately consider the  magnitude of the decisions we are making here today.   A nuclear weapon is a nuclear weapon. They are fundamentally  different than anything else in the world, and they must be treated as  such.   In the absence of a full debate on the floor of this Chamber that  allows the American people to understand what is truly at stake with  this new weapon, I could not support this legislation.   Thank you.                            ____________________
