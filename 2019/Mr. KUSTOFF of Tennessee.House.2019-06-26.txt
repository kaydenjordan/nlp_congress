 Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my colleague  from Georgia for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment to highlight  the importance of the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program  that is known as HIDTA.   I have had a fair number of conversations with law enforcement  throughout my district in west Tennessee, and they have told me time  and time again that drug trafficking continues to be one of their main  concerns. Along Interstate 40 in Tennessee, we continue to see an  increase in drug trafficking.   I think we can all agree that the spread of illegal drugs leads to  higher crime rates which ultimately increases the financial strain on  our local, State, and Federal law enforcement.   The HIDTA program provides funding for additional equipment and man- hours to carry out investigations required to arrest these criminals  and ultimately stop the flow of drugs.   Mr. Chairman, I know that many of my colleagues are experiencing  similar situations back home, and they understand just how serious of  an issue this is becoming for the safety and security of all Americans.   The bottom line is that our law enforcement needs the resources  offered by the HIDTA program to help keep us safe. The HIDTA program is  also a good first step to combating the opioid epidemic that is  plaguing our communities. We must be proactive now because prevention  is the best long-term solution.   Law enforcement at the local, State, and Federal level have all  expressed support for this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do  the same today.   I also want to thank my colleague from Illinois (Mr. Foster) for  joining me on this bipartisan amendment, and I do appreciate the  support of the chairman and also the ranking member for including my  amendment.                                time  1230
