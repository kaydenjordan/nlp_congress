 Mr. President, I come to the floor as part of Military  Appreciation Month. It is a time, clearly, to remember our brave  service men and women, to reflect on their faithful service to this  country and to recall the many sacrifices our troops and their families  have made and continue to make in defense of this great Nation.   Many of us will be heading overseas for the 75th anniversary of D-day  to commemorate the efforts of an incredible group of allies on the  fateful day and the weeks and the months that followed.   As I stand here today, I think of those soldiers, and I think of my  wife Bobbi's dad, Bob Brown--currently 92 years old, living in  Thermopolis, WY, longtime postmaster. He still drives Meals on Wheels,  as he says, ``for the old folks.''   He was called to Europe in World War II, and he is one of those few  who was in World War II in the European theater as well as in Japan as  part of that first occupation and then called back to Korea as part of  the 2-300 who continued in the fight for our freedoms.   He continues today to serve our United States. His wife, Jerry, who  went through all of this in Thermopolis, WY, knows the sacrifices he  and so many have made.   My dad, World War II, Battle of the Bulge. I still carry his dog tags  from the Battle of the Bulge with me. I have them with me today on the  floor of the Senate, and I carry them with me when I go to see our  troops overseas.   He is the guy who had to quit school in ninth grade because of the  Depression. In World War II--and I have gone through some of his old  papers--I found pictures of him and a number of members of the  artillery who were part of the liberation of France.   From the time I was a little boy, he would say: John, you should  thank God every day because you live in America. You don't know how  fortunate you are.   We are so blessed to live in this great country, and it is to the men  and women who continue to protect this land, who fought for our  freedoms--my dad, his wife, Louise, the sacrifices they have made on  behalf of all of us.   Today we honor all of our Armed Forces, the Army, the Navy, the Air  Force, the Coast Guard, the Marines, the National Guard.   In particular, today I want to salute the members of the Wyoming Army  National Guard because they are now deploying to the Middle East. Some  300 Wyoming soldiers from six units will be sent to the Middle East  between January and September--the largest Wyoming deployment in nearly  a decade.   The deployments began in January with the G Company of the 2nd  Battalion, 211th Aviation, a medical evacuation company--the most  deployed unit in the Wyoming Guard.   The medevac unit that was sent to Afghanistan includes Wyoming  soldiers from Bear River, from Casper, from Carpenter, from Guernsey,  from Cheyenne, Laramie, and Wheatland.   This past week, Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon participated in a  sendoff ceremony in Casper for 130 Wyoming National Guard troops headed  to Texas ahead of a 9-month deployment to the Middle East.   The Wyoming troops from the 2nd Battalion of the 300 Field Artillery,  the ``Cowboy Cannoneers,'' the group my father-in-law, Bob Brown, was  part of--they are from more than two dozen communities from Casper to  Lovell, to Cheyenne, to Moorcroft. This Guard unit will serve under the  U.S. Central Command covering Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, and the United  Arab Emirates.   Wyoming and the entire Nation owe an incredible debt of gratitude to  these fearless fighters for our freedom.   God bless the U.S. Armed Forces, God bless our troops, our veterans,  and God bless the United States of America.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I come to the floor to address again  today the Democrats' one-size-fits-all healthcare scheme. It is a  radical plan to take over all of healthcare in America and to take away  health insurance from millions of Americans.   Still, nearly every Senate Democrat running for President and 109  Members of the House of Representatives, Democrats all, have backed  one-size-fits-all healthcare. Last week, former Senator Heidi Heitkamp  of North Dakota had words of wisdom for her fellow Democrats. She  writes in the Washington Post: ``Most Americans are satisfied with the  healthcare they receive and do not want their coverage options taken  away and replaced,'' as she said, ``with a one-size-fits-all government  program.''   I agree. The fact is, according to the Census Bureau, 90 percent of  Americans have healthcare coverage. Of those, 200 million are covered  by private health plans, and 180 million have employer-provided  healthcare coverage. Most say that their current plan works well for  them.   The 180 million Americans covered through their jobs work hard. These  people go out every morning and support their families. According to a  survey released last year, the vast majority of people with employer- provided coverage--71 percent of them, to be precise--like their  current healthcare plans.   So who exactly are those workers on employer-sponsored plans? Well,  many are union members. They negotiate their health coverage through  their union representatives. Many are public employees, Federal and  State employees, people who serve this country. So why do Democrats who  support one-size-fits-all healthcare want to outlaw proven, popular,  and predictable health coverage for millions of these working families?   Democrats certainly seem to be putting politics above principle. What  is more, they clearly believe that Washington knows best. But shouldn't  we be asking what these hard-working Americans who have good private  health insurance want? Well, shouldn't we ask them what is best for  them and what is best for their families?   Let's take the Teamsters Union, for example. In an article published  in 2017, the Teamsters said:         The availability of high-quality health care has been a top       selling point for those who belong to unions. It is a benefit       these workers have bargained for, and oftentimes they have       sacrificed higher pay for these excellent insurance benefits.    Let me underscore this point: The Teamsters Union believes their  health benefits are excellent, and maybe Democrats should ask the  United Steelworkers about their insurance coverage. If you go to the  steelworkers' website, you will find their answer: ``The Steelworkers  Benefit Plan . . . provide[s] high-quality, affordable health and  welfare benefits to USW [United Steelworkers] members and their  families.''   Basically, if you are a union worker watching this debate right now,  you need to know that Democrats in Washington are coming for your hard- earned healthcare benefits. Make no mistake. Under the one-size-fits- all healthcare legislation offered by Senator Bernie Sanders and so  many Democrats running for President, this high-quality health  insurance program and their insurance will cease to exist.   It is no wonder that last year some high-profile public sector unions  started sounding the alarm about losing their health benefits. When New  York State debated a Sanders-like proposal to take over healthcare, who  raised the loudest objections? Well, it was the public sector unions,  of course.   So again, we have millions of union workers, Federal and State  employees, and their families, all with excellent healthcare benefits  that are on the Democrats' chopping block. Instead of helping fix the  Nation's healthcare problems, Democrats are looking to destroy what is  actually working.   Remember, it is more than union workers and public sector employees  who are threatened. Democrats' one-size-fits-all healthcare plan is  gunning for retired military members' health insurance as well. We are  talking about the TRICARE health insurance program for military  families. There are more than 9 million military families enrolled in  TRICARE. Our servicemembers have earned their TRICARE coverage through  years of faithful service defending this Nation. I believe one of our  greatest responsibilities is to provide for those who protect this  Nation, both those who currently serve and our retired servicemembers.   Back home in Wyoming I talk with servicemembers, with veterans,  nearly every weekend. These proud Americans want me to make sure that  TRICARE works for them and to protect and strengthen benefits that work  and that they have earned through their service. Still, far-left  Democrats don't want to listen to reason. They are hell-bent on a one- size-fits-all approach to healthcare.   It is especially ironic that Democrats even want to ban ObamaCare  plans--the plans they voted for and put in place. It has been less than  a decade since Democrats passed ObamaCare, and now they want to repeal  it and replace it, basically saying that ObamaCare has failed.   For years I have come to the floor to discuss the shortcomings of  ObamaCare. Every time Republicans have offered to improve healthcare,  we have heard from the Democrats that ObamaCare is off-limits and they  can't possibly make any changes to that law. Now that the Democrats are  running for President, suddenly they are singing a different tune. They  are done defending ObamaCare. In fact, Democrats are happy to repeal  ObamaCare so they can replace it with a one-size-fits-all healthcare  plan for America.   Senator Heitkamp is actually warning them not to cast aside ObamaCare  and start all over again with a one-size-fits-all plan.   Well, let me just say as a doctor, as a physician who has taken care  of patients for decades, my focus continues to be on improving  healthcare for American patients and their families. Americans want to  focus on real healthcare reforms that make a difference for them and  their families in terms of the cost and in terms of the quality of  their care. These are the issues that Republicans are working on right  now: protecting patients with  [[Page S2864]]  preexisting conditions, lowering prescription drug costs, and ending  surprise medical bills.   Surprise medical bills are bills patients receive that come out of  nowhere. These bills are an unfair financial burden on many families,  completely unexpected medical costs that they can't afford and aren't  expecting. Just last week I was at the White House with President Trump  announcing a plan to help patients by ending these surprise bills.   Republicans also remain committed to protecting patients with  preexisting conditions and to lowering the cost of prescription drugs.   Democrats have a choice to make. They can follow the far-left  Democrats pushing their radical one-size-fits-all approach to  healthcare. Again, this extreme scheme will mean the loss of health  insurance coverage for millions and millions and millions of hard- working people, union workers and their families, our veterans, people  who helped protect and save this country, Federal and State employees  and their families, and all of the Americans who are currently enrolled  in ObamaCare plans.   The better option for Democrats is to work with Republicans on  commonsense, bipartisan solutions, real reforms that improve healthcare  for all Americans. Let's reject one-size-fits-all healthcare that will  make Americans pay more to wait longer for worse care.   That is the key. One-size-fits-all healthcare, I will tell people  listening in today, means that you will pay more to wait longer for  worse care. It is time to reject one-size-fits-all care for Americans.  Let us work together to give all patients the care they need from a  doctor they choose at a lower cost.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.
