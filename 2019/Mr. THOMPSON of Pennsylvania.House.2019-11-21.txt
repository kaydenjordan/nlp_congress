 Madam Speaker, service plays an  important role in communities across the Nation. From small acts of  kindness to grand gestures, we can all do our part to make a  difference. It is something I am personally passionate about, having  served as a volunteer firefighter for many years and being involved in  scouting my entire life.   Nobody embodies this mission better than the countless volunteers and  service organizations that can be found nationwide. That is why I am  honored to co-chair the Congressional Service Organization Caucus with  my colleague, Congressman Panetta from California.   The Congressional Service Organization Caucus is a group of Members  who not only support their local volunteer service organizations but  share a mutual admiration for community service and humanitarian  assistance.   The spirit of service is something that both Republicans and  Democrats can come together to champion. That is why Congressman  Panetta and I are asking for the support of our colleagues in joining  this caucus and upholding our support for these organizations and the  communities that they serve.                            ____________________
