 Madam Speaker, 18 days before this Nation turns its  eyes toward a beautiful recognition--for those of us who practice the  understanding of the birth of our Lord--Christmas--and the many other  faiths that will celebrate their special days in their own way-- Brittney Griner still remains incarcerated in the most devastating,  horrific, cruel, and brutal conditions. She must come home, along with  Paul Whelan.   At the same time, I stand with the defenders of democracy, Ukraine,  and hope that we will provide the resources necessary and be able to  accept their fight for democracy while our former President asks to  suspend our Constitution. Let us do the support for Ukraine and not  suspend the Constitution.   Finally, ravaging floods are still plaguing the people of Pakistan.  We have asked for $600 million. They deserve those dollars to be able  to restore their lives--pregnant women, families, farmers suffering and  starving. It is necessary, as an ally of the United States, that we try  to respond in this funding cycle now--dollars needed for Pakistan.   I look forward to working with the administration to provide the  relief that they need. We are a Nation of caring and humanitarianism.   Bring Brittney Griner home now.                            ____________________
