 Mr. Speaker, tonight we are going to be  talking about the leading causes of death in the United States. I just  want to go over this because I think sometimes we become disillusioned  with what is actually happening.   The National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention reports on the leading causes of death in the  United States but does not include abortion among their list of causes  of death.   Here is an accurate representation of the leading causes of death for  2019, which includes the number one cause of death. That is abortion.  Also, deaths due to COVID in 2020 and 2021 are included for comparison.   You start off with suicide or intentional self-harm, 47,511 Americans  died.   Influenza and pneumonia, 49,783 Americans died.   Nephritis and nephrotic syndrome, kidney disease, 51,665 died from  that.   Diabetes, 87,647.   Alzheimer's disease, 121,499 deaths.   Stroke, 150,005 deaths.   Chronic lower respiratory, 156,979 deaths.   Accidents, 172,040 deaths.   Cancer, 599,601 deaths.   COVID, 656,488, and that is 18 months total.   Heart disease, 659,041.   And we all know about these deaths because you cannot watch TV or  listen to any news when you are not constantly hearing about what  people in America are dying from because it is a crisis for us.   Abortion, 849,000.   All the data are from one year, 2019, except for COVID. Deaths in the  United States of America from COVID reached 528,600 at the one-year  mark of March 2020 to March 2021, but the entire 18-month death toll  is included in the comparison above.    More unborn babies died daily from abortion in the United States of  America than born children and adults from the COVID pandemic.   We are asked to wear masks, we are asked to social distance, we are  asked to self-quarantine. What we aren't asked is to address deaths by  decision. Abortions.   I would like to suggest that, not only all Members of this Congress,  but the 330 million Americans that we represent, if they have the  opportunity to do it, call their parents and thank them for being pro- life.   How can we possibly be debating on this floor the destruction of life  by a decision, not from a disease but from a decision?   849,000 souls cry out to us. They cannot defend themselves, but we  can defend them. We will pass a law--it will get passed here on this  floor.   And people will say: Well, you don't understand. You know what,  Kelly, I am really not for abortion, it is not my personal preference,  but gosh darn it, it is what the Supreme Court issued.   I tell all those Members, you have a voting card that is actually  your personal preference and your decision. Please do not try to fool  the American people about what is taking place right here in this  House, the people's House, and say that somehow your personal  preference would not be to see all these children aborted, but there is  nothing you can do about it.   Yes, there is. Vote the right way. Turn this down. Abortion right up  until birth? Are you kidding me? How in the world can we ever talk  about ourselves as being a Judeo-Christian moral country whenever we do  things like this?   Mr. Speaker, I just hope that America wakes up and looks at what is  taking place right now and says, not on our watch, not ever on our  watch, not at this time or any time. The greatest country in the world,  the greatest nation in the world, the greatest protector of freedom and  liberty cannot sit back and blindly accept what is happening in our  country.                                time  1945
