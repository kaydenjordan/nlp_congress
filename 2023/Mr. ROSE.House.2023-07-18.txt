 Madam Speaker, about 20 miles outside my district, in  Franklin, Tennessee, a 63-year-old is facing some of the worst charges  on the books, including assault and rape. It breaks my heart to say  these crimes involved children as young as 9 years old. Investigators  have identified several victims, but they are asking more to come  forward as some of these crimes go back more than a decade. Police say  the accused predator targeted playgrounds and lured young boys under  the guise that he was a soccer coach recruiting for his team.   Days after this news broke, families learned the man accused of  violating their community, their children, had lived there for 20 years  but had no business being there. The accused man is an illegal  immigrant.   I signed a letter, joined by Members of the Tennessee delegation, led  by Senator Marsha Blackburn, asking the Department of Homeland Security  Secretary Mayorkas several questions, including why this man was able  to go under the radar for so long.   This is a very grim example of the very real consequences open border  policies are having on State after State, county after county,  community after community.   Nearly 20,000 pounds of fentanyl have been seized at the border since  this fiscal year started last October. That is already more than last  fiscal year's total, and we still have more than 2 months left in this  one. Furthermore, since October 1, Customs and Border Protection  officials have caught more than 125 people trying to cross the southern  border who are on the terrorist watch list.   No one in this body should glaze over a number like that. Let me  repeat: 125 possible terrorists have tried to enter our country since  last October. That is just the number we know about. That is more than  fiscal years 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 combined. How many, we  might ask, have managed to cross that we don't know about?   We know, for example, that 1.5 million illegal immigrants have  successfully evaded law enforcement since this administration took over  the border. How many of that 1.5 million were, in fact, terrorists? How  many were smuggling drugs that will kill our young people? How many are  sexual offenders who will abuse our children?   Yet, in May, the Biden administration announced it would be releasing  a flood of immigrants into the United States with no way of keeping  track of them. Instead of getting a grip on this humanitarian and  national security crisis, this President and his administration have  been busy fighting title 42 and the Trump-era remain in Mexico policy.  To be fair, the President did make his first-ever trip to the border,  in his 50-year political career, in January.   As we continue to see records being broken, crime soaring, fentanyl  popping up in all corners of our country and taking the lives of an  entire generation of young people, overdose deaths rising, Madam  Speaker, I rise today to once again implore President Biden and  Secretary Mayorkas to do their constitutional duty and secure our  southern border.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, the American people heard a stunning testimony  from Special Counsel John Durham last week during a House Judiciary  Committee hearing on his report examining the origins of the FBI's  Crossfire Hurricane investigation against then-Presidential candidate  Donald Trump.   During the committee hearing, Special Counsel Durham testified that  the FBI did not have an adequate predicate to launch the investigation,  the FBI failed to examine exculpatory evidence and interview key  witnesses, and the FBI abused its Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  authorities. Special Counsel Durham also said that he was not aware of  any evidence of collusion between President Trump's 2016 campaign and  Russia.   As an attorney, I am alarmed by these revelations. The good folks of  middle Tennessee deserve better from our country's premier law  enforcement agency. House Republicans will do everything in our power  to ensure our law enforcement institutions are carrying out the law  equally so that we can end the two-tiered justice system in this  country.                            ____________________
