 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the United States and Mongolia have a robust  relationship, distinguished by our shared democratic ideals and  strengthened by close economic and diplomatic cooperation.   This year marks the 30th anniversary of democracy in Mongolia.  Mongolia was the first nation in Asia to transition from communism to  democracy, marking an important juncture in the continent's history.   Years later, Mongolia remains an important democratic partner in the  Indo-Pacific but finds itself in a challenging location, sandwiched  entirely between Russia and China. What happens in Mongolia has direct  implications for the United States. If malign actors compromise  Mongolia's territorial integrity or ability to pursue independent  foreign policy, the security of the United States is also at risk.   I have consistently warned about the Chinese Communist Party's malign  activity around the world as the former chairman and current ranking  member of the House Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation  Subcommittee. I was also encouraged to see the recommendations released  this year by the China Task Force.   After months of classified and unclassified briefings, the China Task  Force released a report with 82 key findings and more than 400 forward- looking recommendations. Many of these focus on the CCP's predatory  Belt and Road Initiative, which is infamous for its debt trap  diplomacy.   Mongolia is a formal participant in this initiative, and China  currently supplies the largest portion of their foreign investment.  This is why it is essential that the U.S. continue to develop our  strategic partnership with Mongolia. We must be their most meaningful  third neighbor, and that term describes the Mongolian relationship with  countries other than China and Russia.   One of the ways we can do this is by strengthening Mongolia from  within by supporting small and medium enterprises and industries like  the cashmere production.   This past year, I reintroduced the Mongolia Third Neighbor Trade Act,  which would allow duty-free entry of Mongolian cashmere into the United  States. This one bill would create over 50,000 jobs, it is estimated,  in Mongolia, primarily women jobs, at a cost less than $1 million over  a 10-year period to the American taxpayers.   The cashmere wool industry is particularly important to Mongolia's  economy; but while Mongolia produces over one-third of the world's  cashmere, almost all finished products are processed and exported from  China. Duty-free entry for the United States' imports of Mongolian  cashmere would benefit the United States by facilitating increased  trade with Mongolia and reducing U.S. imports of Chinese cashmere  products. The measure would likewise benefit Mongolia by reducing  Mongolia's economic dependence on China and promoting the development  of Mongolia's garment industry, an industry in which 90 percent of  workers are women.   We must also offer a better alternative through initiatives like the  Third Neighbor Trade Act and this resolution. That is exactly what this  bill does by reaffirming our relationship with our like-minded partner,  Mongolia. We will never allow adversaries to undermine peace and  stability in the Indo-Pacific region.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, for over three decades, the relationship  between the United States and Mongolia has continued to grow and  strengthen. Mongolia is a strong democratic partner in the Indo- Pacific, and the United States has become an important third neighbor.   I would like to congratulate the Mongolian people on their 30th  anniversary of democracy and look forward to continuing to build our  partnership.   Mongolia's success as a democracy and continued sovereignty is  extremely relevant to the security of the United States, the Indo- Pacific region, and the world. For this reason, Mr. Speaker, I urge my  colleagues to support this resolution, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the right to practice one's faith is the most  fundamental freedom there is. There is a reason our Founding Fathers  made it the First Amendment: Our Founders understood that someone's  right to worship was sacred and should belong to all people regardless  of their faith.   If religious freedom is taken away, all other freedoms are subject to  being taken away also. It is just that simple.   Unfortunately, religious freedom still does not exist everywhere.  Today, religious minorities are persecuted all over the globe.   According to the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom,  about one-third of the countries around the world still have laws  against blasphemy. In many dictatorships, people are not allowed to  worship anything but the state. To do so would be seen as a threat to  the government because they do not recognize a higher power.   As a result, religious minorities are targeted in some countries with  severe brutality. People are being beaten, arrested, and tortured.  Houses of worship are razed and destroyed. In countries like Iran,  Pakistan, and others, ascribing to a different religion could mean the  death penalty. In other places, it can mean forced labor or a public  whipping.   This is simply unacceptable. Today, the House has an opportunity to  stand up for religious freedom around the world.   This is an important resolution. This resolution makes the repeal of  blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy laws a priority everywhere. It  designates countries that enforce such laws as countries of particular  concern for religious freedom and calls on all governments to release  religious prisoners of conscience.   The United States has always been a leader when it comes to religious  freedom. Today, we have a chance to lead again and to tell the world  that we will not stand for religious intolerance.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support H. Res. 512, and I  yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1230     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this body is no stranger to the human rights abuses  committed by the Iranian regime. The Islamic Republic of Iran is the  world's largest state sponsor of terror and has regularly attacked and  detained those who disagree with them, including even their own people  and American citizens.   Today, we focus on the regime's religious persecution of the Baha'i,  Iran's largest religious minority group. The Baha'i in Iran are  regularly subject to arbitrary interrogations and arrests without due  process. They are often denied employment and access to higher  education. Their cemeteries have been vandalized, and many of their  leaders have been executed. Moreover, Iranian state media publishes  anti-Baha'i hate propaganda, exposing them to prejudices and even  potentially violent attacks by their neighbors.   Mr. Speaker, the Trump administration has admirably used sanctions to  punish Iran's human rights abusers, but we cannot let up until all  people in Iran, including the Baha'i, have the right to practice their  faith freely. With this resolution, we vow to continue to hold human  rights abusers accountable, including those who target the Baha'i.   The Iranian regime must end their persecution of the Baha'i by  releasing those who have been illegally imprisoned, by ending their  hate-filled propaganda campaign against the Baha'i, and by reversing  policies that the Baha'is equal opportunity.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot).    Mr. Speaker, one of the principles this country was founded  upon was the freedom to worship. This is a right that people all around  the world should have, including the people of Iran. Resolutions like  this remind the world that the United States of America will not turn a  blind eye to religious persecution.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch) and the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson) for their leadership in  introducing this bipartisan resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support H. Res. 823, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
