 Mr. Speaker, over the last year, Republicans and Democrats  have worked together on numerous occasions to provide COVID relief for  the American people. Unfortunately, this bill was not that way. This  legislation is a completely partisan bill that has yet to receive one  Republican vote in either the House or the Senate.   This spending bill will appropriate nearly $2 trillion at a time in  which we still have $1 trillion in unspent funding from previous relief  bills. This bill will be passed at a time in which our economy is  growing, in which unemployment is dropping, in a time which Americans  are being vaccinated.   Instead of prioritizing public health needs or focusing on reopening  our  [[Page H1270]]  economy, reopening our schools, or even securing our border, we will be  voting to add almost $2 trillion to our national debt; but most of the  spending is going to fulfill campaign promises and fund the agenda of  the far left.   We must reject this partisan bill that even many Democrats admit is  the most progressive legislation in the last quarter century, and  Congress must instead focus on working together for the good of the  American people.
