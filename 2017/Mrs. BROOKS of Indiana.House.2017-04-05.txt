 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn  yesterday's deadly chemical attack in Syria.   Early yesterday morning, while most people were asleep in the rebel- held city of Khan Shaykhun, airstrikes hit, carrying what is suspected  to be poisonous gas. These airstrikes are believed to be the work of  the Syrian Government or its ally, Russia.   According to the AP, at least 72, if not up to 100 people, including  at least 10 children, were killed and hundreds more injured. Entire  families were found dead in their homes, and healthcare workers who  rushed to help others were also overcome by the poison. A second  airstrike hit near a hospital where victims were being treated.   The Assad regime's continued use of chemical weapons on its own  people, innocent families, and children is despicable, and this is not  the first time. Besides these unspeakable, horrific acts against  innocent people since the Syrian civil war began 6 years ago, more than  11 million Syrians--half of the country's prewar population--have been  displaced from their homes.   The urgency of this situation cannot be denied. We can no longer  ignore the  [[Page H2702]]  continued abuse and killing of the Syrian people. We must take  meaningful action to empower the Syrian people and remove Assad from  power.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks, and include extraneous materials on the topic of my Special  Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Indiana?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks, and include extraneous materials on the topic of my Special  Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Indiana?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the  first woman elected to Congress, Jeannette Rankin. 100 years ago this  week, on April 2, 1917, Jeannette Rankin inspired millions of Americans  when she became the first woman in the Nation's history to serve in the  United States House of Representatives.   It is hard for me to believe, but Jeannette Rankin served in Congress  before women had the national right to vote in this country. In fact,  it was a driving force behind her decision to run for elected office.  Upon her historic election in November 1916, she declared: ``I may be  the first woman Member of Congress, but I won't be the last.''   The women who have joined me here, and are going to join me here on  the floor this afternoon, are her living legacy, along with the more  than 300 women who have served in Congress before us.   Representative Rankin, a Republican from Montana, served two terms in  Congress; the first term from 1917 to 1918, and the second term from  1941 to 1942.   Because of Rankin's groundbreaking achievement 100 years ago,  hundreds of women from across the country have made history in  Congress, drawing attention to the pressing issues of their time and  creating policies that have impacted generations of Americans. We are  as diverse as the districts we represent, and I am pleased to be joined  on the floor by my fellow women in Congress to celebrate this important  milestone.   In recognition of her work and the rich history of women in Congress,  Members of Congress from across the country, across party lines, will  be rising to honor Representative Rankin and to share what 100 years of  women in Congress means to them.   Mr. Speaker, with that said, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida  (Ms. Frankel), my friend and co-chair of the Congressional Women's  Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Frankel  for her remarks and for reminding us that often while those of us in  this arena might be called names, we are a strong voice. She was a very  serious  [[Page H2735]]  legislator, as are you. I just want to thank you for your leadership in  this body and thank you for being a part of honoring the 100 years of  women in the House.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs.  McMorris Rodgers), my friend, our Republican Conference chair, the  fourth highest Republican in the House, and also the highest ranking  woman in Congress. I welcome her to discuss and honor Jeannette Rankin.   Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, a big ``thank you'' to Susan  Brooks and Lois Frankel, co-chairs of the Women's Caucus for this  Congress, for bringing us all together to celebrate Jeannette Rankin.   This body, the people's House, is the heart of representative  government, and it functions best when everyone, no matter their  background or their walk of life, has a voice. And 100 years ago,  Jeannette Rankin gave women that voice. She shattered a glass ceiling  here in Congress and paved the way for more than 300 women to lead and  to serve.   As she famously said: ``I may be the first woman Member of Congress,  but I won't be the last.''   And she was right. We now have 104 women serving the Halls of  Congress, more than any other time in history. Today, women play key  roles in all areas of policymaking. We are involved in the budget, tax  reform, education, health care, and national security. Every day, women  bring their unique perspectives, talents, and passions into the  national debate, and remind us that all issues are women's issues.  Everything we have accomplished as women leaders: the first female  speaker, the first female committee chairman, the first African- American woman; and Latinas; the first women to have children while  serving in Congress. All of these advances and milestones were made  possible by the bravery of women in the early 20th century.   Rankin had the courage to say: Why not me?   She had the courage to step up and be the first, and she couldn't  even vote in the election, but she won and stood in this very Chamber  and spoke her mind. I find it incredibly moving. It is so powerful.   She was a trailblazer, and she really set the standard for women. She  stood strong in her beliefs when everyone around her challenged her  ideas, her methods, even her very presence.    This is the example everyone in the Chamber should be setting--is  setting for the next generation of women leaders. Fortunately, we have  a strong foundation. We are following in the footsteps of so many  inspiring women: Jeannette Rankin, Edith Rogers, Clare Boothe Luce,  Coya Knutson, Lindy Boggs, Jennifer Dunn, to name a few. The women in  this room and the hundreds that came before us show the world that  women have something unique, something special to offer the world.   I am reminded of this each time I look at my two young girls, Grace  and Brynn; and I look at them and I see so much boundless potential.  That is why I view this centennial, this milestone, so much bigger than  Congress. It is not a date on the calendar. It is a celebration of the  American spirit. Our country is the place where you can imagine what is  possible, and then go out and make it happen.   Our government is where good ideas, no matter their source, can be  debated, considered, and crafted into law, and where our ideas and  values can have real and positive impact on millions of lives.   I want my daughters to know that not only should they take a seat at  the table, but that there is a seat reserved for them. I want them to  know that when they speak, the world should listen; that when they act,  it is with purpose; and when they lead, they can change the world.   After 100 years, we stand on the shoulders of giants, but we stand  there to lift up the next generation higher than ourselves. We stand  there so that every woman has a voice and has an opportunity to be  legendary, and so that women can keep making history for many years to  come.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman so very  much, and I am so inspired by the fact that the gentlewoman is the  first woman to have given birth to three children while serving in  Congress, also her service in her State legislature before and her role  in leadership in this body. I just want to thank her very much for  being a part of this.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs.  Lawrence), my friend from the State to the north of Indiana, and would  turn it over to her for any thoughts she might have celebrating 100  years of women in Congress.                                time  1630     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman  from Michigan for her work as vice chair of the bipartisan Women's  Caucus. I also want to thank her so much for partnering with me and  visiting a school in Detroit where my son was a student teacher. I will  forever remember our partnership visiting with those kids at Davison  Elementary and want to thank her for that.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman  from Michigan for her work as vice chair of the bipartisan Women's  Caucus. I also want to thank her so much for partnering with me and  visiting a school in Detroit where my son was a student teacher. I will  forever remember our partnership visiting with those kids at Davison  Elementary and want to thank her for that.    I now yield to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Mimi Walters), the other vice chair of the Women's  Caucus, my friend.   Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my  fellow female Members of the House of Representatives to pay tribute to  Jeannette Rankin, the first woman elected to the U.S. House of  Representatives 100 years ago.   A mere 4 years after Congresswoman Rankin's landmark election, three  more women were elected to Congress, including Mae Ella Nolan.   Congresswoman Nolan was not only the first woman from California to  be elected to Congress, she was also the first woman to chair a  congressional committee.   Mr. Speaker, now a century after Jeannette Rankin was sworn into  Congress, it is not enough to simply recognize the significant  contributions  [[Page H2736]]  women have made throughout history, we must also look to the future.   We have made significant strides in this country, but more are  needed. Women represent over 50 percent of the population, yet we still  face significant obstacles in the workplace, academia, and elsewhere.  That is why we must work together to expand opportunities, remove  barriers, and empower the next generation of women.   We must always remember that we stand on the shoulders of those who  came before us and fought for equality--equality of opportunity, not- quality of outcome.   As we strive to make our country stronger for the next generation, we  must continue to fight so that each woman has an equal opportunity to  compete and to excel based on her abilities and accomplishments.   I want to thank the co-chairs of the Congressional Women's Caucus,  Congresswoman Brooks, and Congresswoman Frankel, for sponsoring this  Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman  from California for spending time with us and talking about the women  who came before us who fought for equality, who fought for us, and  women like Jeannette Rankin who actually fought so hard that she fought  her way here before women had the right to vote in this country.   Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman from California, too, has served in her  State legislature, and I want to commend her for her service and being  a role model for so many people in her State.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to another gentlewoman from the State of  California (Ms. Speier), who, in my time here in Congress, I have  observed has fought on behalf of women and girls and has fought, in  particular, with respect to issues involving sexual violence and other  violence against women. I want to commend her for that work.   Mr. Speaker, I would love to hear her thoughts on the 100 years of  women in Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  California for sharing the trials and tribulations of a woman who came  before us. As she said, as I look throughout our Chamber, the  descriptions of her as grand and eloquent and deep-thinking really  remind me of so many of the women who we serve with currently today.   She certainly went through difficult elections and put herself in the  arena which can be very difficult.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California for sharing that  story, and I thank her for being here.   I would like to welcome the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Black),  my good friend, and actually the chair of the Budget Committee. I have  long admired her career since joining the conference, and I just want  to thank her for being here and look forward to anything she might  share with us about her thoughts about women serving for 100 years here  in Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman  from Tennessee for spending her time with us today. I think her story  coming from, as she said, public housing, and I think over time because  of education and because of opportunities in this country, and she  started the business, she got her nursing degree, she started a  business before coming here to Congress, served in her State  Legislature as well, I know she is a mom, she is a grandmother, she has  been an incredible voice here in the House, and she really does show  that everything is possible in this country. Yet I really appreciate  her acknowledging that we are standing on the shoulders of the women  who came before us.                                time  1645    I just want to thank the gentlewoman, and I know other women in  Tennessee serve as well. The chair of my subcommittee, Congresswoman  Marsha Blackburn, is serving as chair of the Communications and  Technology Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee, and there  have just been terrific folks that have come from Tennessee.    Absolutely. As Congresswoman McMorris Rodgers  mentioned, there needs to be a seat reserved at the table here in the  House. And I certainly know that women on both sides of the aisle, like  yourselves, are mentors to other women in other legislative bodies and  in other elected offices, encouraging them to come to this body, and so  I just want to thank you for that.   We come from all parts of this country to talk about women here  serving in the House over the last 100 years. While I come from the  Midwest, we heard from the West Coast, Cathy McMorris Rodgers. We heard  from the other Midwest Member, Brenda Lawrence from Michigan, the great  State of California, but I don't think anyone comes as far to serve in  the House of Representatives as the next Member I am about to  introduce.   Congresswoman Amata Coleman Radewagen joins us from American Samoa,  so she represents a territory and travels tremendous distances to be  here in this body each and every week that we are in session.   I have really enjoyed getting to know you as a Member. With the  beautiful reminder of the flower that you wear regularly here in this  body, you remind us of the incredibly beautiful place from which you  come and the proud people that you represent. I look forward to hearing  your remarks.   I yield to the gentlewoman from American Samoa (Mrs. Radewagen).    Mr. Speaker, I just want to commend the  gentlewoman as well for being an incredible role model, not only for  the young women of American Samoa, but for the young men of American  Samoa because, as I have often said, we need to also bring along the  young men to support young women who choose to run for office. I assume  the gentlewoman had many of them in her election getting involved and  helping her come to this place and be a voice for American Samoa.   I know the gentlewoman's work on the Veterans' Affairs Committee,  that she has continued to be a strong voice for the men and women of  our armed services and veterans, and I want to thank her for that fine  work.   At this time, I welcome a new friend and a new colleague to talk  about the women in Congress, someone whom I have just recently met,  Congressman Raskin from the great State of Maryland. I welcome him to  this body and to the Chamber and any thoughts that he might want to  share. I know that he comes from the academic world prior to coming  here, as a professor. And for anything the gentleman might want to  share with us on his thoughts on women serving in Congress, I yield to  the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    I thank the gentleman for speaking out and  for being here today.   I think that we do have a long way to go. There are many initiatives  that are being undertaken around the country. The gentleman's offer or  suggestion of a multi-Member district is certainly not one that I am  familiar with. I know that often our party organizations require it to  have gender balance, certainly in political organizations many times.  But that is certainly a concept that I am not familiar with.   But I will say that, as a new Member of Congress, I think and am  hopeful that, as you work in your committee work, you will meet the  incredible women in the body who serve currently. We, both sides of the  aisle, are constantly recruiting and asking more women to consider  serving.   Often, our State legislatures or city councils and other places are  wonderful places to seek out women to continue to serve in office, and  it is because of terrific colleagues like the gentleman who add so  much. I know he is already adding to this body in a significant way,  and I want to thank him for honoring Jeannette Rankin.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to talk a little bit more, because it was  97 years ago that the 19th Amendment granted women the right to vote. I  want you to think about this once again.   Jeannette Rankin was elected to Congress before she could even vote,  before women had the right to vote. And can you imagine being elected  before women across the country could really cast a ballot? That is  pretty incredible and pretty historic.   She had a vision that women in Congress would one day be equal to the  number of men, their male colleagues. Now, unfortunately, 100 years  later, we are still far short of that goal. The reality is that many  women today are still making history by just running for elected  office, just like Congresswoman Rankin did 100 years ago.   As you may or may not know, I am the Congresswoman from the Fifth  Congressional District of Indiana. I represent Hoosier communities in  eight urban, suburban, and rural counties in central Indiana.   What you may not know is that, when I was elected in 2012 along with  my colleague Congresswoman Jackie Walorski, we were the first  Republican women to represent the State of Indiana in Congress in more  than 50 years. By running and winning, Jackie and I were making history  for the Indiana Republican Party, and we joined a proud tradition of  Hoosier women across both sides of the aisle who served our State in  government roles at every level since our State's founding 200 years  ago.   It was in 1851 that women in Indiana, in response to the failure of  an amendment to our State constitution to give married women equal  rights to property, formed the Women's Rights Association of Indiana.  This group worked for the next 70 years to achieve women's suffrage.   It is important that women recognize the success of other women,  because we didn't get here on our own, and encourage and support each  other to break through those barriers. The women that have come before  us have set the groundwork for us to continue building upon.   Since winning the right to vote, seven women from Indiana have  represented Indiana in Congress. That is only seven, and that includes  me. I would like to highlight just some of the accomplishments of the  Hoosier women who came before me.   Virginia Ellis Jenckes was a widow who managed her late husband's  farm on the Wabash River. Serving as her own campaign manager, and with  her 19-year-old daughter as her driver, Jenckes logged 15,000 miles on  a districtwide speaking tour before her election in 1933, unseating a  16-year veteran Congressman to become the first female to represent  Indiana in Washington. In Congress, she advocated for stronger flood  control measures, as well as for American farmers, veterans,  and workers.    In 1949, Representative Cecil Murray Harden became the first  Republican woman elected to represent Indiana. She believed that women  had an important role to play in politics. She famously said earlier in  her career: ``The more interest you take in politics, the more you meet  your responsibilities as a citizen.'' She served for five terms and  pushed for more women to become engaged in and consider running for  public office. And, in fact, I was pleased that her great-granddaughter  was involved in my first run for office.   In 1982, Representative Katie Hall became the first African-American  woman from Indiana to be elected to Congress. Democratic Representative  Hall supported measures to reduce unemployment, to address crime,  family debt and bankruptcy, and alcohol and drug abuse. She is best  remembered for introducing and working to enact legislation to make Dr.  Martin Luther King, Jr.'s birthday a Federal holiday.   The fourth female elected to represent our State in Congress,  Representative Jill Long Thompson, earned the nickname ``Jill  Longshot'' when she became the first woman to earn the nomination of a  major party for a U.S. Senate seat in Indiana in 1986. Although her bid  was unsuccessful, she went on to win a seat in the House in 1989. She  served three terms in Congress, focusing on efforts to help Hoosier  farmers.   She continued this work first as Under Secretary of Agriculture for  Rural Development under President Clinton and then as Board Chair and  CEO of the Farm Credit Administration under President Obama.   After nearly 20 years in the Indiana Legislature and as Center  Township trustee, where she erased the city's welfare agency debt,  Democratic Representative Julia Carson, the grandmother of our own  colleague now, Congressman Andre Carson, was elected to represent our  State capital city of Indianapolis. She was the first African American  and first woman to represent the city in Congress, and she served for  12 years. A staunch and passionate advocate for the poor, she focused  on helping people achieve financial literacy and supported working  families.                                time  1700    In 2013, Indiana sent two Republican women to Congress for the first  time in more than 50 years. I am proud to be serving in Congress  alongside my good friend, Representative Jackie Walorski. Born in South  Bend, Jackie served our State as a member of the Indiana State House of  Representatives and in Congress. She has been an advocate for  commonsense solutions to growing our economy and strengthening our  national security from the beginning.   Hoosier women have certainly left their marks in America's history  book, but as I stand here today, I am struck by, quite frankly, how  much work we still have to do. Indiana is one of only 22 States that  hasn't yet sent a female United States Senator to Washington. As you  have heard today, 19.4 percent of the seats in the House and Senate are  held by women.   A lot has been accomplished by women like Representative Jeannette  Rankin--four women in the past 100 years--and, today, I want to  encourage all of us to consider how much further we can go in the next  100 years.   I am pleased that another colleague, a freshman from the great State  of Washington, is joining a previous Congresswoman, Cathy McMorris  Rodgers, from the State of Washington, who was here earlier. I was  pleased to meet Representative Jayapal at our first Women's Caucus  meeting. I want to welcome the gentlewoman. The gentlewoman has been an  incredibly strong advocate on behalf of women in her career prior to  coming to Congress, representing Seattle and the surrounding area, and  I would welcome a discussion.   I want to welcome the gentlewoman as a new member in the freshman  class. Many women have joined the gentlewoman in this freshman class. I  want to welcome the gentlewoman to our celebration of 100 years of  women in Congress.    I thank the gentlewoman so very much for  coming here today.   I think the gentlewoman has reminded us that we are a body that  reflects the country, and the gentlewoman, indicating that she was not  born in this country, yet she is an incredible role model for so many  young men and women. As I have said previously, I think it is important  for the young men of this country, regardless of where they were born,  who now live in this country, to see that women like the gentlewoman  are a strong voice in this body.   While the gentlewoman mentioned that there have been about 11,000  people who have served in this body, there have only been about 300  women. We have a long way to go.   I also want to thank the gentlewoman for sharing her work with Ileana  Ros-Lehtinen, who has been in Congress serving this body, a female who  has been here longer than any other female in this body. She does  tremendous work. She has been chairwoman of the Foreign Affairs  Committee and continues to be a strong--I assume the gentlewoman is  serving with her on that committee.    I think the gentlewoman helps demonstrate  that very often we find colleagues, female colleagues across the aisle,  to work on issues together, whether it is on legislation, cosponsoring  legislation or co-leading legislation, whether it is leading discussion  groups here in the House, or whether it is leading letters to the  agency heads in the executive branch and letting them know that we  stand together on those issues.   So I look forward to working with the gentlewoman here in this body,  and I want to thank the gentlewoman for her time and her thoughts.   At this time, I would like to wrap up by sharing that we see that  women have taken on leadership roles like all of the women who have  spoken here during this past hour. In many ways, these women have all  made history in their own rights in their communities, in their States,  in their districts, and in this body. We should celebrate each of their  accomplishments.   As Cathy McMorris Rodgers from the great State of Washington said, we  want to ensure that our daughters and our granddaughters have seats  reserved at the tables, have seats here in this body in the future, and  that eventually this body better reflects the composition of our  country where, actually, more than 50 percent of our population is  women. We need to do what we can to encourage women to continue to seek  out leadership opportunities at all levels, whether it is working in  student government in their schools, whether it is working in student  government in their colleges and universities, whether it is having a  leadership role in their church group, or whether it is having a  leadership role in their neighborhood group or in their Y or in their  4-H.   All of these things can help give them the skills to then go on,  whether it is in their local communities, in city halls or in their  local city councils or county councils, or in their neighborhood  associations, or in State legislatures and then, really, coming to this  body, because women do have strong, serious, and thoughtful voices. The  women before us certainly had that. It was proud pioneers like  Jeannette Rankin who came to this body before women had the right to  vote. I want to continue to celebrate their accomplishments. The fact  that women are still making history by participating in politics is a  sign that we still have far to go.   I want to thank all of the women and the gentleman from Maryland who  participated in celebrating Jeannette Rankin.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend Women's Caucus  Chairs: Susan Brooks and Lois Frankel, for hosting this bipartisan  special order focused on the Achievements and Importance of Women in  Congress.   I am proud to be a Woman Member of Congress representing the great  state of Texas.   And, as a member of the Women's Caucus, I am proud to be an original  co-sponsor of Congresswoman Brooks' commemorative resolution which  honors the life and legacy of the first woman to serve in i the United  States Congress, Jeannette Pickering Rankin, on the l00th anniversary  of her swearing-in to Congress, who famously said ``I may be the first  woman in Congress, but I won't be the last.''   It is critical today that we take pause to highlight the importance  and contributions of women Members in Congress; as well as:   1. Recognize the importance of the Suffragette Movement in achieving  opportunities for women;   2. Emphasize the imperative of promoting education for women in STEM;  and   3. Affirm our nation's commitment to expanding opportunities for  women in my home state of Texas and across the country.   This year marks the 100th anniversary of the first woman being  elected to Congress, Representative Jeannette Rankin of Montana.   This resolution is a fitting way to honor Representative Rankin's  legacy, and to celebrate the many contributions of the female lawmakers  who have succeeded her in this institution.  [[Page H2740]]    Jeannette Rankin was a trailblazer who broke barriers throughout her  lifetime and whose example continues to inspire women the world over.   She graduated from the University of Montana with a biology degree in  1902.   She later became active in the women's suffrage movement, organizing  the New York Women's Suffrage Party and working for the National  American Woman Suffrage Association.   In 1916, Representative Rankin became the first woman elected to  Congress, even before the ratification of the 19th Amendment, which  guaranteed the right to vote to women.   For all of her contributions to women's rights, to political  activism, and to this institution, it is only fitting to pay tribute to  her achievements.   This year also marks the 45th anniversary of the first woman in her  own right to represent Texas in the House of Representatives,  Congresswoman Barbara Jordan.   In 1972, Congresswoman Jordan, was the first African American elected  to the Texas Senate after Reconstruction, and the first Southern  African-American woman elected to the United States House of  Representatives.   Congresswoman Barbara Jordan was a lawyer, educator, an American  politician, and a leader of the Civil Rights Movement.   Today, it is with great honor that I serve in my mentor and friend's  former seat, continuing to carry the torch she elevated for so many and  for so many years, representing the outstanding constituents of  Houston, Texas.   We tend to think that before the Women's and Civil Rights Movements  minority Americans had no ability to represent themselves in  government.   Despite the tremendous obstacles of intimidation and harassment that  was faced by these brave Americans, they sought and won election to  political office.   Prior to her election to Congress, Jordan taught political science at  Tuskegee Institute in Alabama for a year before passing the Texas State  bar in 1960 and starting a private law practice by which she served her  community with pride.   In 1994, President Clinton awarded her the Presidential Medal of  Freedom and The NAACP presented her with the Springarn Medal.   She was honored many times and was given over 20 honorary degrees  from institutions across the country, including Harvard and Princeton,  and was elected to the Texas and National Women's Halls of Fame.   Congresswomen Jordan and Rankin both dedicated their lives to the  pursuit of unfettered democracy so that we all could have a voice and  use it freely.   Shirley Chisholm became the first African American woman elected to  Congress, when she was elected to represent the New York's Twelfth  Congressional District in 1968 running on the slogan, ``Fighting  Shirley Chisholm--Unbought and Unbossed.''   She reflected that spirit well during her 14 years in Congress.   During her first term she spoke out for civil rights, women's rights,  the poor and against the Vietnam War.   Her first term in Congress was set against the backdrop of the Civil  Rights Movement and the women's movement for equal rights.   Shirley Chisolm had an understanding that during those turbulent  times the nation required a determined leader to represent the voice of  so many Americans who felt dismay at their treatment.   She took an extremely active role in changing the way women were to  be judged from that point on.   She remarked that, ``Women in this country must become  revolutionaries. We must refuse to accept the old, the traditional  roles and stereotypes.''   This is a sentiment that I myself take to heart, women in this nation  are now told they have a right to determine the kind of life they want  to lead; Shirley Chisholm was at the core of this movement.   On January 25, 1972, Chisholm announced her candidacy for president.   She stood before the cameras and in the beginning of her speech she  said:   ``I stand before you today as a candidate for the Democratic  nomination for the Presidency of the United States.   I am not the candidate of black America, although I am black and  proud.   I am not the candidate of the women's movement of this country,  although I am a woman, and I am equally proud of that. I am not the  candidate of any political bosses or special interests.   I am the candidate of the people.''   Shirley Chisholm did not win the nomination; but she went on to the  Democratic Convention in Miami and received 151 delegates' votes.   More than that, she demonstrated the will and determination of so  many Americans who had previously felt forgotten, she had lighted a  fire under so many who had felt disenfranchised.   I am glad to walk in their footsteps and will continue to encourage  women to uphold the principles they taught us to fight for and cherish.   Because Representative Rankin is a graduate of the sciences from a  rural area, encouraging participation in programs such as the Jeannette  Rankin Women and Minorities in STEM Fields Program is the perfect way  to honor her legacy as a woman of the sciences and the first woman  elected to Congress, and to inspire the next generation of women and  minorities from rural areas to take up STEM fields.   Following in the footsteps of so many astounding role models, we must  continue to encourage women, particularly those from underserved  communities across the country, to participate in research and projects  in all academic fields, and specifically in the sciences.   Women and minorities have been and continue to be underrepresented in  STEM fields.   Although women make up 47% of the total U.S. labor force, they  comprise only 36% of the computing workforce, 24% of the engineering  workforce, and 18% of the advanced manufacturing workforce.   Indeed, minority representation in STEM fields is even lower, with  African-American and Latino workers comprising 29% of the general  workforce, but only 15% of the computing workforce, 12% of the  engineering workforce, and 6% of the advanced manufacturing workforce.   The Jeannette Rankin Women and Minorities in STEM Fields Program is  one way that we can address these glaring disparities.   The program awards grants to universities and institutions of higher  learning to distribute to eligible applicants, and they prioritize  projects and programs of particular relevance to USDA.   Recipient institutions have used these grants for worthy endeavors,  such as:   1. establishing a Jeannette Rankin Women and Minorities in STEM  Fields Program fellowship program for women and minority high school  students in rural areas;   2. providing mentorship and hands-on, service-based learning to high  school students and undergraduates in particular STEM fields; and   3. offering mentoring services to current undergraduates to help them  successfully complete STEM-based degrees.   These women were in positions of great responsibility during times  when this nation was under a great burden.   The true greatness of their story is not just that they overcame the  oppression they faced, but that they had the courage to help remedy a  nation that in many ways had spited them.   They refused to bend their principles to the hatred they faced; they  were true pioneers in leadership.   They are my role models in Congress because they represent the kind  of leaders that America has always needed at times of adversity, they  had a spirit and a courage that could not be broken, they had a vision  of America that exceeded that of most of their peers.   I am very proud to be a Member of Congress and to follow in the  footsteps of giants like Jeannette Rankin, Barbara Jordan, and Shirley  Chisolm.
