 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Walberg.   There is an irony here, and it is an irony I think that is worth  pointing out. This is, obviously, in the context, like the gentlewoman  from California pointed out, of the fiduciary rule, which we are  familiar with. That was an effort by the Obama administration to  promulgate a new rule to create a new standard that would have an  impact, Mr. Speaker, on investment advice.   It was clear that the net result of that was to do what? It would  have crowded people out at the lower end of the economic spectrum, not  give them access to the coverage or the advice that they needed,  because the advice, Mr. Speaker, would have been too expensive, and it  would have created the self-fulfilling prophecy, unfortunately, where  wealthier people, who can afford it, are able to get good advice.   It was a terrible idea. We worked on a bipartisan basis. The  administration  [[Page H1213]]  wouldn't have any part of the bipartisan solution. They jammed the rule  down. It was a bad idea.   Yet, the same administration, Mr. Speaker, is now saying to the  entities that we really shouldn't have confidence in, that is States  and localities on these pensions, you have more flexibility. So think  about it. Taking away flexibility from people who need help, locking  them out, not intentionally, but locking them out, and yet giving more  flexibility to the very entities that have demonstrated that they have  not used that properly.   It is ironic. I mean, you can't make this up, basically. We need to  do what we can, and here is what we can do. We can support this  resolution, H.J. Res. 66--and 67--move its passage, reset this debate,  and fundamentally have a new discussion about this, but we don't have  to yield to these poor plans from the Obama administration.                                time  1500
