 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding and for  his leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong support of this resolution,  Congresswoman Lee's longtime effort to repeal the 2002 Authorization  for Use of Military Force.    The Constitution is clear: Only Congress has the power to authorize  war.   In 2002, this resolution was adopted in order to address the ongoing  threat from Saddam Hussein and his regime in Iraq, the threat that it  represented to America. Saddam Hussein is gone. A new government has  been established in Iraq, and this AUMF is obsolete.   There are threats to the United States, and we have the authority to  address those threats when they arise. There are ongoing threats that  we ought to be able to debate here on the floor of the House of  Representatives and act upon when our security is threatened. But no  President of any party should ever be able to reach back two decades  when Congress, on a different fact situation, authorized the use of  force in order to authorize any use of force that they deemed to be  important to them.   Congress has this authority, and we need to assert it. That is what  we do today.
