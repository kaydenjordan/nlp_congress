 Mr. Speaker, as a Member representing the territories,  I would rather pay taxes than have the treatment that this body gives  to those that live in the territories. I believe it is the greatest  scam and an okey-doke that you have allowed us not to pay taxes and  hold that against us to ask for our equal treatment. So keep paying  those taxes and you will get your Statehood one day.   Mr. Speaker, the United States territories that I represent are also  not on equal footing with the rest of the Nation. There is no  representation in the U.S. Senate. No equal voting representation in  the House of Representatives. Unlike D.C., we cannot vote for  President. We know what it is like to be part of the greatest country  in the world but not a full participant, and it feels incomplete.   As Americans, we strive to be productive citizens and an asset to the  Nation. Statehood for D.C. is a matter of fairness that has been slow  in coming. This city, built by African Americans with the use of forced  labor, contributes more in Federal taxes on a per person basis than  many States. It is a punishment to Americans living in the capital,  including those working in policy or public service for the good of the  Nation, to be disenfranchised when they establish a home in the  District.    This body changed the boundaries in the 1800s to ensure that slave  owners could keep their slaves. We have changed the boundaries in the  committee to allow for the Federal city to still exist and the  residents of D.C. to become a State. It has been done by this body  before. Don't make it seem like it is something that can't happen  again. At this very moment, citizens across this Nation are clamoring  for change, equality, and justice. With one vote, we can deliver that  for the people of D.C.   Mr. Speaker, it is time to do what is right and allow the people of  this city to feel whole, to feel complete, to feel like they matter.  Support H.R. 51.
