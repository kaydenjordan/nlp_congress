 Mr. Speaker, the Moving Forward Act  recognizes that childcare is infrastructure.   Central to rebuilding our economy, stabilizing our workforce, and  educating our children, childcare is a public good, supporting more  than $99 billion a year in economic activity.   But we have not treated it as such. Ninety-six percent of childcare  professionals are women, and 40 percent are women of color, and they  are chronically underpaid. Costs for families are high, creating  barriers, especially from women, from entering and staying in the  workforce.   The pandemic has pushed this vital sector to its breaking point, and  we cannot afford to let it fail. This bill creates a grant program to  renovate and modify childcare facilities, helping them to reopen  safely. It invests in providers and in our Nation's children.   Childcare is the foundation for building an inclusive economy, and  now is the time to invest in our future. I urge a ``yes'' vote on this  legislation.                            ____________________
