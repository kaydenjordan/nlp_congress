 This bill adds over $250 billion to our debt. The  additional debt will make us weaker, not stronger. As we speak, the  massive Federal spending of the last 2 years is already causing  inflation throughout the supply chain and eventually will lead to  economic stagnation.   There is nothing conservative about this bill. The bill is nothing  more than a Big Government response that will make our country weaker,  not stronger. I object.
