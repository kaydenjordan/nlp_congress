 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding to me.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1, the For the People  Act.   America is not a democracy if we don't protect the right to vote. We  should be expanding voter rolls and making every single American voice  heard at the ballot box, and that includes currently and previously  incarcerated Americans. A mistake made and paid for should not strip  your constitutional rights and silence you for life.   I offered an amendment to this bill that would have included those  Americans in our democracy, however, I have withdrawn that amendment at  this time. I will continue to work with my colleagues to fight for re- enfranchisement for these Americans.   Mr. Chairman, I close by noting that this bill represents a paradigm  shift in our approach to voting rights, and it is a reflection of the  priorities of Democratic leadership in this body. It is long overdue  and exactly the type of legislation that went overlooked until  Democrats retook this Chamber.   Mr. Chairman, I urge all my colleagues to support our democracy by  voting for its passage.
