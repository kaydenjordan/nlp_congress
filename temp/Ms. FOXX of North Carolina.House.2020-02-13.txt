 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from  Georgia for yielding time.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.J. Res. 79.   As a woman who has worked all her life, often in male-dominated  professions, I detest discrimination in any form against any group, and  I have always done all that I can to eliminate it. Furthermore, I  welcome any discussion on how to root out discrimination against women  where it exists.   But do not be deceived. This is not what this legislation is about.   The 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution already provides women  and all Americans equal protection under the law, but the goal of this  legislation is different. The goal here is to expand access to abortion  up to birth and to overturn the broadly supported policies that protect  taxpayers from being forced to pay for abortions.                                time  1000    As we know all too well, Roe v. Wade has broadly legalized abortion  in the United States, but the equal rights amendment that this  resolution tries to ratify goes much further.   There is a broad consensus that the ERA could be used to overturn  pro-life laws, legalize abortion up to birth, and mandate taxpayer- funded abortions.   The expansion of abortion is not the only harmful impact of the ERA.  It would have a harmful impact on shelters that protect women from  violence, eliminate women-specific workplace protections, and destroy  women's sports.   Furthermore, were this resolution ever to become law, the Supreme  Court would undoubtedly rule that it does not ratify the equal rights  amendment.   As everyone in this room knows, when Congress initially passed the  equal rights amendment, it intentionally included a 7-year deadline for  the required 38 States to ratify, a deadline which has long since  passed. Multiple States have also rescinded their ratification.   As such, Supreme Court precedent requires that any attempt to ratify  the ERA must start at the beginning. Even Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg  was recently quoted saying she would like the process to start over.   To be perfectly clear, with this resolution, the Democrats are  attempting to write into the Constitution the right to an abortion at  all three trimesters, force taxpayers to pay for them, and eliminate  all conscience protections for medical providers who wish to abstain  from abortion.   This resolution is not about protecting women. It is a partisan  messaging bill designed to appease radical pro-abortion groups. If the  majority were serious about the equal rights amendment, it would start  the process anew and give all States the option to consider the ERA  again.
