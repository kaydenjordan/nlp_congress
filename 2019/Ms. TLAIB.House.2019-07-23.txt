 Madam Speaker, I stand before you as the granddaughter of  a Palestinian grandmother, my sity, who yearns to experience equality,  human dignity, and freedom. I stand before you, the daughter of  Palestinian immigrants, parents who experienced being stripped of their  human rights, the right to freedom of travel and equal treatment. So I  can't stand by and watch this attack on our freedom of speech and the  right to boycott the racist policies of the Government and the State of  Israel.   I love our country's freedom of speech, Madam Speaker. Dissent is how  we nurture democracy and grow to be better, more humane, and just. This  is why I oppose H. Res. 246.   All Americans have a constitutional right, guaranteed by the First  Amendment, to freedom of speech, to petition their government, and to  participate in boycotts.   Speech in pursuit of civil and human rights at home and abroad is  protected by our First Amendment. That is one reason why our First  Amendment is so powerful. With a few exceptions, the government is  simply not allowed to discriminate against speech based on its  viewpoint or its speaker.    The right to boycott is deeply rooted in the fabric of our country.  What was the Boston Tea Party but a boycott? Where would we be now  without the boycott led by civil rights activists in the 1950s and  1960s, like the Montgomery bus boycott and United Farm Workers grape  boycott.   Some of this country's most important advances in racial equality and  equity and workers' rights have been achieved through collective action  protected by our Constitution.   Americans of conscience have a long and proud history of  participating in boycotts specifically to advocate for human rights  abroad. Americans boycotted Nazi Germany in response to dehumanization,  imprisonment, and genocide of Jewish people. In the 1980s, many of us  in this very body boycotted South African goods in the fight against  apartheid.   Our right to free speech is being threatened with this resolution. It  sets a dangerous precedent because it attempts to delegitimize certain  people's political speech and to send a message that our government can  and will take action against speech it doesn't like.   Madam Speaker, the Supreme Court has, time and time again, recognized  that expressive conduct is protected by the Constitution, from burning  a flag to baking a cake. Efforts to restrict and target that protected  speech run the risk of eroding the civil rights that form the  foundation of our democracy.   All Americans have the right to participate in boycotts, and I oppose  all legislative efforts that target speech.   Madam Speaker, I urge Congress, State governments, and civil rights  leaders from all communities to preserve our Constitution, preserve our  Bill of Rights, and preserve the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom  of speech by opposing H. Res. 246 and antiboycott efforts wherever they  arise.                            ____________________
