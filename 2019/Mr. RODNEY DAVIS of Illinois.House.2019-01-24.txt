 Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle to come to the table and urge  Speaker Pelosi to come to the table to negotiate an end to this  shutdown.   This week, Democrats called us back to Washington to solve this  problem, but they voted against paying Federal workers three times over  the past week, while Republicans have been standing up for those who  have now missed paychecks.   It has been 15 days since the Speaker has sat down to negotiate with  the President.   Last week, I went to the White House for what was supposed to be a  bipartisan meeting to discuss ending this shutdown and, unfortunately,  none of my Democratic colleagues showed up.   Before Democrats even heard President Trump's proposal offering a  solution for DACA recipients and TPS individuals in return for border  security, they rejected it.   Speaker Pelosi gave the longest speech ever in this Chamber, on  protecting DACA recipients, but now she is refusing to provide  certainty for them.   We have an opportunity to get real border security and protect DACA  recipients. It is time to set politics aside and for the Speaker of the  House to go to the table, end this shutdown, and negotiate a deal with  the President.                            ____________________
