 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman and also Ms.  Jayapal for allowing me to speak today.   Madam Speaker, I rise for my former district director Chris and his  wife, Bridget. This is their story.   Bridget was pregnant with their very much-wanted second child. After  the 20th week, they were stunned to learn that the brain stem of the  fetus was not attached, and if the baby even survived, then the newborn  would likely die within hours. Doctors told the family, if they wanted  more children, it would be a good idea to end the pregnancy. After  consulting with their minister, they decided to do so.   The happy ending is that a year or so later another child was born,  and she is happy and healthy today.   As co-chair of the Pro-Choice Caucus, I know that difficult  circumstances always surround these highly personal decisions, and I  don't think that the U.S. Congress is the body that should impose its  opinion.   Just imagine the horrible choices families would have to make if H.R.  36 became law. Ninety-nine percent of abortions are conducted before  the 20-week mark. Virtually all the rest are just like this situation.   Madam Speaker, I urge the body to reject this bill and to move on to  important issues that are facing this country.
