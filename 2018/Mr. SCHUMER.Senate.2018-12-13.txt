 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we have just a little over a week to come  to some agreement on how to fund the government past next Friday.   Leader Pelosi and I have given the President two options to keep the  government open. Both are noncontroversial. Neither contain any  Democratic demand. We just want to keep the government open. So far,  President Trump has not accepted either offer. The President appears to  be clinging to his demand for billions of dollars for a border wall,  and from what we saw in the Oval Office and news reports about his  reaction after our meeting, President Trump is willing to throw a  temper tantrum and shut down the government unless he gets his way.   I want to be crystal clear. There will be no additional  appropriations to pay for the border wall. It is done. The President  repeatedly promised that Mexico would pay for his unnecessary and  ineffective border wall, in his words, ``100 percent.'' On Tuesday, he  said he would be ``proud'' to shut down the government unless U.S.  taxpayers pay for it. Now, just this morning, the President tweeted  that Mexico will pay for the wall through savings from the new NAFTA.   Well, Mr. President, if you say Mexico is going to pay for the wall  through NAFTA--which it certainly will not--then I guess we don't have  to. Let's fund the government.   Honestly, if the President really believed what he tweeted this  morning, that his new NAFTA would pay for the wall, he wouldn't be  threatening to shut down the government unless American taxpayers fund  his wall. He can't have it both ways. The President's position on the  wall is totally contradictory, ill-informed, and frankly irresponsible.  It is not a serious proposal. It is a throwaway idea the President  used--used in the campaign and still uses--to fire up his base.   A Trump temper tantrum and shutdown threat isn't going to change any  minds in Congress. President Trump has several ways to avoid a  shutdown. He should pick one and soon, but if we wind up with a  shutdown, it will be entirely the President's fault. President Trump  himself would not dispute that in the Oval Office on Tuesday. He almost  bragged that he would shut down the government--what irresponsibility.   I would just like to remind my friend the majority leader that if we  arrive at a Trump shutdown, the onus for reopening the government will  soon fall in his lap. When Democrats take control of the House in  January, Democrats will pass one of our two options to fund the  government, and then Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans will be  left holding the bag for a Trump shutdown if they don't pass our bill  now.   So there is no way for my Republican friends to avoid the issue.  There is no way for Leader McConnell to avoid the issue, fearful of  President Trump as they all might be. Either Republicans help deal with  the President now or they will be left dealing with a much bigger  problem in January.                            ____________________     Mr. President, a brief word on China. I have spent the  better part of the last two decades encouraging administrations to be  tougher on China, which has risen to challenge the United States  economically, not through fair trade and fair competition but by  shielding its market from U.S. competition, flouting international  trade rules against dumping currency manipulation, relentlessly  stealing our intellectual property and know-how. China has not played  by the rules. They are the outlaw of trade, and they have cost the  United States millions of jobs and probably trillions, if not hundreds  of billions, of dollars.   The recent arrest of the CFO of Huawei, a tech giant in China with  close ties to its government and military, is a reminder of the  predatory and rapacious behavior of Chinese companies. Huawei is  charged by U.S. officials with intentionally violating U.S. sanctions  with Iran.   Beyond these specific charges, however, Huawei has raised serious  concerns among U.S. officials for a potential role in cyber espionage,  given their reported links to China's state security services, and now  news reports have confirmed that the massive cyber attack on the  Marriott hotel chain a few weeks ago was conducted by none other than  Chinese intelligence.   This administration has been tougher on China than previous  administrations. They deserve credit for that, but this administration  has also shown an eagerness to quickly bargain away tough enforcement  of Chinese abuses for mild and sometimes meaningless concessions so  President Trump can get a quick news hit, particularly on a bad day.  That is what happened with ZTE. No one wants to see a repeat of that  movie.   We had ZTE dead to rights. They were hurting America, and President  Trump, at the last minute--still unexplained--let them off the hook. I  hope that doesn't happen again because this administration has set us  up for a potential victory for the first time--better than Bush's  administration, better than Obama's administration--against China  rapaciousness.   I am urging the President to be tough on Huawei and direct U.S.  officials to prosecute these charges and have the Huawei CFO stand on  trial in the United States, as she deserves.                            ____________________     Mr. President, finally, to my dear friend and about my  dear friend, the Senator from North Dakota. The task sadly falls to me  to begin saying goodbye to Members of our caucus who will not be  returning in the 116th Congress. This morning, I would like to begin  with the junior Senator from North Dakota.   Heidi Heitkamp had a childhood that sounds like it was ripped from  the pages of a frontier epic. She grew up as one of seven kids born  over 9 years in a house with three bedrooms, in a town with a  population south of 100. Do the math. That means that around one-tenth  of the town was Heitkamps.   Inside the household, the lack of space meant that Heidi's room was  also her brother's room and also the laundry room. According to her  sisters, the presence of a laundry machine had almost no effect on her.  She read and read, and rarely, if ever, did she participate in the  washing or folding of the Heitkamp laundry.   Her siblings didn't seem to mind, at least not too much. As Julie  Heitkamp said about growing up with Heidi, ``She was so good . . . it  was annoying.''   It turned out that the bookworm from a small town in North Dakota was  destined for great things. When she worked for Senator Kent Conrad, the  outstanding Democrat from North Dakota, he realized the same goodness  in Heidi her sisters recognized, and he encouraged her to run for State  auditor at the age of 28. She didn't win that race, but she ran again  for State tax commissioner and won and, again, for  [[Page S7534]]  attorney general and won--fighting on behalf of sexual assault  survivors and against the abusive practices of the tobacco industry.  She would run for Governor and, eventually, for the Senate--losing the  first but winning the second. She would become the first woman ever  elected to the Senate from the great State of North Dakota.   For someone who came from where Heidi came, that election might have  felt like a culmination--but no. For Heidi, it was just the beginning.  It was not about winning or even beating the odds. It was about what  you did with the time you had when you were here.   As Heidi talked about in her farewell speech, what is important is  how we use our time. Let the history books report just how well the  Senator from North Dakota used her time while she has been here.   Heidi had been able to bring Democrats and Republicans together  during a time of extraordinary partisan divisions--one of the few who  could do it so successfully on such major issues. It had been because  she understood how each side saw an issue, what each side wanted, and  what a compromise could look like. Once she knew an agreement was  possible, she worked like no other to see that it was achieved.   That is how she got Senator Whitehouse and Senator McConnell on the  same energy bill having to do with carbon capture--a remarkable feat  with a staunch environmentalist who gives speeches on the floor every  day about green and with a Senator from a coal State who defends that  industry. That is how she created the first AMBER Alert in Indian  Country. It was with our dearly departed friend, Senator McCain. That  is how she helped to shut down backpage and child sex trafficking on  the internet with broad bipartisan support.   What a great legacy--all of it bipartisan. That instinct for  compromise and consensus was born from her life experience. In her  family of nine, Heidi was known as the arbitrator. Even her name is a  compromise. Born Mary Kathryn, Heidi became ``Heidi'' because there was  a ``Mary'' and a ``Kathryn'' in her grade school class. She gladly  accepted the nickname.   Of course, there have been times Heidi couldn't bring our two sides  together on an issue because she had already been further along than  both sides.   Senator Heitkamp has been the first to really drive home in the  Senate the plight of Native American women. She has worked at it  tirelessly because she believes that if people were to know about the  poverty and abuse and addiction that has plagued many reservations and  how they affect both the men and women, they would be up in arms about  it. So she wrote the first bill to create a Commission on Native  American Children who suffer from rates of poverty, malnutrition, and  education disparity far above other populations. A little while ago, it  became law and received funding. Recently, it had its first meeting--a  legacy that will live on. She also wrote Savanna's Act to address the  epidemic of missing and murdered Native American women. It passed the  Senate unanimously just a few weeks after the election.   Well, Heidi, the Senate is catching up to you, and we intend to use  the time we have to build on the incredible legacy you leave on these  issues. Just so I will never forget what your service has meant to this  Chamber, I will always keep the picture of the three Heitkamp sisters  on my wall in my office--all with their high North Dakota cheekbones.  It is going to stay there to be a reminder of what Heidi has done and,  more importantly, I am sure she would say, as a reminder of the many  things we still have to do to continue the great legacy she will leave.   Those of us on this side of the aisle--at least I--will miss her  cornbread as well, her insistence on Corona beer, and her ability to  suffer even the worst Fargo accents--or mimicking of Fargo accents as I  attempted to do--that were directed in her way.   All of us in this Chamber will sure miss the junior Senator from  North Dakota--her warmth, her passion, her sincerity, her political  courage. We owe a debt of gratitude to Darwin, her husband, and to her  children Ali and Nathan for borrowing Heidi for these years. We wish  them all the best as well.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
