 Madam Speaker, yesterday marked 1 full month of this  unnecessary government shutdown, and 800,000 Federal employees are set  to miss their second paycheck later this week.   The shutdown is not only affecting those workers, but we are seeing  ripple effects of agencies being closed or staff being downsized. Food  banks are seeing massive increases, some almost twelvefold, in demand  from Federal employees, but also people who rely on help like Section 8  housing checks or SNAP benefits.   Here is some of what I am hearing. I heard from a constituent who is  a career employee at the FAA that ``it is frustrating that thousands of  hardworking Federal employees have become innocent pawns in the current  Washington standoff between Congress and the President over funding for  border security. As an integral part of the Nation's air traffic  control system, my focus has always been and will always be on  safety.''   He goes on: ``My dedicated colleagues and I at the FAA work  tirelessly in furtherance of the agency's mission of providing the  safest, most efficient aerospace system in the world, despite some of  us now doing so without pay.''   I have also heard from a woman whose husband is a Federal agent at  the FDA. ``My question,'' she says, ``is how are we going to make ends  meet without a paycheck from my husband this Friday? We adopted our  sweet son a year and a half ago, draining our savings account to do so.  We currently do  [[Page H1009]]  not have savings to fall back on during this time.   ``How are we supposed to pay our rent, our bills, keep food on the  table for our family, or pay for an emergency should it arise? I do  have a full-time job that will at least bring us some income during  this shutdown, and I am sure we are luckier than most Federal-employed  families, but I can assure you that our family is in true panic mode.   ``We have been doing everything in our power to ensure our family  would be able to purchase a home this summer. How do we explain to  creditors that we don't have the money to pay them right now without it  affecting our credit?''   I have also heard from a constituent who is a furloughed Federal  worker who is ``forced to come to work every day without pay due to the  partial government shutdown.   ``Every day that goes by, the stress and anxiety about not having a  paycheck and having to support my family, all the while having to incur  the costs of going to work every day, mounts. To top this all off, as  an `excepted,' or an `exempt,' employee, under current Federal law, I  am not allowed to apply for nor can I receive unemployment  compensation.''   I have also heard from a local business owner who contracts with  Federal entities. He says: ``My work has ground to a halt. I won't be  compensated for any downtime, and I will have to reduce my workforce.  We don't need a wall; we don't need to waste money; and we don't need  symbolic racism. We need an open government that manages land,  services, travel, and commerce. Please apply pressure to get the  government open and our district's Federal employees, contractors, and  private-sector partners back to work.''   I have heard from a constituent who served 40 years in the Coast  Guard, under many different administrations, who said: ``Worst of all,  it is negatively impacting the most junior members of our workforce.  These are the people you will meet if you ever take your family out  boating on Puget Sound or the navigable waters of this country and  experience some form of distress. As a retiree, I will not be paid at  the end of this month, a statement I once believed I would never have  to say.''   I have heard from a social worker whose client left a domestic  violence situation and recently received a letter about discontinuation  of Section 8 housing benefits: ``This family, without this support,  will be homeless once again, let alone the emotional strain that this  is causing. Please do what you can,'' she says, ``to prevent the stress  on our most vulnerable.''   The shutdown must end now. Federal employees and their families  should not be held hostage for a wasteful and ineffective wall. People  who rely on assistance from the Federal Government are now caught in  the fray.   The House now has voted nine times to reopen the government with  bipartisan bills that have similar language to what the Republican  Senate passed in December, and we will introduce similar legislation  today, giving Republicans in the Senate yet another opportunity to open  the government.   I will not support reopening the government in exchange for the  President's wall. This hostage-taking strategy must not be a successful  one, or we will see it again.   The wall, as he defines it, is a monument to racism and xenophobia,  an environmental disaster, and a huge waste of hard-earned taxpayer  dollars.   Let's be clear that what Mr. Trump offered as a ``compromise'' on  Saturday doesn't even undo the damage he alone has caused. That is no  compromise; that is lip service.   Get the government open, and then we can have an informed, evidence- based discussion about the best way to protect our borders without  holding the American people hostage.                            ____________________
