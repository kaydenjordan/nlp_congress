 Madam Speaker, as a woman, as a mom, as a former  teacher who worked with hundreds of teenagers and who loves each and  every one of them, I rise in opposition to this bill, which isn't about  freedom for women; it is about death for babies.   We are faced with multiple questions today.   Is it okay to coerce a woman to have an abortion?   Is it okay to send a 13-year-old girl home to perform a do-it- yourself abortion on herself without medical supervision? Is it okay  for her to have this abortion without her parents even knowing?   Is it okay to take the life of a baby just because it has Down  syndrome?   Is it okay to take the life of a baby just because it is a girl?   Is it okay? It is not okay. The answer to all of these things should  be no.   Yet, this bill eliminates protections for women and girls facing  coercion, neglect, and discrimination. It endangers their health, and  it ends the life of a living human being with a plan and a purpose from  God and who deserves to live.   We are here to defend the basic right to life, and I plead with my  colleagues to vote ``no.''
