 Mr. Speaker, since I was a little boy I have been told  that a dog that won't bark in his own backyard ain't much of a dog.   Mr. Speaker, the number one enemy to the Communist Chinese Party is  the United States of America. As a matter of fact, Xi Jinping has  clearly stated that by 2049 he wants China to be the world leader  diplomatically, economically, militarily, even in space. As a matter of  fact, they are on pace right now to outperform and pass the United  States as a leader in space before 2045.   Where are we right now? Well, China owns $870 billion in U.S.  Treasuries that finance our debt. They either own or have a huge  portion of the Chicago Stock Exchange, AMC Theaters, General Electric's  appliance division, General Motors, and Smithfield Foods, just to name  a few.   On another alarming note, they own 384,000 acres of American  agricultural land. That is a 30 percent increase just since 2019. On  top of that, they own land near an Air Force base in North Dakota. That  is a clear threat to our national security.   That is what the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug  Administration appropriations bill is going to address. It is going to  put American interests first by directing the Secretary of Agriculture  to prohibit the purchase of land by those associated with our foreign  adversaries.  [[Page H3963]]    Mr. Speaker, this dog is barking, and Congress needs to address the  threat right here in our own backyard.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I am here to speak about the fiscal year  `24 Agriculture Appropriations bill, specifically how this legislation  supports American farmers and ranchers by slashing regulations and  reducing spending back to prepandemic levels.   Georgia is the top poultry producer in the Nation. Our poultry  industry generates an economic impact of $28 billion for our State.   This bill eliminates harmful regulations that unnecessarily dictate  how to raise and market livestock which negatively impact Georgia  producers and consumers alike. It also cuts spending to account for the  end of the COVID pandemic emergency by saving $32 billion in taxpayer  dollars.   My colleagues and I in the House are going to have the opportunity to  discuss this legislation and support our rural communities and farmers.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the fiscal year  2024 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and  Related Agencies appropriations bill.   Specifically, I will highlight the work that this legislation does to  rein in wasteful Washington spending while strengthening our rural  communities and protecting our food supply.   Georgia is the number one State for poultry, and this bill reins in  harmful regulations that dictate how poultry and livestock producers  raise and market their animals.    This bill also prevents the purchase of land by foreign adversaries.  Let me repeat that. This bill will prevent the purchase of land--U.S.  land--by foreign adversaries, countries like China, Russia, North  Korea, and Iran.   Let's take China for instance. China owns 384,000 acres of American  agricultural land. As a matter of fact, they have even got land that is  close to one of our air bases in North Dakota. That poses a national  security threat, not just that, but a food supply threat.   Finally, this year's Agriculture Appropriations bill reins in  Washington spending and D.C. bureaucracy by directing the USDA to focus  State hiring efforts on assisting rural communities and producers.   So with that, and my colleagues in the House, as we continue to  discuss and debate this appropriation bill this week, let's focus on  our commitment to the American people and protect our agriculture  industry.
