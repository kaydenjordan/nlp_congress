 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 3  minutes on the nomination of Tony Blinken for Secretary of State.    Mr. President, I bring to the floor this morning the  nomination of Tony Blinken to be Secretary of State. He has been  nominated, of course, by President Biden, and this is brought by  Senator Menendez and me. We have had the honored privilege of working  together to move as rapidly as we could Mr. Blinken's nomination.  Obviously, these things do take some time, and we are fortunate to be  able to bring it as quickly as we have to the floor.   This is, in my judgment, certainly the most important nominee that  there will be to the President's Cabinet in light of a number of things  but not the least of which is they are in the line of succession for  the Presidency.   Mr. Blinken has a long and distinguished history when it comes to  statecraft and foreign relations matters. Certainly, he is very  qualified for this job. Obviously, we don't agree on all things. Nobody  ever does.   I will say that there are 200 countries, approximately, on the  planet, and each one of them has unique and very distinguished issues.   In speaking with Mr. Blinken on these matters, I find that there is a  tremendous amount of agreement that he and I have. Obviously, whenever  these things happen, there are areas of disagreement, and obviously the  media and a lot of people focus on these.   I should mention that at least one of those--Iran--is a very wide  disagreement that we have. In my judgment, the JCPOA was a colossal  failure and a real blunder for American policy overseas. In talking  with Mr. Blinken, he does not share that view, and obviously he is  going to work with the President, carrying the President's water to get  us back into the JCPOA. I think that is a mistake. We have talked about  this at length, and certainly whatever the consequences of that are,  those who do it are going to have to live with it.   I can state that this is not a partisan issue. There are people on  both sides of the aisle who have real reservations about going back  into the JCPOA, particularly if there aren't very significant  sideboards put on that. The effort is going to be made, and we will  advise as we can and go down that pike.   Again, I say that this is one issue. Out of the many, many issues  that we discussed, there was very little--in fact, no daylight between  us on some of them. A good example of that would be Turkey. I think Mr.  Blinken shares my reservations about Turkey, and, again, the vast  majority of this body, the U.S. Senate, has deep, deep reservations  about the direction that Turkey is going.    In any event, we need a Secretary of State, and this is the person  for the job.   With that, I yield the floor    Mr. President, as a senior member and former  chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and  Entrepreneurship, each month I recognize and celebrate the American  entrepreneurial spirit by highlighting the success of a small business  in my home State of Idaho. Today I am pleased to honor 44East in  Meridian as the Idaho Small Business of the Month for January 2021.  [[Page S150]]    Established by Cheryl Jones and her daughter Kayloni Perry, 44East  specializes in home goods and gifts. Cheryl and Kayloni's shared love  for crafting gifts and home decorations inspired their entrepreneurial  success. With the support and encouragement of their friends and  family, they opened 44East in 2017. Since then, it has developed a  reputation for its exceptional service and its unique, curated array of  products and home decor items. The owners take pride in supporting  their local business community by sourcing one-of-a-kind and specialty  products from other small businesses in the Treasure Valley and Pacific  Northwest.   Like many small businesses, 44East faced an uncertain future during  the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Confronted with the  possibility of permanent closure, Cheryl and Kayloni quickly adapted  44East's business model and began offering their products virtually  through a social media campaign dubbed ``Live at 5 to Survive.'' Soon,  customers began flocking to 44East's social channels to purchase their  products. ``Live at 5 to Survive'' did more than just ensure the  continued survival of 44East; it introduced hundreds of customers to  the business and resulted in a swell of new sales. Today, 44East  continues to host its ``Live at 5 to Survive'' campaign and has since  reopened its doors, instituting health safety measures to protect its  customers. 44East's resourcefulness and ingenuity is a testament to  Idaho's entrepreneurial spirit.   Congratulations to Cheryl, Kayloni, and all of the employees of  44East on being selected as the Idaho Small Business of the Month for  January 2021. You make our great State proud, and I look forward to  your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
