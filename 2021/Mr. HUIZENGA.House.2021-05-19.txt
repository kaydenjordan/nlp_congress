 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the exemplary  career of Tom TenBrink and his legacy of service, dedication, and  success in the Jenison community. On behalf of west Michigan, it is an  honor to express my appreciation and gratitude for his many years of  service to the students, staff, and families of Jenison Public Schools.   Mr. TenBrink's distinguished career with the Jenison Public Schools  is coming to an end, as he is retiring after 34 successful years, 18 of  which were spent as superintendent of the district.   As a faithful servant to west Michigan, Mr. TenBrink has spent his  tenure establishing Jenison Public Schools as a destination district.  He has fostered a family culture, prioritizing the importance of  adopting attitudes of servant leadership, while also maintaining a  commitment to educational excellence.   His steadfast leadership has led to the creation of the Jenison  International Academy, the development of a K-12 Spanish immersion  program, and the building of the Jenison Center for the Arts and a new  Kids First early childhood center. Furthermore, the district has earned  countless accolades under his leadership.   Tom, thank you for your leadership, dedication, and commitment not  only to the students, but to the Jenison community and all of west  Michigan. I hope you enjoy retirement knowing that Jenison and  Georgetown Township would not be the place it is today without your  leadership.                            ____________________
