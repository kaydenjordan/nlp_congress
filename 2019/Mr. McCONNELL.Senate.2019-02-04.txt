 Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk due for a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under  provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceeding.    Mr. President, for the past week now, the Senate has  been considering a package of legislation to strengthen our Nation's  diplomatic presence in the Middle East. The Strengthening America's  Security in the Middle East Act would renew our commitment to Israel's  security, expand cooperation with Jordan, and impose new consequences  on the perpetrators of Assad's brutality in Syria.   When America's national security and vital interests are at stake,  some circumstances require not only the use of important diplomatic  tools but also direct involvement from the United States. That is why I  introduced an amendment to S. 1, so the Senate can speak clearly and  directly about the importance of our Nation's ongoing missions in  Afghanistan and Syria.   I know a broad consensus about American leadership in the world  exists in this body. It is time to reaffirm our commitment to this  vision and to the men and women fighting on the ground to uphold it. I  was glad to see a big bipartisan majority of this body vote to advance  my amendment on Thursday. I hope a similar majority joins me in voting  to approve this mainstream amendment today, and I look forward to  passing this thoroughly bipartisan legislation later this week.                            ____________________     Mr. President, once we complete our work on S. 1, the  Senate will turn to the Natural Resources Management Act, under the  leadership of Chairman Murkowski and the Natural Resources Committee.   This legislation combines more than 100 individual lands bills. It  will allow communities across America to responsibly develop their land  and natural resources while maintaining a balance with locally  supported conservation.   On a national scale, this legislation will achieve things such as  permanently reauthorizing the Land and Water Conservation Fund and  codifying sportsmen's recreational access to Bureau of Land Management  and National Forest areas nationwide. On a local scale, communities  across America are looking forward to specific provisions.   I am particularly proud that the legislation will include two bills I  introduced to safeguard historic Kentucky landmarks and designate Camp  Nelson and Mill Springs Battlefield as national monuments. I know  virtually every one of our colleagues is enthusiastic about local  achievements it will deliver in their States as well.   This bipartisan legislation is a major priority dating back to the  last Congress, when nearly 90 Senators cosponsored its components, and  I am glad we will be able to turn to it soon.                            ____________________     First, Mr. President, later today, the junior Senator  from Nebraska will give the Senate an opportunity to address an issue  of profound moral importance. I understand that he plans to ask consent  to pass legislation that ought to be the very definition of something  that receives unanimous consent in this body. It would help ensure that  all baby girls and boys who are born alive--all of  [[Page S818]]  them--have their right to life respected and receive the medical care  they need.   It builds on the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002, which did  indeed pass this body by unanimous consent, and creates enforcement  mechanisms if abortion providers fail to give these newborn babies the  medical attention and care they so obviously deserve.   Completely apart from the rest of our debate on the issue of life,  how could this question be any clearer? What could be more unanimous  than this: What medical professionals owe every single newborn American  citizen, regardless of the circumstances of their birth, is attention  and care--not neglect and certainly not violence. Frankly, it is  harrowing that this legislation is even necessary.   What is even more disturbing when, last week, a Democratic Governor  was unable to clearly and simply state that, of course--of course-- these newborn babies have human rights that must be respected.   I have been a proud cosponsor of Senator Sasse's legislation, and I  hope none of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle invent any  reasons to block this request later today. That would make quite a  disturbing statement.   If they do inexplicably block Senator Sasse's effort, I can assure  them this will not be the last time we try to afford newborns this  fundamental legal protection.                            ____________________     Mr. President, one final matter--last week, our Nation  received yet another wave of good news about our strong economy and all  the opportunities it is creating for working Americans.   Republicans' pro-growth, pro-family economic policies have helped our  Nation's job creators and small businesses hit the accelerator, and  middle-class families across the country continue to reap the rewards.   The Labor Department tracks the total amount that U.S. employers  spend each year on wages and benefits for workers. Last quarter, the  year-on-year increase was the highest it has been in more than 10  years. Last month, the total percentage of Americans who are employed  hit its highest mark since December 2008.   Let me say that again. Following Republican policies, we are now  seeing the largest annual jump in a decade in the amount spent on  workers' compensation and a higher percentage of Americans working than  we saw at any point--at any point--under President Obama.   An expert described these data to the New York Times: ``Employers are  still actively looking for jobs, and with wages ticking up, it looks  like workers are getting some more bargaining power.''   Another expert put it this way: ``The virtuous cycle continues . . .  a virtuous cycle of a continuously growing U.S. labor market.''   So I am confident we will hear more about this from the President in  his address Tuesday evening. The state of our Nation's economy is  thriving and working Americans are feeling the boost. This is what  happens when Republican policies get Washington out of the way.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
