 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, tomorrow, Northrop Grumman and the U.S.  Air Force will unveil the new B-21 bomber, a sixth-generation aircraft  that will revolutionize the Air Force's long-range strike capabilities.   I had the special opportunity to see the first tails under  development at Palmdale, and I am excited that this incredible feat of  U.S. engineering will finally be unveiled to the American public and to  our adversaries. It is an exciting day for the Air Force, and it is an  especially exciting day for Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota,  which was chosen to be the first home--Main Operating Base 1--of the B- 21 Raider.   We have come a long way at Ellsworth since I first came to the  Senate. Shortly after I took office, Ellsworth was recommended for  closure by the Department of Defense's Base Realignment and Closure  Commission. So one of my first priorities as a U.S. Senator became  getting Ellsworth taken off the closure list. Statistically speaking,  our odds of pulling through were not high, but thanks to an all-hands  effort by the congressional delegation and State and community leaders,  we won the day, and we were removed from the BRAC list that August.   Then we got right to work on building up the base so we would never  again find ourselves in the same position.   In 2007, the Air Force Financial Services Center opened at Ellsworth,  and 2011 saw the arrival of the 89th Attack Squadron and its command  and control stations for MQ-9 Reapers.   In 2015, a nearly decade-long effort paid off with the quadrupling of  the  [[Page S6925]]  training airspace for the base. The Powder River Training Complex is  now the largest training airspace in the continental United States and  can be used for large-force exercises that draw combat aircraft from  across the country, and it is well-suited for B-21 training. This is  just one of the efforts that we undertook to put Ellsworth in the best  possible position to secure the B-21 mission. I am proud that it paid  off with last June's announcement that Ellsworth would become the home  of the Raider.   The B-21 represents a significant step forward in our long-range  strike capabilities, and it will come not a moment too soon. Between  chronic underfunding and a high operational tempo during the War on  Terror, our military preparedness became seriously strained.   A 2018 National Defense Strategy Commission report warned that our  Nation's readiness had eroded to the point where we might struggle to  win a war against a major power like Russia or China. This was not just  because of the wear and tear of our own forces but also because of the  significant investments being made by China and Russia in their  militaries, with the intent of neutralizing our military strengths. We  have made progress since then, but there is still a lot of work that  needs to be done.   The importance of continued investment in our Nation's military and  our technological edge cannot be overstated. The events of the past  year should remind us that there will always be bad actors who  represent a threat to peace and freedom, and being prepared to meet  those threats is the best way of preserving peace and keeping our  Nation secure.   It is disappointing that the National Defense Authorization Act-- yearly legislation to authorize funding for our military and national  defense--has been so low on Democrats' priority list this year. We are  2 months in fiscal year 2023; yet the Senate still hasn't taken up the  2023 bill. Democrats were more focused on spending hundreds of billions  of dollars on their Green New Deal priorities than they were on passing  essential legislation for our Nation's defense.   As efforts continue to negotiate a way to bring the NDAA to the  floor, I hope we are able to pass a comprehensive bill that rejects the  President's inadequate funding request and addresses all our key  defense requirements.   As always, one of my top priorities is ensuring that each year's NDAA  addresses the needs of our airmen at Ellsworth Air Force Base. I am  working to ensure that the base continues to receive full funding for  the many equipment and support facilities that will be needed for the  B-21 Raider mission.   In late October, I had the opportunity of reviewing the progress at  Ellsworth firsthand with Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall, and  suffice it to say, things are going to be very, very busy over the  coming years. The B-21 training and operational missions will require  significant investments in new infrastructure, including a low- observable coating restoration facility and a radio frequency facility  to support the Raider's stealth properties, as well as a  weapons generation facility to support its nuclear capability. The NDAA  will continue this essential military construction and ensure that it  remains on pace in preparation for the arrival of the B-21.    We also need to ensure Ellsworth remains a premier training space for  our bombers, which is why I am pursuing a provision to require the  Federal Aviation Administration to establish a pilot program to support  the development of dynamic airspace. Dynamic airspace--sometimes called  adaptive airspace--refers to efficiently scheduling and managing  airspace and adjusting airspace boundaries as military exercises or  other flights proceed through them. This concept will better enable the  Pentagon to meet training requirements for aircraft like the B-21,  which need larger volumes of training airspace to accommodate longer  engagement distances.   As always, while we prepare for the B-21 mission, I continue to work  to ensure that our B-1s at Ellsworth receive all the resources they  need to remain a responsive and lethal component of Global Strike  Command, as they demonstrated in the just-completed Bomber Task Force  deployment to Guam.   While updated planes and equipment are essential, as always, our  greatest resource is the men and women who wear the uniform. I will  continue to work to improve quality of life for our Ellsworth airmen  and their families.   More military families will be moving into the communities  surrounding Ellsworth with the arrival of the B-21 mission, and another  one of my priorities is making sure that the infrastructure is in place  to provide ample support for these new families.   I worked to include a provision in this year's NDAA that would allow  the Secretary of Defense to continue to adjust basic allowance for  housing rates if an installation is experiencing a sudden increase in  the number of servicemembers assigned there. This will help ensure that  families at Ellsworth and elsewhere will have the resources they need  to secure appropriate accommodations.   I am also working to ensure that the Douglas School District is able  to integrate and support Air Force members' children and provide  sufficient classroom space. I am grateful to the other members of South  Dakota's congressional delegation for working with me to ensure that  this year's NDAA will authorize up to $15 million in Impact Aid funding  for schools experiencing forced structure changes like the anticipated  growth at Ellsworth.   I am looking forward to tomorrow's unveiling of the B-21 Raider and  to that day in the near future when the first Raider lands at  Ellsworth. It is an honor to be part of building up the base and to  represent the men and women of Ellsworth in the U.S. Senate.   I will continue to do everything I can to ensure that our Ellsworth  airmen and our men and women in uniform in every branch of the military  have everything they need to carry out their missions.

Christina is a graduate of Roncalli High School in Aberdeen, SD.  Currently, she is attending Northern State University in Aberdeen, SD,  where she is majoring in history. She is a hard worker who has been  dedicated to getting the most out of her internship experience.   I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Christina for all of  the fine work she has done and wish her continued success in the years  to come.                            ____________________
