 Mr. Speaker, today, I stand to applaud  the Clinton County Solid Waste Authority and their Wayne Township  Landfill, which has been an essential contributor to our community for  half a century.   Originally permitted in 1973 and developed in 1990, this landfill now  boasts a state-of-the-art subtitle D facility and recently received  approval for a 75-acre expansion, providing an additional 23 years of  disposal capacity.   The Wayne Township Landfill is not just a waste management site. It  is a beacon of responsible waste disposal, recycling, and community  preservation. They are dedicated to ensuring the quality and longevity  of Clinton County.   This remarkable institution has been a substantial force for good in  our community, providing financial support to local fire companies,  offering scholarships, and reducing tipping fees to ease the burden on  our citizens.   They actively participate in environmental conservation; contribute  to local sports, educational programs, and community events; and have  played a crucial role in industrial park expansion and flood cleanup  efforts.   The Wayne Township Landfill is a lifeline for our community,  employing 81 individuals, stimulating local economic growth, and  investing in our community infrastructure.   As they celebrate their 50th anniversary of waste acceptance, it is  evident that they are more than a landfill. They are dedicated stewards  of our community's well-being, economic prosperity, and environmental  health.                            ____________________
