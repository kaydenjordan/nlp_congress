 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   As I have expressed, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Richmond), my  friend, would like to have a moment.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.   I know that I speak on behalf of all the Members of the House to wish  Virgil Godspeed, great success in the future, and great happiness.    I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at 12 p.m. for morning- hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business, with votes postponed  until 6:30 p.m.   On Tuesday and Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning- hour debate and 12 p.m. for legislative business.   On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business,  with last votes no later than 3 p.m.   We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. A  complete list of suspensions will be announced by the close of business  today.   The House will also consider H. Con. Res. 24, expressing the sense of  Congress that the report of Special Counsel Mueller should be made  available to the public and to Congress.    I thank the gentleman for his question. I want to put it  in context.   For the first time in history, we started this Congress with a  government shutdown. For the first time in history. The business was  not completed, the government was not fully funded, and it was  necessary for us, as we began this session, to have numerous votes to  open up the government. We didn't get a lot of help from your side of  the aisle on doing that, and it was not about a debate; we had  considered six bills that essentially had been agreed to. There was  clearly a disagreement on Homeland Security.   But let me remind you, on H.R. 1, the largest bill that we considered  during the last Congress, you brought that to the floor and you had no  committee hearings. Not a single committee hearing. You had no  witnesses. No member of the public was able to testify. It was a closed  rule, and zero amendments were made in order.   Now, let me make a comparison for you on H.R. 1, the bill we just  passed. This bill had five hearings across several committees, 19  witnesses testified, the primary committee of jurisdiction had markup,  and 72 amendments were made in order.   Now, H.R. 1, last Congress, zero Democratic amendments made in order.  Now of course there were no Republican amendments made in order either  because it was a closed rule, no amendments at all, no hearings, no  committee hearings, no witnesses.   So that we have, as we said we would, had a process, opportunity for  the public to testify, opportunity for amendments to be made in order.  I forget exactly how many amendments you said, Republican amendments,  but that is, whatever that number was, whether it was 10 or 15 or 25 or  35, more than we had in order.   As the gentleman knows, the last Congress was the most closed  Congress in history. In history. We did not see a single open rule, not  one under Speaker Ryan, not one. I am committed to ensuring, however,  that we have a limited amount of closed rules.   Again, the gentleman is correct, the government was shut down and we  had rules that we put forward to get the government open. It was not an  amendment to say partially open this. It was, let's get it open.   So that my answer to the gentleman is we said what we were going to  do on bills. We had 72 amendments on this bill. The proportion of  amendments, the gentleman's concerned about, certainly want to make  sure that we have substantive amendments considered from both sides of  the aisle; that was done here. The gentleman thinks not enough, but as  I said, it was, as opposed to zero, a substantial increase.    I thank the gentleman for yielding. Of course, we both  know, certainly since the time I have been here, that motions to  recommit, on both sides of the aisle, have been gotcha amendments. They  have been amendments to use for political ads to talk about  partisanship. Both sides did that, understand.   So is there consternation about them? There is. Did you have an MTR  today? You did. It was a difficult MTR. Of course, it dealt with a  problem that does not exist at the Federal level, and it said so in the  resolution, that there was not a problem that they were solving, just a  sort of a sense that local communities ought to be directed what to do.   Having said that let me go back to the gentleman's question again.  You said you had nine amendments. We had zero. So you could say it was  900 percent, 9,000 percent, but whatever you want to say, on H.R. 1 in  your Congress and H.R. 1 in our Congress and all those figures, I  think, are probably lost on the public, but what is not lost on the  public or the press that has covered it extensively, last Congress was  the most closed Congress in history, just as the Government being  shutdown at the beginning of this Congress was the first time that  happened in history, because you didn't get your job done.   But I would tell the leader, I understand the rights of the minority.  We want to honor the rights of the minority, and, yes, there is a lot  of discussion, but as you know, nothing has been done, and I am sure  those discussions will continue.   But I understand the gentleman's point. We used the motion to  recommit. You have used the motion to recommit. There is no proposed  change currently under consideration.    I tell the gentleman, I have heard that question raised  before.   You removed Mr. King from the committees after 10 years of comments,  speeches, and support for groups that did not comport with what we said  yesterday in terms of rejecting bigotry and prejudice and hate. Ten  years.                                time  1145    We have now twice taken action to make clear that hate and prejudice  and bigotry are not the policies of this Congress, of this country, and  should not be the policy of any of our Members, rhetorically.   Debating policy, having differences of opinion are clear. I don't  know whether the gentleman heard my speech on the floor, but I could  not, I think, have articulated more forcefully that anti-Semitism is  unacceptable,  [[Page H2605]]  that anti-Semitism has led to grievous results, unacceptable results,  the Holocaust, of course, being the most horrific.   I made that very clear. The resolution made that very clear. And yes,  it did include other forms and other objects of hate and prejudice and  bigotry.   And I was disappointed that 23 of your Members voted against it.  Every one of my Members, without exception, voted for that resolution.  So that resolution, I thought, that got over 400 of us, spoke very  strongly to our opposition to anti-Semitism, to racism, to sexism, to  Islamophobia.   And I haven't seen any resolution on the floor of the House when you  were in charge that responded to the President of the United States  stoking Islamophobia.   I saw no resolution. I saw no resolution on the floor when the  President of the United States made a comment that, well, there are bad  people on both sides, in Charlottesville--those holding Swastikas;  those who were saying we are not going to allow the Jews to take over;  those who had racist epithets and who, in fact, of course, killed one  of the participants. I saw no resolution. We ultimately did get to a  resolution.   But I would say to my friend, frankly, those of us on our side of the  aisle think that the President too often uses words and actions that  undermine the sentiment of the resolution that I voted for, that you  voted for, and the overwhelming majority of the House voted for saying  that is not and should not be the policy of the United States.   I won't go into more specifics, but the gentleman, I am sure, knows  that I could.   What is positive is that yesterday some 400-plus of us voted to say  to America and to each of our citizens and those who view America as a  beacon of liberty and justice that we reject out of hand any comments,  any actions that would be recognized by most people as stoking bigotry  and prejudice and hate.   So, yes, that language you are talking about, as introduced, was not  a final product. The final product came about through a lot of  discussions and addressing the hate and bigotry and prejudice that is  directed at too many people who are somehow viewed as different.   The remarks to which the gentleman referred were pointed out very  clearly as being remarks which had been used through the millennia as  ways to diminish the integrity of Jewish citizens and to imply that  somehow their support for Israel was an indication of their lack of  loyalty to their country. You and I both know that was used for  centuries, millennia, to marginalize Jewish citizens and to make them  feel unwelcomed and rejected.   So I think the resolution was a good thing for us to do. It passed  overwhelmingly. I am sorry that 23 of your Members decided not to vote  for it.   Let me go back to the MTRs.   We had a very strong statement that your side offered on anti- Semitism. And you all voted for it; we all voted for it. Not a single  Democrat voted against it. And when it came for final passage, I don't  recall how many Republicans, but it was the overwhelming majority of  your caucus voted against it.   So offering an amendment, having the amendment adopted, which we  accepted because we thought that it was important to make that powerful  statement against anti-Semitism, we adopted it.   Unfortunately, when it came to the real vote--not the political  gotcha vote, but when it came to the real vote--your side all voted  against it--or if not all, pretty close.    First of all, Mr. Speaker, let me say I reject out of hand  the premise that we didn't speak directly to anti-Semitism in the  resolution that was adopted yesterday, period. It spoke strongly to  that.   Not only did it speak strongly, but if the gentleman heard my  remarks, they were very strong with respect to an absolute rejection of  anti-Semitism.   Now, apparently, the problem is we also spoke against racism. We also  spoke against xenophobia.   I mentioned the President on xenophobia, the denigration of the  dignity  [[Page H2606]]  of immigrants who have been so important to this country at the highest  levels of our government, the allegations of widespread criminal  activity in a broad bush. That resolution yesterday spoke to that.   It spoke about Islamophobia. It spoke about hatred of immigrants, of  LGBT members of our society. It spoke against discrimination and hate.  And, yes, it spoke directly about anti-Semitism, as it should have.   As I was absolutely committed, and the Members of this House were  absolutely committed--save 23. I don't know why that 23 voted against  it, but they did, not on our side of the aisle.   And I agree with the gentleman. Hopefully, we can continue to not use  this as a political football, as I think it is being used.   And I am not going to cite some of the remarks of the minority leader  with respect to Mr. Soros, Mr. Steier or others, Mr. Jordan, Mr. King.  There was a difference, Mr. Speaker. We didn't wait 10 years.   Initially, we acted--the entire Democratic leadership--with a very  pointed and direct letter that anti-Semitism was not acceptable,  period. No confusion.   And within days, we put a suspension bill--which, by the way, the  rules are waived on suspension bills. As the gentleman knows, you don't  necessarily have to give 72 hours. But there were 72 hours that that  was being discussed, and people knew it was being discussed, and the  leader--and the whip has referred to that.                                time  1200    But I hope that nobody would diminish what we said yesterday about  anti-Semitism, or racism, or any other kind of ism.   Let us not diminish what we did yesterday. I think this was a good  week, Mr. Speaker, for the House of Representatives. We spoke about  making sure that voting rights were protected for every American, and  not only that, protected, but facilitated, made easier to register and  to vote so that all Americans could express their opinion on the  policies of their country and their State, and their municipality, or  whatever office they were voting for.   It was a good day to say that we are going to have redistricting  which is not run by the politicians, and I have been one of them that  has done it so everybody understands that. Every State, not just a few,  would have to have a redistricting process that was fair and balanced,  and not just the politicians drawing their own districts.   It was a good day, Mr. Speaker. It was a good week, because we also  spoke about making sure that we have campaign finance that discloses to  everybody who the contributors are. It is ironic, Mr. Speaker, that I  was here when we considered McCain-Feingold and the Republican  leadership in the House and the Senate both said: ``You don't need  caps. You don't need to limit spending. What you need is disclosure.  Let people know who is contributing.''   Well, of course, Citizens United undermined that pretty  substantially, and we have millions and millions of dollars nobody  knows where it comes from, so this bill did that.   This bill also said that we ought to have better ethics. We ought to  not be serving on boards of profit-making corporations while we are  making policies that affect them in this House. And, yes, it said the  President of the United States, as every President since I have been a  Member of Congress which has been since 1981, should disclose their tax  returns so that the people know, are they acting in their own interest,  or in the people's interest.   We called this bill the For the People Act, for voting rights, for  fair registration, for campaign finance that is honest and above board  and transparent, and for good ethical behavior by us and by the  President.   So I disagree with my friend, the minority whip. I think this was a  good week. In some ways, it was a tough week, but it was a good week. I  am very pleased that not only did we adopt that resolution against  hate, and prejudice, and bigotry against all, including and very  pointedly, starting out with anti-Semitism.   We also adopted a bill that will give more trust and faith to the  American people in their government and more access to the ballot box.  It was a good bill. It was a good week.    Will the gentleman yield on that point?    Mr. Speaker, why in his comment did he mention three  Americans of Jewish descent but didn't mention the Koch brothers, and  by the way, didn't mention the gentleman from Nevada?    Exactly. The three Jews that were mentioned were all  Democrats, and the Koch brothers were not mentioned.    I agree with that.    Of course not.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I urge both sides, when the leader of our Government says things that  clearly offend minority groups of all stripes that we speak out. I  think that is a good thing for us to do, and I am sure that we can be  joined together to do exactly that.   I would also ask the gentleman to perhaps observe the extraordinary  diversity representing all of America on this side of the aisle. You  ought not to be surprised that in representing that diversity, they  bring forward issues that we tried to also address in a resolution that  said hate, bigotry, and prejudice is wrong. It is un-American.   Unfortunately, none of us have ancestors today that were free from  pursuing hateful policies. We ought not to be, as I said on the floor,  too sanctimonious. We are a Nation that allowed slavery and went  through an extraordinary Civil War to eliminate that blot on ``We hold  these truths to be self-evident.''   So, yes, we have a lot of diversity on our side of the aisle, and  that diversity is representing its people. They are Americans, but they  represent a number of Americans who are perceived as different than  other Americans for some designation, either because of race, gender,  color, sexual orientation, or immigrant. You name it.   Yes, we have a lot of diversity on this side of the aisle, and we  tried to respect that diversity and make sure that every American knew  when they read this resolution; we are against discrimination against  anybody.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his yielding and  his comments.   Let me simply add, we can honor that by our words and our actions  today, and tomorrow, and every day thereafter.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet on Monday next, when it shall  convene at noon for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative  business.
