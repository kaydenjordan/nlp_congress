 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I rise today in strong support of the Homicide Victims' Families'  Rights Act, legislation that will help tackle the backlog of cold cases  and bring long overdue justice to more than a quarter of a million  unresolved or unsolved murder cases.   It is estimated that every murder victim leaves behind more than four  family members. This means that more than a million grieving loved  ones, families, friends, and communities, are still waiting for  answers.   And this is not just a problem in older cases. In 2017, the FBI  Uniform Crime Report estimated that across all levels of law  enforcement, investigators were only able to close 62 percent of murder  cases. We can help remedy this with the Homicide Victims' Families'  Rights Act.   This bill empowers families by affording them the right to have their  loved ones' homicide cases examined by a Federal investigator to see if  the case should be reinvestigated.   This is an important review process to establish, especially since  our technological and scientific investigation techniques are  constantly evolving and being improved, providing law enforcement new  tools to investigate even the oldest of cold cases.   This is a straightforward, smart bill that will hopefully bring peace  to victims' loved ones who are too often left in the dark.   I want to thank my friend and colleague, Congressman Swalwell, for  his extraordinary leadership on this bipartisan bill and encourage all  my colleagues to join me in voting ``yes.''   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a national victims' organization  group coalition letter of support; individual letters of support from  The American Investigative Society of Cold Cases, Parents of Murdered  Children, Inc., and Murder Accountability Project; and individual  letters of support from the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys, and  the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association.                                                  December 6, 2021.      Re Support the Homicide Victims' Families Rights Act.       Chairman Jerrold Nadler,      House Judiciary Committee,      Washington, DC.      Ranking Member Jim Jordan,      House Judiciary Committee,      Washington DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler and Ranking Member Jordan: The       undersigned organizations strongly support the bipartisan       Homicide Victims' Families Rights Act (HVFRA). It is our       understanding that this legislation, which is introduced by       Representatives Eric Swalwell (CA-15) and Michael McCaul (TX-      10), is being considered before your committee.        Violent homicides affect so many more lives that just the       victim. The undersigned organizations all provide essential       resources to families and loved one of homicide cases by       engaging in ongoing emotional support, education, prevention,       advocacy, and awareness. We provide continued support to       survivors during the devastation and helplessness they       constantly feel while waiting for justice and closure for the       murder of their loved ones.        HVFRA would expand rights to the families and loved ones in       federal cases by requiring reviews and reinvestigations of       cold case  [[Page H3878]]       homicides. HVFRA would also provide relevant resources to law       enforcement agencies by updating and categorizing the types       of crimes that lead to homicide, cold cases. With our       collective goals towards supporting families and loved ones       who seek justice for unsolved, crimes, we collectively agree       that HVFRA will provide important resources which will       provide justice.        The HVFRA assists families and loved ones of homicide       victims by:        Reinvigorating reviews of cold case murders files. Reviews       are initiated upon request by a loved one or family member       three years after a case goes ``cold.'' A case is ``cold'' if       no suspect is readily identifiable and all leads have been       exhausted.        Providing a full reinvestigation using the most up-to-date       technologies and investigative standards. Following a review       request, if law enforcement concludes that new probative       investigative leads would result, a full re-analysis must be       undertaken. This includes a complete review of the file and       accompanying evidence, new or renewed interviews with       potential subjects and witnesses, and other methods to       identify possible missed steps.        Increasing transparency in national crime databases. The       National Institute of Justice would annually publish detailed       statistics on the number of cold cases, aggregated by the       types of associated crimes and agency. This information will       assist law enforcement agencies across state lines to help       identify trends and hopefully find new leads.        Ensuring reviews and reinvestigations are working. Federal       law enforcement agencies would be required to provide annual       reports to Congress on what is working and what is not       working with new investigations. This will aide in ensuring       that programs are biased towards assisting family members and       loved ones find justice.        The undersigned organizations proudly support the HVFRA.       This important legislation is completely aligned with our       collective commitment towards assisting those who suffer       following a cold case homicide. It is our hope that the House       Judiciary Committee will promptly markup this legislation so       that it can be received before the full House floor for swift       passage.

Re Support Homicide Victims' Families Rights Act.       Chairman Jerrold Nadler,      House Judiciary Committee,      Washington, DC.      Ranking Member Jim Jordan,      House Judiciary Committee,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler and Ranking Member Jordan: The       National Organization of Parents Of Murdered Children (POMC),       a nonprofit organization dedicated to solely to the aftermath       and prevention of murder. POMC makes the difference through       on-going emotional support, education, prevention, advocacy       and awareness. POMC is very supportive of the Homicide       Victims' Families Right Act under consideration before your       commlttee.        POMC has many families of victims of un-solved homicides.       We listen to the survivor talk about the story of their loved       one's homicide and the questions they have because it has not       been solved. Their emotions, frustration and devastation they       feel, along with the helplessness that anything can be done       to bring justice and closure to the murder of their loved       one.        POMC has a program called Second Opinion Service that we       refer families to when investigators have not been able to       solve the case or don't understand why the case is not going       to court. The Second Opinion Service is made up of retired       law enforcement, medical examiners, prosecutors who volunteer       their time to look at the family's case and they will give       their opinion to the family. Most of the time these are cold       cases and we will not look at an open case. The family's are       relieved and comforted that someone will look at the case.       This is why the ``Support Homicide Victims' Families Rights       Act'' would be so important to a family whose loved one's       case is a cold case and just the thought that law enforcement       would look at it again is comforting to them.        POMC believes that the policies within the Homicide       Victims' Families Rights Act should be Adopted by law       enforcement agencies as best practices for unresolved murder.       It is our hope that the House Judiciary Committee will       promptly markup this legislation so that it can be received       before the full House floor for swift passage.        For further information about our organization you can       visit our website www.pomc.org, or if you have additional       questions regarding our support for this legislation please       do not hesitate to contact us.

Warnock,                                                 Executive Director,      Parents of Murdered Children.                                   ____                                   Murder Accountability Project,                                   Alexandria, VA, December 8, 2021.      Re Support Homicide Victims' Families Rights Act.       Chairman Jerrold Nadler,      House Judiciary Committee,      Washington, DC.      Ranking Member Jim Jordan,      House Judiciary Committee,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler and Ranking Member Jordan: The Murder       Accountability Project (MAP), a nonprofit organization       dedicated to educating Americans on the importance of       accurately accounting for unsolved homicides within the       United States, wishes to express its unconditional support       for the Homicide Victims' Families Rights Act under       consideration before your committee.        MAP regularly receives communications from family members       of victims of un-solved homicides. We cannot adequately       express to you the depth of emotion, frustration, and       consternation these people feel, as well as helplessness that       anything can be done to bring justice and closure to these       killings.        We regularly advise families to request a formal review of       the investigation by police personnel to determine if new       avenues are available to seek case clearance. This       recommendation would be precisely codified in the Homicide       Victims' Families Rights Act. More specifically, this       legislation allows family members or loved ones to seek       additional review and re-investigation into files that have       achieved a ``cold case'' status. It would also ensure that       older files are reviewed under the most up-to-date       investigative standards to aid law enforcement in identifying       new probative leads or potential perpetrators.        In short, we believe that the policies within the Homicide       Victims' Families Rights  [[Page H3879]]       Act should be adopted by law enforcement agencies as best       practices for unresolved murders. It is our hope that the       House Judiciary Committee will promptly markup this       legislation so that it can be received before the full House       floor for swift passage.

Re. Support of Homicide Victims' Families Rights Act.       Chairman Jerrold Nadler,      House Judiciary Committee,      Washington, DC.      Ranking Member Jim Jordan,      House Judiciary Committee,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler and Ranking Member Jordan: The       Association of Prosecuting Attorneys (APA) is a private, non-      profit organization whose mission is to support and enhance       the effectiveness of prosecutors in their efforts to create       safer communities. We are a national organization supporting       all prosecutors, including both appointed and elected, as       well as their deputies and assistants.        On behalf of the APA, I am writing in support of your       efforts regarding the proposed Homicide Victims' Families       Rights Act. This Act will give homicide victims' families and       loved ones a reignited hope that justice may still be       afforded to the victims of these crimes. The provisions in       this Act will grant the opportunity for cold cases to be       reopened so that new investigations, utilizing the latest       testing and investigative techniques, may produce results       which previous methods were unable to achieve. With the       steady increase of cold cases this Act is integral to       providing an opportunity to ensure that justice is upheld in       our communities.        The APA remains committed to working with congressional       leaders, victims' families and loved ones, and victims'       rights organizations in support of this Act. We believe that       this Act will not only aid the grieving families and       communities but will improve the entirety of the criminal       justice system.        APA appreciates your time and efforts on the Homicide       Victims' Families Rights Act. Should you have any questions       or need any additional information, feel free to contact me.            Respectfully submitted,                                                      David LaBahn,      President/CEO.                                   ____                                             Federal Law Enforcement                                            Officers Association,                                   Washington, DC, December 6, 2021.      Hon. Eric Swalwell,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Swalwell: We write to you today on       behalf of the 30,000 federal law enforcement members in FLEOA       to express our strong support for H.R 3359, ``Homicide       Victims Rights Act of 2021.''        The loss of a family member is tragic, made more so when       they are the victim of a crime that remains unsolved. It is       imperative that all families have a resolution. As       technologies have improved, the chance of getting to that       resolution of a crime has also dramatically improved.       Agencies with these types of cases should endeavor to use       every modern means available to review these cases and if       possible, bring the new technologies and science to bear to       try to solve them. These agencies will also be more capable       if resourced and funded appropriately in this important work.        Thank you again for your leadership on this effort. We look       forward to continuing to work with you on these matters and       if we can be of any additional assistance, feel free to       contact us.            Sincerely,      Larry Cosme,        National President, Federal Law Enforcement Officers       Association.     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  Prohibiting Punishment of Acquitted Conduct Act--commonsense bipartisan  and bicameral legislation to restore a key aspect of fairness to our  criminal justice system.   Under the U.S. criminal justice system, you are innocent until proven  guilty. A principle that is foundational to our system of law and  order.   Coupled with this principle, is that if you are charged with a crime,  you are entitled to a trial by a jury of your peers. If they find you  innocent, your case is finished.   This all makes sense--and aligns with our understanding of our  justice system. But, in too many cases, tour courts are punishing  people for crimes they've been found innocent of.   Currently, even if one jury finds you innocent and acquits you of a  crime, a different judge can still use that allegation as a basis of  providing a harsher punishment for a crime you are convicted of.   This means that the second judge can effectively unilaterally  overturn a prior acquittal when considering a future sentence-- dismissing the presumption of innocent until proven guilty.   This is absurd.   I was a litigator and defense attorney for many years, and I  understand exactly how unjust it is for someone found innocent to have  this ticking timebomb looming overhead.   This bill will end the practice of judges increasing sentences based  on conduct for which a defendant has been acquitted by a jury-- restoring a foundation pillar of fairness in our criminal justice  system.   I want to thank Congressman Cohen and Congressman Armstrong for their  leadership on this issue, and I urge my colleagues to support this  commonsense bill.
