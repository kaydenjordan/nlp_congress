 Mr. Chair, American frontier investors  can be a powerful partner of the State Department and emissaries of  American values in developing regions of the world. In these critical  regions, they provide ideal alternative sources of capital over China  or other authoritarian regimes. For our friends and allies with  developing or unstable economies that China or other adversaries want  to undermine, American investment is hard power, creating  infrastructure, factories, boosting crop yields, industrial output, and  jobs. In countries where America is locked in competition for  influence, American investment in a gas plant, pipeline, or telecom  network can sway the strategic calculation of the home government.   We rightly hold our investors to a high standard, through the Foreign  Corrupt Practices Act and other laws, but that higher standard makes it  harder for them to compete against Chinese or Russian investors that  are heavily and unfairly subsidized. In exchange, when they come under  attack by corrupt home governments, we owe them the support of our  diplomats and the full weight of the U.S. Federal Government.   Diplomatic support can persuade corrupt governments to change course  and to play by the rules, but too often, the State Department takes a  hands-off approach.   The hands-off approach can reach absurd heights. Even in cases where  a kleptocratic government blatantly expropriated American investments,  these investors took that government to arbitration and won, and then  took that award to our United States Federal  [[Page H4759]]  Courts to get recognition of the award under the Federal Arbitration  Act, our State Department has refused to help Americans right the wrong  and collect the award.   This has to stop. We are in competition with corrupt dictators all  across the globe. American investors need to know that American  diplomats have their back.   I ask for your support of the amendment.
