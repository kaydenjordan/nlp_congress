 The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from Louisiana (Mr. Kennedy), the Senator from South Dakota (Mr.  Rounds), the Senator from Nebraska (Mr. Sasse), and the Senator from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey).    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1948         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.         (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Chronic       Disease Management Act of 2019''.        (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) A small number of chronic diseases account for the       majority of health care spending in the United States.        (2) The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health of the       Department of Health and Human Services used a deliberative       process involving the Multiple Chronic Conditions working       group subject matter experts in clinical medicine,       epidemiology, and public  [[Page S4459]]       health to develop a list of 20 chronic conditions that are       prevalent and potentially amenable to public health or       clinical interventions, or a combination of both.        (3) Limited and targeted interventions for many chronic       diseases prevent the need for additional, more costly       therapies associated with untreated or unmanaged chronic       diseases that lead to adverse effects on quality of life for       patients.        (4) These types of chronic care preventive services should       be encouraged to maximize the effectiveness and positive       outcomes of the care provided under high deductible health       plans.        (5) Section 223(c)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code of       1986 explicitly grants the Secretary of the Treasury       flexibility in defining the scope of preventive care for       purposes of the preventive care safe harbor. As of the date       of introduction of this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury       has refrained from exercising existing authority under such       section to expand the preventive care safe harbor to include       chronic disease prevention.        (6) In the absence of an expansion of the preventive care       safe harbor by the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chronic       Disease Management Act of 2019 would expressly permit high-      deductible health plans to provide chronic disease prevention       and treatment, subject to certain limitations, prior to a       plan enrollee having met their plan deductible.        (7) Allowing health savings account-eligible high-      deductible health plans to cover chronic disease prevention       and treatment on a pre-deductible basis promotes the concept       of Value-Based Insurance Design, which is an effective tool       to improve the quality and reduce the cost of care for       Americans with chronic diseases, with improved outcomes via       increased medication adherence, reduced complications, and       decreased emergency department visits.       SEC. 2. CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION.         (a) In General.--Section 223(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue       Code of 1986 is amended by redesignating subparagraph (D) as       subparagraph (E) and by inserting after subparagraph (C) the       following new subparagraph:        ``(D) Safe harbor for absence of deductible for care       related to chronic conditions.--A plan shall not fail to be       treated as a high deductible health plan by reason of failing       to have a deductible for care related to the treatment of any       chronic condition, as determined by the Assistant Secretary       for Health of the Department of Health and Human Services.''.        (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section       shall apply to coverage for months beginning after the date       of the enactment of this Act.                                  ______                                         By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Ms. Smith):   S. 1949. A bill to amend the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch  Act to require the Secretary of Agriculture to make loan guarantees and  grants to finance certain improvements to school lunch facilities, to  train school food service personnel, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1948         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
