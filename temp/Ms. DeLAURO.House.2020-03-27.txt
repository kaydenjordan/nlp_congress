 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this historic bill.   This is the biggest economic and health crisis the country has ever  faced. Nurses and doctors are in intensive care units trying to save  our humanity against this awful pandemic. This is the biggest  governmental response the country has ever seen to rescue people, the  economy, and our healthcare system.   It is necessary. The United States is now the epicenter of a global  pandemic. Cases of the coronavirus are rising exponentially.    To slow the spread of the contagion, serious measures of social  distancing are underway. Schools are closing. Businesses are  shuttering. Last week, more than 3 million filed for unemployment.   So, the hour is dark. But today, Congress is ready to help get  families, workers, and the country to the dawn of recovery. For that, I  commend Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Appropriations Chair Nita Lowey, and all  the Appropriations subcommittee chairs. Their leadership has been  crucial in the progress that we were able to make for the people.  [[Page H1821]]    Had we passed our House bill, things would be different, but we  managed to shape this package in a fundamental way. We secured a large  investment in hospitals, health systems, and State and local  governments; a profound increase in unemployment insurance benefits;  and a significant expansion in support for small businesses. We made  rent, mortgage, and utility costs eligible for SBA loan forgiveness.   As chair of the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and  Related Agencies Subcommittee, I am proud of the investments we have  made for working people, for public health, and for our teachers and  students.   For health, we secured $140 billion for the Department of Health and  Human Services; $4.3 billion for the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention to respond to the pandemic; $945 million for the NIH to  support research; $127 billion for our medical response effort; and  important increases for seniors, those living with disabilities, and  those struggling with mental health.   For education, we secured $30 billion for the Department of  Education, billions for elementary and secondary education, and  billions to help colleges and universities confront the immediate  effects of the pandemic.   While this funding is crucial, let me be clear: It is a start.   For working people and families, we secured $3.5 billion for the  Child Care and Development Block Grant and $360 million for programs at  the Department of Labor.   I am proud of the increases that other Appropriations subcommittee  chairs have secured: millions to ensure the Economic Injury Disaster  Loans; millions to assist firefighters and our first responders to  secure personal protective equipment; $25 billion for public transit to  protect passengers and operators as they access essential services; $5  billion for the Community Development Block Grant program, to help  communities respond to economic and housing impacts; emergency funding  for child nutrition programs; $4 billion for homeless grants; and $45  billion for FEMA disaster relief, providing assistance to every single  State that has declared an emergency. And we have provided relief to  our Tribal organizations and to our territories.   So, I embrace this historic bill. I know the Speaker, Appropriations  Chairwoman Lowey, and the committee chairs fought to include paid sick  days, paid leave for all, increased food assistance, and a strengthened  and fully refundable child tax credit and a young child tax credit.  Soon, duty will call on us to take the next major bold steps in this  crisis.   I call on the House of Representatives to support the relief that  Americans need.    Mr. Speaker, with state revenues collapsing at the same  time demand for services is skyrocketing, we have had broad agreement  that something needs to be done to help the states. Although some might  have preferred to increase the federal matching rate for Medicaid, this  legislation goes a different route with a fiscal relief fund for state  and local governments.   In any case, the key is to help states plug the enormous fiscal gaps  they are currently facing. I am pleased that the final legislative  language, unlike some earlier proposals that we rejected, gives states  broad flexibility in how they spend the money they will receive. At  this point, it has become impossible to separate the effects on state  budgets of rising demands for services and shortfalls in revenues.   States cannot spend the money on new projects unrelated to the public  health emergency and its economic fallout. I doubt any state would have  done that anyway, but the legislation clearly says that they cannot.   Beyond that, we trust states' discretion about what expenditures are  necessary in light of the current crisis. We also know that states  planned many expenditures assuming revenues that they are no longer  receiving. An activity without the revenue to support it is not  accounted for in the state's budget.   States should understand that they can apply this money to prevent  the cuts that would devastate their necessary functions that they can  no longer cover from their general funds because of the loss of sales  and income tax revenues. We are assured that the Treasury Department  appreciates the importance of getting this money out to states quickly,  flexibly and with a bare minimum of paperwork.   I include in the Record the following Washington Post article,  ``States and Cities Should Brace Themselves for a Downward Spiral,''  written by Catherine Rampell and published yesterday, March 26, 2020.         States are facing huge shortages--and not just of       ventilators, masks and health-care personnel. They're about       to confront enormous budget shortages, too. This is the       sleeper issue of the current economic crisis, and aiding       states now could well be the difference between a brief       recession and a prolonged depression.        Particularly in ailing regions of the United States that       still haven't recovered from the last recession.        The bill the Senate passed Wednesday would give state and       local governments $150 billion to help plug budget holes. It       also includes $31 billion for local schools and colleges.       That money is definitely welcome.        But it will be nowhere near sufficient to prevent cascading       state and local government layoffs and cuts to critical       public services that otherwise lie ahead. For context: States       suffered a cumulative $600 billion revenue shortfall in the       first five years after the Great Recession hit.        And there are ample reasons to believe the fiscal crunch       could be worse this time around. Many states entered this       dual public health and economic emergency in poor budgetary       shape, with too little in their ``rainy day'' funds to handle       this Noah-style deluge. As of late last year, only about half       the states had the funds they need to weather even a moderate       recession, according to Moody's Analytics.        Seemingly every state will take a huge hit, for different       reasons. Those whose economies are especially dependent on       tourism (Florida, Nevada), energy (Texas, Oklahoma) and other       hard-hit sectors are in trouble. As are those dependent on       capital gains revenue (New York, California), given stock       market declines. High-fixed-cost public transit systems       everywhere will suffer as they lose rider revenue. And so on.        Among the biggest problems are the expected declines in       sales tax collections, which make up about a third of state       revenue. With millions of retail stores, restaurants and       other businesses shuttered, sales on which those taxes are       based have stopped. Even the early-pandemic panic-buying is       unlikely to help, because groceries, medications and other       necessities are often exempt from sales taxes.        Taking a cue from the feds, many states have delayed their       deadlines for filing 2019 income taxes, too, meaning they       will not be able to count on an April bump.        Tax money that would normally be withheld from people's       paychecks this year will also be depressed while people are       out of work, suggesting revenue shortfalls will continue for       a while.        Depending on how long layoffs last, they could eventually       start to depress property values, too--and thus the property       taxes that disproportionately pay for schools and local       services. Which suggests there could be reverberating fiscal       effects for years after this pandemic ends.        That's just one side of the ledger. Meanwhile, states'       expenses are spiking, too.        This always happens during recessions, as people seek a       safety net when their income falls. But the particular cause       of this recession--a public health emergency--means there       will be even more demand for public services than usual.        Already, unemployment insurance claims are off the charts,       with initial claims filed last week reaching an all-time high       of 3.3 million. (The past record was 695,000, in 1982.) That       figure probably understates the severity of the need, because       government unemployment websites have crashed.        The aid package passed the Senate Wednesday would top off       what states will offer workers seeking unemployment benefits,       and extend benefits to new categories of workers, but states       will still be on the hook for huge obligations.        Medicaid enrollment also usually rises during a downturn,       as jobless people lose their private insurance and reduced       earnings make people newly eligible for benefits. But given       that this downturn was caused by a pandemic, we should expect       that more people than usual will seek public insurance, and       that the spending per enrollee will be higher than normal.        In its ``phase two'' bill, Congress temporarily increased       the share of Medicaid costs borne by the federal government--      but not by nearly as much as is needed, and not even by as       much as it did in response to the Great Recession. Which is a       shame, given that Medicaid is such a useful vehicle for       distributing federal funds to states even when there isn't a       public health emergency.  [[Page H1853]]         The fastest, most efficient way to get money out to the       states is through Medicaid, because there's a whole mechanism       already that allows for that all in place,'' said Scott       Pattison, former executive director of both the National       Governors Association and the National Association of State       Budget Officers.        Unlike the federal government, most state and local       governments are legally required to balance their budgets.       Without more federal help, states and cities shouldn't expect       a swift snapback from this crisis. Instead, they should brace       for a downward spiral--of service cuts, deteriorating       conditions for households and businesses, and depressed       economic conditions for years to come.
