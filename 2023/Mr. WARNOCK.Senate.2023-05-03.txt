 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise today in shock and sorrow and in  grief for my home State. And, if I am honest, I rise really with a deep  sense of anger about what is happening in our country in the area of  gun violence and death.   I stood here in March of 2021 after a gunman went on a rampage across  Metro Atlanta and snatched eight precious souls--people with families  and friends who loved them dearly. And here I am standing again, this  time with the tragedy having occurred in midtown Atlanta, right in my  own backyard.   While this is still a developing situation, according to media  reports, so far, at least five people were shot--five--on a random  afternoon. There has been one fatality. The others were taken to the  hospital.   I want to take a moment and thank law enforcement officials for  keeping us as safe as they can. I want to thank them for their work  trying to apprehend this individual.   I am also thankful for local media who are keeping all of us  informed, and I am grateful for our first responders, the people in  healthcare, the people on the front lines. We count on them every day  to care for those who are injured, to respond to people in peril. That  is what makes this particular shooting ironic and deeply upsetting,  because it underscores the fact that none of us is safe no matter where  we are. This happened in a medical facility where people are trying to  find healing.  [[Page S1490]]    So I want to underscore that, because there have been so many mass  shootings--in fact, about one every day in this country this year-- that, tragically, we act as if this is routine. We behave as if this is  normal. It is not normal. It is not right for us to live in a nation  where nobody is safe no matter where they are.   We are not safe in our schools; we are not safe in our workplaces; we  are not safe at the grocery store; we are not safe at movie theaters;  we are not safe at spas; we are not safe in our houses of worship.  There is no sanctuary in the sanctuary. We are not safe at concerts; we  are not safe at banks; we are not safe at parades; we are not safe in  our own yards and in our own homes. Now, today, we can add medical  facilities to that list.   And, still, we have done so very little in this building to respond-- and in the American political square at large. I think there is an  unspoken assumption. I think that the unspoken assumption is that  ``This can't happen to me. This won't happen to me. It won't happen to  people that I love.'' But, with a mass shooting every day, the truth is  the chances are great.   I shudder to say it, but the truth is, in a real sense, it is only a  matter of time that this kind of tragedy comes knocking on your door.  Then, in a deeper sense, I think it is important for us to recognize  that it is already happening to you. You may not be the victim of a  mass shooting. You may not know anyone who is the victim of a mass  shooting yet, but in a real sense, it is already happening to all of  us.   Dr. King was right:         We are tied in a single garment of destiny, caught up in an       inescapable network of mutuality. Whatever affects one       directly, affects all indirectly.    This is knocking on all of our doors, and I feel this this afternoon  in a very real sense--I feel it in my bones--because my own two  children were on lockdown this afternoon.   I have two small children, and their schools are on lockdown in  response to this tragedy. They are there. I am here. I am hoping and  praying that they are safe, but the truth is none of us are safe.   As a pastor, I am praying for those who are affected by this tragedy,  but I hasten to say that thoughts and prayers are not enough. In fact,  it is a contradiction to say that you are thinking and praying and then  doing nothing. It is to make a mockery of prayer. It is to trivialize  faith. We pray not only with our lips; we pray with our legs. We pray  by taking action.   Still there are those who want to convince us that this is the cost  of freedom. To them, we have to say no. This ongoing, slow-moving  tragedy in our country--mass shootings as routine--is not the cost of  freedom; it is the cost of blind obstinance, a refusal to change course  even when the evidence suggests we must do something different. It is  the cost of demagoguery--those who want to convince us that commonsense  gun reform is somehow a call to take everybody's guns. This is not the  cost of freedom. Dare I say it is the cost of greed--gun lobbyists  willing to line their pockets even at the cost of our children.   And so we must act.   I am proud of the fact that we did, after 30 years, pass some gun  safety legislation here in the last Congress. It was a significant  piece of legislation, but, obviously, it was not enough. There are 87  percent or more of Americans who believe that we ought to have  universal background checks, and still we can't get it. Think about  that. In a country where everybody says we are divided--and there are  deep divisions, to be sure. There is disagreement on this issue, to be  sure. But in a country where there is 87-percent agreement on  something, there is no movement on it in Congress, which means that  that is a problem with our democracy. The people's voices have been  squeezed out of their democracy, and there is a growing chasm between  what the people actually want and what they can get from their  government.   We saw it in a stark and ugly way a few weeks ago when we had two  brave, young legislators stand up in Tennessee--three, in fact. The  same legislature that refused to do anything on gun violence came down  on them with all of their might and expelled them from the legislature.   We have to stand up against these anti-democratic forces at work in  our country, and we have to give the people their voices back. If we  refuse to act while our children are dying and in a moment when no one  is safe, then shame on us. Shame on us if we allow this to happen, and  we do absolutely nothing.   Saint Augustine, the African bishop of the early church, said that  hope has two beautiful daughters. He said they are both beautiful,  Anger and Courage--anger with the way things are and courage to see  that they do not remain as they are.   I am pleading; I am begging all of my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to remember the covenant that we have with one another as an  American people. Stand up in this defining moment, and let's do  everything we can to protect all of us and, certainly, all of our  children. We owe it to the people who have sent us here.   I know there are those who will look at this moment and say:  Politically, do you really think we can get anything done here? They  will ask if this is the time given the state of politics in our country  right now.   I respond with the words of Dr. King, who said that the time is  always right to do what is right, and that time is right now.   I yield the floor.    Thank you so much.   I am deeply honored to participate in this great tradition started by  Senator Doug Jones of Alabama during his tenure and carried out by my  colleague Senator Brown.   I am always honored to revisit these words from Dr. King from the  letter from a Birmingham jail. So without delay:         My Dear Fellow Clergymen:        While confined here in the Birmingham city jail, I came       across your recent statement calling my present activities       ``unwise and untimely.'' Seldom do I pause to answer       criticism of my working ideas. If I sought to answer all of       the criticisms that cross my desk, my secretaries would have       little time for anything other than such correspondence in       the course of a day, and I would have no time for       constructive work. But since I feel you are men of genuine       good will and that your criticisms are sincerely set forth, I       will try to answer your statement in what I hope will be       patient and reasonable terms.        I think I should indicate why I am here in Birmingham,       since you have been influenced by the view which argues       against ``outsiders coming in.'' I have the honor of serving       as president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference,       an organization operating in every southern state, with       headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. We have some eighty five       affiliated organizations across the South, and one of them is       the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights. Frequently       we share staff, educational and financial resources with our       affiliates. Several months ago the affiliate here in       Birmingham asked us to be on call to engage in a non-violent       direct action program if such were deemed necessary. We       readily consented, and when the hour came we lived up to our       promise. So I, along with several members of my staff, am       here because I was invited here. I am here because I have       organizational ties here.        But more basically, I am in Birmingham because injustice is       here. Just as the prophets of the eighth century B.C. left       their villages and carried their ``thus saith the Lord'' far       beyond the boundaries of their home towns, and just as the       Apostle Paul left his village of Tarsus and carried the       gospel of Jesus Christ to the far corners of the Greco Roman       world, so am I compelled to carry the gospel of freedom       beyond my home town. Like Paul, I must constantly respond to       the Macedonian call for aid.        Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all       communities and states. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and       not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice       anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in       an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment       of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all       indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the       narrow, provincial ``outside agitator'' idea.        Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be       considered an outsider anywhere within its bounds.        Now, you deplore the demonstrations taking place in       Birmingham. But your statement, I am sorry to say, fails to       express a similar concern for the conditions that brought       about the demonstrations. I am sure that none of you would       want to rest content with the superficial kind of social       analysis that deals merely with effects and does not grapple       with underlying causes. It is unfortunate that demonstrations       are taking place in Birmingham, but it is even more       unfortunate that the city's white power structure left the       Negro community with no alternative.        In any nonviolent campaign there are four basic steps:       collection of the facts to determine whether injustices       exist; negotiation; self purification; and direct action. We       have gone through all these steps in Birmingham. There can be       no gainsaying the fact that racial injustice engulfs this       community. Birmingham is probably the most thoroughly       segregated city in the United States. Its ugly record of       brutality is widely known. Negroes have experienced grossly       unjust treatment in the courts. There have been more unsolved       bombings of Negro homes and churches in Birmingham than in       any other city in the nation. These are the hard, brutal       facts of the case. On the basis of these conditions, Negro       leaders sought to negotiate with the city fathers. But the       latter consistently refused to engage in good faith       negotiation.        Then, last September, came the opportunity to talk with       leaders of Birmingham's economic community. In the course of       the negotiations, certain promises were made by the       merchants--for example, to remove the stores' humiliating       racial signs. On the basis of these promises, the Reverend       Fred Shuttlesworth and the leaders of the Alabama Christian       Movement for Human Rights agreed to a moratorium on all       demonstrations. As the weeks and months went by, we realized       that we were the victims of a broken promise. A few signs,       briefly removed, returned; the others remained. As in so many       past experiences, our hopes had been blasted, and the shadow       of deep disappointment settled upon us. We had no alternative       except to prepare for direct action, whereby we would present       our very bodies as a means of laying our case before the       conscience of the local and the national community. Mindful       of the difficulties involved, we decided to undertake a       process of self purification. We began a series of workshops       on nonviolence, and we repeatedly asked ourselves: ``Are you       able to accept blows without retaliating?'' ``Are you able to       endure the ordeal of jail?'' We decided to schedule our       direct action program for the Easter season, realizing that       except for Christmas, this is the main shopping period of the       year. Knowing that a strong economic-withdrawal program would       be the by product of direct action, we felt that this would       be the best time to bring pressure to bear on the merchants       for the needed change.        Then it occurred to us that Birmingham's mayoral election       was coming up in March, and we speedily decided to postpone       action until after election day. When we discovered that the       Commissioner of Public Safety, Eugene ``Bull'' Connor, had       piled up enough votes to be in the run off, we decided again       to postpone action until the day after the run off so that       the demonstrations could not be used to cloud the issues.       Like many others, we waited to see Mr. Connor defeated, and       to this end we endured postponement after postponement.       Having aided in this community need, we felt that our direct       action program could be delayed no longer.
