 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the life  and service of Mr. James Huston Murphy.   James is a 94-year-old decorated World War II veteran as well as a  native of the 11th Congressional District in Georgia.   Jim graduated from Lanier High School for Boys in 1942 and was an  officer in the school's ROTC program, where he was preparing for a  career as an officer in the U.S. military. The ROTC program is where  Jim learned valuable lessons that would serve him down the road during  the war.   In the fall of 1942, Jim enrolled at Georgia Tech, in Atlanta, with  the hope of receiving an Army officer's commission through Tech's  senior ROTC program. At that time, the United States was 4 years into  World War II; and at the urging of Army recruiters, Jim and most of his  fellow ROTC classmates enlisted in the Reserves because the military  wanted them to complete college and officer training before going to  Active Duty.   However, that idea was short-lived, because in March of 1943,  President Franklin D. Roosevelt called Jim's ROTC class and others  across the Nation into immediate Active Duty. They were needed as  ground troop replacements, and at that time, Jim was barely 18 years  old.   In the spring of 1943, Jim reported to Fort McPherson in Atlanta,  where he faced many challenges, but nothing more daunting than passing  the military standard eye exam. And I know you are thinking: How  difficult is an eye exam? Well, for Jim it was nearly impossible  because Jim was blind in his left eye from birth.   This disability would disqualify Jim from serving in the military,  but Jim was not going to let that stop him from serving his country. He  believed that service was his duty, and after playing a few hand tricks  during the exam, he passed.   In March of 1944, Jim was entered to Camp Howze near Gainesville,  Texas, to join the 103rd Infantry Division. The division was embroiled  in intensive combat training, and since Jim had already received some  artillery training, he was assigned to Battery C of the 928th Field  Artillery Battalion, a 105-millimeter howitzer unit.   They trained long and hard, knowing they were headed for war. They  learned the mission of artillery to support advancing infantry ground  forces in combat and how to bracket your target area by trial and  error. Jim's job was to be the forward observer radio operator when  they were in combat and a jeep driver when the battery was moving  forward.    Only a few months had passed since Jim was assigned to the 103rd  Infantry Division before he was aboard the USS Monticello heading for  the war.   The trip across the Atlantic was anything but luxurious. The military  had packed the ship like ``a can of sardines,'' as Jim put it; and the  2-week voyage was full of severe storms and indescribable seasickness,  and a fear of being torpedoed always loomed in the back of their minds.   After arriving in France, it would not take long for Jim's combat  unit to see their first action, and it occurred while they approached  the Vosges Mountains in northeastern France. One of Jim's forward  observer team was killed by rifle fire in the small town of Barr, which  meant that Jim and the other member had to carry on the job a man  short. For this, they were later awarded the Bronze Star.   Jim survived the record winter that enveloped northern France,  Belgium, and Germany during the war, but he did not leave unscathed. On  Christmas night 1944, after finishing a warm meal, Jim became very sick  while single-handedly manning a forward outpost only 200 yards from  German soldiers. The pain became so intense that he had to be  transported to a field hospital, and doctors determined he had a bad  case of appendicitis.   While Jim was lying in the hospital bed after appendix surgery, the  Battle of the Bulge was just getting underway, and Jim realized his  battery desperately need him. Going against doctors' orders, Jim put on  his uniform, left the hospital, and hitched a ride back to his battery.  The rest of Jim's unit was amazed he came back, and in the meantime,  his battery commander had learned he was blind in one eye. Jim was  nominated for the Silver Star, but Jim refused, as he felt any citation  earned should go to the entire battery, not just him.   Germany surrendered in May of 1945, marking the end of the war effort  in Europe, but the war was still raging in the Pacific, and that is  where Jim was sent. However, before Jim got there, the atomic bombs  were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and World War II was soon over.   In Jim's own words: ``My contributions to World War II, from  enlistment to discharge, was 2 years, 11 months, and 14 days of my  youth, including 9 months in combat. For this I am proud and have no  regrets. I did not have to go to the war, but I believed it was my  duty, and I wanted to go.''   Jim will be the first to tell you his story is like so many others  who fought in Europe during World War II, but in reading his memoirs,  his selflessness, his duty to his country and fellow soldiers was quite  exemplary.   Mr. Speaker, Georgia's 11th Congressional District and the United  States House of Representatives thanks Jim. We thank him for his  service to our Nation and his sacrifice for our freedoms.                            ____________________
