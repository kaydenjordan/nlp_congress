 Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the memory of  Leon E. ``Bill'' Braxton, a World War II veteran and teacher who  dedicated his life in service to our Nation and educated countless  students throughout his career.   Bill Braxton was born near Hope Hills, NC, on May 1, 1917. After  graduating high school in 1934, he enlisted with the U.S. Army in April  1935, serving in Panama, Austria, Germany, Japan, and Korea. He was an  honor graduate of the Coast Artillery School, European Air Transport  Service's Flight Captain's School, and the Air Force Office of Special  Investigations. Bill flew combat missions in Indo China in 1954 and  aided the French at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu.   In 1959, he retired from the U.S. Air Force and enrolled at the  University of Miami, graduating magna cum laude with a degree in  German. He then received a fellowship under the National Defense  Education Act to attend Kent State University, earning a master's  degree in German in 1964.   Bill's first teaching position was at Hialeah High School, teaching  German and English. He taught at Stetson University before moving to  Satellite Beach in 1971, where he joined Satellite High School. While  there, he developed the school's German Student Program and was named  teacher of the year for southern Brevard County. His proudest  achievement was establishing the school's Fulbright Student Exchange  program for German students before retiring from the school in 1979.   In retirement, he continued to teach French, German, and Spanish at  Brevard Community College and co-authored four nonfiction books based  on his life experiences, people he met at home and abroad, and events  he witnessed while serving in the military.   Bill Braxton lived a full life and made a difference for his  community and his country. I express my sincerest condolences to his  four children--Thomas Braxton, Douglas Braxton, Patty Braxton, and  Susan Braxton--his seven grandchildren, and his three great- grandchildren. May God bless his family during this time of sorrow, and  may they be strengthened by the memory of his life's service.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I recognize Jeff Becker, the  Lee County Teacher of the Year from Island Coast High School in Cape  Coral, FL.   Jeff believes building trust with his students is important for their  future success. Every morning, Jeff greets students as they walk into  the building and spends his lunch break in the cafeteria getting to  know everyone.   Jeff is the digital media technology teacher, where he strives for  his students to learn video skills. He is credited with transforming  the school's news program, winning Best High School News Show at the  Lee County Film Festival Awards in his first year of teaching.   He was previously in sales for 4 years and noted that, while he was  having a fun time, he felt as though he should be doing something else  with his life. He became a guidance counselor at Cape Coral High School  in 2011 after earning his master's degree in elementary and secondary  school counseling at Wilmington University.   I extend my sincere thanks and gratitude to Jeff for his dedication  to the students at his school and look forward to hearing of his  continued good work in the years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I recognize Caroline Buechner,  the Santa Rosa County Teacher of the Year from Navarre High School in  Navarre, FL.
