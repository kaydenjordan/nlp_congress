 Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Washington  State for delaying the quorum call.   I appreciate the opportunity to visit with you today and to share  some of the conversations I had yesterday before the Judiciary  Committee in regard to the confirmation of a Coloradan, Judge Neil  Gorsuch, who now serves on the Tenth Circuit Court, which is housed in  Denver, CO.   Yesterday began his confirmation hearing before the Senate--the first  step in a process which will ultimately end in his confirmation as a  Justice to the U.S. Supreme Court. It was a great honor to be able to  introduce Judge Gorsuch to the committee. It is a tradition that  Members of the Senate from the home State of the judge nominated to  serve on the High Court be allowed to introduce the nominee--in this  case, a judge of the Tenth Circuit Court. I joined my Democratic  colleague Michael Bennet from Colorado in this tradition and am very  excited to express my support for Judge Neil Gorsuch.   I thought this afternoon I would share some of the comments I gave  yesterday before the committee. I will start by talking about  Confluence Park in Denver, CO.   In downtown Denver, if you look at Cherry Creek and the South Platte  River, they join together. That is where the Colorado Gold Rush began.  When it was first discovered, it started bringing people out to the  West, out to Colorado, to a place now known as Confluence Park, where  the two rivers come together.   At Confluence Park in Denver, if you look, there is a plaque on one  of the walls there that has a poem written on it from Colorado poet  laureate Thomas Hornsby Ferril. It is a poem known as ``Two Rivers''  describing the settlement of the West. The poem ends with this:         I wasn't here, yet I remember them.        That first night long ago, those wagon people        Who pushed aside enough of the cottonwoods        To build our city where the blueness rested.    ``Where the optimistic blueness of our Colorado skies rests against  the mountains and the plains'' is a good description of our great  State. We are reminded about how incredibly diverse our great Nation  is, its people and its geography. Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the  Supreme Court helps recognize the diversity in geography, the diversity  of our country, and it helps to recognize that indeed there are highly  qualified jurists who reside west of the Mississippi River.   Judge Gorsuch is a fourth-generation Coloradan. He is a skier. He is  a fly-fisherman. He serves on a court that represents 20 percent of our  Nation's landmass.   Once confirmed, Judge Gorsuch will be only the second Coloradan to  have ever served on the Nation's highest Court. The first Coloradan to  serve on the High Court was Justice Byron White. Justice Byron White  also led the NFL in rushing, which is something Neil Gorsuch won't be  able to claim when he is confirmed but is certainly something that  makes his confirmation as the second Coloradan unique in our history.  Should he be confirmed, Judge Gorsuch will also make history as he  represents the first Generation X Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court,  the emerging generation of American leadership.   Judge Gorsuch was confirmed to the Tenth Circuit Court unanimously by  voice vote in this Chamber in 2006. In fact, 12 current Democratic  Senators did not oppose his confirmation, including three distinguished  members of the Judiciary Committee. Ranking Member Feinstein, Senator  Leahy, and Senator Durbin are all members of the Judiciary Committee  who supported, through voice vote, his nomination. Eleven years ago,  Senator Graham presided over an empty committee dais as Neil Gorsuch  faced his confirmation in 2006. No one showed up. What a difference a  court can make. The level of bipartisan support for his 2006 nomination  is almost unheard of in today's political climate, but when you look at  his record, his writings, and his statements, it is easy to see why  Judge Gorsuch has such overwhelming support.   Judge Gorsuch is not an ideologue. He is a mainstream jurist who  follows the law as written and doesn't try to supplant it with his own  personal policy preferences. As he said, ``Personal politics or policy  preferences have no useful role in judging; regular and healthy doses  of self-skepticism and humility about one's own abilities and  conclusions always do.''   Judge Gorsuch is not an activist judge but, rather, a faithful  adherent to and ardent defender of our Constitution. Judge Gorsuch said  that judges have a ``foundational duty'' to ``do more than merely  consider [the Constitution]. . . . They take an oath to uphold it.''   The judge recognizes that the judiciary is not the place for social  or constitutional experimentation and that efforts to engage in such  experimentation delegitimize the Court. As he said, ``This overweening  addiction to the courtroom as the place to debate social policy is bad  for the country and bad for the judiciary. . . . As a society, we lose  the benefit of the give-and-take of the political process and the  flexibility of social experimentation that only the elected branches  can provide.''   Judge Gorsuch has a deep appreciation and respect for the  constitutional principle of federalism and the separation of powers  prescribed by our Founding Fathers. As he stated, ``A firm and  independent judiciary is critical to a well-functioning democracy.''   Judge Gorsuch understands the advantage of democratic institutions  and the special authority and legitimacy that come from the consent of  the governed. As he said, ``Judges must allow the elected branches of  government to flourish and citizens, through their elected  representatives, to make laws appropriate to the facts and  circumstances of the day.''   Judge Gorsuch appreciates the rule of law and respects the considered  judgment of those who came before him. As he said, ``A good judge will  seek to honor precedent and strive to avoid its disparagement or  displacement.''   It is this appropriate temperament, this fidelity to the  Constitution, this remarkable humility that has made Judge Gorsuch such  a consensus pick among Colorado's diverse legal and legislative  communities.   Former Colorado Senator, Democrat Ken Salazar, Secretary of the  Interior under Barack Obama, in praising Judge Gorsuch's temperament,  said during his circuit court confirmation:         [A] judicial nominee should have a demonstrated dedication       to fairness, impartiality, precedent, and the avoidance of       judicial activism--from both the left and the right. I       believe that Mr. Gorsuch meets this very high test.    A very prominent Colorado lawyer and former adviser to President Bill  Clinton said:         Judge Gorsuch's intellect, energy, and deep regard for the       Constitution are well known to those of us who have worked       with him and have seen firsthand his commitment to basic       principles. Above all, this independence, fairness, and       impartiality are the hallmarks of his career and his well-      earned reputation.    Hundreds of prominent liberal and conservative Colorado attorneys  support Judge Gorsuch, writing this bipartisan letter of support  praising the judge:         We hold a diverse set of political views as Republicans,       Democrats, and Independents. Many of us have been critical of       actions taken by President Trump. Nonetheless, we all agree       that Judge Gorsuch is exceptionally well qualified to join       the Supreme Court. He deserves an up-or-down vote.    The people who know him best in Colorado--they have worked with him  [[Page S1872]]  in the Tenth Circuit Court, and they have worked with him in private  practice--believe that he deserves an up-or-down vote, believe that he  is exceptionally well qualified to join the Supreme Court.   One of the individuals, one of the lawyers, one of the Democrats who  signed that very letter, who wrote this phrase, was a Democrat who was  the cochairman of the host committee for the Democratic National  Convention in Denver in 2008 that saw the nomination of then-Senator  Barack Obama to be the Democratic candidate for the 2008 ticket.   Colorado's former Democratic Governor Bill Ritter and former  Republican Attorney General John Suthers jointly said:         It is time to use this confirmation process to examine and       exalt the characteristics of a judge who demonstrates that he       or she is scholarly, compassionate, committed to the law, and       will function as part of a truly independent, apolitical       judiciary. Judge Gorsuch fits that bill.    Judge Gorsuch has a consistent record of applying the law fairly, and  his reputation among his peers and lawmakers is evidence of it.   According to the Denver Post, Marcy Glenn, a Denver attorney and  Democrat, recalls two cases before Gorsuch in which she represented  underdogs, and she said: ``He issued a decision that most certainly  focused on the little guy.''   That same article cited another example. ``Judge Gorsuch can't be  pigeonholed as either pro-prosecution or pro-defense,'' said Peter  Krumholz, a Denver appellate attorney who reviewed the nominee's  criminal law record. ``He is very independent and will not hesitate to  rule in favor of a criminal defendant's rights when he thinks it's  warranted by the Constitution.''   For all these reasons cited today and the many reasons that have been  cited over the past several weeks, I am certain Judge Gorsuch will make  Colorado proud and that his opinions will have a positive impact on  this country for generations to come.   I look forward to Judge Gorsuch receiving a fair hearing today,  tomorrow, and after that, to working with my distinguished colleagues  on both sides of the aisle to expeditiously confirm his nomination.   Thomas Hornsby Ferril, a great poet laureate, wrote another poem.  This one is memorialized on a mural painted in the rotunda of the  Colorado capitol. It ends with these words: ``Beyond the sundown is  tomorrow's wisdom. Today is going to be long, long ago.''   The wisdom of Neil Gorsuch, guardian of the Constitution, will serve  our Nation well for generations to come.
