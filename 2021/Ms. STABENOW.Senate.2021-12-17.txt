 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I am so pleased today to rise to speak  about two incredibly competent women who are going to be coming before  us for votes for the Michigan Federal district bench a little bit later  today.   First of all, I rise in support of the nomination of Judge Shalina  Kumar to be the U.S. district court judge for the Eastern District of  Michigan. During her nomination hearing, Judge Kumar spoke about her  father, Dr. Krishna Kumar, who moved to the United States from India.  Dr. Kumar taught all of his children to believe in themselves and that  they could be anything if they put their minds to it, and that is just  what Shalina Kumar has done.   She was born in Royal Oak, MI, received her undergraduate degree from  the University of Michigan, and graduated from the University of  Detroit Mercy School of Law. She spent a decade in private practice  before being appointed by Governor Jennifer Granholm to the Oakland  County Sixth Circuit Court in 2007.   She has since been elected by Michigan voters, and since January  2018, Judge Kumar has served as the chief judge of the circuit court.  During her time as a judge, Judge Kumar has presided over more than  10,500 cases, and she has served as presiding judge of the Adult  Treatment Court, which allows people to avoid jail time by getting  mental health treatment, help with employment and education, which is  so important. During her nomination hearing, Judge Kumar talked about  the amazing transformation she sees in people and how grateful they are  for the opportunity to contribute to society.   She has also served as the chairperson of the Oakland County Criminal  Assignment Committee, a member of the Michigan State Bar  professionalism committee, and a member of the Executive Committee of  the Michigan Judges Association.   If confirmed, Judge Kumar would be the first Federal judge of South  Asian descent in Michigan, and there is no doubt that her father and  her home State of Michigan will be very, very proud. I enthusiastically  support this nomination and hope that my colleagues will do the same.                       Nomination of Jane M. Beckering    Mr. President, secondly, I rise also to give strong support as well  for the nomination of Judge Jane Beckering to be U.S. district court  judge for the Western District of Michigan. I can think of few people  more qualified or more respected and more ready to serve the people of  Michigan in this new role.   Jane Beckering is a native of West Michigan. She attended the  University of Michigan and then the University of Wisconsin in order to  carry on her family's legacy. Both her father and her grandfather were  trial lawyers--two of the world's finest, according to Judge Beckering.  They believe that America's system of justice was the best in the  world, and they taught Judge Beckering that civility, integrity, and  respect for others are the trademarks of the legal profession.   Judge Beckering has spent her career upholding these ideals. During  her more than three decades of legal experience, she has presided over  and issued an opinion on more than 4,000 cases. Since 2007, she has  served as a judge on the Michigan Court of Appeals and is the chief  judge pro tempore of the court. She was first appointed to the court by  then-Governor Jennifer Granholm and later elected by the people of  Michigan.   Before that, Judge Beckering was a trial attorney in Grand Rapids,  and she has been actively involved in the West Michigan legal  community. She has a broad range of experience in a wide range of  cases, including multi-State commercial litigation, product liability,  personal injury, and wrongful death cases.   For all of these reasons, Judge Beckering was strongly supported by  the Western District Judicial Nominations Advisory Committee. She was  unanimously rated ``well qualified'' by  [[Page S9279]]  the American Bar Association, and she received bipartisan support in  the Senate Judiciary Committee.   She is just the type of person we need in the Federal judiciary, and  I am eager for her to begin her new role. I wholeheartedly support this  nomination and encourage my colleagues to do the same.   Both Judge Kumar and Judge Beckering are extremely qualified and  competent judicial nominations that are in front of us today, and I  hope everyone will be supporting them as strongly as I am. And I know  people in Michigan are very, very proud of both of them.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
