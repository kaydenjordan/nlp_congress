 Mr. Speaker, with all the political rhetoric, the finger- pointing, and the many versions of TrumpCare, hyperpartisan politicians  often forget what this debate is all about.   It is about people, about relieving a person's pain and suffering,  about giving a person a chance to live a healthy and happy life. It is  about Max Page. Maybe you will remember him. Max was the mini Darth  Vader from a Super Bowl commercial in 2011 who captured our hearts.   Max was born with tetralogy of Fallot, a rare and deadly congenital  heart defect. Throughout his 12 years, Max has had more than 10 heart  surgeries under the loving care at Children's Hospital Los Angeles. He  lives every day with a pacemaker and an artificial pulmonary valve.  Open heart surgeries are complex and very serious surgeries. They are  tough on patients, with often a long recovery, and grueling for the  family.   Max stopped by my office a few days ago to talk about his experience,  and he told me: ``I am going to have my condition all my life. I am  going to have surgery as a constant commotion on my life. I just want  to be covered. I don't want to have to worry about insurance and how I  am going to pay these bills. I just want to focus on keeping myself  healthy and not having to sacrifice everything for a surgery.''   Max wants to play baseball. He loves Harry Potter, and he dreams of  being an actor. Earlier this year, Max was in the hospital for  treatments for an entire month. His mom, Jennifer, described how they  were feeling bummed one day after such a long and arduous hospital  stay. They decided to take a walk, and on their walk they met a boy  Max's age named Will. Will is still in the hospital today. He has been  there 9 months waiting desperately for a heart transplant.   Max told me how Will has spent every holiday and even his birthday in  the hospital this year. Max wanted to do something for Will, so they  had these bracelets made. He named them ``Will Power.'' They have Max's  favorite verse on them. Max and Will connected. They developed a bond  bound by compassion. Their hope for a normal life gave them strength  and friendship, and Max promised Will he would bring the bracelets to  Congress when they came.   Philippians 4:13: ``I can do all things through Christ who  strengthens me.''   Max and Will, that is my favorite verse, too.   Max is fighting to protect other kids like him and Will, people with  a preexisting illness, from losing coverage and having to pay more from  facing a lifetime path on coverage.   He came to tell the stories of so many other children he knows from  his many hospital visits. His message is simple: ``Children's  healthcare needs a bipartisan solution.''   Max and Will and all the friends they have made in the hospital  aren't rooting for Democrats or Republicans. They are fighting for  their life and rooting for each other. They are children who want to  get healthy, who want to stay healthy and care for one another.   We can all learn from Max's and Will's selfless courage to help  others. Stop the hyperpartisan fight to score political points and  start fostering a bond through compassion.   Let's find a way to protect healthcare for Max and Will. In the midst  of this healthcare fight, we should take a moment to pause and remember  that goal. Let's be like Max and think of others as we come together to  find a bipartisan solution to address what isn't working, and remember  Max's message: Children's healthcare, all healthcare, must and should  be a bipartisan issue.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, our constituents sent us here to discuss our  differences honestly and openly and come together to pass bipartisan  legislation addressing our Nation's most pressing issues.   Every year I have been in Congress, I have voted in favor of  bipartisan, clean funding bills to give our troops a pay raise and fund  our military in the VA. I took those votes proudly, working with  Democrats and Republicans.   Today, I am outraged Republican leadership played politics with this  critical funding. To include a poison pill rider that wastes $1.6  billion in taxpayer dollars on an ineffective border wall is just  shameful. We all know this wall will not make us any safer. Even law  enforcement officials oppose this funding.   I am very disappointed GOP leaders would link President Trump's  divisive campaign rhetoric with what should unite all Americans:  supporting our troops and veterans.   Because of procedural trickery, debate was not allowed. That would  have allowed a bipartisan agreement on a clean bill supporting our  troops and our veterans.   Shameful.                            ____________________
