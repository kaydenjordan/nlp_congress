 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Concealed  Carry Reciprocity Act as well. This commonsense legislation protects  the constitutional right to bear arms by allowing qualified individuals  to carry a concealed firearm across State lines.   Our First Amendment rights to free speech don't change when we cross  State lines, and neither should our Second Amendment constitutional  right to protect ourselves.   Unfortunately for Marylanders, our right to bear arms is still  heavily restricted by gun-control liberals in our State legislature.   Restricting the right to own firearms only hurts a law-abiding  citizen's right to defend herself. Cities like Baltimore and Chicago,  with their out-of-control murder rates despite their highly restrictive  gun laws, are proof of that.   Concealed carry reciprocity will make our country safer. Self-defense  is the top reason cited for owning a firearm, and concealed carry  permit holders are certainly not to blame for our Nation's violent  crime problem.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass H.R. 38 and protect our  Second Amendment rights.                            ____________________
