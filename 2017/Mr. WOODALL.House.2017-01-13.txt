 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a  vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 48 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                 H. Res. 48         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 3) setting forth the       congressional budget for the United States Government for       fiscal year 2017 and setting forth the appropriate budgetary       levels for fiscal years 2018 through 2026. The first reading       of the concurrent resolution shall be dispensed with. All       points of order against consideration of the concurrent       resolution are waived. General debate shall not exceed two       hours, with 90 minutes of general debate confined to the       congressional budget equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the       Budget and 30 minutes of general debate on the subject of       economic goals and policies equally divided and controlled by       Representative Tiberi of Ohio and Representative Carolyn       Maloney of New York or their respective designees. After       general debate the concurrent resolution shall be considered       for amendment under the five-minute rule. The concurrent       resolution shall be considered as read. No amendment shall be       in order except the amendment printed in the report of the       Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution. Such       amendment may be offered only by the Member designated in the       report, shall be considered as read, and shall be debatable       for the time specified in the report equally divided and       controlled by the proponent and an opponent. All points of       order against such amendment are waived. After the conclusion       of consideration of the concurrent resolution for amendment,       the Committee shall rise and report the concurrent resolution       to the House with such amendment as may have been adopted.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       concurrent resolution and on any amendment thereto to       adoption without intervening motion. The concurrent       resolution shall not be subject to a demand for division of       the question of its adoption.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the bill (S. 84) to provide       for an exception to a limitation against appointment of       persons as Secretary of Defense within seven years of relief       from active duty as a regular commissioned officer of the       Armed Forces. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read.       All points of order against provisions in the bill are       waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and on any amendment thereto to final passage       without intervening motion except: (1) 90 minutes of debate       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Armed Services; and (2)       one motion to commit.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), my good friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I  may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded  is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 48 provides for  consideration of S. Con. Res. 3, the FY17 budget resolution, as well as  consideration of a bill to move forward on the process of confirming  our civilian Secretary of Defense, former General Mattis.   Mr. Speaker, the rule is a structured rule today to move  expeditiously on both of these measures, and in the time we have gotten  to spend together, Mr. Speaker, you know I am a fan of the festival of  democracy that can be the Committee on Rules process, particularly the  appropriations process. But there are times where moving expeditiously  is required, and today is one of those days.   You are not going to see a rule like this come very often because we  are considering the FY17 budget resolution today. Historically, as you  know, in this Chamber, when we get ready to consider budget  resolutions, Mr. Speaker, we are considering every single one that any  Member of Congress would have an opportunity to write. That process  takes place every spring to meet the statutory deadline of passing  budgets by April. This is not that budget today, Mr. Speaker.   This is a budget, as you know, to move us forward on a reconciliation  process to finish up the FY17 budget process, and rather than  considering all the amendments that one might have to offer, we have  made in order just one. It is the Democratic substitute. It is offered  by my good friend, the ranking member on the Committee on the Budget,  Mr. Yarmuth, and it is absolutely worthy of the Membership's  consideration. But it is not going to be a vote-a-rama on every budget  known to mankind. It will be the underlying budget from the House  Committee on the Budget as well as one substitute from the ranking  member.   Mr. Speaker, when it comes to consideration of the measure to waive a  statutory prohibition on naming a civilian Secretary of Defense who has  been out of the military for less than 7 years, we are also offering  that under a closed rule today. No amendments are going to be made in  order. You may not know, Mr. Speaker, but that is the  [[Page H478]]  only statutory change that has passed the United States Senate in 2017.   When we talk about having to move expeditiously, when we talk about  whether or not we are going to have an open process or a closed  process, understand that while this body has passed dozens of statutory  changes in just these first 9 days of legislative activity, the Senate  has passed but one. This is in anticipation of an inauguration of a  President on January 20. This is in anticipation of trying to fill out  a Cabinet. This is in anticipation of trying to make sure that civilian  leadership is in place on day one to lead and to serve the men and  women of the United States military.   This is not the time to have that vote-a-rama. This is the time to  move expeditiously, again, with a bill that has passed in a bipartisan  way in the other Chamber. I look forward to getting back into the  business of leading the Senate, not following the Senate. I look  forward to getting back in the business of voting on absolutely every  idea that Members bring to this floor.   Today, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule so that  we can move expeditiously on two of our priorities: passing that FY17  budget resolution and ensuring the speedy confirmation of the civilian  leader of the Department of Defense.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to yield 4 minutes  to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), who probably knows more  about the Health and Human Services Appropriations bill than anyone  else in this Congress, the cardinal from that committee in the 114th  Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to thank my  colleague for her admonition to reject divisive and self-serving  rhetoric because I think that is absolutely something we should take to  heart.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr.  Newhouse), a member of the Rules Committee and a new member of the  Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Reluctantly I recognize that we are, apparently, not going to have an  end to divisive, self-serving rhetoric. I am still optimistic, as it is  a long year ahead of us.   What the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan) is suggesting, Mr.  Speaker, is that we ensure the failure of Social Security going  forward. The only guaranteed benefit in Social Security is that it is  guaranteed to fail. Those are not my words. These are the words of the  actuaries who are in charge of protecting Social Security. The  nonpartisan actuaries who govern Social Security say that there is not  enough money today to pay the benefits that folks are expecting. The  law of the land, as it exists today, requires that, when that day  comes, benefits will get cut dramatically. Only a 75 percent  realization of benefits is what the law requires that befalls our  senior citizens. If we pass the amendment that is suggested by my  friend, we would be prohibited from considering any solutions to that  problem. Means testing, which my colleagues have advocated for years,  is off the table under that scenario.   Mr. Speaker, to suggest that anyone on this side of the aisle wants  to undermine the commitment that this country has made to our seniors  is ludicrous; but to suggest that I go to a 22-year-old, whose polling  today suggests he or she believes they are more likely to see a UFO in  their lifetime than a Social Security check in their lifetime--to  suggest that going to that 22-year-old and my thinking that maybe his  retirement age would be a year or two higher than his great- grandparents' since he is now living decades longer--I will remind my  colleagues we came together in a bipartisan way to raise the retirement  age from 65 to 67 in 1983, not because one of us hated seniors and one  of us loved seniors, but because we all believed in our commitment to  seniors.    Mr. Speaker, don't let the Record reflect anything other than that  this budget resolution provides the framework to begin this discussion,  to begin the discussion of what comes next. There is not a single line  of authorizing language in this budget resolution. Any suggestion that  the law will change tomorrow because of this budget resolution is  false. The law will be the same tomorrow as it was yesterday. The  difference is we have begun a path--we will have created a framework;  we will have provided the tools--to have a discussion about how to  solve very real problems in this country.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The gentleman from Massachusetts said in his opening statement that  he didn't come to Congress to hurt people; that he came to help people.  I want to stipulate that that is 100 percent true. There is no one in  this Chamber who I believe has a bigger heart for men and   [[Page H482]]  women than the gentleman from Massachusetts, which is why I know that  he does not support what I see happening to my constituency.    He says people are paying less for their health care today. I dispute  those numbers writ large, but I know it is true in my district because  the free healthcare clinic has doubled since the passage of ObamaCare.  Folks once had access to small plans that they chose for their  families. Those plans were outlawed. Now they have high deductible  plans that are worthless to them, so they seek care at the free  clinics. I know that ripping the plans out from under those men and  women in my district was not the gentleman's intention when he passed  the Affordable Care Act, but it is absolutely the result.   I know that when the gentleman set up those exchanges, which all  Americans were supposed to be able to go to to buy their healthcare  plans, he did not intend for those plans to get canceled year after  year after year after year, because they were unsustainable. We all  know, of the constituents in our districts who did what the government  told them to do, they lost the plans their employers used to provide;  they went to the exchanges to buy a plan; and, 1 year later, those  plans were canceled. They went through the process again: they picked  out other plans; they went through the exchanges and paid their money;  and, 1 year later, those plans were canceled again and again.   We all know those constituents; so to suggest that the only reason  someone would come to the floor today would be to solve a nonexistent  problem is ridiculous. We all know that there are problems. What is  ridiculous are the folks who would come and defend the status quo. The  status quo is indefensible, Mr. Speaker.   When we get together, we can do amazing things. There are vast  experiences of the Members in this Chamber, Mr. Speaker, and our  bringing those to the table leads to better solutions. We have spent 6  years being stuck in the status quo, and this bill represents an  opportunity to turn the page on that status quo, and I know every  single Member has constituents in his district who will welcome it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1000     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I was not in Congress at the time the Affordable Care Act passed, but  I remember it, watching from home. We talk about this as if it was some  sort of thoughtfully crafted piece of legislation that folks are so  tremendously proud of. I happen to have the numbers here, Mr. Speaker.   It was H.R. 4872 that moved through the House, that was the  authorizing part. We had three votes in the U.S. House of  Representatives on that bill. We had a motion to recommit, as it was  not actually a healthcare bill to begin with, and a vote on final  passage.   Then it went over to the U.S. Senate where they worked their will on  it. They had 43 votes on it, amendments offered, ideas, and changes.   Then it came back to the House where we changed it not at all. There  was one straight partisan vote on the Affordable Care Act. Not one idea  from the U.S. House of Representatives added, not one change from the  U.S. House of Representatives, not one alteration of any kind.   As you recall, Mr. Speaker, they had a filibuster-proof majority in  the United States Senate, so Democrats could work their will any way  they wanted. When they lost that filibuster-proof majority--they only  had 59 votes out of 100 instead of 60--they ended debate, they ended  discussion, they ended collaboration and jammed what they had passed at  midnight on Christmas Eve right on through the U.S. House of  Representatives. I can't imagine who defends that as the proper outcome  of the legislative process. We have a chance to change that, Mr.  Speaker.   I am glad that my friend from Connecticut has some constituents that  have benefited. I have some constituents that have benefited. But I  have constituents who are being failed, and I know my friend from  Connecticut does, too.   I am glad that my friends on the other side of the aisle are talking  about all of their success stories, but I want my friends to join me  and grapple with all of the failures.   I will not deny the way the conversation about health care has  changed since the passage of the Affordable Care Act--folks talking  about preexisting conditions, folks talking about lifetime caps, folks  talking about keeping young kids on their policies until they are 26.   I just don't understand why my colleagues would deny that folks who  used to have care, now don't. Folks who used to have affordable plans,  now don't. Folks who used to be able to take care of their employees  through their small business plans, now can't. This is undisputed, and  we have an opportunity to do better. I hope my colleagues will join me  in doing that.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  to share with my friend from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) that one is  not entitled to their own facts, but one is also not entitled to share  just half the story and leave it as if it is the entire story.   Everything the gentleman from Massachusetts said was true, until the  U.S. House abdicated any responsibility whatsoever and passed exactly  what the Senate did with no amendment whatsoever. All of the work  product the gentleman talked about, all of the work that the gentleman  talked about went for naught in this U.S. House of Representatives.   To deny that this is not the bill that folks wanted to have crafted  is to deny reality. To deny that this is not the bill that folks wanted  to have crafted is to deny the nine different times the Republican  House and Senate sent to the President repeals of ObamaCare, things  that were so broken even the President couldn't live with it and he  signed those repeals into law.   Mr. Speaker, I am not trying to denigrate any of the motives of my  friends on the other side of the aisle. I just can't understand, for  the life of me, why they don't want to try to do better.   That pride of authorship, that arrogance, it has a real impact on the  men and women that I serve, and I am asking my friends to partner with  me to help me fix it. But if they won't partner with me, I am going to  move forward and fix it anyway.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Shimkus).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds just to say  absolutely none of that is true. Absolutely not one word of that is  true. This bill does not one of those things. This bill does, in fact,  nothing to change the law at all in any way, shape, or form. It is not  true. This bill provides a process for debating the law, and I  certainly hope we will pass it so we can have that debate.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I advise my friend from Massachusetts I do  not have any further speakers and would be happy to close when he is  prepared.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I am fond of telling folks back home, Mr. Speaker, when they tell me  they know exactly what is going to happen over the next 2 years, that I  don't think they are telling me the truth. Because I confess to you, I  have absolutely no idea what is coming over these next 2 years. I think  these next 2 years are going to be unlike any we have seen in the  history of self-governance in this land; and, candidly, I am excited  about that because the status quo isn't working for the 700,000 people  that I represent.   I don't know what's going to happen over these next 2 years, but I  believe that, for the first time, we are going to grapple with some  really, really, really hard problems that folks on both sides of the  aisle have been ignoring for too long.   Mr. Speaker, I don't question the commitment of my friends on the  other side of the aisle to the American people. I question the  legislation that they use to deliver it. You heard my friend from  Oklahoma talk about premiums going up 67 percent for his constituents.  That is indefensible. It is not okay. We can do better, and, with the  passage of this budget resolution, we will have the tools to do that. I  say again, the law will be the same tomorrow as it is today, but we  will have the tools to grapple with these problems.   Eight million Americans were so failed by the Affordable Care Act  that they paid a tax penalty instead of accessing care. That is not  okay. I don't believe a single Member on the other side of the aisle  decided they just wanted to tax young people instead of provide young  people with quality care. This budget will give us the opportunity to  have the tools to fix that problem.   Billions of dollars, Mr. Speaker, have gone into State-based co-ops  that have failed, gone bankrupt, and terminated all of their plans  which not only ripped health care out from under the American people,  Mr. Speaker, but threw billions of dollars away in administrative costs  at the same time. That is not okay. That is indefensible. We can do  better. Passing this budget resolution will give us those tools.   Mr. Speaker, I made a commitment in the Rules Committee last night to  do everything I could to stop poisoning the well of public discourse.  Then I re-  [[Page H488]]  upped for the Rules Committee, and I realized that is going to be a  tough promise to fulfill. We have difficult work to do, and we are  passionate about the quality of that work.   But, Mr. Speaker, we all know the status quo has failed. We all know  that we have the opportunity to deliver, and we all know that a vote of  ``yes'' on this budget resolution will give us more tools to deliver  that success than we have today. We need to do this. We need to  celebrate doing this.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support the rule and support the  two underlying measures that it will bring to the floor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
