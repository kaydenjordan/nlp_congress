 Mr. Speaker, last Friday, September 17,  was POW/MIA Recognition Day. This important day is a time to remember  the brave men and women who have yet to return home.   Currently, there are more than 80,000 American servicemembers who  remain unaccounted for from World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam  War, and the Cold War, and the Gulf Wars.   Our servicemembers are the bravest among us. They answer the call to  protect and defend our country in times of war and in times of peace.  While many return home, some do not.   In May, I introduced the Prisoners of War and Missing in Action Trade  Agreement Resolution. This resolution urges our mutually beneficial  trade agreements to include a commitment from trading partners to  continue the search and recovery efforts of our Nation's missing  servicemembers.   Mr. Speaker, in honor of POW/MIA Recognition Day, I urge my  colleagues to join this resolution. We must uphold the eternal promise  to our Armed Forces to always bring our men and women home.   In that spirit, I also want to say thank you to one of my alma  maters, Penn State University, that in a stadium of about 110,000, they  placed one seat that will never be filled until the last of all those  who are missing will return home. That was dedicated in honor of Penn  State graduate and Vietnam veteran, Major Louis Smith, who has yet to  return home from that war.                            ____________________
