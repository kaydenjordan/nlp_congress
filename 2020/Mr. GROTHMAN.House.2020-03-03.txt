 Madam Speaker, first of all, I will let you know, so we  break the suspense, I will probably be more like 5 minutes, so it is  easier for everybody.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk one more time about the crisis at  the border.   One more week has gone by, and for 1 more week, Donald Trump is out  there alone fighting to preserve the integrity of our border and who  the future citizens of the United States of America are.   Donald Trump is a fan of immigration, that is why, on his watch, we  are now up to around 750,000 people being sworn in legally in this  country every year, and there has been no effort made to really  substantially reduce that number.   Nevertheless, we do want to pick our immigrants. We want our  immigrants to be people who have come here legally and are  appropriately vetted, and Donald Trump is doing what he can--without  any help from Congress, I might add--to make sure that that happens.   The first thing that Congress has to do is to make permanent the  Public Charge rule. Donald Trump has correctly said, even for legal  immigrants, we are not going to take people in this country if we  expect they would be permanently, or close to permanently, taking  advantage of the programs our government has to offer.   Right now, 63 percent of the noncitizens, compared to 35 percent of  the native-born, are on some sort of government program. We have a hard  enough time at this time of trillion-dollar deficits taking care of our  own citizens who have fallen on hard times without taking the people  who are on hard times from all around the world.   Donald Trump is putting his finger in the spigot, but we know the day  will come when we have a different President. When we have a different  President, I am scared to death the new President will go back to the  old method of anybody can come here, and, if they come to our country  for free Pell grants, if they come to our country for free food, if  they come to our country for free medical care, if they come to our  country for free housing, we will let them back in.   Madam Speaker, I wish President Trump would always be able to prevent  that, and I am sure he is going to continue to prevent that as long as  he is President; but, if you look at the other people running for the  job, I wouldn't bet that even by this time next year, and certainly  within 5 years, we won't be back to the days of being the welfare  magnet for the Western Hemisphere or the entire world.    Madam Speaker, I call on Congress to step up and pass legislation  that a future President cannot undue, stating that we are not going to  have more people here as a public charge.   Secondly, a couple weeks ago, I went down to the border one more time  and had a chance to talk to local law enforcement, some of the citizens  on the border, as well as the Border Patrol. They are appreciative of  the things that the current administration is doing.   I saw 12 miles of wall being built at the Arizona border. I saw that,  while it might be possible to get around the wall, it would be very  difficult. I don't think most people could climb a 30-foot wall, much  less get over the concertina wire on top, much less get down the other  side.   But, again, those are actions from President Trump. I wish, in the  future appropriations bill, Congress would fully fund that wall like  the Border Patrol, who sees what is going on every day, wishes they  had.   President Trump has reached an agreement with the Mexican Government  so that people coming here seeking asylum pending their hearing can be  held in Mexico rather than coming across, living in this country,  having children with birthright citizenship, and taking advantage of  laws that law-abiding people from other countries don't have.   Again, President Trump has reached an agreement with Mexico, and that  is why we have gone from 80,000 or 90,000 people, at least, coming in  the border in May of last year to under 2,000, we  [[Page H1469]]  believe, more recently. But, again, that is another victory that could  be short-lived.   We heard again, currently, it could easily be over 90 percent of the  fentanyl, of the meth and heroin come across the border. This should be  a national crisis. More people are dying on an annual basis from this  scourge than died in the entire Vietnam war.   Nevertheless, it is still treated as no big deal, and Congress is not  going out of its way to do anywhere near what it should to prevent  these drugs from coming across the border, which are killing our  citizens.   Furthermore, the drug cartels who control that border are breaking up  families and taking advantage of young people, 14-, 15-year-olds, to  smuggle across the border.   Why do they do it? Because they know, in the United States, we are  not going to incarcerate people who are 15 years old for sneaking drugs  across the border.   It amazes Border Patrol that, a few times, some potential immigrant  commits a crime and they are separated from their children; meanwhile,  the drug cartels have thousands of people separated from their parents  to do their dirty work and barely a peep from the average American  Congressman who is so worried about things otherwise.   We also had a chance to look at the Nogales border and see what is  going on there and the possibility that people are going over the wall.  We heard, again, we could use more dogs on the southern border, not  only to detect drugs coming across one way, but to detect cash coming  across the other way--something else that, if this Congress really  cared about our border, they would do something about.   We heard, again, about the dangers of having the drug cartels control  our southern border rather than our Border Patrol, wealthy drug cartels  that may be paying off some American citizens who live on the border  and may be paying off Mexican military, maybe Mexican police. When they  sneak people over the border, it is not unusual to have these people  dehydrate in the Arizona desert. It is not unusual to have these people  drown in the Rio Grande River.   The fault is the inactivity of the American Congress to really secure  these borders so we don't continue to empower the Mexican drug cartels  that are not only causing people to die coming here, but are also  corrupting the Mexican Government, resulting in the high homicide rates  that we see south of the border.   Madam Speaker, I call upon Congress to act to immediately hire more  Border Patrol, to hire more dogs, to make sure we have enough funding  for the wall, to permanently cause people trying to come into this  country to have to stay south of the border pending their asylum  hearing, to change the asylum laws so that anybody can't just say ``I  am in danger in my home country'' and come here, and, above all, to  change the public benefits rule so that our future immigrants are  uniformly hardworking people who are going to be an asset to America  rather than the current situation in which they are apparently  disproportionately the type of people who come on the government.   We are all willing to take care of the people in the United States  who have fallen on hard times, but the idea of going back to the days  in which people all around the world know that the United States of  America is the welfare magnet for anyone is ruining our country, and it  is hard to imagine people who don't take these actions as anything  other than people who want to permanently change our country.   Madam Speaker, I call on Congress to take action that President Trump  would suggest so that, if, God forbid, anything happened to him, we  still are in a position to protect our border and save our great  country.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 3 o'clock and 14 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, March 4, 2020, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
