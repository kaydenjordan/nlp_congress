 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my support for H.R. 3848, as amended,  the Housing our Military Veterans Effectively, or HOME Act.   I have conflicting emotions as I finally stand here advocating for  the  [[Page H6096]]  passage of the HOME Act. On one hand, I am elated to finally see this  language move forward that will ultimately get more veterans off the  street and into housing. That is my goal here, to end veteran  homelessness. On the other hand, I remain frustrated with the length of  time it took this body to take up this bill and the fact that I will  have to be back on the floor next year advocating for the same  authorities here to be extended yet again since most of this bill  expires on September 30, 2024.   Last week, VA announced they met their goal to house 38,000 veterans  this calendar year several months early. I am very proud of this  accomplishment, but unfortunately, this does not reflect the full  picture of the reality we face related to veteran homelessness in our  country.   HUD's 2023 Point-in-Time Count will be released soon. Based on  initial reports from communities across the country, it will likely  show a dramatic increase in veteran homelessness. We are losing ground.  The VA is doing incredible work to get veterans into housing, but when  one veteran gets housed, another is falling into homelessness.   We need to bolster the prevention tools the VA and providers have to  quickly address a veteran's housing insecurity the moment it occurs.  The Democratic-led authorities in the HOME Act are those very tools.   This bill, which includes two Democratic bills, from Congresswomen  Cherfilus-McCormick and Williams, gives the VA and its community  providers the flexibilities and resources they need to effectively  house veterans experiencing homelessness and at risk of becoming  homeless.    However, the bill before us today isn't perfect. It has technical  flaws that we quickly brought to the attention of our Republican  colleagues, but they refused to fix it. If we send the language we are  considering today over to the Senate, the Senate will have to amend the  language, pass it, and send it back to the House for final passage,  leaving more time that the VA and providers operate without these  authorities, more time that homeless veterans go without, and more time  that homeless veterans spend on the street.   I need not say to all in this Chamber that we know that December is  upon us. I spoke in the Chamber just a few weeks ago about the fact  that winter was upon us and yet we had not passed the HOME Act.   I am really disappointed by this unforced error of being in a  position where we find ourselves here on the floor to pass an empty  gesture. We reported this bill out to the House in July. As happens,  there have been additional changes that needed to be made. We had  agreement with the Senate on these changes, yet the majority chose not  to proceed with the agreement. We are here on a bill that is not going  anywhere any time soon.   The reality of this situation is that Republicans are playing games  and using homeless veterans as their pawns. Homeless veterans do not  have time for games. Maybe it seems easy because these most vulnerable  veterans don't have lobbyists stating their case or advocating their  case. Every night they spend on the street is a night this Congress  could have prevented. These are our most vulnerable veterans, in the  most vulnerable situations, and we owe it to them to keep our word to  send the VA the resources they need to help them.   For some homeless veterans, this is literally a matter of life or  death.   At the Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity legislative hearing on  this bill earlier this year, we heard directly from the VA about a  homeless veteran who was imminently considering taking his life by  suicide before the VA intervened and got him the help he needed using  the authorities this bill would reauthorize.   The VA's recent Suicide Prevention Report indicated that homeless  veterans are 186 percent more likely to die by suicide than any other  veteran. These Democratic-led provisions are suicide prevention tools.  They are lifesaving. In only 12 days from when the authorities in this  bill lapsed at the end of the public health emergency, between May 11,  2023, and May 23, 2023, the VA was forced to cancel over 42,000 rides  that supported over 18,000 veterans to attend 10,000 medical  appointments. Just 12 days caused that big of an impact. Here we are,  207 days later, and I can barely fathom how many homeless veterans went  without in that period.   If we are going to help homeless veterans, we need a hotline-ready  bill to send to the Senate. By hotline, we are talking about the Senate  hotline for House bills that have been passed and are ready to pass the  Senate because they have no flaws, no substantive flaws.   Why aren't we sending to the Senate hotline-ready bills from the  House of Representatives when we know the language that needs to be put  in those bills has all been agreed to by the four corners? Senators  Tester and Schumer both assured me last week that if we sent the Senate  both of the four-corners agreed-upon language for this bill and for the  Elizabeth Dole Home Care Act, they would get these bills onto the  Senate hotline so that they have a chance of getting to the President's  desk by Christmas.   As we enter the holiday season and a cold winter, we should take our  duty to help homeless veterans as seriously as possible. We must do all  we can to get these veterans housed and off the streets during the  coldest months of the year. We did have a choice here. We had a choice.   Instead, we have before us here a flawed bill that the Senate will  have to amend and send back to us. We can end veteran homelessness. It  is a choice that Congress can make to fully fund the resources and  authorities that the VA and its partners need to get veterans into  stable permanent housing.   We saw proof of this during the pandemic, one of the most difficult  times in our country's recent history, when we actually reduced veteran  homelessness by 11 percent. We know what works. We know that the  Democratic-led flexibilities and authorities included in the HOME Act  will reduce homelessness.   I must register my disagreement with what my colleague from Wisconsin  has claimed, that the grant and per diem rates were adequate. They were  never adequate. It was because of the flexibilities we included during  the health emergency that we were able to address the always inadequate  levels of funding. It is a falsehood to try to claim that it was about  inflation. No, these program per diem rates for the many, many  organizations out there that help our veterans across the country were  never adequate.    We had an opportunity to move forward a compromise today, but a  different choice was made. I am going to hope against hope that somehow  this bill does get to the President before the end of the year and that  we don't have it on our conscience that we made homeless veterans  suffer any more than they already have.   I will ask my colleagues to support H.R. 3848, as amended, today, and  I will also say a prayer that we see through to doing the right thing.   I would submit to my colleagues on the other side, after all, isn't  that why we are here, to do the right thing?   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I wish that we could be sending over to the Senate today a  hotline-ready bill.   We knew what we had to put into this bill. The majority knew what  corrections needed to be made. By tradition, subsequent to the vote  that we took today, we could have done those corrections and had a bill  that could have gone on the Senate hotline. Absent any Senator's  objection, it could have been sent to the President's desk for sure by  the Christmas holiday.   By some miracle something could happen. There could be a heating of  the conscience. There is a conscious choice being made today to not  send the Senate a bill that is substantively freed from the flaws that  we could have fixed.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I hope  against hope that we still can get this done by the end of the year.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my support for H.R. 542, as amended,  the Elizabeth Dole Home Care Act of 2023.   This bill, introduced by Representative Brownley and Representative  Bergman and reported out of committee with unanimous support in July,  is truly landmark legislation.   It would require VA to provide access to all home-and community-based  services, such as home health aides, home-based primary care, and  respite care to all veterans and caregivers who need them.   Currently, elderly and disabled veterans only have access to  important home- and community-based services if their VA medical  centers have chosen to offer these services.   This bill is named for a person, who in her personal life and in  public service, has dedicated herself to caring for others: Senator  Elizabeth Dole. Tomorrow will mark the second anniversary of the  passing of Senator Bob Dole, an Army veteran who had a dedicated  caregiver in the other Senator Dole.   This legislation will enable veterans to remain at home, safely age  in place, and avoid or delay admission to nursing homes and other  costly institutional settings of care. It will also help connect  veterans' caregivers to respite care and other supportive services that  help them care for veterans at home and improve VA's coordination with  other Federal long-term care programs that promote aging at home.   Finally, the Elizabeth Dole Home Care Act of 2023 will require VA to  create a website where veterans and their families can more easily  obtain information about VA's home- and community-based services  programs and assess whether any of these programs may be right for  them. The research is clear: veterans prefer to remain at home and  their health outcomes are better when they do. Home care is by far the  cheaper alternative to institutional settings.   Nearly every veteran will at some point face the need for additional  care at home, or if they can't get it, spend their last years in a  nursing home setting. This legislation is an investment in care for  millions of veterans and current servicemembers who need this help now  or in the future.   The Elizabeth Dole Home Care Act of 2023 has the support of every  major veteran service organization, including Paralyzed Veterans of  America, Disabled American Veterans, Veterans of Foreign Wars, the  American Legion, the Wounded Warrior Project, and the Military Officers  Association of America.   It is also supported by AARP, the National Association of Counties,  the National PACE Association, and the Elizabeth Dole Foundation.   It has been these groups' number one policy priority. Shouldn't it be  ours?   These groups, and dozens of others, have advocated tirelessly for  passage since its introduction 2 years ago.   Despite the great need for this bill, it has been an uphill battle to  get it to the floor. We have worked to get support and get the cost  down. That showed when it was voted unanimously out of committee in  July.   It seems the battle is not over yet because this bill cannot be taken  up by the Senate as is. Since the bill was reported, we have worked  with our counterparts in the Senate to ensure the bill was as near to  perfect as possible. There were a few changes that were agreed upon by  all four corners of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.                                time  1645    Unfortunately, instead of advancing text with full sign-off, the  majority has gone back to text they know has problems in the Senate, so  we will have to either await amendment by the Senate or some other  legislative action before this legislation can move to President  Biden's desk for signature.   The programs and services in this bill are life-changing. In the next  16 years, VA will have doubled its spending on long-term care services,  nearing $15 billion, to meet these needs. While enrolled veterans have  a right to institutional care, there are not enough beds or staff in  institutional settings in the country to meet the projected need.   Good sense tells us that VA must move quickly to expand home- and  community-based services to keep veterans safely in their homes.  Providing home- and community-based services would also ensure that VA  has the space and staff to care for those who truly do need  institutional care.   It is disappointing that we have not gotten this bill on the fast  track to signing and that disabled and elderly veterans and their  caregivers will have to wait even longer for the care they deserve.  This holiday season, we could have given these veterans a gift with  lasting impact. The House majority instead tells us we must content  ourselves to wait for the Elizabeth Dole Home Care Act to be included  in a larger package.   The majority has committed to moving this legislative package out of  the House and the Senate with delivery to the President by the end of  January. I remind everyone that there are some other big items that we  have to get done in January, and I am worried about whether or not that  other big item might impede our ability to get this item done.  [[Page H6102]]    The intention is that the Elizabeth Dole Home Care Act and the HOME  Act be included as key pillars of the package.   The majority has also committed in the last week to not abuse these  bipartisan bills as leverage to include partisan poison pills in that  package. I intend to hold my Republican colleagues to that agreement,  and the stakeholders and the VSOs will, as well.   This agreement includes the fallback that if this package cannot be  completed in time, then these bills should be advanced as standalone.  We received a letter on Friday from a broad coalition of national  organizations representing service-disabled veterans and their  caregivers memorializing this agreement that said it best: ``Disabled  veterans and their families cannot wait any longer.''   It was the same exact letter that was already included in the Record  by my colleague from Michigan, so I don't have to include it again now.   Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 542, as amended, and I ask my colleagues  to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman  from the great State of California (Ms. Brownley), who is the ranking  member of the Subcommittee on Health and the author of this amazing  piece of legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I am prepared to  close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in  support of this very important, transformational piece of legislation,  H.R. 542, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3581, as amended, the  Caregiver Outreach and Program Enhancement Act, or COPE Act.   This legislation, as amended, incorporates three Republican-sponsored  bills, which were marked up at the subcommittee and full committee  level over the summer.   First, H.R. 3581 would create a 3-year, $50 million per year grant  program to award grants to entities that will provide mental health  counseling, treatment, or support to caregivers participating in VA's  family caregiver program.   The VA would also be required to provide outreach to caregivers to  inform them of available mental health support offered by grantees. The  legislation also requires the Government Accountability Office to  conduct a study to assess the availability and accessibility of mental  health support for veterans' caregivers.   Additionally, H.R. 3581, as amended, will authorize VA to contribute  to local authorities to mitigate the risk of flooding on local property  adjacent to VA medical facilities. It would also authorize up to $125  million over 5 years for VA to carry out flood mitigation improvements.   Currently, the statute only allows VA to contribute to local  authorities for improvements needed for safe ingress or egress;  however, veterans' access to healthcare is frequently disrupted in  areas that experience frequent flooding, and VA's ability to partner  with local authorities on flood mitigation projects has been limited.   This legislation would also require VA to submit to Congress a report  assessing the extent to which each of its medical facilities is at risk  of flooding, including flooding associated with rising sea levels.   Finally, H.R. 3581, as amended, will establish a 5-year survey  program to examine security and criminal activity at VA facilities,  staffing of VA's police departments, and the availability and adequacy  of VA police equipment and training.    After surveying all facilities, VA will be required to submit annual  reports to Congress summarizing the survey results and providing action  plans for addressing any identified weaknesses.   While I support the policy ideas in H.R. 3581, as amended, I know our  colleagues in the Senate would like to make some changes to this  legislation before it can be enacted. Just last Friday, House committee  staff met with their Senate counterparts to discuss changes to the VA  security reporting provisions.   Senate staff also have proposed broadening the report on VA medical  facility flooding risks such that VA would be required to assess all of  its mission-critical assets, including medical facilities, cemeteries,  and regional offices, and their vulnerabilities to flooding, wildfire,  tornadoes, hurricanes, and other disasters.   Therefore, similar to the other veterans bills we are considering on  the floor today, we already know this legislation simply cannot be  taken up and passed in the Senate, and future House action will be  needed.   It would have been preferable if the majority had resolved these  differences before bringing this bill to the floor. Nevertheless, I  will support H.R. 3581, as amended, and encourage my colleagues to join  me in passing it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, I ask all my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 3581, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.
