 HORN of Oklahoma asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)    HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of the continued effort by the U.S. Trade Representative and the  Democratic working group to finalize the United States-Mexico-Canada  Agreement, the USMCA.   Oklahoma workers, families, businesses, and our Nation benefit from  free and fair international trade. Every day, Oklahomans create and  export world-class products, and two of our largest trading partners  are our neighbors to the north and the south.   In 2018 alone, Oklahoma exported a total of $5.6 billion in  manufactured goods. Nearly half of those went to Mexico and Canada. In  the same year, Oklahoma agriculture exports to Mexico and Canada  totaled $154 million.   A stronger trading relationship with Mexico and Canada means a  stronger economy for Oklahoma. It is imperative that Congress finish  negotiating and pass a strong trade agreement to restore certainty in  our trading relationship with Canada and Mexico and support millions of  American jobs in the process.   Though finding common ground is not easy, it is critical, and I  support the USTR and lawmakers' work to find a bipartisan path forward  for this important trade agreement.                            ____________________
