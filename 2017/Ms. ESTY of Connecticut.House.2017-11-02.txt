 Mr. Speaker, for weeks we have heard that  the partisan tax plan crafted behind closed doors might include the  elimination of the deduction for families' State and local income  taxes. Today the rumors became reality. The tax plan announced today  would drastically reduce the State and local tax deduction.   Let me be as clear as I can be. This proposal is a tax increase on  middle class families, and I oppose it. Working people in my State  already send more dollars to the Federal Government in taxes than they  receive back in support. For every dollar we send to Washington from  Connecticut, we receive back just 83 cents. By attacking the State and  local deduction, this tax plan would make life even harder for real  people in my district.   A senior citizen in Simsbury, Connecticut, called me to say that she  might lose her home if this tax deduction is taken away from her.  Seniors who live on a fixed income shouldn't have to risk losing a roof  over their head just so that Congress can cut the corporate tax rate.   Families who are already struggling to pay their bills, put their  kids through college, and buy their first home shouldn't have to suffer  in order to cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans.   The President promised that tax reform would help our middle class  and would bring jobs back. It is doing neither.   I urge my colleagues to support keeping the State and local  deduction.                            ____________________
