 Mr. President, I call up my motion to instruct  conferees, which is at the desk.    Mr. President, this motion to instruct emphasizes that  climate change cannot be used as a basis for the President to declare  an emergency or a major disaster or any other means to expand executive  powers.   In the last 2 weeks, Progressives in Congress have renewed their push  for the President to claim powers he doesn't have and make it harder to  produce energy domestically and export it abroad. This is bad policy,  and it sets a bad precedent to encourage expansive executive authority.   Now, of course, I think we should address climate change, but ceding  broad authority over to the Executive is not the way to go. I have  worked together with my colleagues on numerous pieces of meaningful  climate legislation and continue to do so as the ranking member of the  Environment and Public Works Committee.   When Congress wants to address climate, as we have in the past, it  rolls up its sleeves and does so in a thoughtful, bipartisan manner,  with clear, detailed direction to the Executive, not by giving the  Executive broad authority to do whatever it sees fit.  [[Page S2324]]    I encourage a positive vote on my motion to instruct.
