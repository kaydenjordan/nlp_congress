 I thank the distinguished chair of the Budget Committee  for giving me some time to talk today. She is a distinguished person, a  colleague, a classmate, and somebody I have the utmost respect for.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the House budget resolution and to  recognize the very important first step we are taking in our country  today regarding ObamaCare. By adopting this budget resolution, we will  set into motion the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.   Last week, on this very floor, the minority leader, Ms. Pelosi, stood  here and called ObamaCare a magnificent success. Yet, since being sworn  into office in 2011, I have heard just the opposite from my  constituents. Every single day, I have heard that ObamaCare is raising  the cost of health care, is creating uncertainty in Arkansas, is  hurting Americans, and that we need to replace it with real reforms  that focus on the patient, not the government.   This law is not just bad for patients and healthcare consumers.  ObamaCare's onerous mandates and endless regulations are hitting  industry across the board. It stifles business; it squelches private  sector job growth; it hurts our economy. Let me give you an example.   Mr. Chairman, Superior Linen Service, in my district, employs over  100 people. Prior to the enactment of ObamaCare, Superior Linen Service  recognized the importance of having a healthy workforce and was already  providing quality health insurance to its employees, and it was able to  manage its payroll insurance benefits in-house for the entire 60 years  of its existence. After the passage of the Affordable Care Act,  Superior Linen Service could no longer manage the sheer amount of  paperwork it took to prove that it was, in fact, complying with the  law.   Let me be clear. Thanks to ObamaCare, the company provided no new  benefits, but had to outsource its payroll and management at a cost of  $100,000 a year. This is just one of many examples. This is an  important day. I urge a ``yes'' vote on the resolution.                                time  1145
