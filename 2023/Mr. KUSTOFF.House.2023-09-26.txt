 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor, remember, and celebrate  the life of a dear friend and mentor, Donald Kenneth Sundquist, known  to all of us as Don. Don passed away this year on August 27.   Over his long and successful career, Don Sundquist served as a  business leader, a Member of Congress from his election in 1982 and  serving for six consecutive terms, and as Governor of the State of  Tennessee from 1995 until 2003.   In public office and out of public office, Don cared greatly and  profoundly about the people of Tennessee and worked tirelessly for  their betterment.   Don Sundquist was born in Illinois and earned his bachelor's degree  from Augustana College in 1957. Following his graduation, Don served  for 2 years in the United States Navy.   After an extensive business career, Don was elected to this very body  in 1982 from the Seventh Congressional District of Tennessee.   Don was known as what was then called a ``Reagan Republican,'' and  made himself known as a fiscal conservative. In the House of  Representatives, Don served on the House Ways and Means Committee. That  is the same committee I serve on. I walk into that grand committee room  almost every day and think about Don and his many accomplishments.   In 1994, Don was elected as the 47th Governor of the State of  Tennessee, he  [[Page H4468]]  was then elected to serve a second term in 1998 by a record margin.   During his tenure as Governor, Don Sundquist ushered in new  businesses and companies to the State of Tennessee. His Families First  welfare program significantly reduced the number of families on  welfare, and he insured that Tennessee became the first State to  connect all of its public schools and libraries to the internet.   Don Sundquist's life can be summed up in one word: service.   He dedicated his life to the betterment of the Volunteer State, and  he taught us all many lessons along the way. If you walk the streets of  Memphis, Nashville, and other cities throughout Tennessee, and  Washington D.C., you will meet a lot of people who owe their careers  and their livelihoods to Don Sundquist.   Indeed, Don Sundquist was a person of honor and integrity.   On a personal note, I will tell you that Don was not only a mentor to  me, but to so many others in Tennessee and across the Nation. He has a  true legacy that will continue to live on in those in and out of public  service.   Don Sundquist was a good friend to both my wife, Roberta, and to me.  He will be deeply missed. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife,  Martha, the former First Lady of Tennessee, and their children, Tania,  Andrea, and Deke.   Mr. Speaker, I know that each of you and all of us will keep his  memory and legacy alive.   Thank you to Don for a lifetime of service not only to Tennessee but  to the entire Nation. You had a remarkable career and a remarkable  life.                            ____________________
