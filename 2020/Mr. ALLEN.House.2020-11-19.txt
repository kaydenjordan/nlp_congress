 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R.  8294. I, too, come from the construction industry, which I learned from  the ground up, and I know firsthand how apprenticeships provide our  workforce with a unique opportunity to gain valuable skills that are  needed to secure a good-paying job and a long-lasting career.   The reason apprenticeships are so successful is because employers  know exactly what skills are in demand. That is why we must encourage  more employer-led innovation in the apprenticeship space.   This legislation denies workers and employers autonomy to create  programs that are responsive to workforce needs. This shortsighted bill  would undo the Department of Labor's industry-recognized apprenticeship  programs created under President Trump. This program provides companies  an alternative avenue to train skilled workers and develop  apprenticeship programs for their specific industry needs.   This year has already been tough on our employers with COVID-19,  devastating businesses across the country, and the last thing we need  is to impose more bureaucratic red tape and requirements.   I am disappointed that my Democrat colleagues are pushing a plan that  would put these job-filling programs in jeopardy and prevent more  workers from accessing these opportunities.   I believe that this is a space for bipartisanship, and I urge my  colleagues to oppose this flawed approach and work with us to encourage  innovation and flexibility.
