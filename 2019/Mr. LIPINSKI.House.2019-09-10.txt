 Mr. Speaker, as we return this week, we must confront  our Nation's sickening gun violence. My commitment to act is even  stronger after my own terrifying experience.   My wife Judy and I were at the Gilroy Garlic Festival when a shooter  opened fire. We heard the pops, then screams, and we turned and ran for  our lives. Three people were killed, but it could have been much worse  if not for law enforcement's quick action. It almost seems like a bad  dream, but it was real. Just as the threat of gun violence in our  Nation is all too real.   This violence has social and spiritual roots, but there are  commonsense laws we can enact to stem gun violence. I have had many  people beg me for Congress to act, including proud gun owners who  understand that we can pass gun safety laws while also upholding the  Second Amendment.   This week the Senate should start by passing the comprehensive  background check bill that we passed in the House earlier this year.  Doing nothing is not an option. Congress must act.                            ____________________
