 Mr. President, I rise to discuss Zambia's upcoming  elections and the erosion of democracy under President Edgar Lungu. On  August 12, the people of Zambia will go to the polls to elect their  President and members of the National Assembly. They will do so under  the cloud of growing authoritarianism, with troops in the streets,  protesters in prison, and dissenting voices muzzled by censorship.  Indeed, many Zambians have good reason to be dissatisfied with their  present government and, in a free and fair vote, might very well reject  President Lungu's bid for reelection. But I fear they may not have that  opportunity.   For nearly 30 years, Zambians have enjoyed a relatively free and open  political environment. In 1991, Zambia's founding father Kenneth Kaunda  lost the country's first multiparty election in decades and gracefully  stepped aside after 27 years in power. President Kaunda died in June of  this year, at the age of 97, with a complicated legacy; he was a  liberator, but also held an iron grip on power for nearly three  decades. However, his final act of public service paved the way for  democracy to take root in his country in the years that followed.  Sadly, President Lungu is erasing that monumental contribution to the  Zambian people.   Since President Lungu's rise to power in 2014, he has used the organs  of the state to intimidate his political opponents and consolidate  power for his Patriotic Front--PF--party. Freedom House rates Zambia as  only ``partly free,'' citing laws and government actions which have had  the effect of restricting the activities of opposition parties,  limiting civil society participation, and curbing free expression.  Similarly, the U.S. Department of State, in its 2020 Country Reports on  Human Rights Practices, noted ``significant human rights issues'' in  Zambia, particularly in the area of elections and political  participation.    In March, the Zambian political analyst Dr. Sishuwa Sishuwa  published an essay in which he warned that ``Zambia may burn after the  August elections.'' He wrote that the public's distrust of Zambia's  institutions and the ruthless competition between its political elites  had contributed to a climate of fear and anger that could plunge the  country into chaos. The subversion of the independence of the courts  and other public institutions has led to a lack of confidence. Credible  allegations of corruption and impunity have been made against leaders.  A collapsing economy, mismanaged by President Lungu to the point of  defaulting on its foreign loans, has resulted in mass youth  unemployment and rising inequality. Dr. Sishuwa also noted Western  countries' declining assistance to Zambia and their silence on its  democratic backsliding. He painted a vivid image of a once-peaceful and  prosperous country on the brink of calamity. According to the Committee  to Protect Journalists, Zambian police began investigating Dr. Sishuwa  for sedition shortly after the essay's publication.   Indeed, political violence has already arrived on the streets of  Zambia. Fighting between supporters of the PF and the opposition United  Party for National Development--UPND--left at least two people dead  last week. Troops have been mobilized to restore order, but Zambian  security forces have also been accused of using deadly force against  peaceful protesters.   The United States has a clear interest in ensuring that Zambia  remains a free and stable country. We have provided approximately $500  million in assistance to Zambiaa every year. At a time of increasing  instability in Southern Africa, with unrest in South Africa and  Eswatini, crackdowns in Zimbabwe, a brutal insurgency in Mozambique,  and the rampant spread of COVID-19, the region cannot afford Zambia's  collapse. We know that instability anywhere has a rippling effect that  impacts U.S. interests and our allies.   Moreover, Zambia presents a test for the Biden administration's  commitment to promoting and protecting democracy abroad. I encourage  the administration to more address Zambia's democratic backsliding. I  hope that is corrected before elections commence. We should be clear  with President Lungu that the United States does not tolerate  authoritarianism and that the generosity of the American people is not  without limits. The United States should increase support for Zambian  civil-society and democracy and governance programming in Zambia.  Finally, the Biden administration can demonstrate its commitment to the  bilateral relationship by nominating a skilled and experienced diplomat  to serve as ambassador to Zambia.   While the United States stands with the Zambian people, ultimately,  responsibility for Zambia's democratic decline lies squarely with  President Lungu and his government. In the short term, President Lungu  must commit to holding free and fair elections on August 12 and ensure  transparency in the process by permitting election monitors to observe  the vote without restrictions. He must also publicly commit to accept  the outcome of the election, and step aside should he lose. Regardless  of the outcome, the PF, UPND, and all other parties must work together  to restore the integrity and independence of public institutions, end  impunity for state violence, and address corruption. They must do this  by partnering with civil society, restoring freedom of the press, and  respecting civil liberties. They must accept that dissent and protest  are not a threat to their power, but rather proof of a healthy polity.   This will be a long and difficult process which will test the courage  and patriotism of Zambia's elites. Next week's elections may be the  first step towards Zambia's renewal or else the next step towards its  ruin. Perhaps President Lung can take inspiration from Kenneth Kendal's  final act of leadership and put his country before his own political  interests.                            ____________________
