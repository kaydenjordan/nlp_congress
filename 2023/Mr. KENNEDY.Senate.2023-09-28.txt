 Mr. President, I am back again to try to keep the  National Flood Insurance Program from expiring.   I will be the first to concede that America needs a national flood  insurance program that looks like we designed it on purpose. What we  have now does not look like that. To call it imperfect is an  understatement. But the only thing worse than having what we have right  now is to not have a national flood insurance program at all.   The fact of the matter is, for all practical purposes, people who are  at risk for flooding cannot buy flood insurance from the private  markets, which means they can't buy a home, which means their mortgages  would be foreclosed upon. That is why we have a National Flood  Insurance Program.   Should we improve it? Yes. I have been trying for 7 years. We need to  keep trying. But we are not going to get it done over the next couple  of days.   I believe government is going to shut down tomorrow--or at least  Saturday, rather. I hope not, but I believe it is. And if it does, the  National Flood Insurance Program will be shut down.   I don't want to scare people half to death. It doesn't mean that FEMA  will stop--which runs the NFIP--will stop paying claims, but it will  stop commerce, if nothing else, because FEMA can't issue new policies.  And, again, I realize it is not perfect. But we are in hurricane  season.   Let me say that again. We are in hurricane season.   Is this important to my State? You bet. But it is not just important  to my State; it is important to every single coastal State. And that is  why I would like to see us extend this program for a very, very short  period of time.   My bill is a clean extension. It doesn't make any changes to the  program. I wish I had the authority to make changes, but I don't. This  bill will just extend what we have now, imperfect as it may be--and  Lord knows it is imperfect--through December 31, 2023. That will give  us some additional time to design a program that looks like somebody  designed it on purpose.   Mr. President, for that reason, I ask unanimous consent--did I  mention, Mr. President, that my State is in the middle of hurricane  season?   Let me say that again--and so is every coastal State. And we are  going to shut down the National Flood Insurance Program in the middle  of hurricane season, the U.S. Senate? What planet did we just parachute  in from?   For that reason, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of my bill, S. 2968,  which is at the desk; I further ask that the bill be considered read a  third time and passed--and passed--and that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Reserving the right to object, Mr. President. Maybe the  homes that my good friend Senator Paul is describing are homes in  Kentucky, but they are not homes in Louisiana. The homes in Louisiana  that need flood insurance are not mansions. These are homes of working  people. These are modest homes being paid for by people who get up  every day, go to work, obey the law, pay their taxes, and try to do the  right thing by their kids.   I don't know about the millionaires that Senator Paul is talking  about. Again, maybe they are in Kentucky. But they are not in  Louisiana. My coast is a working coast.   Point 2: What Senator Paul proposes is to limit flood insurance to  $250,000.   The median sales price of a home in America today is $430,300. Now,  there are a lot of reasons for that. One of the reasons for that is  President Biden's inflation. But those are the facts. In Louisville,  KY, the median sales price is $271,000. In Dallas, TX, it is $389,000.  In Miami, it is $605,000.   Why do you want to fool the American people? Why do you want to  ``reform'' a flood insurance program that is going to deny flood  insurance?   Do some people own second homes? Yes. I thought Republicans weren't  supposed to penalize success in America. I thought our position was  that if you worked hard and accumulated wealth, first, you should get  to keep most of it. Why? Because you earned it. And second, we should  applaud success in America. If you earn enough to buy a second home, we  shouldn't discourage that. The third reason I cannot agree to my friend  Senator Paul's suggestion is because he knows as well as I do that many  of us have worked together to try to reform the Flood Insurance  Program. We haven't reached consensus yet. We are going to keep  working. But if I agree to Senator Paul's suggestion today, both he and  I will be selling out our colleagues who would not agree to these  changes, and they are not here right now.   The easy thing for me to do is to accept the Senator's proposal, but  I don't play that way. I am not going to do it without giving every  Member of this Senate who would like input into Senator Paul's  suggestions the chance to object as well. I don't play that way.   For that reason, I object.    Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague Senator Paul  and his comments. I, like him, would like to continue to work with our  colleagues to reform this program. But when reality calls, you  shouldn't hang up, and that is what we have done here today, because  this government is going to shut down. I hope I am wrong--God, I hope I  am wrong--but I think this government is going to shut down midnight  Sunday night, and the National Flood Insurance Program is going to shut  down with it, right smack dab in the middle of hurricane season.   I thought the first role of government--I thought this is what  Republicans believe; I thought this is what Libertarians believe--the  first role of government is to protect people and property. And all the  U.S. Senate has done today is expose ordinary Americans--not  millionaires; ordinary Americans--who live in modest homes, who get up  every day--I am going to say it again--and go to work and obey the law  and pay their taxes and try to do the right thing by their kids and  whose home is their biggest asset. We are going to tell them: It is OK.  Even though you can't buy the flood insurance from a private provider,  the government is going to stop you from buying it from the National  Flood Insurance Program right in the middle of hurricane season.   That is not what this country is all about.   All my bill would have done--and I will be back. Just like the  Terminator, I will be back. All my bill would do would be to take the  current program--the current program, I will concede--I agree with  Senator Paul--the current program looks like somebody knocked over a  urine sample. It is that bad. But we need to work to improve it. But in  the meantime, we do not need to allow it to expire.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
