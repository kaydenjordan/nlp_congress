 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  4374 because our Nation's servicemembers deserve the best and safest  medical treatments available, especially when they are in harm's way.   This bill fixes a provision in the FY 2018 NDAA which passed the  House overwhelmingly just yesterday, which would have allowed the  Secretary of Defense to approve the emergency use of medications that  have not yet received FDA approval.   Under today's legislation, we ensure the FDA will review any  emergency DOD request for the use of unapproved medical products on an  expedited basis while maintaining the FDA's critical role of evaluating  the safety and effectiveness of treatments. This new authorization will  include situations when the Secretary of Defense determines the risk of  attack with an agent that may cause an imminently life-threatening and  specific risk to the United States' military forces.   As a physician and a veteran myself and the chairman of the House  Veterans' Affairs Committee, I have worked tirelessly to ensure our  Nation's servicemembers have access to the best, safest, and most  effective medical treatments available while they are in service and  after.   While we all want these breakthrough treatments made available to our  Nation's men and women in service as quickly as possible, we need to  make sure that they are safe and effective before subjecting members of  our Armed Forces to unproven treatments in the interest of expedience.   I have personally spoken to the FDA Commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb  on this issue, and he assures me that the FDA will work in a  collaborative way with DOD to ensure the processes work more  effectively for our troops.
