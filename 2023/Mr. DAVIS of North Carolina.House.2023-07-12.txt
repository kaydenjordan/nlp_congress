 Mr. Speaker, I rise to highlight  Precision Graphics, a family-owned electronics manufacturing and  fulfillment facility in Snow Hill, North Carolina, my hometown.   It fills me with tremendous pride to witness our local business'  growth and positive impact.   Precision Graphics, located just a block from my grandmother's home  where I was raised, holds the resilience and strength of our community.  While they have encountered supply chain challenges, the outlook is  improving.   It is of utmost importance that we continue to support businesses  like Precision Graphics and our STEM programs. We must restore hope and  help young people across eastern North Carolina, rural America, and our  country to live the American Dream.   Let's come together and work toward empowering our local businesses,  fostering job creation, and contributing to the prosperity of our  Nation.                            ____________________
