 Mr. President, I agree with my colleague from Alabama,  Senator Jones. Senator Jones and I haven't been here as long as some of  our other colleagues have been, but I think it is probably fair to say  that when Senator Jones and I have a colleague who is departing or if  the Presiding Officer has a colleague who is departing, there will be  one day of farewell. Maybe there will be an hour's window in which we  can come to the floor to say thank you or there will be a reception in  the Mansfield Room. I think it is fair to say, as has my colleague  Senator Jones, that I have been in line for a long time to get to this  day to say thank you to Johnny Isakson.   These tributes started when Senator Isakson first announced he would  be retiring from the Senate. It is very fitting that they continue  through this day because of the work he has pursued and because of his  accomplishments but also because of the humanity that rests in his  heart. All of us are better off because of his work.   In my knowing him, I hope that a little bit of Johnny Isakson rubs  off on all of us and that we can be here today, knowing that we are a  better institution, better leaders, and better public servants because  of his model.   Senator Isakson has done a lot of things that have been discussed on  the Senate floor. I don't know how much I can add, but I am going to  add a few things to the kind words that have been said. So many people  have said such great things.   The first time Senator Isakson and I had an opportunity to really  work together was on something that will benefit generations of  Coloradans. It was the VA hospital in Colorado--something that may have  shaved off some of the patience Senator Isakson has, which seems to be  unending at times. This one, though, I am sure, took a little bit of a  toll--the frustration with a very crazy collapse of a VA facility that  had taken over a decade and--gosh--hundreds of millions of dollars to  complete. It was a project that started out in the nineties but that  didn't get done until about a year ago or so. It was a project that had  started out at $300 million but that had ended up being over $2  billion.   Through it all, Senator Isakson was mindful of a very simple purpose,  which was that this facility was to benefit the veterans who had given  so much to this country. The first thing Senator Isakson said to me  was: Don't worry. We are going to get this done, and we are going to  make reforms so that this never happens again.   Under Senator Isakson's leadership, we have seen changes at the VA,  and we have also seen changes about how new facilities are going to be  completed and built so that we can avoid the kinds of mistakes that led  to the delays in Colorado.   Ultimately, Senator Isakson knew that this would be the crown jewel  in the Rocky Mountain region for veterans' service and veterans' care,  and that is exactly what it continues to be. We have Senator Isakson to  thank for the completion of that and the time on task it took to get  the job done.   Senator Isakson held a field hearing in Aurora, CO, with, I think at  the time, Deputy Secretary Sloan Gibson to find out what had happened,  why the delays occurred, and then to fix it and to hold the people  accountable who were responsible for the delays. That is the kind of  leadership Senator Isakson provided.   Throughout that process, I think I threatened to rename the  colonoscopy unit after a couple of people, but for Senator Isakson, we  should name the town after him for the work he did to complete that  facility.   I remember the first time I gave him a little bit of a treat from  Colorado in order to thank him for his work. It was a box of Enstrom  Toffee from a family company in western Colorado. It was a pretty  incredible treat. I gave it to him and thought he had never had this  before.   He looked at it, and he said: Oh, Enstrom Toffee. I love this stuff.  I used to give this out to my clients when I was in real estate.  [[Page S6980]]    So I couldn't even surprise him with what I thought was a very  special Colorado treat.   Johnny is the kind of person who has the ability to cut through  problems, to cut through the smoke, to cut through the haze and the fog  of a challenge and go right to the merits of it, to very concisely riff  on any issue at a moment's notice, cut to the heart of a problem, and  provide a solution to that problem and to that challenge.   As the old saying goes, you are known by the company you keep. When  one looks around this Chamber, one sees the people who came to pay  their thanks to Senator Isakson. It is pretty good company. He has done  such great things for Georgia and for this country. I can't thank  Senator Isakson enough for his leadership, for helping us all out in  Colorado, and for making this country a better place.   Senator Isakson, thank you for all that you have done.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I rise to recognize a great  Coloradan, Bobi Garrett who, after 21 years, is retiring from the  National Renewable Energy Laboratory--NREL--in Golden, Colorado.   NREL is a crown jewel of research and development in the energy  field, where its employees show up to work each day dedicated to  finding solutions to the problems that we currently face not just in  Colorado, but the United States and the world as well. Bobi has been  with NREL since 1998, starting as the associate director for strategic  development and analysis and is currently the deputy laboratory  director of strategic programs and partnership, as well as chief  operations officer--COO--of the facility. Bobi's work is vital to the  performance and effectiveness of NREL, and her extensive expertise in  the energy field has been instrumental in the laboratory's success.   Bobi started her career in energy and engineering when she graduated  from Montana State University in 1976 with a degree in chemical  engineering. She was just one of seven women in her engineering class.  In addition to her NREL service, Bobi serves as an ambassador for Clean  Energy Education and Empowerment, a program that helps women with  careers in energy, and currently as a board member of CO-LABS, an  organization dedicated to increasing Colorado's global standing in  research and technology.   Bobi has worked tirelessly in her career to ensure that the future is  brighter for generations to come. Her dedication to this effort earned  her a spot in Denver Business Journal's ``Top Women in Energy'' in  2015, a well-deserved honor. We are proud to have Bobi in the great  State of Colorado, and we look forward to her future efforts to make  the world a better place.                            ____________________
