 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   (The remarks of Mr. Kennedy pertaining to the introduction of S. 1150  are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills  and Joint Resolutions.'')    Mr. President, if I came to you today and told you we  had received a job application from somebody to work for the  government, and you and I looked at her job application and we saw she  had graduated from Harvard Law School, if we looked at her job  application and we saw she had worked for a Presidential campaign, if  we saw she had practiced law in the private sector, if we noticed from  her resume that she had actually worked as a counsel, as a lawyer, in  the White House, if we saw she had clerked for a Supreme Court Justice,  Justice Anthony Kennedy--each Justice of the United States, I think,  has four law clerks every year. I don't know how many tens of thousands  of lawyers and law students apply, but to be chosen is one of the  highest honors you can receive as a young lawyer. If I told you this  person who applied for a job in government used to work at the  Department of Justice as Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General in  the Office of Legal Policy, if I told you she had also worked for one  of the most prestigious law firms in the country, Wilmer, Cutler,  Pickering, Hale & Dorr--I remember them as Wilmer, Cutler, but they  have changed their name since then. They have been around forever. If I  told you all of those things, I think any reasonable person would say:  Wow, let's hire her here immediately. Let's do it before she finds  another position. Well, that person has applied for a job in  government. Her name is Rachel Brand. She has been nominated by  President Trump to be Associate Attorney General.   That is a position that is vitally important within the Department of  Justice. It is responsible for the oversight of the Civil Division, the  Civil Rights Division, the Office on Violence Against Women, and many  other important components of the Department of Justice. I think no  matter what political party you happen to be in or whatever your  political persuasion, we can all agree that right now it is  particularly important not only to have a Department of Justice that is  fully staffed but to have it fully staffed with extraordinarily  qualified people whom every American can look at and go: Wow, is she  qualified. I am so pleased she is working for the Federal Government  and my tax dollars are being well spent.   Ms. Brand has broad experience, as I indicated, both within the  Department of Justice and in the private sector. As I indicated--I am  going to say it again--she worked for Justice Anthony Kennedy of the  U.S. Supreme Court. Wow, what an honor. She has served as Assistant  Attorney General under President George Bush. She has been in private  practice, as I indicated. She has been chief counsel for Regulatory  Litigation in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and I could go on and on  and on.   I fully support Ms. Brand's nomination. I sit on the Judiciary  Committee, the committee of the Senate that vetted her. She is highly  respected, she is whip smart, she is well qualified, and she is fully  prepared to hit the ground running. That is exactly what we need.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I would like to talk today about the need  for a work requirement in our Medicaid Program. In 1969, President  Lyndon Johnson addressed the American people, and he talked about  breaking the cycle of poverty. This is what President Johnson said:         I believe . . . that the key to success in this effort is       jobs. It is work for people who want to work.    President Johnson, as we know, was a Democrat. He fervently believed  that the people of Louisiana didn't want handouts. Most people want a  chance to support themselves. President Johnson also believed that  Medicaid, as originally envisioned, would be a safety net for the  disabled, the elderly, and people with small children. Medicaid is not  exactly that; it is dramatically different.   Whether you agree or disagree with what has happened to Medicaid, the  fact is that it has turned into a health insurance program for about 20  percent of all Americans. Think about that. We have roughly 320 million  people in our country, and fully 25 percent are on Medicaid. It gets  bigger and bigger every year, and it gets more expensive every year.  You can see that the numbers speak for themselves. You can see the  trend. You can certainly see that we started in 1966, and you can  particularly see the trend beginning in 1996 and its trajectory.   It also became more expensive. The cost of our Medicaid Program in  1966 was $1 billion. That is a lot of money. This is the cost of last  year: $576 billion and climbing.   Let me talk about our State alone. In Louisiana, the cost of Medicaid  has increased from $5.9 billion in 2008 to $10.7 billion today, and 65  percent of all of the babies born in Louisiana every year now are born  on Medicaid. Think about that.  [[Page S3013]]    We know that Medicaid is a Federal-State program. The Federal  Government puts up some of the money; the State puts up some of the  money, as well. In Louisiana, we put up about one-third of the money.  In Louisiana dollars, in 2008, we were putting up $1.7 billion in State  money. It is called the match for the Medicaid Program. Today, the  State of Louisiana is paying $3.3 billion. You can do the math. That is  about a 10 percent increase every year.   If we are spending $3.3 billion of State money, that means every  year, just like clockwork, we have to come up with an extra $330  million. I can tell you where that money comes from. It comes out of  public schools, it comes out of universities, it comes out of our  budget for roads, and it comes out of our budget for public safety.   We have a choice in America. Either Medicaid is going to be, as we  originally envisioned it, a safety net for the old, the disabled, and  mothers with babies or it is going to be a health insurance program for  the masses.   If the American people and Congress decide that Medicaid is going to  be a health insurance program for the general population, then it needs  to operate as health insurance does in the private sector. In other  words, able-bodied adult enrollees in Medicaid should be required to  work in order to receive their benefits, if they are able.   I am filing a bill that is going to be entitled the ``Medicaid Reform  and Personal Responsibility Act of 2017.'' It is going to create a work  requirement for Medicaid. My reason is simple. I want Americans to  prosper. I don't want our people to remain mired in poverty. I want to  break poverty's back by creating a system that doesn't force the  American people to subsist on handouts from government, and the best  way to do that is to provide an incentive for able-bodied Americans to  know the dignity of work because a person without a job is neither  happy, nor is he free.   I think my bill is a commonsense approach to reducing America's  reliance on entitlement programs. The work requirement will be very  simple. It will be similar to the program that we have in place--the  work requirement we have in place right now for food stamps.   This is what my bill would require: If you are on Medicaid or want to  receive Medicaid, and you are an adult between the ages of 18 and 55,  and you are able-bodied, you are not disabled, and you don't have any  dependents, you don't have any children--so if you are 18 to 55, you  are not disabled, and you don't have any children, then in order to  receive Medicaid or to continue to receive Medicaid, you have to either  work 20 hours a week--not 40 hours a week but 20 hours a week--you have  to look for a job or you have to go back to school if you don't want to  work. Or if you don't want to go back to school or you don't want to  look for a job or you don't want to get a job, you have to perform  community service for 20 hours a week. My goal is to get people off  Medicaid and into the workforce, so they can support themselves and not  need Medicaid.   I don't want to take Medicaid away from people in need. I do want  fewer people to need Medicaid. So if you are disabled, if you are  pregnant, if you are elderly, if you are caring for a child, my bill  doesn't apply to you. I am not talking about telling a mother with a  baby in her arms that she has to go find a job, and I am not going to  ask an elderly person in a nursing home to leave the nursing home and  go get a job in order to receive Medicaid. All my bill says is that if  you are young by today's standards, between 18 and 55, you are able- bodied and you have no children or dependents, then you have to go get  a job or you have to go to school or you have to perform community  service.   I want to be very clear about something else. In my State, we have a  lot of flood victims. We had terrible flooding last year. In my State,  Louisiana, we have a depression in the oil and gas industry; indeed, we  do throughout America, and I know we do in the great State of Alaska as  well. I am not looking to add to their hurt. I am working very hard, as  are you, Mr. President, to put our oilfield workers back to work and to  get our flood victims the assistance they need to recover from the  tragedy that has befallen them. This bill is not about them. This bill  is about able-bodied adults between the ages of 18 and 55 who have no  dependents and who have been unemployed for years, in many cases, by  their own choosing.   Our country has grown a lot and evolved a lot since Medicaid was  introduced in 1965. We now face new challenges, both at home and  abroad. We know that. Medicaid has grown, as well, but it hasn't  evolved in a positive way, in my opinion. Just 3 years after Medicaid  was founded, we knew we were going to have a problem finding the money,  given the exponential growth in the program, and more than 50 years  later, it is way past time to do something about it.   We have to break the back of poverty. This is not about throwing  people out into the cold. This is about helping them to know that they  can get work because the best program--the best social program in the  entire world is a job. By implementing a work requirement for able- bodied adults, Medicaid will evolve to the next logical step. Our goal  ought to be to ensure, of course, that people are healthy. That is what  Medicaid exists for, but if you are healthy, then the next step is to  help you join the workforce.    The simple fact is, this is nothing new or extraordinary. We already  have work requirements--required by acts of this Congress--for  unemployment assistance, for welfare benefits, for subsidized housing,  and for food stamps. Now, these requirements have been a success. We  all know that, not just for stemming the costs of those programs but  also for helping people--helping Americans build careers.   Yet we do not have a requirement--a work requirement--for Medicaid.  If my bill passes, we will. Work requirements exist because these  programs are supposed to be safety nets. That is what a social program  is, a safety net. They are not supposed to exist to permanently support  you if you can support yourself.   Our social programs in America are meant to be bridges. In way too  many respects, they have become parking lots. Medicaid costs are not  just a national problem. The program's expansion is clipping the wings  of States like Louisiana and like Alaska because, as I pointed out, the  States have to put up a substantial amount of the money.   We are becoming a country in which people subsist instead of thrive  because they don't know the rewards of work. We have become a country  in which poverty is a way of life for way too many people. That is just  sad. More than 50 years after Medicaid began, it is time to break the  back of poverty once and for all. We can start with a work requirement  for Medicaid.   Thank you.                                  ______                                         By Mr. KAINE (for himself and Mr. Warner):   S. 1156. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow  rehabilitation expenditures for public school buildings to qualify for  rehabilitation credit; to the Committee on Finance.
