 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by thanking Chairman Thornberry,  Ranking Member Smith, Chairman McCain, Ranking Member Reed, Senator  Inhofe, and their staff for their tireless work in producing this  conference report.   I am especially pleased that this conference report is named after  Senator John McCain, a true American hero. Thank you for your service,  Senator, and Godspeed.   It was an honor to serve as a conferee throughout this process and to  be a part of this undertaking in support of our Armed Forces.   While no bill is perfect, there is much to be proud of in this  conference report. We are giving our troops a much-deserved pay raise,  taking critical steps to counter Russian aggression and resist Chinese  coercive influence, and continuing to ensure the Department of Defense  is prepared to mitigate the risks posed by climate change.   We are also increasing funding for the Virginia- and Columbia-class  submarine programs, which are made in my home State of Rhode Island,  and protect our Nation and our allies and create thousands of jobs back  home.   As ranking member of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities  Subcommittee, it has been a pleasure to work with Chairwoman Elise  Stefanik.   I am particularly glad we are making strong investments in our cyber  personnel and capabilities, providing increased support for our Special  Operations Forces and their families, and increasing funding for key  programs to maintain our technological superiority, such as railgun  development, directed energy prototyping, and unmanned vehicles.   The threats we face as a nation are diverse and challenging. There  are no easy answers for how the United States will continue to promote  stability and the rules-based international order.   But I believe that this bipartisan work of the House and Senate Armed  Services Committee, and this bill in particular, will improve our  national security and help keep our country and our servicemembers  safe.   Lastly, I want to thank Kathryn Mitchell on my personal staff, who  serves as my MLA. She is leaving for South Korea to be with her  husband, who is serving in the United States Army.   Job well done, Kathryn, and thank you.   For those reasons and more, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  support this conference report.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the 28th anniversary  of the Americans with Disabilities Act. In 1990, the bipartisan effort  to identify disability rights as civil rights became the foundation for  reducing discrimination for the disability community.   The enactment the ADA was a groundbreaking acknowledgment that people  with disabilities deserve the dignity of full participation and  integration into daily life. It eliminated countless physical and  societal barriers, and it increased access to education, employment,  housing, and transportation. Yet, as we remember this historic day and  look back on all that we have accomplished, let us recognize that there  is so much more to be done.  [[Page H7710]]    It is up to each and every one of us to promote greater access and  inclusion and the opportunity to lead life with dignity so that we can  one day realize the full promise of the ADA. Because when we fight for  the inclusion and equality of individuals with disabilities, we also  fight for a world that is characterized by inclusion and equality for  all.                            ____________________
