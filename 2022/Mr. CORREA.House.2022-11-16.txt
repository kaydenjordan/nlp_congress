 Madam Speaker, this is not a Democrat or Republican  issue. This is about stopping sexual predators.   For decades, Larry Nassar abused young girls on the U.S. women's  national gymnastics team. At least 265 young women and girls--265  victims--were targeted and sexually abused by Nassar. It was all due to  a nondisclosure statement that protected Nassar from justice.    Allowing sexual predators to hide behind nondisclosure agreements is  wrong and is a crime.   Today, we have the power to stop sexual predators from hurting our  loved ones.   I ask my colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, to vote for the  Speak Out Act.
