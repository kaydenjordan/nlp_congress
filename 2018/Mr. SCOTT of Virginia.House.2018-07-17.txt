 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, Federal administrative law judges, commonly known as  ALJs, decide over 1 million cases a year, covering everything from  appeals of Social Security Disability and Medicare claims to disputes  over black lung benefits and securities law violations. These are cases  that can touch virtually all of our constituents.   On July 10, President Trump issued an executive order that will  undermine the quality and independence of ALJs and the impartiality of  the decisions they render. It does so by changing the hiring standards  for judges.   The current standards guarantee that ALJs are fully qualified to  serve. The executive order will replace those standards with a far more  lenient system that would allow ALJs to be hired based on ideology or  cronyism rather than experience and competence.   This executive order, titled, ``Exempting Administrative Law Judges  from the Competitive Service'' will open the door for the  politicization of a profession that plays a defining role in the lives  of millions of American families.   Representatives Elijah Cummings,  David Cicilline,  John Larson, and  I filed an amendment to defund the executive order and preserve the  impartiality, independence, and competence of administrative law  judges. Unfortunately, the majority on the Rules Committee has refused  to allow Members of Congress to vote on or even debate our amendment.   The longstanding hiring standards for ALJs were designed to guarantee  the legitimacy of their decisions. ALJs were required to have 7 years  of trial-level experience as an attorney and successfully complete a  six-part examination. To insulate judicial decisionmaking from agency  political pressure, the examination was conducted by the Office of  Personnel Management, OPM, which maintained a list of the highest  scoring applicants from which agencies can then select their  candidates.   All of that was jettisoned by the President's executive order, which  removes ALJs from the competitive service. Now the only requirements  are that an ALJ must be a lawyer in good standing.   This executive order is strongly opposed by a broad spectrum of  organizations. The Federal Administrative Law Judge Conference, a  nonpartisan, voluntary professional association, warns, ``now, any  agency that wants to hire an ALJ needs no approval from OPM and can  hire any attorney regardless of skill or experience. The new  appointment process will not afford members of the public the due  process and fair hearings they deserve. Instead, it will give agency  insiders and political loyalists a job for which they may not be  qualified but for which they will feel indebted.''   The Association of Administrative Law Judges, which represents over  1,600 ALJs at the Social Security Administration, states that the  President's order ``will politicize our courts, lead to cronyism, and  replace independent and impartial adjudicators with those who do the  bidding of political appointees.''   The American Association for Justice writes: ``It is important for  all cases overseen by ALJs to have a neutral ALJ handling the case, not  someone who may be beholden to a particular political party, hostile to  a particular agency or program, or otherwise politically motivated in  their decisionmaking.''   The American Bar Association writes: ``By giving agency heads sole  discretion to hire ALJs who will be making determinations affirming or  overturning decisions rendered by that agency, the executive order has  the potential to politicize the appointment process and interfere with  the decisional independence of ALJs.''   The American Bar Association says further that: ``Nothing less than  the integrity of the administrative judiciary is at issue here. That is  why it is critical that Members of Congress have an opportunity to  participate in the debate and help formulate a solution. The first step  is to halt implementation of the executive order.''   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the letters from those four  organizations.                               American Association for Justice,                                                      July 13, 2018.      Hon. Members of the House,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Member of Congress: The American Association for       Justice strongly opposes the Trump Administration's recent       executive order regarding the hiring and role of federal       Administrative Law Judges (ALJs). An impartial judiciary is       central to the strength of our justice system, and ALJs       should not be involved in the political process. The ALJ       executive order threatens the American people's right to a       neutral arbiter and right to due process.        It is vital that ALJs be independent and impartial. This       executive order eliminates the process of selecting ALJs       based on their qualifications, and instead allows these       positions to be filled by political appointees without any       merit-based procedure. Administrative proceedings should       continue to be overseen and adjudicated by ALJs who are       qualified, such as attorneys with at least seven years of       litigation experience and who are vetted by the Office of       Personnel Management, as was the prior process. The       appointment of ALJs with no experience, who can gain       appointment solely due to their financial contributions or       other political incentives so long as they possess a bar       license, could result in unfair, biased rulings for millions       of Americans.        The executive order will have a devastating effect on a       vast array of cases, including cases before the Social       Security Administration, Department of Labor, National Labor       Relations Board, and Department of Health and Human Services.       There are about 2,000 ALJs that decide over a million cases       each year. Approximately 1,600 of those ALJs hear Social       Security disability cases and render almost 700,000 decisions       each year at the hearing level. It is important for all cases       overseen by ALJs to have a neutral ALJ handling the case, not       someone who may be beholden to a particular political party,       hostile to a particular agency or program, or otherwise       politically motivated in their decision-making. AAJ is       especially concerned about bias against claimants seeking       Social Security disability benefits.        We urge you to oppose this executive order and to support       Amendment #55, sponsored by Reps. Scott (VA), Cummings,       Cicilline and Larson (CT), to Division B of Rules Committee       Print 115-81 (H.R. 6147). We greatly appreciate your support       in protecting the American people's right to due process.            Sincerely,                                                      Linda Lipsen,      CEO, American Association for Justice.                                   ____    [News Release From the Association of Administrative Law Judges, July                                 12, 2018]      Statement by Hon. Marilyn Zahm, President of the Association of    Administrative Law Judges (AALJ) on White House Executive Order on                         Administrative Law Judges         President Trump's executive order this week regarding the       hiring and role of federal administrative law judges should       concern anyone who has a Social Security Card. This is an       assault on due process for the American people who have a       right to a neutral arbiter. Currently, 1,600 of the roughly       2,000 federal ALJs hear Social Security disability cases. The       president's order calls for replacing the current merit       system used to hire judges with a court-packing plan that       will allow agency heads to hand pick judges who hear cases at       the Social Security Administration and dozens of other       federal agencies. This change will politicize our courts,       lead to cronyism and replace independent and impartial       adjudicators with those who do the bidding of political       appointees. This is a decision that should be reversed. If       allowed to go forward it would be the equivalent of placing a       thumb on the scale of justice.                                   ____                                         American Bar Association,                                         Chicago, IL, July 16, 2018.      Hon. Pete Sessions,      Committee on Rules, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. James McGovern,      Committee on Rules, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Sessions and Ranking Member McGovern: On       behalf of the American Bar Association and its over 400,000       members nationwide, I write to urge you to support       consideration of Representative Scott's proposed amendment to       Division B of Rules Committee Print 115-81 during floor       consideration of H.R. 6147. The amendment would prohibit the       use of funds by the Office of Personnel Management or any       other executive branch agency for the development,       promulgation, modification, or implementation of the July 10,       2018, Executive Order Excepting Administrative Law Judges       from Competitive Service.        The Executive Order (EO) is an ill-considered and legally       vulnerable response to the Supreme Court ruling in Lucia et       al. v. Securities and Exchange Commission, which held that       SEC Administrative Law Judges (ALJs) are considered       ``inferior officers of the United States'' and therefore       require appointment consistent with the Appointments Clause       of the United States Constitution.        The EO, which eliminates the nationwide, uniform,       competitive selection exam process  [[Page H6279]]       and weakens existing qualifications standards, gives each       agency head the unfettered authority to hire ALJs based on       criteria established by the agency. In fact, the EO       specifically states that it gives agencies greater discretion       to assess critical qualities, including the applicant's       ``ability to meet the particular needs of the agency,'' which       are, of course, left entirely to the agency to define.        There is no doubt that changes to the current selection and       appointment process for ALJs are required by Lucia, but we       believe that those changes should be instituted after there       has been an opportunity for Congress and the public to engage       in an open and deliberative process that considers possible       options for curing the constitutional defects in the current       process. We hope this includes an examination of ways to       assure that safeguards remain in place that respect the       unique adjudicative role of ALJs and retain public confidence       in the system. If adopted, the Scott amendment, by halting       implementation of the EO, would allow congressional and       public engagement on this important issue.        A fair and impartial administrative judiciary is       indispensable to our system of justice. Vast numbers of       Americans are involved in administrative adjudicative       proceedings every day, and the decisions rendered by ALJs in       these proceedings often affect their lives in profound ways.        By giving agency heads sole discretion to hire ALJs who       will be making determinations affirming or overturning       decisions rendered by that agency, the EO has the potential       to politicize the appointment process and interfere with the       decisional independence of ALJs.        Nothing less than the integrity of the administrative       judiciary is at issue here. That is why it is critical that       Members of Congress have an opportunity to participate in the       debate and help formulate a solution. The first step is to       halt implementation of the EO.        We therefore urge you to allow the House to vote on the       Scott amendment when it deliberates on H.R. 6147.            Sincerely,                                                      Hilarie Bass,      President.                                   ____    [From the Federal Administrative Law Judges Conference, July 11, 2018]     Executive Order on Administrative Law Judges Lowers Standards and                            Reduces Independence         Washington, DC.--On July 10, 2018, President Donald J.       Trump issued an executive order eliminating the competitive       process to select nonpartisan Administrative Law Judges       (ALJs) based on qualifications demonstrated through courtroom       experience and an examination process. These positions may       now be filled by inexperienced political appointees.        Nearly two thousand ALJs decide over a million cases each       year. Americans are far more likely during their lifetime to       encounter a federal ALJ than any other type of judge.        Since 1947, administrative proceedings, under the       Administrative Procedure Act (APA), have been objectively       overseen by presidents from both political parties without       partisan interference. In enacting the APA, Congress ensured       that agency judges must be both highly qualified and       independent from political influence.        Until yesterday, federal agencies hired ALJ candidates with       7 years of litigation experience. Candidates were ranked       based on their scores on a six-part examination conducted by       the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Now, any agency       that wants to hire an ALJ needs no approval from OPM and can       hire any attorney regardless of skill or experience.        The new appointment process will not afford members of the       public the due process and fair hearings they deserve.       Instead, it will give agency insiders and political loyalists       a job for which they may not be qualified but for which they       will feel indebted.        As judges, we are disappointed that a merit selection       system that produced nonpartisan judges for seven decades was       eliminated by the stroke of a pen. We call for presidential       reconsideration or Congressional intervention to restore the       ALJ merit selection system.        The Federal Administrative Law Judges Conference (FALJC),       established in 1947, is a nonpartisan voluntary professional       association for federal ALJs. FALJC is dedicated to improving       the administrative judicial process, presenting educational       programs, and ensuring due process and judicial independence       in administrative proceedings.     Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, by refusing to  allow this amendment to come to the floor, the majority has denied  Members the opportunity to have an important debate on this issue.  Rather than avoiding the issue, the majority should be standing up for  a just and impartial review process. Rather than refusing a vote on  this amendment, the majority should be joining us in holding the  administration to account.   Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed by the majority's opposition to  consider this issue that affects so many constituents across the  country. I, therefore, urge Members to oppose the rule.
