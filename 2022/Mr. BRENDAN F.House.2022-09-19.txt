BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, as the Chaplain  just previously mentioned, we recently celebrated the 235th anniversary  of the signing of the United States Constitution in Philadelphia.   As the Member of Congress who represents the Independence Hall where  it was drafted and adopted, it is a great honor for all of us in my  district to know that our city played such an important role in the  history and founding of our country.   It is now up to all of us to again read our Constitution and bring it  close to not only our minds but our hearts. Every single day we must  work to uphold it and uphold our democracy.                            ____________________
