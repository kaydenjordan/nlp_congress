 Madam President, today, we will be voting on two very  important bills: the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act and the  Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. I would like to thank my  colleagues Senator Graham and Senator Sasse for their leadership on  these bills, and I would like to thank Senator McConnell, for his  efforts to bring these bills to the floor for a vote.   First, I want to talk about Senator Sasse's Born-Alive Abortion  Survivors Protection Act, a bill which I have cosponsored that would  ensure that a baby who survives an abortion will receive the same  treatment as any child naturally born at the same age, without  prescribing any particular form of treatment.   That is just morally right, and I don't see why there would be any  disagreement about it. This bill is not even about abortion; it is  about infanticide.   Twenty-eight years ago, I came down here to tell the story of Ana  Rosa Rodriguez. Here is what I said:         Mr. Chairman, there is a big misconception regarding       abortion and the issue of women and their right to protect       their bodies. It is not that right that I object to, but the       right that is given them to kill an unborn fetus--an unborn       child.        I want to share with you a story that my colleague, Chris       Smith told some time ago on this very floor. Ana Rosa       Rodriguez is an abortion survivor. At birth she was a healthy       3 pound baby girl except for her injury--she was missing an       arm.        Ana survived a botched abortion. Her mother attempted to       get an abortion in her 32nd week of pregnancy when she was       perfectly healthy--8 weeks past what New York State law       legally allows. In the unsuccessful abortion attempt the       baby's right arm was ripped off, however they failed to kill       Ana Rosa. She lived.        Pro-life supporters agreed that nightmare situations like       the Rodriguez case are probably not common, but abortion       related deaths and serious injuries occur more frequently       than most people are aware.        It is amazing that we can pay so much attention to issues       such as human rights abroad and can allow the violent       destruction of over 26 million children here at home. We are       fortunate that Ana was not one of those children-she       survived.    That was in 1992. But today, we still don't have explicit Federal  protections for the babies who survive the brutal abortion process. As  I said, this issue is not about abortion but about caring for a baby  outside the womb.   The need for these protections has become even clearer as we see  States like New York and Illinois allow abortion for virtually any  reason up until the point of birth and support infanticide by removing  protections for infants born alive after a failed abortion.   Just a few years after that speech, in 1997, I was on the floor with  my good friend former Senator Rick Santorum to try to pass the partial- birth abortion ban and end the horrific practice  [[Page S1135]]  of late-term abortions. Fortunately, we won the battle against partial- birth abortions and finally ended that practice in 2003. That ban was  upheld by the Supreme Court in 2007.   But we have yet to pass legislation banning late term abortion.   Only seven countries allow abortion after 20 weeks, including the  United States and North Korea. That is horrific. The U.S. is supposed  to be an example in regards to global human rights; yet we are on par  with North Korea when it comes to protecting the unborn.   Senator Graham's Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act would help  roll back this horrific practice by prohibiting abortion after 20 weeks  post-fertilization, when we know babies can feel pain.   This is another commonsense bill that should not divide us along  partisan lines; a baby is a baby whether in or outside of the womb, and  each baby deserves a chance to live as an individual created in the  image of God.   There still much more we need to do to end the abortion on demand  culture, but thankfully, we have the most pro-life President in  history.   This January, President Trump became the first sitting President to  attend the annual March for Life rally in Washington. Hundreds of pro- life Oklahomans joined the President and tens of thousands of Americans  to march. I had the chance to meet many of these Oklahomans, many of  them extremely young--as young as high school. They asked me how to  respond when the radical left attacks their views. I told them to be  kind, but not to be afraid to voice their opinions--after all, they are  right.   Under President Trump's leadership, we have protected the Hyde  amendment, reinstated and expanded the Mexico City policy, and stripped  abortion providers like Planned Parenthood from using title X funding  for abortions.   The need to stand up for our babies is as important today as it was  in 1992 and 1997. I am looking forward to building on our successes  under President Trump to end the practice of abortion on demand and to  ensure that we protect babies who survive abortions.   We will overcome evil with good by upholding and affirming the  dignity and inherent worth of every human being. We will keep fighting.
