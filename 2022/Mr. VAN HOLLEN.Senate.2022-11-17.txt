 Mr. President. I rise today to honor the career of  Gaye Olivia Brown, a dedicated public servant with more than three  decades of government service, on the occasion of her retirement.   Maryland is home to a robust Federal workforce that serves our  country with pride. Federal employees work day-in and day-out to  provide crucial services to the American people. I have the honor of  representing many of these dedicated individuals in the U.S. Senate.   For many years, Mrs. Brown has been part of that group, committing  herself to government service locally and on the Federal level, for the  Metropolitan Police Department, the Department of Defense, Andrews Air  Force Base, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and finally, at  the National Institutes of Health. At these Agencies and beyond,  Federal workers help keep our country running, both in normal times and  in times of crisis. I am honored to support this workforce as they  fulfill their mission, just as Mrs. Brown has done with distinction.   I commend Mrs. Brown for 34 years of dedicated and faithful public  service. I congratulate her on her well-deserved retirement.                            ____________________
