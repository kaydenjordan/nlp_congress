 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my  colleagues in our effort to raise awareness for the growing opioid  epidemic in America, particularly in the State of California.   In 2016, nearly 5,000 Californians died of opioid overdoses.  Astonishingly, the year before, 122 million prescription opioid pills  were dispensed in Orange County.   Mr. Speaker, we cannot allow this cycle of opioid abuse and death to  continue, which is why Congress must work together to end the epidemic.   I proudly supported recently enacted legislation that provides $4  billion of prevention, treatment, and law enforcement programs that  help address this growing crisis.   Ending the opioid epidemic starts at home. On April 28, National  Prescription Drug Take Back Day gives Americans the opportunity to  safely dispose of their excess prescription drugs, including opioids.  This effort can reduce the possibility that these pills will find their  way onto our streets.   There is still work to be done, but I am confident that together we  can end the opioid crisis in this country.
