 Madam President, before Senator Sasse leaves, I say to  the Senator, I just can't thank you enough for the passion and the  persuasion you bring to these issues. You speak from the heart. You  speak with reason. You make a lot of sense, and over time, you will  prevail. Just stick with it. Your day will come.   What he is saying is, if you try to abort a child, and the child  survives the abortion, shouldn't the doctor and the nurses and  everybody involved treat the child the same as if they came into the  world some other way? I think the answer is yes.   Really, these two pieces of legislation are about us as a nation.  This is 2020. Who are we as Americans? To me it is odd that we even  need to have a discussion about this. I am just perplexed that this is  even a problem.   Abortion is legal in the United States. There are certain  restrictions on it, but I just can't believe we can't rally around the  idea that if a baby survives the procedure and is alive and breathing  and functioning, medical science doesn't kick in to save the baby. It  is just--I don't know. I don't know what happened. What happened to our  country that we are even talking about this? It is 2020, for God's  sake. It is not 1020.   Anyway, just hang in there, Ben. Your day will come.   My legislation--I have been doing this for a few years now. We are  one of seven nations in the world that allow abortion on demand at 20  weeks, along with North Korea, Vietnam, China, Singapore, the  Netherlands, and Canada. What would this legislation do at 20 weeks?  This is about the fifth month in the birthing process.   The bill is called the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. Why  do we call it that? Medical science has determined that a child at 20  weeks is capable of feeling excruciating pain. So if there is an  operation to save a child's life or to repair a medical defect at 20  weeks, they provide anesthesia to the child because, during the  surgery, the child feels pain. You can see that when a child is poked,  they actually repel against the poking.   The bottom line is, I find it odd that medical science requires  anesthesia to save the baby's life, but during that same period, you  can dismember the child. That is what we are talking about here.   What kind of Nation are we if, at the fifth month--this is 20 weeks  into the birthing process--we are one of seven nations that allow  abortion on demand? There are exceptions for the life of the mother-- that hard decision if the mother's life is impacted by the child, and  we will leave that up to the family--and if the pregnancy is as a  result of rape or incest. But beyond that, we want to eliminate  abortion on demand at the 20-week period because, I would argue, that  doesn't make us a better nation. It doesn't advance anybody's cause.   The bottom line is, based on medical science, we know that this child  has nerve endings intact. Medical encyclopedias encourage young parents  to sing to their unborn child during this period of development because  they can begin to associate their voice and recognize who they are. I  find it odd that we would encourage young parents to sing to their  unborn child at 20 weeks; we require anesthesia to save the child's  life; but we are also a country that allows the child to be  dismembered. It makes no sense to me. They have exceptions that make  sense: life of the mother, the result of rape or incest where there is  no choice at all.   The bottom line is that these two pieces of legislation are going to  continue to be advanced until they pass. It takes a while for America  to kind of get focused on what we are saying here because abortion is  an uncomfortable topic to talk about, particularly in the  [[Page S1136]]  early stages of the pregnancy. But what Senator Sasse is saying is that  in the case of the child surviving an abortion, there is really not  much to talk about. We should protect the life that is now a being. The  baby survived. I don't know why the baby survived. I don't know how the  baby survived. I just know that decent people would want to come to the  child's aid once she does survive.   Just imagine what it must be like, after the baby survives the  abortion, to be left unattended for 1\1/2\ to 3 hours. That says a lot  about us as a nation. I just think we are better than that.   It is kind of odd that we even have to have this debate, but  apparently we do because this happens more than you would ever think.  Babies actually survive abortion, and the rules in this country are  that you just let it die. There is no longer required care. That, to  me, as Senator Sasse said, is barbaric. It doesn't make us a better  people, and it really doesn't affect the abortion debate because the  baby survived.   My legislation is about us as a nation too. How does abortion on  demand in the fifth month advance the cause of America? I don't think  it does.   We have exceptions in those instances where it is a tragic choice  between the life of the mother and the unborn child and in the cases of  rape or incest, which are tragic and criminal, but generally speaking,  we would like to get ourselves out of a club of seven nations that  allow abortion on demand at a time when the parents are encouraged to  sing to the child and you have to provide anesthesia to save the  child's life because you would not want to operate on a baby in a  fashion to hurt the child.   I dare say that if you are a doctor and you try to save the baby's  life at 20 weeks through surgery and you don't provide anesthesia, you  are going to wind up getting yourself in trouble. I find it odd that  the law would allow the dismemberment of the child even with  anesthesia, but that is where we are.   To Senator Sasse, I say that you are an articulate spokesman for your  legislation. One day, we will prevail. It took 15 years to pass the  late-term abortion ban. It is going to take a while, but our day will  come.   At the end of the day, the sooner America can get this right, the  better off we will be.   With that, I yield the floor.                                Cloture Motion
