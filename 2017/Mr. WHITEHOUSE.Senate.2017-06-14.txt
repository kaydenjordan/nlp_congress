 Madam President, I understand Senator McCain has come  to the floor. I will yield to him as the chairman of the Armed Services  Committee.    Madam President, I appreciate my colleague's sense of  humor.                      Transparency in Business Ownership    Madam President, the United States of America has suffered an  unprecedented intrusion into our American Presidential elections. In  January, our intelligence agencies disclosed that agents of Russia, on  the orders of President Vladimir Putin, engaged in a massive election  influence campaign throughout 2016.   This effort strikes at the very heart of our representative  democracy. All Americans should take this attack deadly seriously.  Congress had to act against such interference decisively. By  strengthening economic sanctions against the Russian gangster state, we  hit them where it hurts, right in the oligarch. I am glad to see that  Republican and Democratic Senators came together to do this.   Now the question will shift to the White House. Last July, as  evidence of Russian election meddling began to emerge, then-candidate  for Vice President Mike Pence said: ``If it is Russia and they are  interfering in our elections, I can assure you both parties in the  United States government will ensure there are serious consequences.''   Well, it is Russia, and they were interfering, but there has been  little sign of consequences so far from the Trump White House.   Michael Flynn, as adviser to the President-elect, had illicit  communications with the Russian Ambassador, about which he then lied.  Trump appointees at the State Department alarmed career officials with  their rush to craft a pro-Russia program. President Trump held an  unprecedented, cozy meeting with Russian envoys--all smiles in the Oval  Office--a meeting for which Putin says he has a transcript. In Europe,  Trump, dropping the assurances about article 5 protections from his  NATO speech, gave the Russians joy.   The Trump administration has been reportedly trying to return two  compounds used by Russian intelligence to Russian control--compounds  here in the United States. Former FBI Director James Comey told the  Senate last week that President Trump never spoke to him, not even  once, about defending against Russia's acts of aggression.   Well, the threat from Russia is severe. Chairman Graham and I held  hearings in our Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism,  exploring the Russian toolbox for interference in democracies across  the globe--how Russia exploits the dark shadows of other countries'  political and economic systems.   One tool is campaign money. Russia is reported to have funneled money  to French far-right party Presidential candidate, Marine Le Pen, for  instance, as part of a reward for her support of Russia's actions in  Crimea. Ken Wainstein, Homeland Security Advisor to George W. Bush,  cited Russia as a threat of that kind of foreign financial infiltration  here in the United States. ``It is critical that we effectively enforce  the campaign finance laws that would prevent this type of financial  influence by foreign actors,'' Wainstein told our subcommittee. But  that task proves difficult in a system like ours that permits the free  flow of dark money.   Since the Citizens United decision, we have seen unprecedented dark  money flow into our elections from anonymous dark money organizations,  groups that we allow to hide the identities of their big donors. We  don't know who is behind that dark money or what they are demanding in  return. Despite this risk, Congress has been unwilling to push back  against the tide of dark money. Too many are too in tow to the big  American dark money emperors, like the Koch brothers, but once you  permit big money to flow through dark money channels, cash from  Vladimir Putin is no more traceable than cash from Charles and David  Koch.    ``The Kremlin's Trojan Horses'' is a study of Russian influence in  Western Europe done by the Atlantic Council. Russia takes advantage of  nontransparency in campaign financing and financial transactions, the  report says, to build political alliances with ideologically friendly  political groups and individuals, as well as to establish pro-Russian  organizations in civil society, creating a shadowy web of political  networks which help to propagate the regime's point of view.   Corruption is the grid on which the electrons of Russian influence  flow. In  [[Page S3469]]  the foreword to the ``Kremlin's Trojan Horses'' report, Radoslaw  Sikorski, former Foreign Minister of Poland, who has seen a lot of this  up close, described what he called ``the financial networks that allow  authoritarian regimes to export corruption to the West.'' He warns:         Electoral rules should be amended, so that publically       funded political groups, primarily political parties, should       at the very least be required to report the sources of their       funding.    He continues:         The Kremlin's blatant attempts to influence and disrupt the       U.S. Presidential election should serve as an inspiration for       a democratic push back.    Well, we should certainly push back by requiring political entities  in this country to report their sources of funding.   Another of our witnesses, Heather Conley at the Center for Strategic  and International Studies, wrote about ``The Kremlin Playbook.'' The  CSIS report, ``The Kremlin Playbook,'' calls corruption ``the common  thread'' among these various drivers of Russian influence. It is, the  authors write, ``the lubricant on which this system operates.'' She  testified just today in the Helsinki Commission that ``corruption is a  systemic weakness within a country that is exploited and influenced by  adversaries and from which no country is immune, including the United  States.''   Where Russia can work in darkness, Russian agents systemically  exploit democratic institutions to acquire influence over politicians  and political systems using corruption. Russia has done this in the  former Soviet Union and in Europe for decades, and we should be  prepared in the United States, Ms. Conley says, for them to keep doing  it here.   ``The Kremlin Playbook'' warns that to fight the corruption that  gives Russia this channel of influence, ``enhancing transparency and  the effectiveness of the Western democratic tools, instruments, and  institutions is critical to resilience against Russian influence.''   Ms. Conley echoed the widespread warnings that the United States is  particularly susceptible to Russian influence via dark money channels  in our politics. That is widely agreed.   She and others have warned of a second vulnerability: lax  incorporation laws that hide the true owners of shell corporations. In  the same way that dark money channels can hide the hand of foreign  influence, so can shell corporations, which obscure the hand of the  entity behind the corporate screen. Interestingly, USA TODAY just  reported: ``Since President Trump won the Republican nomination, the  majority of his companies' real estate sales are to secretive shell  companies that obscure the buyers' identities.''   Our lax incorporation laws have made the United States a destination  for drug traffickers, terrorists, corrupt foreign officials, tax  cheats, and other criminals from around the world. Former FBI Director  Comey testified before the Judiciary Committee that the United States  is becoming the last big haven for shell corporations--sickening but  true. These crooks come here to America to form shell companies to hide  assets and obscure illegal activities. For added safety, a foreign  gangster or a crooked despot or an agent of Putin could put a shell  corporation behind a shell corporation with another shell corporation  behind that.   There are few safeguards in place to prevent foreign actors from  funneling money into our elections through faceless shell companies. We  actually already see shell companies used to hide the identities behind  big political spending. This is not a potential. This is happening now.  We just don't know whether foreign influence is behind it. Nothing  prevents agents of Putin from being behind those hidden entities.   Part of the Kremlin's playbook is to use shell corporations and other  devices to establish illicit financial relationships with prominent  local figures. The shell entities allow Russian money to flow  anonymously into crooked deals. The crooked deals give rise to corrupt  relationships, and these corrupt relationships give Russia leverage,  either through the carrot of continued bribery of the prominent local  figure or the stick of threatened disclosure of the crooked deal  imperiling the prominent local figure. The prominent local figure in  the crooked deal is well and truly on the Russian hook. For what it is  worth, Donald Trump is the very model of the Russian mark in this sort  of scheme.   To close this avenue of foreign political influence, Ms. Conley told  us: ``Building and strengthening financial transparency requirements  and beneficial ownership will go an extraordinary way to prevent these  corrupt practices to further Russia's influence.''   We really ought to be able to agree that we need to prevent these  corrupt practices to further Russia's influence.   The answer to the problem of shell corporations is simple: Have each  state track the actual owners of companies they charter and make that  information available to Federal, State, and local law enforcement  agencies through proper process. That is what Ms. Conley means by that  phrase she used, ``beneficial ownership.'' It is the term of art for a  simple concept, knowing who the real owner is.   The True Incorporation Transparency for Law Enforcement, or TITLE,  Act, which Chairman Grassley and I will reintroduce soon, would require  States to identify the actual human beings who own the company they  incorporate. The bill would provide funding to support the maintenance  and retrieval of this information, which would be available to law  enforcement officers who present valid, court-ordered subpoenas or  search warrants. The bill has bipartisan support and has received  strong endorsement from the law enforcement community, banks, and anti- trafficking organizations.   Transparency in business ownership is ever more vital around the  world. The European Union understands very well the shadow of Russian  influence that has been cast over it, and every member of the European  Union has committed to ensuring incorporation transparency. The United  Kingdom, Spain, Germany, Italy, and France have already enacted  incorporation transparency laws. The light of corporate transparency is  about to shine throughout Europe to help defend them from Russian  influence. This means that money from those shell companies and schemes  committed through those shell companies will be looking for new, dark  homes, likely in American shell corporations. Again, we are supposed to  be an example to the world. We are supposed to be the ``City upon a  Hill,'' not the place where the world's most corrupt and criminal  evildoers come to hide their cash and their assets.   We know the Russian playbook for election interference exploits  opaque incorporation laws. We know criminals and even terrorists view  the United States as a haven to hide illegal activity and its proceeds.  We even know, weirdly, that lax incorporation laws are affecting our  real estate market. Some American cities are so loaded with real estate  held by shell corporations that it is actually driving up the prices  for real American home buyers. Of course, there are not a lot of people  in the corner store when the property is held for a foreign owner as  the safeguard for his illicit gains.   We must take commonsense steps to stop these activities and bring  wrongdoers into the light. The measures that we will take against  Russia are welcome and, as Senator McCain has said, even overdue, but  we must remember that this is an ongoing battle and we have systemic  weaknesses that have already been clearly identified to us over and  over by bipartisan experts in this field and renowned think tanks and  study groups here in Washington. To quote Ms. Conley again, ``the  battle of Western democracies to defeat corruption'' must be seen as  ``a matter of national security.''   Testifying before our Crime and Terrorism Subcommittee, former  Director of National Intelligence James Clapper agreed and urged  Congress to act. He said:         I believe [the Russians] are now emboldened to continue       such activities in the future both here and around the world,       and to do so even more intensely. If there has ever been a       clarion call for vigilance and action against a threat to the       very foundation of our democratic political system, this       episode is it.        I hope the American people recognize the severity of this       threat and that we collectively counter it before it further       erodes the fabric of our democracy.   [[Page S3470]]     This week the Senate takes strong steps to punish Russia for its  disruptive meddling in the past, but we must do more. Dark money and  the shell corporations that allow Russian influence are identified  known vulnerabilities in the future. Every warning is that the Russians  are not going away and that future elections will be marked by Russian  mischief. We have to close both avenues of foreign influence and  corruption: dark money and shell corporations. They are no good in any  event. They are no good in any event, and now they bring the added  contamination of Russian election manipulation. I hope we can work  together to remedy that contamination.   I yield the floor.
