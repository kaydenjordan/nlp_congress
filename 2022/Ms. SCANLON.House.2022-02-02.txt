 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate an outstanding  female athlete and native of Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania, for her service  to our community.   Margo Carlin currently plays field hockey at Boston College, where  she has won multiple awards and played in the NCAA Final Four. But her  accomplishments go far beyond the field hockey turf.   Last year, after a new rule allowed college athletes to raise money  from the use of their names and likenesses, Margo saw an opportunity to  make a difference in our community. She used her platform as a college  athlete to partner with Covenant House and raised nearly $30,000 to  help that charity house and feed young people who are experiencing  homelessness in our area. That successful partnership allowed Covenant  House to seek out similar partnerships with athletes in other parts of  the country.  [[Page H342]]    Margo's approach to community service is an example of how each of us  has the power, with a little creativity, to use our unique talents to  make a difference. I am so proud to recognize Margo Carlin today, and I  look forward to all she will accomplish in the future.                     Support Workforce Training Programs     Mr. Speaker, since coming to Congress, my office has  focused on forging closer connections between the jobs that we are  developing in our region and the people who live here.   I have been proud to support a number of workforce training programs  that bridge that gap, particularly for the jobs that are revitalizing  the Philadelphia Shipyard, thanks to a contract we helped secure for  the building of five national security multi-mission vessels.   Another sector of our local economy that is going to benefit  immensely from investments in workforce training and public-private  partnerships is biotech and life sciences.   Last week, the U.S. Economic Development Administration announced  that the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia is receiving a STEM Talent  Challenge Grant, one of only eight such grants awarded in the entire  Nation.   The Wistar Institute will use this grant to support workforce  training to address the demand for skilled workers from the life  sciences industry which has been growing by leaps and bounds in our  region.   For over 20 years, the Wistar Institute has been pioneering workforce  training for young people attending high schools and community colleges  in our region to enter this exciting field. And I am delighted that  this new program is training students from Cheyney University, the  oldest HBCU in the country, which is also located in my district.   The Quality Science Pathway Apprenticeship offers an earn-and-learn,  hands-on training curriculum, taught by experts to uniquely address the  critical need for a highly skilled, quality science labor force based  in the Philadelphia region.   For the last decade, our regional economy has been driven by dynamic  eds, meds, and tech sectors. Life sciences is a key part of that  economy, so I am grateful that the EDA chose to invest in this model  program at the Wistar Institute to help people from our region win  these critical jobs and the opportunity to have careers in an  expanding, in-demand industry.                     Fighting Gun Violence in Our Country     Mr. Speaker, since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic,  we have seen an unprecedented rise in gun violence across the entire  country.   While most conversations about gun violence are quickly overwhelmed  by extremist rhetoric, one of the strategies to reduce gun violence  that has widespread support is to make sure that law enforcement has  the resources needed to investigate and clear cases that get criminals  and guns off of the streets. That is why I am proud to support an  important piece of legislation introduced by former police chief and  our colleague in Congress, Representative Val Demings.   The VICTIM Act targets resources to the things we know can help  reduce gun violence. Grants would support the hiring, training, and  retention of detectives and victim services personnel. These grants  will also fund training, equipment, and personnel needed to process and  analyze evidence in gun crimes.   In Philadelphia, our Police Department would like to use such funding  to support a new unit dedicated to investigating non-fatal shootings.   One of the reasons I came to Congress was to fight for an end to gun  violence, to protect our children, our families, and our communities.   In our country today, gun violence is hitting ever closer to home.  Several of my employees have lost relatives to gun violence. In  November, a constituent was killed in a carjacking near his college  campus. A month later, I became the victim of carjacking, though I am  extremely lucky that no one was injured in my case.   Then, just last week, I found myself embracing a mother devastated by  the death of her daughter after she was struck by gunfire at a  playground. This has to stop.   There is no one solution. But as a legislator, I want to pass laws to  tackle the underlying issues driving this epidemic of violence, as well  as providing the means to end it. That means commonsense gun safety  reform, resources for law enforcement, support for mental health  services, and investments in education and employment opportunities for  all Americans.   The VICTIM Act can be an important part of this effort, and I hope we  will soon be able to bring it to the floor for a vote.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from the Rules  Committee for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of today's rule. The America  COMPETES Act is a bold and important bill that would help make our  economy more competitive, more dynamic, and more prosperous as we  confront the challenges of the 21st century.   This bill provides a long-overdue investment in our Nation's leading  research and development institutions, which will deliver huge benefits  to the region I represent. It will fund innovations and breakthroughs  to ensure that the United States leads the world in advancements in  artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, computing, and biomedical  research.   The America COMPETES Act also provides a targeted program of policies  to address our short- and long-term supply chain challenges. These  policies will help to lower inflation, promote domestic manufacturing,  encourage businesses to reshore jobs, and insulate our economy from the  supply chain disruptions we are seeing right now.   Internationally, the America COMPETES Act will improve our  relationships with our allies and partners in the Americas, Europe,  Africa, and Asia, fostering closer political and economic ties and  countering China's growing influence abroad.   All in all, the America COMPETES Act is a sound investment in our  Nation's future, and I hope that the House and Senate can quickly work  out their differences so that we can send a final bill to President  Biden's desk soon.   Madam Speaker, I also want to highlight two amendments that I have  offered to help shape the America COMPETES Act. One of those amendments  would provide grants to institutions of higher education to create  innovative, research-focused education centers for STEM students. These  centers would provide students with course-based research experiences  across STEM disciplines and education levels, and they would work to  reduce the barriers that minority and low-income students face in  participating in STEM education in order to reduce attrition rates and  increase diversity in the STEM workforce.   My other amendment deals with the regional technology and innovation  hub program created by the America COMPETES Act, which would provide  cities and towns with funding to increase jobs and training  opportunities in R&D, tech, and manufacturing. My amendment would  clarify the program's designation process so that cities like  Philadelphia can compete fairly for these vital Federal resources.    I am proud to contribute these amendments to the bill, and I urge all  of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the rule and the underlying  legislation.
