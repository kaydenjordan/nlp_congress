 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, my dear friend and colleague  from Maine, Representative Pingree, hosted a panel discussion on the  Fruit and Vegetable Prescription Program.   Experts from Wholesome Wave, the American Heart Association, and War  on Poverty--Florida briefed congressional staff on how we can improve  health outcomes for people living in poverty by increasing access to  healthy, fresh produce. It is a simple concept with incredible results.   Currently, healthcare providers at 34 clinics across 10 States  provide individuals and family members with prescriptions for fruits  and vegetables and $1 per day per family member to purchase these  nutritious foods.   The program has significantly increased food security among its  participants and has enabled these families to increase their vegetable  consumption by an astounding 206 percent.  [[Page H9719]]    I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting the Local FARMS Act,  H.R. 3941, Representative Pingree's bipartisan legislation to expand  the support and effort, and let us all work together to end hunger now.                            ____________________
