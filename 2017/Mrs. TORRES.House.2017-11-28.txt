 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   H.R. 2768 names two peaks in the Uncompahgre National Forest in  Colorado after Charlie Fowler and Christine Boskoff.   Fowler and Boskoff were world-class rock climbers whose  accomplishments left enduring legacies on the sport. Sadly, in 2016,  the two set out to climb a mountain in a remote part of China near the  Tibetan border and never returned.   This bill and the renaming of the peaks is a fitting tribute and I  support its adoption.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2615 is a simple bipartisan bill that authorizes  the exchange of two small parcels of land to provide needed access for  our veterans in Mississippi.   The Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 5699 is located adjacent to a  portion of Gulf Islands National Seashore, and while having a national  park in your backyard is a desirable condition, the post has found  themselves landlocked and in need of direct access to their facility.   To solve this issue, the Gulf Islands National Seashore Land Exchange  Act will exchange approximately 2 acres of land owned by the VFW with  1.5 acres owned by the Federal Government.   The acreage required by the VFW will be used to establish a short  driveway directly to the post while the land given in exchange to the  Federal Government will be managed as part of Gulf Islands National  Seashore.   This exchange is supported by both the VFW post and the National Park  Service and is a simple and logical solution to a local issue. I am  pleased to see the National Park Service and the VFW working together  to form a solution to this issue. This bill passed the House in the  114th Congress, and I urge all Members to support this commonsense,  bipartisan bill.  [[Page H9443]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, passage of H.R. 1491, which I am proud to cosponsor,  will clear the way for the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Indians to  finally provide additional Tribal housing for their members. Only 17  percent of Tribal members and lineal descendants live in Tribal  housing.   In 2010, the Tribe purchased approximately 1,400 acres of ancestral  land in an effort to provide suitable housing for the Tribe's members  and their descendants.                                time  1645    Even though this land was taken into trust administratively in  January of this year, a number of parties continue to file lawsuits  appealing the decision.   The Chumash leadership has been forthcoming in their desire to  acquire this land only for additional Tribal housing, and they have  attempted to be good neighbors by engaging local elected officials and  groups to mitigate any and all concerns.   It is a shame that it has almost taken a decade for this issue to be  resolved, but we are now at a point where we can finally put an end to  this process. Passage of H.R. 1491 will reinforce the Secretarial  decision that put the land in trust and will also incorporate a  memorandum of agreement between the Chumash Tribe and the Santa Barbara  County Board of Supervisors in relation to the land.   I congratulate the Chumash leadership for their work and persistence  on this issue, and I thank the Santa Barbara County Board Supervisors  for coming to this agreement. I also thank my friend and colleague from  California, Chairman LaMalfa, for carrying this legislation, not giving  up on it, and moving it forward.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3115 authorizes a land exchange between the Forest  Service and PolyMet Mining. PolyMet will acquire land within  Minnesota's Superior National Forest to pursue the development of an  open pit mine.   While the Forest Service already approved the exchange, I understand  several groups of concerned Minnesotans have expressed concerns about  the proposed development, including the Fon du Lac Band of Lake  Superior Chippewa, a federally recognized Tribe whose reservation is  downstream from the proposed mine. The area to be exchanged is part of  the Tribe's ancestral homeland, and they have concerns that the  conveyance could impact rights to hunt, fish, and gather. Federal  ownership protects these rights.   As ranking member of the Subcommittee on Indian, Insular, and Alaska  Native Affairs, I think it is important that we listen to the concerns  of tribal communities. That said, I understand this bill is a priority  for Representative Nolan, and I look forward to hearing his  perspectives.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Nolan), the sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. McCollum).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.  [[Page H9448]]     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill could not be more straightforward. H.R. 995  would require the USDA and the Department of the Interior to change the  terminology used to describe the racial background or place of origin  of people.   These very outdated and offensive racial terms have no place in our  Federal regulations. Modernizing these terms should be a continuous  effort across all agencies. I want to thank the gentleman from New York  (Mr. Jeffries) for his leadership on this issue by pushing this  legislation forward.   Mr. Speaker, I want to include in the Record the phrases that this  bill would change: replacing the references to the term ``Negro'' with  ``Black or African American;'' replacing the definition of ``Negro''  with the definition of ``African American'' as ``a person having  origins;'' replacing the references of the term ``Oriental'' with  ``Asian American;'' and replacing the references to the terms  ``Eskimo'' and ``Aleut'' with ``Alaska Native.''   I think it is only fair that we move to pass this bill and finally  address people as we should. I also want to bring attention to the  title of the bill, which is the 21st Century Respect Act.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to add that the bill was reported out of  committee by unanimous vote.   I want to read into the Record Representative Jeffries' remarks on  H.R. 995, the 21st Century Respect Act, a bipartisan bill that will  remove outdated and offensive racial labels from the Code of Federal  Regulations:         I thank Ranking Member Grijalva and Mrs. Torres and       Chairman Bishop and Mr. LaMalfa for working with me to move       this important bill expeditiously through committee. I also       want to thank Congressman Chabot for his support and       partnership.        Words matter. They can cause great harm by making people       feel lesser or other, and when words are rooted in bigotry in       our Nation's laws, it signals that we, as a country, are       legitimizing and normalizing bigotry.        Unfortunately, there are still laws on the books that use       old offensive racial terms to refer to our fellow Americans.       These terms come from areas where intolerance was acceptable,       and they have no place in modern society.        For example, title 36 of this CFR still uses the term       ``Eskimo'' to refer to certain indigenous Americans from       Alaska. People in many parts of the arctic consider       ``Eskimo'' a derogatory term because it was widely used to       connote barbarism and violence. The 21st Century Respect Act       replaces ``Eskimo'' with ``Alaska Native,'' a modern term       embraced by the people that it describes.        Title 7 also includes the terms ``Oriental'' and ``Negro,''       which are terms that are disparaging today. H.R. 995 replaces       those old labels with ``Asian American'' or ``Pacific       Islander'' and ``Black'' or ``African American,''       respectively. These new terms reflect America's growth and       progress.        Now, more than ever, we need to be conscious of the signals       and messages that our  [[Page H9449]]       words and actions are sending to our fellow citizens. As       elected officials, it is our responsibility to lead by       example and make sure that our laws and institutions reflect       our best aspirations of unity and respect for Americans of       all backgrounds.        Passing the 21st Century Respect Act is a demonstration of       our commitment to ensuring that every person who pledges       allegiance to our flag feels valued and included by the       Nation it represents. I encourage all of my colleagues to       support H.R. 995.    Mr. Speaker, these are words from Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, who is  on his way.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Mrs. Demings).    Mr. Speaker, can you tell me how much time I have  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Jeffries).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
