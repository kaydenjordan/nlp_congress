 Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy  in permitting me to speak on these resolutions. This is a poll-tested  focus group effort to change the subject.   We all know that attacking facilities or not providing healthcare to  an infant is already illegal. This is a veiled attempt at distracting  from the real consequences of the Dobbs decision.   People have had their rights taken away and can no longer receive the  care they wish. When we see doctors consulting their lawyers when  patients are dying on operating tables because they are afraid of  abortion bans, voting on this resolution is an embarrassment.   It is unconscionable that when people are living in fear, even dying  because they are denied healthcare, the House is ignoring this in favor  of a political stunt.   I stand with the American public and in opposition to this  legislation.
