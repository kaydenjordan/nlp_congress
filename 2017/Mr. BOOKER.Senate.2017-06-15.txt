 Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the Police  Reporting of Information Data and Evidence Act, or PRIDE Act-- legislation I introduced on Thursday, May 25, 2017. This bill would  increase accountability and transparency for law enforcement by  requiring States to report to the Department of Justice use of force  incidents that occur between police officers and civilians. I am proud  to have introduced this important bill and I want to thank Senator  Chris Van Hollen for joining the legislation as an original cosponsor.  I also want to thank Representative Joaquin Castro for introducing a  House companion of the PRIDE Act.   Across our Nation, law enforcement officers put their lives on the  line each day to protect our communities. These individuals have  answered the call to serve, and we owe these brave men and women our  deepest respect and gratitude. As mayor of Newark, NJ, I saw firsthand  the dangers police officers face each and every day. They must make  tough, split-second decisions that have life and death consequences.  They truly have one of the toughest jobs in America.   We must provide law enforcement with the tools and resources they  need to do their jobs safely and effectively. That is why I have been a  strong advocate for robust funding for the Byrne Justice Assistance  Grant program, Bulletproof Vest Partnership program, and the Community  Oriented Policing Services Hiring program. These programs support law  enforcement in their mission and help make our communities safe.   While the vast majority of police officers serve with integrity and  perform their duties without incident, we know that there are instances  when officers engage in inappropriate uses of force. These cases are  not emblematic of law enforcement as the whole; however, these  incidents have eroded trust between law enforcement and the communities  they are sworn to protect. This is especially the case today due to the  number of incidents that are caught on video and shared on the  internet. This phenomena only exacerbates the difficult job police  officers have and fails to lend clarity to the actual number of cases  of excessive use of force that occur nationwide.   We must work to shore up that trust deficit and ensure that those who  break the law and use excessive force are held accountable and those  who rightfully uphold the law are viewed in the correct light. We must  collect more data on use of force incidents between law enforcement and  civilians. As former Federal Bureau of Investigations Director James  Comey said in an address to Georgetown University, ``Without complete  and accurate data, we are left with `ideological thunderbolts.' And  that helps spark unrest and distrust and does not help us get better.''   For those reasons, I introduced the PRIDE Act. This legislation would  require States to report to the Justice Department any incident where  use of force is used against a civilian or against a law enforcement  officer. It would mandate the collection of certain information such as  national origin, sex, race, ethnicity, age, physical disability, mental  disability, English language proficiency, housing status, and school  status of each civilian against whom law enforcement used force. It  would require officers to record the date, time, and location of the  incident and whether the jurisdiction allows for the open-carry or  concealed-carry of a firearm. It would require the officer to detail  whether the  [[Page S3552]]  civilian was armed and the type of force used and the types of weapons  used in the incident. The bill would require the officer to explain why  force was used, provide a description of any injuries sustained as a  result of the incident, detail how many officers and civilians were  involved, and provide a brief description of the circumstances  surrounding the incident.   The bill would create a grant program to help smaller law enforcement  agencies--those with 100 employees or less--comply with the provisions  of the bill. Also, it would allow those agencies to use the grant money  to create public awareness campaigns designed to gain information  regarding shootings and use of force incidents against police officers.  Lastly, the legislation would allow agencies to use the funds to  conduct use-of-force training, including deescalation and bias  training.   There is no excuse not to collect more data on use of force incidents  between law enforcement officers and civilians. Shining a spotlight on  these instances will improve police-community relations, vindicate  wrongly accused law enforcement officers, and provide lawmakers with  the information they need to devise smart and effective policy. I am  proud to have introduced the PRIDE Act, and I urge its speedy passage.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the  introduction of the bipartisan Compassionate Access, Research  Expansion, and Respect States Act, or CARERS Act. The bill would make  our Federal laws dealing with medical marijuana fairer and help ensure  that Americans have access to the care they need. I am proud to  introduce this legislation, and I want to thank Senators Rand Paul and  Kirsten Gillibrand for working with me on this bill. I also want to  thank Senators Lisa Murkowski, Al Franken, and Mike Lee for joining the  [[Page S3557]]  CARERS Act as original cosponsors and Representatives Steve Cohen and  Don Young for introducing a House companion bill.   Right now, regardless of whether you are in a State that has  legalized medical marijuana, it is illegal under Federal law. This  inconsistency puts growers, distributors, and patients at great risk of  Federal prosecution even though they are in compliance with State law.   In 2013, the Department of Justice issued guidance to Federal  prosecutors to refrain from prosecuting individuals that use, purchase,  or sell marijuana in States where it is legal as long as a State  regulatory framework exists that maintains certain standards, such as a  ban on sales to minors. As a result of this guidance, more and more  States have taken steps to legalize medical marijuana.   Sadly, despite this guidance, the inability of the Federal Government  to be aligned with States regarding the legality of medical marijuana  has resulted in confusion and uncertainty for State lawmakers and the  public about what the law requires. This lack of clarity is only part  of the problem. Individual users of medical marijuana in States with  legalized medical marijuana continue to be targeted by the Drug  Enforcement Agency.   And now, more than ever, I am especially concerned with Attorney  General Jeff Sessions as our Nation's top law enforcement officer. His  radical stance on marijuana is way out of the mainstream, and he has  taken steps to reinvigorate the failed War on Drugs. Recently, he wrote  a letter to Senate and House leadership asking them not to renew an  appropriations rider that prevents the Justice Department from spending  money on cases that involve individuals who are in compliance with  State medical marijuana laws. He said, ``I believe it would be unwise  for Congress to restrict the discretion of the Department to fund  particular prosecutions, particularly in the midst of an historic drug  epidemic and potentially long-term uptick in violent crime.'' Contrary  to Attorney General Sessions' views, this is not a problem we can jail  ourselves out of.   Individuals who use medical marijuana in States where it is legal  should not fear prosecution simply based on prosecutorial discretion.  It is time for Congress to act.   Today, I reintroduced the CARERS Act. First, and most importantly,  the bill would end the Federal prohibition of medical marijuana.  Millions of Americans need to gain access to the medicine that works  best for them. The Federal Government's current stance on medical  marijuana has only created confusion and uncertainty. This bill would  prohibit the Federal Government from prosecuting persons who are in  compliance with State medical marijuana laws and let people gain access  to the care they need.   The bill would also allow States to import cannabidiol, commonly  called CBD for short. CBD is an oil substance made from a marijuana  plant that contains virtually no THC--meaning you experience no high  from the drug. CBD is the medicine so many children need--along with  thousands of other individuals with Dravet syndrome--to control  seizures. We must make this important drug more available so people can  access the medication they need.   The bill would promote research. A large problem for our Nation is  that not enough research exists on the impact of medical marijuana. We  know there are legitimate medical uses of the drug, but we can learn  much more. We need to allow experts to access the drug to conduct tests  and clinical trials to fully understand the effects of the drug and how  it can best be utilized. This will only benefit the doctors that  prescribe it, the lawmakers that regulate it, and the people that need  it.   Finally, the bill would allow VA doctors to recommend medical  marijuana to veterans in States that have legalized medical marijuana.  Many men and women in uniform who have bravely served our Nation come  home with invisible wounds of war, and they deserve the best care  available. This means allowing them access to the medicine they need to  heal or control their condition. Those who have served our Nation  deserve to be served by us, and that means receiving the best care  available.   The CARERS Act was the first medical marijuana bill introduced in the  Senate. Unfortunately, we did not pass it in the last Congress, but I  am hopeful that in the 115th Congress we can get this bill across the  finish line and send it to the President's desk for signature. I,  again, want to thank my colleagues who worked with me on this bill, and  I urge its speedy passage.                                  ______                                         By Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Wyden, Mrs. Murray,          Mr. Sanders, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Bennet, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr.          Booker, Mr. Brown, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Carper, Mr.          Casey, Mr. Coons, Ms. Cortez Masto, Ms. Duckworth, Mrs.          Feinstein, Mr. Franken, Ms. Harris, Ms. Hassan, Mr. Heinrich,          Ms. Hirono, Mr. Kaine, Mr. King, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Leahy, Mr.          Markey, Mr. Merkley, Mr. Murphy, Mr. Nelson, Mr. Peters, Mr.          Reed, Mr. Schatz, Mrs. Shaheen, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Udall, Mr.          Van Hollen, Ms. Warren, and Mr. Whitehouse):   S. 1376.
