 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman and both my  colleagues, though I respectfully disagree that this Congress has  placed any priority on helping get people out of poverty. Indeed, when  it comes to poverty in America, this Congress has largely been silent.  I think the Congress itself is impoverished when it comes to ideas  about how to lift people up into the middle class.   We talk here so much about the middle class, and appropriately so,  but there are millions of people out there who are struggling to just  climb up that first or second rung of the economic ladder and work  themselves into the middle class, and this Congress is doing little,  constructively, to assist them.   The need for real and meaningful change is particularly evident in my  home State of Texas, where the State legislature has been so incredibly  indifferent to this problem. There, one out of every four children is  below the poverty level, and over one-third of all Texans live in the  shadow of poverty, meaning that their income is less than twice the  poverty threshold. The Corporation for Enterprise Development ranked  Texas near the bottom among all States on key measures related to  financial security.   Now, here is what today's bipartisan bill does to respond to that,  and it is really a story of the number one.   Of the several Republican proposals that were originally advanced by  now-Speaker Paul Ryan two years ago, some introduced by Republican  colleagues and some containing good ideas, this is the one last bill  standing.   With the notable exception of a budget that is devastating to  opportunities for poor Americans, this is the one and only bill on  Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, previously known as welfare,  that Republicans will even permit us to discuss on the floor of this  House.   This one very modest bill does not add one new dollar to address the  challenges that those who want to rise from welfare to work need. It  simply segregates $100 million from an existing fund for one year.   Now, get this: the fund from which they are segregating the $100  million from, Donald Trump is seeking to abolish the entire fund so  that no moneys for this proposal will be available after one year.   This bill gives the States no new flexibility, and no new authority.  It does not authorize them to do anything that they cannot do today.  Indeed, some States--and I think my colleague from Illinois referenced  one of these--are already finding ways to, in appropriate situations,  subsidize employment.   What this bill does is to say that on this particular $100 million  fund, as long as it lasts, until President Trump eliminates it  entirely, that the States must use the money in a particular way. In  other words, it seeks to restrict the States who receive these moneys  to require them to use it for one particular way to assist those who  are in poverty.   It is also significant that the Trump budget cuts are so far-reaching  in trying to undermine efforts to raise people out of poverty, and for  those who are not able-bodied, to provide them the support that they  need. This bill deals with a little less than one-half of one percent  of the Trump budget cuts.   I believe, sincerely, that we need a better approach, that we have  ideas on both sides of the aisle that are being blocked by a  determination to not address root causes of poverty.   First, we should support initiatives that strike at the early seeds  of poverty, like the Home Visiting Program that will expire in a mere  three months, which helps to improve opportunities for at-risk children  and helps their parents be the parents they want to be; and certainly,  early childhood education is a key part of that.   Second, we should increase efforts to help people gain the skills  they need to secure jobs through which they can support their families  at a living wage, and that is the challenge here. Sure, some employers  will love to have taxpayers subsidize their workforce, pay part of the  wages that they would otherwise have to pay, and sometimes this is a  valuable support, particularly for people that are reentering our  society after incarceration and other groups of particularly hard-to- place employees. But for many folks, the big question is, when the  subsidy ends, when the taxpayer stops paying, will there be a job  there? Is there a job ladder that will allow that person to work  themselves up, or are they essentially participating in minimum wage  employment that will not support their family and will not provide them  a future?   There are in-demand skills-training programs that do work and do  offer an alternative, but they are not free. They take an investment.  An example is Project QUEST in San Antonio.    Mr. Chairman, Project QUEST has an 86 percent job  placement rate for its graduates, who boost their incomes, on average,  from $10,000 a year before entering the program to $40,000 a year.   I know there are similar programs in other parts of the country that  do the same. They are not subsidized employment, but they are working  with poor people to get the skills that they need for an in-demand job  and working with local employers to find out what types of jobs are  most needed. In many parts of America, our economy is being held back  by a lack of qualified workers.   Then, one of the areas that is so important to all parents, but  particularly to single moms that are in poverty, is childcare.  President Trump is proposing not one, but three cuts to childcare,  cutting out hundreds of millions of dollars of support to childcare,  which stands in the way of many individuals from working their way out  of poverty.   I believe that we need to be working together to try to find genuine  solutions and that working together is not just here in this House, in  Congress, because the big problem here is that, when we voted in 1996-- and I voted for it, for moving from welfare to work--we expected the  States to be partners in that effort. Today, as much as we talk about  work and getting from welfare to work, exactly 8 cents out of every  dollar being spent on the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families  program--8 cents--goes to work supports. And not very much more than  that goes to childcare, and President Trump, of course, wants to reduce  that.   It is only by having a comprehensive program that is really focused  on the roots of poverty and assisting those  [[Page H5117]]  who would help themselves that the promise of that welfare law can  become effective.   Unfortunately, while we did change fundamentally and end welfare as  we know it, it became welfare for Republican Governors who wanted to  use these Federal moneys not to assist the poor, but to assist their  States fill various budget gaps. We have a great example of where block  grants fail. I hope we can find ways to succeed.                                time  0930
