 Mr. President, reserving the right to object--    Mr. President, I don't think the answer to the question  is going to be a surprise to my friend from Massachusetts. I will only  say this, and I will try to do it briefly. I have been amazed, over the  last 1\1/2\ years and even longer, at the intense, overblown rhetoric  about this issue of net neutrality and the hyperbole we have heard on  the floor of the Senate and elsewhere.   About 1\1/2\ years ago, the FCC voted on the Restoring Internet  Freedom Order. It went into effect. It repealed what most of us  considered a heavyhanded approach based on a law that took effect back  in 1934.   When the FCC implemented this new restoring internet freedom order  back a year and a half ago, I was just astounded by what was being said  by my friends on the left. One Senator warned that this was practically  the end of Netflix, YouTube, and Amazon. Another cautioned:         They want to get rid of the Federal Communications       Commission's net neutrality rules so that . . . Internet       Service Providers can indiscriminately charge more for       internet fast lanes, slow down websites, block websites, make       it harder and maybe even impossible for inventors,       entrepreneurs.    One tweet from my friends on the Democratic side said: ``If we don't  save net neutrality, you'll get the internet one word at a time.'' That  quote got three Pinocchios from even the Washington Post.   These things never happened. As a matter of fact, people on the other  side of the issue who actually have taken the position of the Senator  from Massachusetts have admitted that ISPs are delivering on consumers'  expectations. They are not throttling websites.   As a matter of fact, here is what has happened since the FCC order  went into effect a year and a half ago: Broadband providers large and  small have deployed fiber networks to 5.9 million new homes--the  largest number ever recorded. More Americans are connected at higher  speeds than ever before. Capital expenditures have rebounded from the  slump they suffered when the internet was subjected to title II.   This should surprise no one because the internet has thrived during  Democratic and Republican administrations and during Democratic  majorities on the FCC and Republican majorities on the FCC when we have  taken the light-touch regulatory approach.   The issue seems to be title II regulation of rates. I would simply  say to my brothers and sisters on the other side of the aisle that we  can pass a law tomorrow afternoon providing Americans with all the  protection they want from blocking, throttling, and preventing paid  prioritization. What we will not do and what this President will not  sign is legislation authorizing the Federal Government to set internet  rates in the old 1934 Bell System of title II regulations. For that  reason, I do object.
