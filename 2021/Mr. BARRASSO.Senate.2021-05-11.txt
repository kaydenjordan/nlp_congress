 Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the 100th  anniversary of the incorporation of Mills, WY.   On Saturday, June 12, 2021, the town of Mills will honor this  milestone with a 100th Anniversary Summer Fest Celebration. The event  will host a parade, concerts, and other festivities throughout the day.  It is an excellent opportunity for the people of Natrona County and  Wyoming to gather and commend the strong, lasting character of this  community.   Mills was established in May of 1921 at a location near the Fort  Caspar site along the northern banks of the North Platte River. Many  pioneers traversed this area along the Oregon Trail before oil was  discovered in the Salt Creek Field. In 1919, with the growth of the oil  and gas industry, brothers James, William, and Thomas Mills and their  Mills Construction Company purchased a homestead owned by Charles M.  Hawks. Company employees and their families began to settle in the  surrounding land. By 1921, over 500 people lived in the quickly  developing area. A need for local organization resulted in Mills'  incorporation as a town, becoming the third in Natrona County.   The story of Mills is a microcosm of the story of Natrona County and  Central Wyoming. The town has navigated through the booms and busts of  the oil industry throughout its century and continues to navigate its  unique place across the river from Casper. Industry has always played a  large role in the development of the community. From its beginnings  with the Mills Construction Company, Mills now hosts a wide range of  manufacturing, fabrication, heavy machinery, and oil and gas  businesses. Yet, Mills still maintains its  [[Page S2443]]  quaint charm with Oregon Trail historic sites, river recreational  opportunities, and local watering holes.   Mills held its first election on May 10, 1921. The first mayor was  George E. Boyle, who was elected alongside new Councilmen Fred Hunter,  Fred Shackleford, G.W. Lindsley, and Michael Kennedy. A century later,  Mills is served by Mayor Seth Coleman with Councilmembers James  Hollander, Darla Ives, Sara McCarthy, and Brad Neumiller. They continue  their tradition of public service and stewardship.   From its incorporation as a town with a population of 500, Mills  entered 1990 with over 1,500 residents. Today it boasts a population of  over 4,000 people and is one of the fastest growing communities in  Wyoming. On August 4, 2020, Governor Mark Gordon signed a proclamation  declaring Mills a ``First-Class City.'' This is another milestone to  add to the summer celebration.   It is my honor to commemorate this historic milestone for the city of  Mills. Their centennial celebration is a tribute to generations of  determination and community. Bobbi joins me and everyone in Wyoming in  our appreciation of everything the people of Mills have contributed to  our great State and Nation. We extend our congratulations as we look  forward to the next 100 years.                            ____________________
