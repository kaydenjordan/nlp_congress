 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the  supplemental funding for Hurricane Harvey relief. H. Res. 502 totals  $7.85 billion in emergency funding, including $7.4 billion for FEMA's  Disaster Relief Fund. This supplemental funding is a necessary first  step toward assisting our communities in immediate need.   However, rebuilding and recovering from the devastation of Hurricane  Harvey will continue to require further resources and really hard work.  I will continue to work closely alongside my colleagues in the Texas  delegation, the Louisiana delegation, and the Appropriations Committee  to meet the needs of our neighbors in the southeastern part of our  State.   My thoughts and prayers are with all those affected by this  devastating storm.   Colleagues, I encourage each and every one of you to vote for this.  H. Res. 502 is focused on addressing the immediate needs of those  affected by Hurricane Harvey. It sends them a powerful message: that we  are here and we are here for them, and we will be working hard for them  throughout this recovery.   Just this morning, I saw another newsman standing waist-deep in water  in Houston as it continues to recede. Let's cast our vote properly and  start the recovery for the southeastern part of Texas and the western  part of Louisiana.    Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Mr. Frelinghuysen  and Mrs. Lowey for all the work that we did together on this bill. The  whole bill is a good bill. It deserves this House's support.   But I am here to present the Department of Homeland Security  Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2018, which, in turn, deserves your  support. This is a good bill that is essentially for the security of  our Nation. It not only funds vital security and law enforcement  capabilities, but it also restores funding for critical Federal  assistance grant programs and disaster relief.   As importantly, it provides the oversight essential to ensure the  Department's actions are in accordance with congressional intent.   Let's look at it. For CBP, $1.6 billion for 74 miles of border wall  construction that was previously included in the Make America Secure  Appropriations Act that was passed in July.   In addition to the funding for the wall construction, this bill will  fund additional border patrol agents and virtually all of the  technology, infrastructure, and assets needed for the security of our  borders.   For ICE, this bill funds 44,000 detention beds; 10,000 more beds than  were funded in 2016; almost 4,700 more than the number funded in 2017.   This bill will strengthen ICE's ability to enforce immigration laws  and conduct investigations into human trafficking, child exploitation,  and transnational crime.   For TSA, although the bill does not include the proposed increase in  aviation security fees, it fully funds required transportation security  screeners.   For the Coast Guard, all major acquisition programs are funded at the  required level: the polar icebreaker, the offshore patrol cutter, and  the fast response cutter.   For FEMA, the bill fully funds the request for disaster assistance.  It restores nearly $940 million to the Federal assistance for first  responder grants and education training exercises. Additionally, the  bill fully funds all cybersecurity acquisition requirements at the  requested levels, fully funds the Secret Service, and fully funds E- Verify.   In conclusion, my colleagues, this bill strengthens the security of  our Nation. It also sends a powerful message that if you break our  Nation's laws and cross the border illegally, you will suffer the  consequences: apprehension and a guaranteed stay in detention.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger), my colleague, for the purpose of a  colloquy.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding,  and I thank him for bringing up this issue.   Last week, FEMA was forced to restrict obligations for past disasters  to prioritize funding for immediate lifesaving efforts in response to  Hurricane Harvey.   The supplemental funding bill that passed the House this morning will  enable FEMA to lift these restrictions and resume funding for long-term  recovery efforts, such as those in North Carolina and other parts of  our Nation.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now  rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Collins of Georgia) having assumed the chair, Mr. Marshall, Acting  Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union,  reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill  (H.R. 3354) making appropriations for the Department of the Interior,  environment, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September  30, 2018, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, pursuant to section 3 of House  Resolution 500, as the designee of Chairman Frelinghuysen, I rise to  offer en bloc No. 3 as part of the consideration of Division E of H.R.  3354.

Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman from  California, and I thank the manager of this bill, Judge Carter from  Texas, for including my amendment in the en bloc amendment. Let me  explain it very simply.   My amendment would help facilitate the Secretary of Homeland Security  from being limited in their discretion for the utilization and  enhancement of the use of Federal air marshals on inbound international  flights considered to be high risk by the Department of Homeland  Security.   My amendment ensures that the Federal Air Marshal Service effectively  uses its funds to deploy personnel on inbound flights that are  considered high risk by the Department of Homeland Security and that  there is no limit on that ability.   I believe that Federal air marshals are the last line of defense in  some instances in defending the cockpit and aircraft cabin against  terrorist attacks. We know that airlines, airplanes, aviation still  remains a very attractive target, as evidenced over the years, by  terrorists.   As the former chairwoman of the Transportation Security Committee, I  have worked over the years and sponsored legislation to ensure we had  enough air marshals who receive all the requisite training to  effectively secure aircraft.   Let me say that all of our individuals are important to the  Department of Homeland Security. I ask my colleagues to support this  amendment. I thank my colleagues for putting it in the en bloc, and I  ask for its support.   Mr. Chair, let me thank Subcommittee Chairman Carter and Ranking  Member Roybal-Allard for their leadership on this important legislation  and for the opportunity to explain my amendment.   Thank you for this opportunity to explain my amendment, which simply  prohibits any funds in the Homeland Appropriations Act from being used  to limit the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security to  enhance the use of Federal air marshals on inbound international  flights considered to be high risk by the Department of Homeland  Security.   My amendment ensures that the Federal Air Marshal Service effectively  uses its funds to deploy personnel on inbound flights that are  considered high risk by the Department of Homeland Security and that  there is no limitation on that ability.   I believe that Federal Air Marshals are the last line of defense in  defending the cockpit and aircraft cabin against terrorist attack.   As the former Chair and a current member of Homeland Security  Transportation Security Subcommittee, I have worked over the years and  sponsored legislation to ensure that we have enough air marshals and  that they receive all the requisite training to effectively secure  aircraft.   To best protect our Nation from terroristic threat it is of extreme  importance that we use the necessary funds to support the use of  Federal Air Marshalls on inbound international flights.   Make no mistake--the threat to our aviation system from aircraft  inbound to the United States from foreign airports is serious and  dangerous.   Following the capture and killing of Osama Bin Laden, intelligence  was gathered that suggests that Al Qaeda still has an interest in  attacking the U.S., likely through transportation modes.   This fact, coupled with the numerous suspicious activities even on  domestic aircraft where passengers were attempting to open cabin doors  in flight or otherwise disrupt flights, is of concern.   While my amendment deals with the threat on inbound aircraft to the  U.S., its ultimate impact will be to ensure that air marshals are  assigned to the highest-risk flights.   It simply prohibits funds from being used to limit the discretion  Secretary of Homeland Security to enhance air marshal coverage on  inbound high-risk flights in accordance with the Department's risk  model.   The terroristic threats are ever changing and we must allow the  Secretary of Homeland Security to make the necessary adjustments to  protect the American people.   This is not a funding issue or people issue, rather a security issue  and this amendment is budget neutral.   Let me thank those who at the Department of Homeland Security and its  component agencies for their service, including my friends at the  Transportation Security Administration.   Let me thank all Federal Air Marshals for their service to our  nation.   I ask my colleagues to support Jackson Lee Amendment No. 89.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from California (Mrs. Torres).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Donovan).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Donovan).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.   Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered  by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Carter).   The en bloc amendments were agreed to.     Amendment No. 63 Offered by Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 63  printed in part B of House Report 115-295.   Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Chairman, I have an  amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 635, line 9, after the first dollar amount, insert       ``(reduced by $1,000,000) (increased by $1,000,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 500, the gentlewoman  from New Mexico (Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham) and a Member opposed each  will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New Mexico.   Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Chair, my amendment  prioritizes funding to study the treatment of detainees and the  conditions of private immigration detention centers.   ICE is increasing apprehensions and putting immigrant communities at  [[Page H7075]]  higher risk of apprehension, detention, and deportation. At the same  time, the Trump administration has lowered detention standards when  signing contracts with private facilities. This has led to the highest  number of deaths in ICE custody since 2011.   We have seen a complete disregard for civil and constitutional rights  of detainees, many of whom are torn from their families without basic  due process protections. These facilities are not holding prisoners.  They are holding asylum seekers who risked everything to start a better  life. They are holding hardworking community members. They are holding  family members: mothers, fathers, and children.   Information regarding detention facilities is already inconsistent,  outdated, and, frankly, overall lacking in transparency. Medical  neglect, poor treatment by guards, sexual abuse, and even in-custody  deaths plague numerous facilities across the country. Even worse,  repeat offending private prison companies continue to receive lucrative  contracts for additional facilities.   We have to have an objective and transparent review of these private  immigration detention centers. I urge my colleagues to join me in  voting ``yes'' for my amendment to ensure that detainees are treated  humanely and provided basic due process protections.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham).   The amendment was agreed to.                   Amendment No. 66 Offered by Ms. Jayapal    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 66  printed in part B of House Report 115-295.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        September 6, 2017, on page H7075, the following appeared:  AMENDMENT NO. 63 OFFERED BY MS. JAYAPAL The Acting CHAIR. It is  now in order to consider amendment No. 63 printed in part B of  House Report 115-295.      The online version has been corrected to read: AMENDMENT NO. 66  OFFERED BY MS. JAYAPAL The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to  consider amendment No. 66 printed in part B of House Report 115- 295.    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, the proposal to cut ICE funding  for enforcement of immigration laws and removal of those here illegally  will endanger the safety of the American people and convey to bad  actors that the rule of law no longer exists in the United States,  leading to increased border crossings and even more illegal aliens in  the United States.   Cutting funding for beds will lead to the release of criminal and  other removable aliens into communities across the country and weaken  the United States border security. I ask you to join me in opposing  this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.  [[Page H7076]]    The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal).   The amendment was rejected.                 Amendment No. 70 Offered by Mr. Fitzpatrick    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 70  printed in part B of House Report 115-295.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.  [[Page H7077]]         Mr. Chairman, my good friend from Texas, I know  his heart is in the right place, but I have real concerns about the  cost and the utilization of body cameras.   We know that you have to preserve evidence. And once you have opened  this door that there are expected to be body cameras on officers, then  not only do you have to preserve every piece of film or production that  comes out of that camera as a potential piece of evidence, and if you  take that and multiply it times the number of incidents that are going  to occur as we go through a year, and then multiply that times however  many years this agency lasts, you are talking about storing millions of  gigs or whatever they are that have to be preserved to preserve  potential evidence that could be used both by the defense and the  prosecution.   And then in a case where there isn't a body camera, it is going to be  a jury argument that can be very effectively made by the defense about  why isn't there a body camera where there is a policy of having body  cameras?                                time  0000    But the real issue that I have with this is the cost of preserving  the record continuously by law enforcement. I think people haven't  thought this out to what kind of additional cost this is going to be as  you spread this out over the lifetime of an agency and all the agents  that work for that agency.   I know the reasons why people think body cameras are a good idea, and  they fit that. But does it justify the storage cost that is going to be  required to preserve the evidence that is manufactured by the body  camera?   That is the question I think we ought to consider, and that is the  reason I oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I understand what my colleague  wants: the 45,000 agents that could potentially be acquiring these  cameras. Because the first thing you are going to have the first time  you go before a judge and you use one of these body cameras in one  case, the defense is going to be wanting to know why you are not using  them in every case. They are going to be setting up a defense of the  fact that the officers failed to meet their duty to preserve the  record.   So you take just 45,000 and 1 year of contacts. Granted, his $10  million isn't going to get all of those guys cameras, but you started  down the road to putting a camera on 45,000 agents. And then you have  to store everything they produce of any contact that they have for the  potential use in evidence by one or the other side in a legal  proceeding. That is what concerns me.   Joe Kelly is a good marine and a good Secretary, and I am sorry he is  not with us anymore. But the reality is, if you sat in the courtroom  and watched the preservation of evidence, you know this has the  potential, both for law enforcement and for us, to be a mushroom that  explodes in nuclear proportions. That is the only reason I raise this  issue.   I know the issues that they are trying to address, and they need to  be addressed. I am concerned about the fact that once you start down  that road, you are constitutionally required to preserve evidence, and  that will be costly. I will leave that up to our colleagues as to how  they feel about that.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I only want to lay out that there  is a potential very large cost once this door is opened. That is my  opposition to this.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Castro).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment offered by Ms. Roybal-Allard.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chair, the proposal to cut ICE funding for  enforcement of immigration laws and removal of those here illegally  will not only endanger the safety of the American people, it will also  convey to bad actors that the rule of law no longer exists in the  United States, leading to increased border crossings and a growing  overall illegal alien population.   Cutting funding for beds will lead to the release of criminal and  other removable aliens into communities across the country and weaken  the United States border security.   The hiring of additional ICE agents is needed to protect our  communities by preventing terrorism and reducing crime through the  vigorous enforcement of immigration and custom laws. Restricting this  hiring compromises ICE's law enforcement mission, jeopardizing homeland  security and public safety.   Interior immigration enforcement is indispensable to national  security and public safety. It cannot be separated from border  security. A successful border control and immigration system must be  supported by the enforcement of all pertinent laws.   Adding funds to procure another polar icebreaker, while a noble idea,  is simply not practical at this time. The Coast Guard is still in the  early stages of design and will not be ready to procure the first  icebreaker until late fiscal year 2019 at the earliest. The funds will  be unexecutable and, therefore, a waste of limited resources that we  have.   In addition, if you discuss with the border patrol about the biggest  deterrent we have, it is the threat of detention.   Mr. Chair, I ask that my colleagues join me in opposing this  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Chairman, I just want to emphasize the fact  that my amendment still leaves ICE with enough money for 30,000  detention beds. They still have the capability to address the needs in  their duties.   I also want to emphasize the fact that although the money is not  going to go out in fiscal year 2019, the request for proposal will be  in mid-fiscal year 2018; therefore, it is critical that those who will  be bidding on these contracts know that, in fact, there is money  available.   Finally, I just need to emphasize one more time the fact that we are  extremely vulnerable in the Arctic at this time. There are times, as I  said, where we have absolutely no presence whatsoever, while at the  same time, Russia has a continuous presence in that area.   Mr. Chair, it is critical that we support this amendment and get the  Coast Guard the icebreaker that they need.   The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    Mr. Chairman, I, too, agree with Ms. Roybal- Allard for the need for an icebreaker, that is not in dispute here, but  to cut the beds to the proposed 30,000 that she said, in 2017, our  number was 39,000 and change, and we have been over that this year, so  we still have a real need for these beds, and that need, as I have  stated before, is why I oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Roybal-Allard).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.   Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from California  will be postponed.               Amendment No. 75 Offered by Mr. Castro of Texas    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 75  printed in part B of House Report 115-295.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment  offered by Mr. Castro.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment  offered by Mr. Castro.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chair, I made the statement previously when  we discussed this that this could quickly escalate. We are escalating  again by 19,000 more people who would ultimately be required to have  cameras.   Once again, without getting into what I just talked about, this is  going to be a very costly item. We have something called chain of  custody on evidence. ICE agents deal with some very serious issues,  felony issues under Federal law. They have got a wide jurisdiction, one  of the widest jurisdictions of any agency, even wider than some like  the FBI.   So, once again, now that chain of custody on that camera, where that  camera information passes from hand to hand, has to be kept in addition  to the evidence so that if you are going to present it in court, you  can prove the chain of custody. You just enhanced and expanded the  amount of costs that it is going to take for an agent to go to trial.   I know this is a very popular idea all over the country, because it  has been very much supported by the media, but I really, in good faith,  believe that people have not considered the evidentiary problems they  are going to create for themselves by the presence of these cameras.                                time  0020    We will find out fairly quickly as these cameras proliferate what the  cost is going to be and what the information required is going to be by  the courts. And maybe I am overanticipating, but just now, we have gone  from $44,000; we have added another $19,000, just in our agency. Now,  multiply that times every law enforcement entity in the United States  and it becomes an astronomical expense and something we need to think  about, and think about hard.   So, for those reasons, not because I don't think it is a good idea to  have congeniality between arresting officer and defendant or being able  to prove where there is abuse. I agree with all those things.   But I think you are creating a monster evidentiarywise as you go  forward with body cameras. We tried them back in the seventies, and  they very quickly found that they were not a good idea, but I guess we  will try them again.   Anyway, for those reasons, I oppose the gentleman's amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Well, I certainly understand the example that  the gentleman gave about officers planting dope, and it certainly did  work.   I can tell you, in my 20 years on the bench, we have had cameras on  the dashboard of DPS troopers' cars for 10 years, 20 years maybe, I  don't know, maybe the whole time I was there. But I have seen at least  15 of those prove the guilt of the defendant by his actions in front of  those cameras. So it is not just to catch dirty cops; it also catches  people in criminal action.   By the way, the action of that officer was a criminal action so,  therefore, you have to preserve the evidence. My point is made by your  very argument. You have to preserve the evidence. If you lose the  evidence, you are going to lose the prosecution, and so you are going  to have to keep it secure. If it passes from one hand to the other  hand, it has to be tracked in a chain of custody.   If it is secure on the--there is going to have to be some evidence of  the security of whatever web or whatever it is that it is on, or the  cloud, that that is a secure cloud so that someone can't have messed  with the evidence while it is on the cloud. All of that is potential  argument against conviction in a criminal case, and those ICE agents  deal with serious criminal cases.   I don't think people have thought it out. If they have, then that is  fine. Let's spend that money. But it is going to be astronomical if we  do it for every law enforcement agent in the country.   I continue my opposition, and I reserve the balance of my time.    I continue to oppose, and I yield back the  balance of my time  [[Page H7080]]    The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Castro).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chair, once again, as I said before of the  gentlewoman's amendment cutting beds, that that will weaken the United  States' border security, and the hiring of additional ICE agents is  needed to protect our communities, prevent terrorism, reduce crime  through vigorous enforcement of immigration and customs laws.   Successful border control and immigration systems must be supported  by enforcement of pertinent laws. This bill recommends $240 million for  four fast-response cutters, the same as the amount requested. The  program is on schedule and on budget, and there is no need to  accelerate the procurement of additional ships. We have been building  those on time without flaws now for 4 years at that same rate. We are  building a lot of fast-response cutters very quickly.   We have, now, a new program for the offshore patrol cutter, which the  first of the contracts have been let, and that is in the process of  being built, and we have a projection for multiple of those cutters.   Taking away from our ability to detain people who have broken the law  is not a good resource for growing a program that is already very  robust and very effective and has put online multiple fast-response  cutters.   Mr. Chair, for those reasons, I oppose this amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, even if this money should be moved  and the gentleman's amendment be approved, it wouldn't mean that any  more fast-response cutters would be built in this calendar year.   I am fairly certain that the commandant of the Coast Guard would say  that we have been very robust and very effective at producing fast- response cutters, and I believe that the detention beds is a deterrent  for those coming across the border and for those violating the law as  an important part of the defense of the borders and the people of the  United States.   Therefore, I continue to oppose the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have some concerns regarding  this amendment. However, I agree there is a gap in our Nation's  icebreaking capability, and I strongly support the Coast Guard's  icebreaking program. For that reason, I will not oppose this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment  offered by Mrs. Torres.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chair, estimating the required number of  operations and detention beds is not exact science. This reprogramming  a party is essential to be able to deal with emergent and critical  operation needs, like surges we have seen in 2014 and 2016.   Without sufficient funding for beds, ICE will be forced to release  criminal and other illegal aliens into communities across the country  and weaken the security of the United States. The proposal to restrict  ICE's ability to reprogram funding for detention beds would not only  endanger the safety of the American people, but it will also convey to  bad actors that the United States will not detain illegal aliens,  leading to increased border crossings and growing overall illegal alien  operations in the United States.   Therefore, I oppose this amendment and ask my colleagues to do the  same.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.   The Acting CHAIR.

Modification to Amendment No. 79 Offered by Mr. Carter of Texas     Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that  amendment No. 79 printed in part B of House Report 115-295, which was  adopted as part of the amendments en bloc, be modified by the  modification placed at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the modification.   The Clerk read as follows:    Modification to amendment No. 79 offered by Mr. Latta of Ohio:        Before ``dollar amount'' insert ``first''.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        September 6, 2017, on page H7082, the following appeared: The  Clerk read as follows: Before ``dollar amount'' insert ``first''.      The online version has been corrected to read: The Clerk read as  follows: Modification to amendment No. 79 offered by Mr. Latta of  Ohio: Before ``dollar amount'' insert ``first''.    ========================= END NOTE =========================      The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman  from Texas?   There was no objection.   The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is modified.                 Amendment No. 80 Offered by Mr. King of Iowa    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 80  printed in part B of House Report 115-295.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the  gentleman's amendment, and I adopt all of his arguments that he has  made.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chair, over half of the ICE detention  population is housed in privately owned and operated detention  facilities. Neither ICE nor State and local detention facilities can  provide the number of beds required to house the detained population  that we have today. Without the capacity provided by contracts with  private detention facilities, ICE will be forced to dramatically scale  back interior enforcement and, more seriously, release thousands of  dangerous criminal aliens from custody.   Eliminating private facilities will require a significant expansion  to ICE's capacity that, according to estimates, will exceed $1.3  billion and could be as much as $5 billion to $6 billion.   I also note that my colleague in the minority considers detention  standards to be of vital importance, yet the majority of the facilities  that meet the highest and most stringent detention standards are the  very same contract facilities this language would eliminate.   For these reasons, I oppose this amendment and ask for a ``no'' vote.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, once again, I oppose the  gentleman's amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, once again, I oppose the  gentleman's amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Castro).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, it seems that the minority has a  very good tag team match going here. The previous amendment would  eliminate, if it passes, all of the privately owned facilities, leaving  us with, by the gentlewoman's own statement, 3,500 beds for detainees;  whereas, our total population today ranges from 35,000 to 40,000 people  that are detained, which would mean all those people would have to be  released or placed in some kind of alternative of which the no-show for  that alternative is horrendous.   This kind of restriction makes no sense. Even though there is nobody  planning to build ICE facilities right now, to restrict the government  from a possible need, should that need arise--I remind you that in  2014, in the month of August, 78,000 children came across the border,  and an equal number or more of a child with a parent came across the  border in the Laredo sector alone.   So we have real needs that need to be met, and quite honestly, this  amendment ties the hands and everybody gets turned loose. I very much  oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, what Ms. Roybal-Allard just stated  was true, but I rise in support of this gentleman's amendment because  it is time the agencies and departments fully comply, and this  amendment attempts to achieve that effort. Therefore, I support the  gentleman's amendment.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now  rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  King of Iowa) having assumed the chair, Mr. Marshall, Acting Chair of  the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported  that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R.  3354) making appropriations for the Department of the Interior,  environment, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September  30, 2018, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
