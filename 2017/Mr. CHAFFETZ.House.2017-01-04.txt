 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 71) to provide taxpayers with an annual report disclosing  the cost and performance of Government programs and areas of  duplication among them, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 71         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Such requirements shall be carried out using amounts       otherwise authorized.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) and the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Clay) each  will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Utah?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Utah?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, this is a very good bill brought to us by  lead sponsor Mr. Walberg of Michigan who has done considerable work on  this not only at this point, but in Congresses of the past. We have  cosponsorship from a number of people on both sides of the aisle--five  members within the Oversight and Government Reform Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello).   Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, it is important the  Federal Government convey to taxpayers how it is spending their hard- earned money. That is why I rise in support of H.R. 71, the Taxpayers  Right-To-Know Act.   For Federal programs authorized to spend over $1 million, this  bipartisan bill would make more information available and accessible  online so that taxpayers may see where their money is being spent and  how the program is performing. For each Federal program meeting these  requirements, the government would need to make public several key  pieces of information that are of interest to many of my constituents,  including funding levels for the program, Federal laws that authorize  the program, regulations related to the program, the results of  performance reviews that measure the program's effectiveness, and any  overlap of the program with another Federal program.   Simply put, this bill would help alleviate waste and prevent taxpayer  dollars from being spent on unnecessary, ineffective, or duplicative  programs.   I thank Congressman Tim Walberg and Congressman Jim Cooper for their  continued leadership on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, this bill did pass the House without any objection in  the last session, and I would, once again, urge my colleagues to  support this commonsense bill.  [[Page H65]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I am thankful for the good work by Mr. Walberg and Mr. Cooper, who  also serve on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. I thank  Mr. Clay and, certainly, Mr. Cummings.   In the 114th Congress, this bill was able to pass overwhelmingly in  the House by a vote of 413-0--with no opposition. It is truly  bipartisan and bicameral. It is a good bill. I thank Senator James  Lankford of Oklahoma for his work on the Senate side, and we do hope  that it will make it swiftly through the Senate.   The Taxpayers Right-To-Know Act provides the public and Congress with  increased transparency about Federal programs, including how much they  cost and any benefits that they provide. It sounds like a good and  worthy thing to do, and it passed the previous Congress. I urge my  colleagues to vote in favor of it here in the 115th Congress, and I am  glad it is one of the first things that we are doing.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 73) to amend title 44, United States Code, to require  information on contributors to Presidential library fundraising  organizations, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 73         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Presidential Library       Donation Reform Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARIES.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Utah?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan), who has championed this effort  for quite a while. He is passionate about this, and he has poured his  heart and soul into it.   Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. I thank the chairman for yielding to me and  for his support of this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, this is very simple, bipartisan legislation that would  require organizers of Presidential libraries to disclose the identities  of donors and the amounts they give. It wouldn't limit any donations;  it would simply require disclosure. I introduced this legislation  several Congresses ago because I felt then and feel now that the public  should be made aware of possible conflicts of interest that sitting  Presidents can have or may have while raising funds for their  libraries.   First of all, I thank Ranking Member Cummings for again cosponsoring  this very important legislation and making it bipartisan. The  legislation is so bipartisan that, after the first time we passed the  bill--and it passed 392-3--it was taken over, at my request and with my  agreement, by then-Chairman Waxman, who made it his bill. We passed it  once again, and we passed it in the last Congress by a simple voice  vote, so there is a lot of support for this bill. In the Senate, it was  introduced by Mr. Carper and Mr. Coburn, when he was in the Senate. We  need to get some  [[Page H66]]  more interest over there, and I think we are going to be able to do  that in this Congress.   Mr. Speaker, we do not know who these donors to the Presidential  libraries are or what interests they may have on any pending policy  decisions that are to be made. I think that our government needs to  operate in the open, not with secrecy. This legislation will apply to  all future Presidential libraries and mandate, regardless of party,  that the names of the donors and the amounts they contribute be  disclosed. I would like to add that this legislation will apply to  President Trump's future Presidential library. This will require him to  disclose more than any other President has ever had to disclose before.  This will be an unprecedented disclosure, and it falls in line with his  stated desire to drain the swamp. Any sitting President has a great  deal of power. Funds should not be raised for a Presidential library in  his honor without some type of public disclosure.   I decided to introduce this bill after news reports surrounding a  proposed Presidential library exposed that foreign governments from the  Middle East were making very large donations. Then, in 2007, The  Washington Post reported that President Clinton's Presidential library  raised a substantial percentage of the cost of its facility with  foreign contributions. However, this is not a partisan issue. I have  introduced this and supported this legislation under both Democratic  and Republican Presidents. The Presidential Library Donation Reform Act  of 2017 would bring clarity to the process of planning and building  these Presidential libraries.   In 2013, Sunlight Foundation Policy Director Daniel Schuman endorsed  an earlier version of this bill during a hearing in front of our House  Oversight and Government Reform Committee, where he said it ``would  provide valuable information on special interests whose donations put  them in close proximity with Presidents.''   Even Richard Cohen, the very liberal columnist for The Washington  Post, once said about this bill: ``But surely it would be anything from  interesting to illustrative to just plain damning to see what names are  on that list and for what amounts.'' Our citizens have the right to  know the details of these fundraising activities.   This bill has been introduced by the Center for Media and Democracy;  the Center for Responsive Politics; the Citizens for Responsibility and  Ethics in Washington, often known as CREW; Common Cause; Public  Citizen; the Society of Professional Journalists; and many others.   USA Today wrote a very favorable editorial about this bill, and it  has been mentioned favorably in many publications across the years. I  think it is a bill that everybody on both sides of the aisle can  support, and I ask my colleagues to support this very bipartisan  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   As has been highlighted here by Mr. Clay and by me, there is good  bipartisan work that has gone on for far too long. It is time to pass  this bill. I really do appreciate the good work Mr. Duncan of Tennessee  has done and the work of Ranking Member Cummings of Maryland.   The Presidential Library Donation Reform Act of 2017 is the type of  good-government, bipartisan legislation that is perfect to be one of  the first bills to pass out of the 115th Congress. Last Congress, this  legislation passed through the committee by regular order and passed  the House of Representatives without opposition.   President Franklin Roosevelt established the first Presidential  library in 1939. Since then, every former President since Herbert  Hoover has had a library dedicated to his Presidential records. Each of  the 13 current libraries is managed and operated by the National  Archives and Records Administration at an annual cost of roughly $75  million. While these facilities are operated at taxpayer expense, the  construction of these libraries is privately financed through  donations.   As the volume of records for each President has increased over the  years, so have construction costs. For example, when it opened in 2004,  the Clinton Presidential Center, in part, cost approximately $165  million.                                time  1300    Nine years later, the George W. Bush Presidential Center, which  opened in 2013, cost about $250 million. The Chicago Tribune has  reported that President Obama's library might cost as much as $500  million.   Despite these escalating costs, there are no transparency  requirements for Presidential library fundraising organizations. Here,  transparency is important and very much needed.   This bill will require Presidential library fundraising organizations  to disclose to the National Archives contributions in excess of $200 in  any fiscal quarter in a searchable and sortable format. In turn, the  National Archives will post this data online.   This disclosure requirement would end once control of a library  facility is transferred to the National Archives. This ensures  compliance costs of this legislation are minimal for both fundraising  organizations and the National Archives.   This legislation is bipartisan. It is not intended to target any one  individual. The Presidential Library Donation Reform Act has passed the  House four times since 2002, with overwhelming support with both  Democratic and Republican majorities in place at the time.   I would like to, again, highlight and thank my colleague,  Representative Duncan. I do appreciate his efforts on this. I do hope  that the 115th Congress is the time that the Senate will see fit to  pass this bill to the President's desk.   I have no additional speakers.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge its passage.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge its passage.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 70) to amend the Federal Advisory Committee Act to increase  the transparency of Federal advisory committees, and for other  purposes.

Committee on Ways and Means,                                        House of Representatives,                                    Washington, DC, January 4, 2017.      Hon. Jason Chaffetz,      Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, House           of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Chaffetz, I am writing with respect to H.R.       70, the ``Federal Advisory Committee Act Amendments of       2017,'' which was referred to the Committee on Oversight and       Government Reform.        H.R. 70 involves issues that fall within the Rule X       jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means. As a result       of your having consulted with the Committee and in order to       expedite the House's consideration of H.R. 70, the Committee       on Ways and Means will not assert its jurisdictional claim       over this bill. However, this is conditional on our mutual       understanding and agreement that doing so will in no way       diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways       and Means with respect to the appointment of conferees or to       any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters       contained in die bill or similar legislation.        I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming       this understanding with respect to H.R. 70, and would ask       that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be       included in the Congressional Record during Floor       consideration thereof.            Sincerely,                                                       Kevin Brady,      Chairman.                                   ____               House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and                                                  Government Reform,                                   Washington, DC, January 4, 2017.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: On January 3, 2017, H.R. 70, the Federal       Advisory Committee Act Amendments of 2017, was introduced by       Rep. Wm. Lacy Clay (D-MO-1). The bill was referred primarily       to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, with an       additional referral to the Committee on Ways and Means.        I ask that you allow the Ways and Means Committee to be       discharged from further consideration of the bill so that it       may be scheduled by the Majority Leader. This discharge in no       way affects your jurisdiction over the subject matter of the       bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future       referrals. In addition, should a conference on the bill be       necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee       on Ways and Means represented on the conference committee.       Finally, I would be pleased to include this letter and any       response in the bill report filed by the Committee on       Oversight and Government Reform, as well as in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration, to       memorialize our understanding.        Thank you for your consideration of my request.            Sincerely,                                                    Jason Chaffetz,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, this is a bill that the primary sponsor is  actually the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Clay). I reserve the balance  of my time in order to allow Mr. Clay to speak first on this issue, Mr.  Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Again, I thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Clay) for his good  work on this. The Federal Advisory Committee Act Amendments of 2017 was  introduced by Representative Clay to help improve the governance and  transparency of the Federal advisory committees. Last Congress, this  bill passed through the committee by regular order and passed the  House.   Congress acknowledged the merits of using advisory committees to  acquire viewpoints from business, academic, and other interests when it  passed the original act back in 1972. While not necessarily well-known,  Federal advisory committees are small bodies of people who provide  advice, guidance, and recommendation to Federal policymakers on a wide  range of topics.   All told, in fiscal year 2015, there were roughly 1,000 Federal  advisory committees, and they held roughly 7,400 meetings at a cost to  the American taxpayers of more than $369 million. Now, this strikes me  personally as an exceptionally high number. It is a large amount of  money. We need to learn more about them, and I personally would help  champion to reduce the number of overall Federal advisory committees.   We have some 2 million Federal employees, I think, who are highly  capable, motivated, and compensated to provide this work. It is good to  get outside perspective; but, at some point, we are going to have to  look at the cost, the size, and the scope of this as well.  Nevertheless, we have to make sure that we are getting the most of  these taxpayer dollars.   Some agencies believe the FACA requirements are cumbersome and  resource intensive. We could certainly streamline this. This reduces  the ability of committees to focus on substantive issues in a timely  fashion.   Both governmental agencies and private groups say the 1972 act does  not do enough to require agencies to promote openness and transparency  with regard to Federal advisory committees. The bill works to address  these problems and bring transparency to the Federal advisory  committees and the Federal agency decisionmaking process.   The bill provides needed transparency for how committee members are  selected in several ways. First, the bill requires members to be  selected without political affiliation. The bill also authorizes agency  heads to require members to fully disclose any conflicts of interest.  You would think that that would be common sense but something that we  actually need to put into this bill and make sure that we understand  that.   In addition, the bill allows these individuals who regularly attend  and participate in committee meetings to be considered as a member,  even if they are not allowed to vote.   The bill also improves transparency of committee activities. This is  done by increasing the independence of these committees and making sure  its advice, information, and recommendations are a judgment of  the committee and not the agency.  [[Page H70]]    The bill also increases transparency by requiring each agency to make  available on their Web site the committee and its activities.   I urge our Members to support this. It has wide support and has had  it in the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. I urge its  passage. I again thank Mr. Clay, Mr. Connolly, and others who were  working on this issue.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers. I continue  to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is a good piece of legislation. I again  thank Mr. Clay and Mr. Connolly for their work on this, and I urge its  passage.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 72) to ensure the Government Accountability Office has  adequate access to information.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 72         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

[[Page H71]]           House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and             Government Reform,      Washington, DC, January 4, 2017.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: On January 3, 2017, H.R. 72, the GAO       Access and Oversight Act of 2017, was introduced by Rep. Earl       L. ``Buddy'' Carter (R-GA-1). The bill was referred primarily       to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, with an       additional referral to the Committee on Ways and Means.        I ask that you allow the Ways and Means Committee to be       discharged from further consideration of the bill so that it       may be scheduled by the Majority Leader. This discharge in no       way affects your jurisdiction over the subject matter of the       bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future       referrals. In addition, should a conference on the bill be       necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee       on Ways and Means represented on the conference committee.       Finally, I would be pleased to include this letter and any       response in the bill report filed by the Committee on       Oversight and Government Reform, as well as in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration, to       memorialize our understanding.        Thank you for your consideration of my request.            Sincerely,                                                    Jason Chaffetz,      Chairman.                                   ____                                      U.S. House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Ways and Means,                                    Washington, DC, January 4, 2017.      Hon. Jason Chaffetz,      Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Chaffetz, I am writing concerning H.R. 72,       the ``GAO Access and Oversight Act of 2017.'' This bill       amends access to the National Directory of New Hires (42       U.S.C. 653(I)) which is within the jurisdiction of the       Committee on Ways and Means. As a result of your having       consulted with me concerning the provision of the bill that       falls within our Rule X jurisdiction, I agree not to seek a       sequential referral so that the bill may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor.        The Committee on Ways and Means takes this action with the       mutual understanding that, by forgoing consideration of H.R.       72 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over the       subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and       we will be appropriately consulted and involved as the bill       or similar legislation moves forward so that we may address       any remaining issues that fall within our Rule X       jurisdiction. The Committee on Ways and Means also reserves       the right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or       similar legislation, and requests your support for such       request.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding, and would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration thereof.            Sincerely,                                                       Kevin Brady,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter), the original cosponsor of the  bill. I want to thank the gentleman for his championing this bill  through.   Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  72, the GAO Access and Oversight Act of 2017.   The GAO is one of the most important tools taxpayers and Congress  have to keep the Federal Government accountable. Without complete  information, GAO is limited in their ability to prevent waste, fraud,  abuse, and mismanagement.   This bill clarifies that GAO has access to data, such as the National  Directory of New Hires, which will better equip GAO to audit key  Federal programs on behalf of taxpayers. Every day, GAO handles the  government's most sensitive information in a responsible manner, and  GAO provides trusted recommendations for improving the Federal  Government's operations.   The Federal Government reported $137 billion in improper payments in  fiscal year 2015, the largest ever reported. Total improper payments  for the Federal Government over the past 10 years exceeds $1 trillion.  This bill will increase the effectiveness of GAO to help reduce  improper payments, dollars that could be used to better fund the  programs that ultimately serve the people. This bill takes an important  step forward by providing GAO with an additional tool to ensure GAO's  effectiveness in preventing fraud, waste, and abuse.   I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 72, the GAO Access and  Oversight Act of 2017, and its chief sponsor, Mr. Buddy Carter of  Georgia.   We have a duty to ensure that taxpayer money is spent efficiently and  effectively. One of the key ways we carry out this duty is through the  key watchdog of the government, the Government Accountability Office.  The GAO has a proven track record of excellence, and we rely heavily on  this group, thousands of professionals who pour their heart and soul  into diving deep into organizations and understanding how they  function. But as this bill states, we need some more openness and  transparency.   In the past 6 years alone, it has identified more than 200 areas of  duplication, overlap, and fragmentation. They have made recommendations  on 600 actions to make our government more effective and efficient. We  need to listen to them and understand them. We also, I would argue, Mr.  Speaker, have a duty and an obligation to give them the tools and  access that they need in order to do their jobs even better. We must  put GAO in the best position possible to rout out and deter waste,  fraud, and abuse.   Today, we have an opportunity to better arm the GAO by clarifying its  right to access data contained in the National Directory of New Hires.  This gives GAO access to the most up-to-date data to ensure Federal  program dollars go to the folks Congress intended to receive them.  Doing so, we will help GAO better investigate potential fraud and  improper payments, including those overextended disability insurance  programs. The GAO's objectives are hindered without access to the data,  and taxpayer dollars are not as well protected.   This bill has previously received overwhelming support in the House,  and it is time for us to finish the job and pass the bill to the Senate  and get it to the President's desk.   On September 16, the House approved this important bill by a vote of  404-0. The language in this bill was also included in bipartisan  legislation that was approved unanimously by the full House in the  113th Congress. Again, it is time to send this bill to the President.   I would like to thank my colleagues, and Representative Buddy Carter  in particular, for sponsoring this legislation and believing in it so  wholeheartedly. I would also like to thank Senator Ben Sasse of  Nebraska as the lead sponsor in the United States Senate.   I urge passage of this bill. I have no additional speakers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill  [[Page H72]]  (H.R. 69) to reauthorize the Office of Special Counsel, to amend title  5, United States Code, to provide modifications to authorities relating  to the Office of Special Counsel, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 69         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) and the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Clay) each  will control 20 minutes.

General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Utah?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Utah?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Blum), the lead sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   First, let me note in the last Congress this legislation passed out  of committee by regular order and passed the House on January 11, 2016.   The Office of Special Counsel is tasked with protecting Federal  employees from prohibited personnel practices, including reprisals on  whistleblowers. Whistleblowers are an indispensable part of helping  Congress identify waste, fraud, and abuse at Federal agencies.  Information provided by these brave folks can result in investigations  and legislation that changes the way we conduct ourselves in  government.   As the agency tasked with protecting whistleblowers, the OSC is vital  to make sure these individuals feel comfortable coming forward and that  they are offered protections. The agency has been busy. From 2013 to  2015, OSC's caseload increased from 4,500 cases open to more than  6,100. That increase coincided with multiple scandals within the  Veterans Administration, as Mr. Blum of Iowa has highlighted.   In fiscal year 2016, OSC projected nearly 2,500 cases from just the  VA--2,500 cases at just the Veterans Administration. This  reauthorization will ensure the OSC has adequate funding to continue  protecting whistleblowers in the VA and other agencies as well. The  majority of the OSC funding goes directly to hiring employees who work  to protect whistleblowers.                                time  1330    The bill also makes substantive improvements to current law to ensure  the OSC can carry out its mission more effectively. Those reforms cover  a few areas, ensuring agencies cooperate with the OSC, clarifying OSC's  investigative procedures and making sure Congress receives clear  information on whistleblower reprisal throughout the Federal  Government.   With this bill, the OSC has clear authority to access agency records  and to conduct its investigations. For its part, the OSC must treat  those records in the same manner of confidentiality as the agency  would, alleviating concerns about disclosure of sensitive information.   The bill also gives OSC needed flexibility to focus on claims that  deserve our attention. It will allow the agency to terminate  duplicative claims already being pursued by the Merit Systems  Protection Board and claims that  [[Page H74]]  exceed statutory timeframes. Agencies will also be required to submit  reports detailing what actions they take as a result of these OSC  investigations--something in Congress that we should be paying  attention to. This reporting provision requires agencies to admit any  failures in holding people accountable and gives Congress much-needed  transparency.   Finally, the bill codifies OSC's practice under the current special  counsel of disclosing to Congress results and statistics. Codifying  this transparency ensures the practice will continue and allow for  easier oversight of these activities.   In order to help protect the whistleblowers and reform the Federal  agencies, I would urge our colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 69.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of this bill, H.R. 69.  We have had four good champions led by Mr. Blum of Iowa in our  committee who have helped put this together: Mr. Meadows of North  Carolina, Mr. Connolly of Virginia, and Mr. Cummings, the ranking  member out of Maryland. All four have come together as original  cosponsors here in the 115th Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I urge its passage, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
