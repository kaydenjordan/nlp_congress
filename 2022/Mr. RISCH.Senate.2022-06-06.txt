 Mr. President, as a member and former chairman of  the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each month  I recognize and celebrate the American entrepreneurial spirit by  highlighting the success of a small business in my home State of Idaho.  Today, I am pleased to honor Cox's Honey as the Idaho Small Business of  the Month for June 2022.   In 1927, Orville S. Cox began managing beehives to support his small  vegetable stand on the road to Yellowstone in Shelley. Honey sales  quickly took off and Cox's Honey was born. Now in its third generation,  the Cox family continues Orville's original honey straining process to  deliver the same quality product he created nearly 100 years ago.   Today, Cox's Honey's 16 employees package over a million pounds of  raw, unfiltered clover honey each year. Their creamed honey has won  several competitions and earned national recognition for its  consistency and flavor. Cox's Honey prides itself on maintaining the  integrity of honey's healthy pollens, enzymes, and vitamins throughout  processing, ensuring they deliver only pure products to their  customers.   Cox's Honey contributes more than just a sweet treat to the community  as sponsors of local athletics, supporters of Shelley High School, and  active participants in local affairs and events. Alongside their  national customer base, the Shelley and surrounding area's support has  allowed Cox's Honey to open a new retail sales floor this month to  accommodate their growing business and expand their product line. Cox's  Honey's continued success is a testament to its dedication to a family  tradition that protects our State's bees and crops and shares one of  Idaho's longest lasting products with the Nation.   Congratulations to the Cox family and all of the employees at Cox's  Honey for being selected as the Idaho Small Business of the Month for  June 2022. Thank you for serving Idaho as small business owners and  entrepreneurs. You make our great State proud, and I look forward to  your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
