 Madam Speaker, ensuring all Americans can freely  participate in the electoral process is a bedrock of our democratic  society. Today in this country we are witnessing an attack on that  sacred right to vote, restricting voting access. We must act to restore  Federal oversight. What we do will determine the course of our  democracy for generations to come.   Our late colleague, John Lewis, shed blood for the right of all  Americans to vote. Let us honor the legacy of those who fought to  protect voting rights and pass this critical legislation.    President Biden made our choice today clear:   ``Will we choose democracy over autocracy, light over shadows,  justice over injustice?''   Like the President, I know where I stand.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for the  Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act.
