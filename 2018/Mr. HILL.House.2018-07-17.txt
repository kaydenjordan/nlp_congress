 Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 331.    Mr. Speaker, a hardy congratulations to Chairman Hensarling  and the ranking member for this exceptional package, the JOBS and  Investor Confidence Act. I support it, and I urge my colleagues to  support it as well.   This important bill includes H.R. 1585, a bill that I worked on with  my friends from Arizona, Ms. Sinema and Mr. Schweikert, and a bill also  supported and helped by Mrs. Maloney of New York. I would like to  highlight title IV.   This bill expands the accredited investor definition by recognizing  the ability to participate in a private offering should not be based  solely on an asset or an income test, but that individuals who have  the sophistication should also be able to participate.    I have spent much of my career helping small companies obtain  funding, helping them do private placements under regulation D. This  has been a long time in coming. It is a matter of basic fairness, which  will provide greater investment opportunities for more Americans and  help our businesses grow and invest their capital faster.   I encourage all my colleagues to support this good measure.
