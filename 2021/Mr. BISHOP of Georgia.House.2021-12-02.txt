 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.    This year, House Democrats worked hard and passed government funding  bills which support vital programs that create jobs, grow our economy,  and ensure our national security.   As chairman of the House Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on  Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and  Related Agencies, I want to stress that the programs in our bill touch  the lives of every single American every day.   It would ensure that USDA can continue to feed America and the world,  to help expand economic opportunity, to create jobs in rural areas, and  to fully meet the demand for farm ownership loans.   It would increase funding to address the opioid crisis and rare  cancers and resume unannounced, in-person inspections in the two  largest foreign drug manufacturing countries in the world, China and  India.   Simply put, it would provide resources to ensure that we have the  most abundant, wholesome, and safest food and medicine in the world.   It will help families that may struggle to put food on the table  through programs like SNAP and WIC.   Sadly, the bill cannot move forward because, in the past few months,  House and Senate Republicans have refused to negotiate with Democrats  on government funding.   Today, we are passing this short-term bill just to keep the  government open. In doing so, Democrats are making sure our government  continues serving the American people. We are also offering another  chance for our Republican colleagues to come to the table with  constructive proposals.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill and, more importantly, to  come together with us to provide peace of mind and certainty to our  fellow Americans by passing a full fiscal year '22 funding bill  package.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record letters in support of the bill  from the Aerospace Industries Association, the Coalition on Human  Needs, the Coalition for Health Funding, and the National Defense  Industrial Association.                                Aerospace Industries Association,                                    Arlington, VA, November 2, 2021.       Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.       Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.       Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader Schumer, Speaker Pelosi, Ranking       Member McConnell, and Ranking Member McCarthy: The United       States aerospace and defense industries are an essential       partner with the federal government in an array of efforts       vital to our economy and our national security. Each fall,       that partnership is tested when those programs are slowed       down or deferred by the use of multiple continuing       resolutions (CR) to keep the government running. On behalf of       our vital industries and our more than two million employees,       the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) strongly urges you       to reach a near-term agreement on fiscal year 2022 funding to       avoid further CRs beyond December 3, 2021.        Government watchdogs continue to document the waste and       unnecessary disruption that CRs cause to federal programs.       Multiple agencies advised the Government Accountability       Office (GAO) in a 2021 report that longer CRs ``contributed       to distortions in agencies' spending, adding to the rush to       obligate funds late in the year before they expire.'' The GAO       determined that contracting officers working under a CR must       continuously align the period of performance under their       contracts to the specific timeframe of a given CR, resulting       in many unnecessary contract modifications during the year.       Hiring of new civilian staff is also delayed, making it       harder for agencies to meet their goals. The GAO notes that       agencies apply creative workarounds in the first quarter of       each fiscal year, because they assume that appropriations       bills will not be in place by the beginning of the fiscal       year. However, these effects become far more serious, and       agency staff have fewer options, when CRs continue into the       second quarter and beyond.        The Department of Defense (DOD) is uniquely harmed under       CRs because these bills typically prohibit DOD from starting       new programs or activities or increasing any program's       production rate beyond that of the current fiscal year. Both       `new starts' and rate increases are critical for our national       defense because our defense posture and threats are always       evolving. As CRs extend to longer periods during the year,       this is an increasing problem for which DOD seldom gets       relief. DOD reported to the GAO that between FY10 and FY20,       they had requested exceptions to CR language (called       ``anomalies'') 1,258 times and had only been granted three       percent of those requests. Most of these requested relief       from the prohibition on new starts and rate increases. We       strongly believe that, should Congress produce CRs extending       into the second quarter of FY22, it should eliminate the       prohibition on new starts and production rate increases.        FY22 is the first year in a decade when discretionary       spending levels have not been fixed in statute by the Budget       Control Act. AIA has long argued that statutory caps are not       needed because Congress and the administration are able to       assess and address the needs of the nation more effectively,       and with greater oversight, through the annual appropriations       process. Last year, Congress enacted all 12 full-year       appropriations bills by December 27. If Congress fails to       once again enact full-year appropriations bills, or continues       running the government into 2022 under continuing       resolutions, it will send the wrong signal to the       government's partners, like those in our industry. We count       on stable, reliable and adequate funding to support the       critical capabilities that we provide for all Americans.        Like other industries, COVID-19 took a serious toll on our       workforce and the thousands of small- and medium-sized       businesses along the supply chain that are at the heart of       the aerospace and defense industries. More than ever,       businesses across all industries need predictability and       consistency.        We again ask that you ensure that all government programs       receive full Fiscal Year 2022 funding on or before December       3, 2021.            Sincerely,                                                   Eric Fanning,                                                  President and CEO,                                  Aerospace Industries Association.  [[Page H6877]]                                       Coalition on Human Needs,                                  Washington, DC, November 15, 2021.      Hon. Rosa DeLauro,      Chairwoman, House Committee on Appropriations, Washington,           DC.        Dear Chairwoman DeLauro: On behalf of the Coalition on       Human Needs, I am writing to strongly urge you to do       everything in your power to enact omnibus FY 2022       appropriations legislation including all 12 subcommittee       bills. Our nation badly needs the increased funding provided       in the House Appropriations Committee bills. We face many       increased needs, a great many exacerbated by the pandemic and       its economic dislocations. For more than a decade, funding       levels for vital human needs programs have shrunk, especially       taking inflation into account. If Congress fails to enact       omnibus appropriations legislation and instead defaults to a       long-term continuing resolution (CR) with flat funding, we       will seriously damage our capacity to respond to the multiple       public health and economic crises we face. As a member of the       House Committee on Appropriations, you have a key role to       play in working for enactment of an omnibus, not a long-term       CR.        Members of the Coalition on Human Needs, including human       service provider organizations, faith groups, labor, civil       rights, policy experts and other advocates concerned with       meeting the needs of people with low incomes,       enthusiastically welcomed the funding levels provided in the       Biden FY 2022 budget and the House and Senate Appropriations       Committees. We have tracked nearly 200 human needs programs       over the past decade. Between FYs 2010 and 2020, we found       that two-thirds of these programs, covering health care,       housing, nutrition, social services, education, training, and       more, had lost ground, taking inflation into account. In the       past year, we have begun to rebuild. But the needs are also       growing.        We now face rising prices affecting necessities including       utilities, food, and rent. Flat funding from a prolonged CR       would fail our people by not providing needed increases in       programs such as the Low Income Home Energy Assistance       Program (LIHEAP). The House increases LIHEAP by $125 million;       the Senate bill increases funding by $175 million. Both these       increases are too modest when taking into account that       natural gas heating costs are projected to rise by 30 percent       this winter and heating oil is expected to rise by 43       percent. Nutrition programs will also need funding increases       because of rising food prices. The House has provided $1.4       billion for Senior Nutrition programs, an increase of $436       million above the FY 2021 enacted level. Responding to the       acute shortage of affordable housing, the House bill would       expand rental assistance to 125,000 additional households.       These increases are vitally needed. Flat funding in all these       areas would be simply unacceptable.        We have for some time faced a substance use crisis, and are       projected to reach 100,000 deaths from opioid overdoses by       the end of this year, up from about 93,000 in 2020. The House       funding level for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health       Services Administration (SAMHSA) is $9.16 billion, $3 billion       more than current year funding. Without those additional       funds, we will not be able to cope with the continuing       increases in opioid addiction.        The pandemic has increased mental health problems. The       proposed SAMHSA funding levels allow us to respond more       adequately. In particular, House funding for various       children's mental health programs increase by $118.5 million       over current year levels. This is a vital turn-around after       years of erosion. From FYs 2010 to 2020, Children's Mental       Health Services declined by 14 percent, including inflation.       We must not return to flat funding when the pandemic has       adversely affected the mental health of millions of children       and adults.        Over the past decade, we allowed our public health capacity       to diminish, and as a consequence we were not ready to cope       with COVID-19. The House Labor-HHS-Education appropriations       bill increases the Centers for Disease Control about $2.7       billion over the current year, allowing for the agency to       rebuild so that it can more effectively respond to COVID-19       and future health threats.        We know our economy is hampered by a mismatch between jobs       available and people with the skills to fill those positions.       FY 2022 appropriations proposals include increases in       Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act programs (WIOA),       YouthBuild, Registered Apprenticeships, and Reintegration of       Ex-Offender programs, as well as expansion of community       college training programs. These will lead to jobs with       higher pay and broadly shared economic growth. These       increases are needed to overcome a ten-year 17 percent       reduction in WIOA programs and to move us forward.        There are too many important programs to list here. But we       do wish to underscore that children have experienced many       hardships during the pandemic, including unprecedented losses       in education. The historic increases proposed in Title I K-12       education for students with low incomes and in special       education funding are urgently needed to help children       overcome the educational setbacks they have experienced.       Title I spending rises by at least $16.6 billion over FY       2021, and there will be $341 more per student for more than       7.6 million students with disabilities. The FY 2022       appropriations bills include many important funding increases       to help families care for their children. In addition to the       mental health, housing, and education funding already       mentioned here, there are badly needed increases in child       care, Head Start, early learning programs, and child abuse       prevention and treatment programs. There are also urgently       needed increases in funds to care for unaccompanied immigrant       children.        The nation's recovery depends on strengthening a host of       domestic programs that have been allowed to shrink for years,       not just to get to where they had been before, but to respond       to needs far greater because of the pandemic and its global       economic dislocations. A long-term continuing resolution       would be a severe failure to address these needs. We strongly       urge you to enact omnibus appropriations legislation       including all twelve bills as soon as possible.            Sincerely,                                                 Deborah Weinstein,      Executive Director.                                   ____                                                  November 19, 2021.      Hon. Rosa DeLauro,      Chair, Committee on Appropriations,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Kay Granger,      Ranking Member, Committee on Appropriations,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Patrick Leahy,      Chairman, Committee on Appropriations,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Richard Shelby,      Vice Chairman, Committee on Appropriations,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Chair DeLauro, Chairman Leahy, Ranking Member Granger,       and Vice Chairman Shelby: On behalf of the Campaign to invest       in American's Workforce, the Coalition for Health Funding,       the Coalition on Human Needs, and the Committee for Education       Funding and our members, we urge you to pass the fiscal year       (FY) 2022 Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill as soon as       possible. The bill passed by the House this summer and the       bill proposed by the Senate Appropriations Committee this       fall provide vital increased funding for the programs and       services that have a profound impact on health and well-      being, child development, educational and skills attainment,       employment, and productivity. Failing to enact the FY 2022       bill and relying on continuing resolutions (CRs) would be a       grave missed opportunity to improve the lives of all       Americans.        The use of extended CRs creates disruption and dysfunction,       and injects fiscal uncertainty into an already uncertain       environment for the agencies that support the nation's public       health, education, job training, social services, and much       more. The reliance on CRs that extend far into the new fiscal       year that has become commonplace in recent years limits       Congress's ability to exercise its oversight authority and       make necessary adjustments to funding levels to meet new       demands.        While short-term CRs are challenging enough, the       possibility of a year-long CR could be catastrophic as our       nation continues to struggle to return to normalcy amidst the       COVID-19 pandemic. Below are some examples highlighting the       challenges that a year-long continuing resolution poses to       critical programs funded by the Labor-HHS-Education       appropriations bill:        Last year, the nation's overdose rate increased by a       staggering 30 percent with 90,000 deaths nationwide--a rate       of increase not seen in three decades and it is now reported       that drug overdose deaths reached 100,000 between April 2020       and April 2021, a grim record. In FY 2022, states are slated       to receive billions of dollars to assist with prevention,       treatment, and recovery services--these dollars will be lost       with a full year CR.        CRs make it difficult for state and local health       departments, as well as school districts, to plan activities       and hire staff as they rely on predictable funding from       federal agencies to carry out their work. Funding delays will       hold up essential programmatic work in communities across the       country.        CRs force grant-funding agencies like the National       Institutes of Health to adopt conservative funding policies,       holding back on investments in new areas of life-saving       research and damaging existing ongoing research efforts.       Unreliable and unpredictable funding streams hurt the       nation's scientific enterprise, and damage America's       competitiveness globally.        After a decade of almost frozen funding for education, the       House and Senate Labor-HHS-Education bills provided needed       investments for FY 2022, starting to address long-standing       needs along the education continuum. Freezing funding at last       year's levels would leave funding for the Department of       Education below the level of a decade ago in inflation-      adjusted dollars.        The pandemic continues to have profound impacts on teaching       and learning, and while the COVID-relief already enacted       supports short-term costs associated with the pandemic, there       will be new, ongoing needs that the FY 2022 appropriations       bill begins to address for students, educators, and       institutions.        During the pandemic, the costs of child care at a center       rose an estimated 47 percent, while family day care increased       by 70 percent; many child care centers were forced to close.       Lack of child care is keeping many women from rejoining the       labor force. The House bill increases child care by $1.5       billion and Head Start by $1.4 billion; flat-funding child       care would make it impossible to rebuild capacity.        More than 11.8 million people are unemployed or       underemployed and women, people of color and people without       an education  [[Page H6878]]       past high school comprise a disproportionate amount of these       workers. A CR would deny additional investments to an already       historically underfunded workforce system at a time of great       need.        As the Administration works to implement the historic       investments to our nation's infrastructure included in the       Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, the demand for skilled       workers in industries including construction, manufacturing,       energy and related industries will continue to grow. At the       same time, workers who lost their jobs in retail, hospitality       and other sectors hardest hit by the pandemic are looking for       opportunities to build new skills for available job       opportunities. A CR denies critical investments in training       programs necessary to mitigate the current skills mismatch       and allow workers to access the jobs for which businesses are       hiring.        The cost to heat a home with natural gas is projected to       rise by 30 percent this winter; heating oil costs are       expected to rise by 43 percent. Flat-funding for the Low       Income Home Energy Assistance Program would lead to dramatic       reductions in the number of households served and the amount       of help they get from LIHEAP.        The undersigned organizations call on Congress to pass a FY       2022 appropriations bill in a timely manner to avoid the       damaging trend of long-term CRs and provide needed services       for the American public.

Hon. Patrick Leahy,      Chairman, Appropriations Committee, U.S. Senate.      Hon. Rosa DeLauro,      Chairwoman, Appropriations Committee, House of           Representatives.      Hon. Richard Shelby,      Ranking Member, Appropriations Committee, U.S. Senate.      Hon. Kay Granger,      Ranking Member, Appropriations Committee, House of           Representatives.        Dear Chairman Leahy, Chairwoman DeLauro and Ranking Members       Shelby and Granger: On behalf of the thousands of companies       represented by the National Defense Industrial Association       (NDIA) and across the defense industrial base, we write to       request the expedited completion of the defense appropriation       bill. While we applaud the bipartisan effort to pass a       continuing resolution (CR) and avoid a government shutdown,       it is a poor stand-in for the full-year appropriations       desperately needed by our warfighters and those who provide       them with the equipment and services that enable their       mission.        We cannot stress enough the importance of the defense       appropriations bill to our national security and to a healthy       defense industrial base. The limbo caused under CRs wastes       precious time and money our nation cannot recover. Delayed       new starts and initiatives place a strain on companies and       their workforce, particularly as they recalibrate operations       to a post-pandemic normal. Our nation's competitors face no       similar challenges putting us at a competitive disadvantage,       particularly with emerging technologies, and place our supply       chains at increasing risk, something we cannot afford after       the nearly two years of pandemic impacts.        Doing business with the Federal Government is already hard.       The tomes of regulations, burdensome business requirements,       sometimes Kafkaesque contracting and oversight procedures,       and compressed margins have combined to drive businesses out       of the defense sector with a net outflow of well over 10,000       companies since 2011 and, as noted in our annual Vital Signs       report, a halving of new entrants to the sector between       fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 alone. Add to that the       uncertainty of ``if and when'' a full-year defense       appropriations gets signed into law, more companies will       reassess their participation in the defense industrial base.       The ultimate price of this is paid by our warfighters who       will lose out on innovations and new capabilities not       delivered.        The inefficiencies caused by beginning 12 of the last 13       fiscal years without full-year funding have cost the military       services billions lost in inefficient expenditures and       program delays. Also, delayed contract starts challenge       larger contractors while threaten the existence of smaller       prime contractors and small businesses down the supply chain.       The effect of that has a human face and a long-term impact.       To execute a new-start contract, a company must recruit,       hire, and train a workforce despite a tight labor market and       a shortage of workers with the required security clearance.       Faced with a delayed start, that company must now choose       between two bad options, either pay that workforce to stand       idle or let those workers go--both of which could lead to       contract or business failure and undelivered capabilities to       our service members.        With no full-year funding, we cannot afford to go too long       without hampering readiness recovery efforts, delaying       capabilities to our warfighters, and postponing investments       in advanced technologies while allowing our defense       industrial base to erode. NOIA supports a bipartisan       agreement on domestic and national security spending and       encourages the adoption of a two-year budget to prevent       another year of budget instability and to provide the needed       support to the Department of Defense for their critical       missions.        We appreciate your attention to this critical issue and       look forward to working with your Committees moving forward.            Very respectfully,      Herbert J. Carlisle,        General, USAF (Ret), President and CEO, National Defense       Industrial Association.      Arnold L. Punaro,        MajGen, USMC (Ret), Chairman of the Board, National Defense       Industrial Association.
