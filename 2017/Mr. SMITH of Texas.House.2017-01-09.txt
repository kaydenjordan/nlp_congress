 Mr. Speaker, a good example of fake news appeared  in Sunday's New York Times. It is a column headlined, ``As Trump Denies  Climate Change, These Kids Die.'' This may be a new high--or maybe a  new low--for climate alarmists and their exaggerations.   Two facts: first, most severe and persistent droughts occurred  decades ago, not recently; and second, there is little connection  between climate change and extreme weather, in general, according to  numerous studies.   Climate alarmists tend to ignore scientific evidence and encourage  media hype, and, of course, the liberal media is all too willing to go  along. Climate discussions should be based on good science, not  politically correct science.                            ____________________
