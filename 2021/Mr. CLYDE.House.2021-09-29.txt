 Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight the tremendous  achievements of two law enforcement officers in Stephens County,  Georgia.   Deputy Sheriff Lieutenant Patricia ``Pat'' Brown recently reached her  30-year tenure with the Stephens County Sheriff's Office. After serving  in the field for many years, Lieutenant Brown now diligently leads the  records division and continues to display exceptional service to her  community.   Senior Deputy Sheriff Paul Shiffer reached his 50-year tenure this  past year. Yes, I said 50 years of law enforcement service. And he  continues to faithfully serve as head of the civil division. Whether he  is working extra hours or using his personal time to custom make  Christmas ornaments for each employee, Senior Deputy Shiffer has gone  above and beyond to serve his community for half a century.   The good folks of Stephens County are fortunate to have Deputies  Brown  [[Page H5518]]  and Shiffer, and I congratulate them both for their devoted service to  the Ninth District.                            ____________________
