 Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself, Vice  Chairman Rubio, Senator Blunt, and all members of the Senate Select  Committee on Intelligence to recognize the service and accomplishments  of VADM Robert D. Sharp and congratulate him on his upcoming  retirement. His leadership and vision drove the National Geospatial- Intelligence Agency--NGA--to deliver support to a wide array of  customers while simultaneously transforming its operating procedures  and business practices. As Director of NGA, Vice Admiral Sharp ensured  that timely, relevant, and accurate geospatial intelligence was  provided to policymakers, warfighters, first responders, the  intelligence community, and the congressional intelligence oversight  committees.   A veteran of the war in Afghanistan and the Gulf War, Vice Admiral  Sharp served our country during a highly decorated 34-year career with  the U.S. Navy, receiving two Bronze Stars, the Legion of Merit, two  Defense Superior Service Medals, and the Navy Distinguished Service  Medal.   Vice Admiral Sharp's service included operational deployments with  USS Ranger (CV61), Carrier Air Wing 2 embarked on USS Constellation (CV  64), and Carrier Group 2 embarked on USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75).  Additionally, in 2016, Vice Admiral Sharp was tasked with serving as  commander, Office of Naval Intelligence, and director, National  Maritime Intelligence-Integration Office.   Vice Admiral Sharp culminated his distinguished career as the seventh  director of the NGA. In this capacity he also served as the  intelligence community's functional manager for GEOINT, head of the  National System for Geospatial Intelligence, and chair of the Allied  System for Geospatial Intelligence.   As NGA director, Vice Admiral Sharp led 14,500 military, civilian,  and contractor women and men with care, compassion, and resourcefulness  during the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the government  shifted to maximize telework, NGA found new and innovative ways to meet  mission demands while ensuring the safety of the workforce and,  simultaneously, significantly improving the morale of the workforce.   Vice Admiral Sharp managed the multibillion-dollar annual operating  budget of the Agency, including the construction of a new, state-of- the-art $1.7 billion NGA-West campus in downtown St. Louis, which  includes the Senator Roy Blunt Geospatial Learning Center. This  innovative facility will be a model for the IC in the future. Under  Admiral Sharp's leadership, the agency has maintained a constructive  and productive relationship with the city, the local community,  academia, and the private sector, marking St. Louis--now alongside  Springfield, VA--as a leader in the GEOINT community.   Vice Admiral Sharp also directed the use of new technology and  commercial capabilities to meet steadily increasing demands of the  customer base for trusted GEOINT with speed, accuracy, and precision-- while working to keep ahead of the speed of change occurring in GEOINT  inside and outside government and around the globe. The importance to  the Nation--and the world--of the ability to utilize new commercial  GEOINT capabilities has recently been made clear during Russia's  unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. Vice Admiral Sharp also refocused  investment in great power competition and emphasized the importance of  assured positioning, navigation, timing, and targeting.   Throughout his tenure at NGA, Vice Admiral Sharp focused attention on  a whole-of-enterprise approach by expanding and deepening relations  with partners across the enterprise. In particular, he has fostered  increased engagement with colleges and universities and promoted  geographic literacy and STEM education in K-12 institutions. NGA has an  active CRADA with the University of Virginia and open source  intelligence partnerships with William and Mary University and Virginia  Tech. NGA has also signed educational partnership agreements with  Harris Stowe State University, a historically Black university in St.  Louis; University of Missouri St Louis, the most diverse public  research institution in the St Louis area; and Gallaudet University, in  Washington, DC, the Nation's premier university for deaf and hard of  hearing students. These initiatives are representative of Vice Admiral  Sharp's career-long commitment to diversity and inclusion.   Vice Admiral Sharp's tenure at NGA was marked by strong leadership  and dedication to mission. He inspired a workforce to remain committed  to the mission while rapidly transforming with changes in technology  and tradecraft during an unprecedented time in the history of the  nation. His leadership of NGA and his decades of service to our country  displayed honor, courage, and commitment. We congratulate Vice Admiral  Sharp on his retirement and thank him for his service to our country.                            ____________________
