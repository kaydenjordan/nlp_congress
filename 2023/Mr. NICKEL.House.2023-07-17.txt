 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate and pay tribute  to the Grateful Dead. Last night, the Dead and Company closed out their  final act in San Francisco, and while this marks the end of an era, it  also gives us an opportunity to reflect on the immense impact they have  had on generations of fans.   Jerry Garcia said it best when he said: ``Maybe we are just one of  the last adventures in America,'' and for those of us who are fans who  follow the Dead, they truly were an amazing American adventure.   For over five decades, their unique blend of rock, folk, and  improvisation transcended boundaries inspiring countless artists and  enchanting millions of dedicated fans.   In a world often divided, the Grateful Dead reminds us that music has  the power to bridge divides and bring people together. Their music  served as a beacon of hope, an escape, and a testament to the power of  artistic expression.   Through their music, the Grateful Dead taught us the value of  community, compassion, and the beauty of living in the moment. As we  celebrate the Grateful Dead, we also pay tribute to the late Jerry  Garcia and all the band members who graced the stage with their  exceptional talents.   Let's also acknowledge the unwavering dedication of the Deadheads,  the devoted fans who traveled far and wide to be part of the Grateful  Dead experience. Their unwavering support and enthusiasm nurtured a  unique bond between the band and its audience, making each concert  totally unique. There was never a concert that was the same as the  last.   As we celebrate Dead and Company's final performance last night,  let's remember that their music and spirit continue to live on in the  hearts of all those that they touched. Their journey may have reached  its final destination, but their melodies resonate across time,  reminding us of the enduring power of music to inspire, uplift, and to  bring us together.   Madam Speaker, I like people who like the Grateful Dead, and whether  in the Halls of Congress or back home in North Carolina, I will always  be thankful for the memories they gave us, the music they shared, and  the profound impact they had on the lives of everyone in this country.                            ____________________
