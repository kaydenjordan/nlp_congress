 Mr. Speaker, as we mark the second anniversary of the  July 11, 2021, protest in Cuba, I call on the Cuban Government to  release all those imprisoned for exercising their rights to protest, to  freedom of expression, and association.   Mr. Speaker, 2 years ago, Cubans took to the streets to demand better  living conditions and more freedoms amid a grim economic crisis. There  is no excuse for these largely peaceful protests to have been met with  government repression, arrests, and internet blackouts.   According to reputable reports, over 1,500 people were arrested in  connection with these protests, and over 680 remain in prison.   However, U.S. policies contribute directly to the hardships that  Cubans endure, but the Cuban Government's repression only exacerbates  the many challenges facing its people.   Cuba should release all remaining protesters, and the United States  of America should end all policies, including taking Cuba off the State  Sponsors of Terrorism list, that only increase the suffering of the  Cuban people.                            ____________________
