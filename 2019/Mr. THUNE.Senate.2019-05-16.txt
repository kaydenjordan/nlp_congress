 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, this week is National Police Week--a  chance to reflect on the sacrifices of our Nation's police officers and  to thank them for everything they do on our behalf.   Yesterday, I spoke on the floor about Military Appreciation Month.  Like members of the military, police officers are a special breed. They  willingly rush into danger and put their lives on the line for the rest  of us. That is not a natural human instinct, to rush into danger. Most  of us are inclined to run away from danger. But police officers do the  opposite. They not only stand their ground in the face of danger; they  walk into the midst of it to protect the rest of us.   A centerpiece of National Police Week is Peace Officers Memorial Day,  which commemorates the sacrifices of all of those who have given their  lives in the line of duty. Last year, more than 100 police officers  were killed in the line of duty. It is a powerful reminder that being a  police officer is a dangerous job. USA TODAY reports that 10 percent of  police officers are assaulted every year--10 percent. Police officers  never know what they are going to face when they respond to a call, but  they go in anyway.   Serving in law enforcement can take a toll. Police officers-- particularly those who specialize in investigating and responding to  the worst crimes--have to see a lot of evil on a daily basis. It is yet  another way they protect the rest of us. They face evil so that we  don't have to. Yet, despite all they do, they don't line up to be  thanked. The police officers I meet tend to minimize their  contributions. ``I am just doing my job'' is a pretty frequent refrain.   A lot of us don't interact with the police very frequently. We don't  often see the work they do to keep our towns and our cities safe. But  being in Congress has given me a chance to interact with police  officers on a daily basis. The U.S. Capitol Building and the  congressional office buildings, where I work, are protected by the men  and women of the U.S. Capitol Police. I see them every day, manning  security checkpoints, directing traffic, standing on guard outside in  the blazing Sun or the cold rain, responding to incidents, and  protecting dignitaries and visitors. I know there is a lot they do that  I don't see, too--the countless things that go into keeping the Capitol  Complex and the thousands of people who work and visit here safe from  threats.   I was in the Longworth House Office Building on September 11, 2001,  when the planes hit the Pentagon and the Twin Towers. Once it became  clear that our Nation was, in fact, under attack, the entire Capitol  Complex was evacuated. People were rushing, running out of the  buildings. Do you know who wasn't running? The Capitol Police. They  weren't going anywhere until they were sure that all of us had gotten  out.   Since I became whip, I have gotten to know a number of the  outstanding plainclothes police officers who protect Members of  leadership. It was two members of the Capitol Police security detail  who stepped into the line of fire at the Republicans' baseball practice  two summers ago and prevented a terrible day from becoming much worse.  Many Members of Congress are safe today because of the actions of those  two police officers.   Here in the United States, we are blessed with a peace and a safety  that is denied to many around the world. It is important to remember  that one of the big reasons most of us are able to live free from fear  is because of the countless police officers on duty around our country.  They are there 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, ready to  step between us and danger. We owe these dedicated men and women a very  great debt.   As we observe Police Week, I want to say thank you. Thank you to the  police officers who serve across our country. Thank you to their  families, who also sacrifice so that the rest of us can live in safety.  A special thank-you to the Capitol Police and the police officers who  keep the peace back home in South Dakota. May God bless each of you.   I yield the floor.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Tennessee (Mr. Alexander).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennessee (Mr.  Alexander) would have voted ``yea.''    Mr. President, today I recognize Jonathan Miklos,  an intern in my Rapid City, SD, office, for all of the hard work he has  done for me, my staff, and the State of South Dakota over the past  several months.   Jonathan is a graduate of Stevens High School in Rapid City, SD.  Currently, he is attending South Dakota State University in Brookings,  SD, where he is double majoring in political science and history. He is  a hard worker who has been dedicated to getting the most out of his  internship experience.   I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Jonathan for all of  the fine work he has done and wish him continued success in the years  to come.                            ____________________
