 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in morning business.    Madam President, each 52 weeks of the year, I do four  telephone news conferences with different groups of journalists. Most  of the journalists are Iowans.   Each week, without failure, a familiar voice opens one of my press  calls with a very thoughtful question on some matter of interest to  folks in the heartland of America. For more than two decades at the  Omaha World-Herald, Joe Morton has cut through the beltway noise to  deliver real news to my constituents in Iowa and those in Nebraska.   Sadly, his tenure at the paper ended just before Thanksgiving. So I  want to take this opportunity to thank Joe for his decades of keeping  Americans informed about the work of their elected leaders. So I say:  Best of luck to Joe, wherever the future takes him. And if anybody in  this area is looking for a dedicated journalist, you ought to consider  Joe.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
