 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                           Community Health Centers     Mr. President, it is no secret that our country faces a  major healthcare crisis and, in fact, a dysfunctional healthcare  system.   We have some 30 million people who have no health insurance, and that  number is going to go up in the coming year. We have even more people  who are underinsured, with high deductibles and copayments. Our people  pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, which means  that millions of people who go to the doctor to get a prescription are  simply unable to afford the bill. In fact, the description of that is  the definition of a dysfunctional, failing healthcare system.   In the midst of all of that, there is another particular crisis  dealing with primary healthcare, and that is that even when people do  have health insurance in many parts of our country, they are finding it  very hard to go to a doctor and to get in to a doctor to treat the  ailments that they have. We fall behind many other countries in terms  of our lack of emphasis on primary healthcare, which should be the  heart and soul of any strong healthcare system. The bottom line is that  when you get sick, you should be able to get to the doctor when you  need to and not have to wait weeks and months in order to do so.   In the midst of a failing primary healthcare system, there is one  very strong bright spot, and that is that for many decades now, in  every State in this country, we have had community health centers run  by the people themselves--democratically run--addressing the healthcare  needs of those given communities. Today, in America, we have about 27  million people--27 million men, women, and children--who are accessing  community health centers. In my own State of Vermont, one out of four  Vermonters gets their primary healthcare through a community health  center.   These centers do more than provide primary healthcare. They also  provide dental care, an issue that is too often ignored when we talk  about the healthcare crisis. They provide mental health counseling,  which is more important now than perhaps it has ever been because of  the opioid and heroin epidemic our country is experiencing. Equally  important, they provide low-cost prescription drugs at a time when so  many Americans cannot afford the medicines they need. That is what  community health centers do, and they  [[Page S629]]  do it well, and they do it cost effectively.   To my mind, there is no question but that there is strong bipartisan  support here in the Senate and in the House for community health  centers. Yet now we have gone over 4 months into the 2018 fiscal year,  and we still have not reauthorized funding for community health  centers. Frankly, I do not understand how it happens that when we have  strong bipartisan support in the House and the Senate for programs that  are working extremely well in every State in this country, the  Republican leadership still has not reauthorized the community health  center program. There is good bipartisan legislation right here in the  Senate that has, I think, the support of virtually everybody in the  Democratic caucus. Seven or eight Republicans are supporting it. It is  the Blunt-Stabenow bill. It is a 5-year extension of community health  centers reauthorization with a modest increase in the budget. If that  bill came to the floor today, my guess is that it would get 70, 80  votes--maybe even more. We have gone 4 months into the fiscal year, and  we still have not seen that bill reauthorized.   What is happening all over this country is that community health  centers, which often struggle with recruitment and retention, are  finding it harder than ever to retain the doctors, nurses, and other  medical staff they need because applicants are looking around and  saying: Why should I work at a community health center if I don't even  know if it is going to be there next year? Why should I stay at a  community health center if I can get a better job offer and I don't  know if this community health center will be funded?   As a result of 4 months of inaction, community health centers all  over this country are hurting. I say enough is enough. Right now, as  soon as possible, we need to reauthorize the community health center  program for at least 5 years, and we need to make sure there is  adequate funding so that they can continue to do the excellent work  they are doing all over this country.                               Opioid Epidemic    Mr. President, there is another issue that I would like to briefly  touch upon. There has been a lot of discussion--appropriately so--about  the opioid epidemic that is sweeping the United States. We have lost  some 63,000 Americans as a result of opioid overdoses in 2016 alone.  Families by the millions are being impacted.   I was in Brattleboro, VT, a few weeks ago, and they talked to me  about what is happening to the children whose parents are addicted to  opioids. They need to find foster homes for those children.   This is clearly an epidemic that has to be dealt with. We have to  increase funding for prevention to make sure young people don't get  swept up into the epidemic and also for treatment for those people who  are addicted.   There is an issue that we have not touched upon enough, and that is  holding the drug companies responsible and accountable for the products  they brought into the market. As some people may recall, in April of  1994, the CEOs of the seven largest tobacco companies testified before  the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health and the  Environment in a historic hearing. What that hearing was about was,  under oath, demanding to know what the executives from the tobacco  industry knew and when they knew it. Did they know that their product  was addictive? Did they know that tobacco caused cancer, heart disease,  and other medical problems? They were asked to hold their hands up and  under oath tell the committee what they knew.   I think it is now appropriate for the Senate to do the same with  those drug companies that are producing opioids. I think we need to  know what the drug companies knew in terms of the addictive qualities  of those drugs. There is some evidence out there that suggests that  drug companies, in fact, did know that the product they were selling  was in fact addictive, but they forgot to tell the doctors--and  certainly not the patients.   It is one thing for somebody to do something in ignorance, not  knowing the impact of what you produce. That happens all the time. It  is something very different if, in fact, the manufacturer of a product  understands that the product causes addiction, that the product causes  death. We need to get to the root of that issue. We need to know what  the drug companies knew and when they knew that.   I would hope very much that in the Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions Committee, which has jurisdiction over this issue, we could  bring the executives of those drug companies that produce these opioids  before us, because not only are we talking about 60,000 people a year  dying as a result of overdoses, but what we are talking about also is  the expenditure of tens of billions of dollars in healthcare and law  enforcement associated with opioid addiction.   I hope that we can move forward and have those executives come before  us and tell us under oath what they knew and when they knew it, because  I think the time is long overdue for us to hold them accountable.   With that, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.                        Stewardship for Our Democracy     Mr. President, I would like to congratulate more  finalists in this year's State of the Union Essay Contest and, as I did  with the finalists I recognized yesterday, I ask that their essays be  printed in the Record.   The material follows:             maisie newbury, middlebury union high school, junior         ``Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone, just remember       that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages       that you've had.'' The Great Gatsby, page 1. This was one of       my father's favorite quotes when I was growing up. He always       cautioned me to think before I spoke or better yet, ``think       before you think.'' While some might call this inauthentic,       my father called it sensible.        I am not blind to the privilege I possess. Though, living       in the big house atop the hill with my two healthy, living       parents in the sheltered town of Weybridge, Vermont, it would       be an easy thing to forget--if it weren't for my brother,       Robbie.        Robbie does not talk much. He cannot read. He cannot write.       He has ``Severe, Regressive Autism,'' a developmental       disorder that inhibits his literacy and communication skills.       When I was younger, my parents explained to me that the world       looked different to Robbie. It was louder, brighter and so       much bigger. Living with Robbie, I am constantly reminded of       my privilege. Every time I speak, run, ski, read, write . . .       I'm doing something that he cannot. All the things I do on a       daily basis are insurmountable obstacles to him. Yet, even       without these luxuries, my brother smiles and laughs--he       enjoys his life and his experience because he owns it. No one       should be allowed to take that from him.        Yet, my brother's access to the care he needs has decreased       immensely in the last year. His weekly appointments with his       occupational therapist, which used to be covered by       insurance, are now unaffordable as my parents must continue       supporting him in their retirement. Learning this, I was       upset. How could something so fundamental be removed from our       insurance policy without a second thought?        In our society, mental health challenges are often       dismissed as illegitimate and fixable. Words like psycho,       idiot and lunatic, are thrown around as diminutive insults       rather than seen as impactful and potentially harmful.       Because of this, mental healthcare is considered a luxury       rather than a necessity, and therefore not something that       should be covered by insurance.        The union we live in does not value mental healthcare       simply because society does not. This issue starts with us. I       cannot stay silent and watch my parents sacrifice my       brother's future stability and independence in order to be       able to support him in the long run; nor can I do this alone.       I know that until society begins placing value on the lives       of people like Robbie, no one will--especially not large-      scale insurance providers. However, I believe that there are       other people like me who, if we band together, can create a       small group of thoughtful, committed citizens ready to take       on the world. For, unlike my brother, my privilege has given       me a voice, and it is my duty to use it to fight for him. I       owe him that much.                   jackson noel, milton high school, senior         With a nation as large as the United States there is a       constant stream of issues and problems that require       addressing. This means that the most important issues are       those that involve the largest portion of the United States       population. In that way, the biggest issue that the United       States should currently focus on is making sure that every       American can afford and has access to health care.        Every American should have the right to health care, as       wealth should not determine quality of life. Health care is       an incredibly important aspect of everyone's lives as it       allows them to live without worrying about not having access       to critical care and treatment to thrive. In this way, the       solution to this problem is the maintaining and constant       adjusting of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,       ``ACA'', to best suit and assist the American people. The       benefit of the Affordable Care Act is deceptively simple in       that more Americans would be able to afford and hold onto       healthcare. This means that they would be able to live a       better life and be better functioning members of society. The       Affordable Care Act has proven to be a legitimate solution       since it has been enacted under the Obama administration.       According to the New York Times, the number of Americans       without healthcare is ``down by 25 percent.'' This shows that       the Affordable Care Act is effective at achieving its goals.        There are many people who believe that the United States       government should play no role in health care; this is a       flawed perspective. The goal is insure as many American       citizens as possible it makes the most sense to have defined       government regulation. One belief is that there should be a       free market for health insurance, allowing companies to       compete to provide the best system to benefit the people.       There are many problems with a free market health care system       that stops it from being helpful and most useful for the       American people. A free market is not designed to allow for       everyone to have insurance, but rather people who can afford       it having better access. This is not beneficial on the       national scale and leads to a large imbalance of power. There       are also numerous flaws in the current American approach to       health care. For one, even when someone is insured there are       upfront fees and payments before insurance kicks in. This       means that someone who is insured might not be able to pay       these fees causing them to be financially burdened by bills       even with insurance.        Universal government health care has proven to be a       sufficient solution to the problem of health care. For       example, Switzerland has universal health care and a per       capita health expenditures of $1,879, compared to America's       $4,160. Meaning that the United States is spending more money       on less.        Making sure that this is available and maintained under the       Trump administration is important in the path towards       accessible health insurance. No one should ever die because       they cannot afford treatment.               hope petraro, montpelier high school, sophomore         Commitment to democracy is the founding principal of the       United States of America-embedded in the fabric of our       Nation, the crown jewel of our proverbial crown. A       constitutional federal republic, with a system of checks and       balances, is an assurance to constituents that they each have       a seat at the table. Yet in practice, this has proven to be       nothing but a promising facade. Gerrymandering, voter       suppression, and ``money in politics'' are not a threat to       our democracy--they define American democracy. The       disproportionate influence of wealthy individuals and       corporations in elections and in the legislative process has       muddled an honest definition of democracy in our Nation while       simultaneously becoming it. However, America's commitment to       tried-and-true methods does not necessitate lack of reception       to positive change.        Campaigns will always include campaign financing, as the       distribution of information to voters is dependent upon       systems that require funding. In addition, campaign       contributions, whether by individuals or corporations, can       rightfully be considered an exercise of the First Amendment       right to free speech. However, refusal to set donation limits       violates the grounds of equality upon which such freedom of       speech is conducted, and can arguably censor and repress the       speech of the less wealthy as it greatly diminishes their       relative influence. Unfortunately, Citizens United and the       subsequent SpeechNow allow donors to make unlimited donations       to super PACS. This includes money donated by foreign       entities, possibly anonymously as ``dark money''. Moreover,       these expenditures aren't verifiably independent from       candidates. Collusion between super PACs, often created by       associates of candidates and candidates themselves, is       rarely, if ever, regulated. In addition, it is hypocritical       to argue, in the name of free speech, that donors can       contribute an unlimited amount to expenditures but that those       expenditures must remain independent. Citizens United,       SpeechNow, and the additional McCutcheon rulings have nearly       neutralized the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, adding a       somewhat plutocratic influence upon the electoral process and       American democracy as a whole.        This issue is multi-partisan. According to Gallup Poll, the       greatest majority of Americans cite dissatisfaction with the       government and poor leadership as our Nation's most important       issue. A September 2015 Bloomberg poll found that about 80       percent of Republicans and Democrats alike oppose Citizens       United. This overarching dissatisfaction can be ameliorated       by working  [[Page S649]]       to keep elections in the hands of the American people.       Political groups, such as the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth       and ALEC, were able to influence elections before Citizens       United, SpeechNow, and McCutcheon, and are able to influence       the legislative process, respectively. However, it's       important for Americans to avoid demoralization,       understanding that the first step to achieving a republic       free of corruption rests in truly democratic elections. A       true democracy can be achieved by restoring the Bipartisan       Campaign Reform Act, strengthening campaign-finance       regulations, and supporting public campaign-financing       initiatives. We, the American people, must decide our       destiny, and our elections should remind each American that       their voices prevail.             zoe prue, champlain valley union high school, junior         The United States is distinguished by the values that are       deeply embedded in our culture and economy. Americans place       emphasis on individual initiative and self-created success.       These ideas are evident in the Constitution, its amendments,       and various institutions. Their derivation is best seen in a       famous phrase written in the Declaration of Independence,       ``life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.'' Captured in       these seven words are the ubiquitous values of our Nation.        Our focus on individually created prosperity is manifested       by capitalism and the free market. However, these are not       conducive to always guaranteeing protections like health care       for our most vulnerable citizens. In America, there are       families stymied in an unrelenting cycle of poverty, and they       are incapable of rising out of the cycle for a myriad of       factors. For example, access to education and vocational       training, discrimination--especially for marginalized       communities--higher incarceration rates, low salaries/wages,       and lack of jobs. Impoverished people have difficulties       paying for the bare minimums like housing, food, and heat.       Consequently, families rarely find any spare money to spend       on healthcare.        This is an issue because, according to the National Center       for Children in Poverty, 15 million children in the United       States live below the federal poverty line. There are       millions of children who do not receive regular physical       check-ups, necessary optometry appointments, or dental care.       Children and adolescents are suffering from health problems       that impact their quality of life. Many treatable ailments       require simple fixes such as glasses to see the board,       fillings for painful cavities, medicine for illnesses, or       inhalers for asthma. It is within our capacity to fix these       problems, so why are we not? We should be concerned about the       health of our Nation's citizens as it is one of the most       important issues facing the U.S. today.        There is an inescapable need for affordable and accessible       health care for the American public. The lasting impacts of       affordable healthcare would be monumental. When we invest in       the health and livelihoods of the next generation of       Americans, we are investing in the next generation of our       workforce. Healthier people results in more able workers, who       by extension, are able to support their own families. It is       one of the best methods to combatting the poverty cycle.        We characterize our Nation by our belief in individualism       and independence. However, when we see a system that is       relentlessly unforgiving towards people in poverty, the most       productive conclusion to come to is that we have to start       taking care of our neighbors. The cycle disempowers them; it       strips them of the ability to pay for necessities like       healthcare. This is why affordable healthcare needs to be       obtainable for all Americans.        Instead of repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act,       it should be expanded upon. The government should fund       programs to offer reasonably priced healthcare to Americans.       Doing so would create a lasting solution to poor citizens       being unable to access health care. The quality of life for       millions of Americans would be improved.                ethan schmitt, rutland high school, sophomore         I am the grandson of a card-carrying member of the National       Rifle Association. I support the United States Constitution       and all of its amendments. Despite this, I believe that the       way our country's officials have interpreted the Second       Amendment has created the foundation for many mass shootings,       which have claimed the lives of countless innocent civilians.        A price cannot be assigned for the lives lost due to this       awfully dangerous policy of our country; every time another       person dies due to homicide, another family is torn apart.       Many children have been killed, particularly in church and       school shootings. And even in cases where there are children       who haven't been physically impacted by the mass shootings,       they may have lost a loved one which will take a toll on them       mentally and emotionally for the rest of their lives.        The universal definition of the term mass shooting is when       four or more people are injured or killed in a single event       at the same time and location. According to The Guardian,       there have been 1,516 mass shootings in the past 1,735 days       before October 1, 2017, the date of the mass shooting that       took place at the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas. A total of       1,719 people have died as a result of these mass shootings,       while an additional 6,510 were injured. The gun at the       forefront of these mass shootings was the semi-automatic       rifle, which has the ability to shoot a round, and       automatically reload with another round that is fired with an       additional pull of the trigger. Despite the National Rifle       Association's attempts to defend such a weapon as a gun       mostly used for hunting purposes, there is no need for this       hazardous assault weapon in order to successfully hunt.        In addition, devices known as bump stocks are used to       simulate the speed of fire similar to that of an automatic       weapon for a semi-automatic weapon. An automatic weapon has       the ability to fire multiple rounds of ammunition by only       pulling the trigger of a gun once, and are more commonly       known as machine guns. The American people have been       prohibited from the use of these weapons with the passing of       the National Firearms Act in 1934. However, bump stocks have       not been banned, and the result of this have been conflicts       such as the mass shooting in Las Vegas where the gunman       successfully attached these devices to 23 of his semi-      automatic rifles, and used them to kill 58 people, which       resulted in the most devastating shooting in U.S. history.        The solution to this mass shooting epidemic is clear.       Congress must use rationality and act as a bipartisan group       to pass a bill which regulates the use of semi-automatic       weapons and bump stocks which have both been used with       frequency in a multitude of mass shootings across the United       States. American citizens have the right to bear arms, but       not with weapons that have no purpose in hunting, target       practice, or even self-defense.        elizabeth toensing, champlain valley union high school, junior         On a summer Saturday morning, I was driving into       Burlington. At a stop light, I looked over at a church to my       right. A man, in his early twenties was sitting on the steps.       He was shivering ferociously, yelling at God, and begging for       help. His tremors were not from cold. He was shaking from       withdrawal. Beads of sweat trickled down his forehead and       soaked his shirt. His body was unable to handle the side       effects of withdrawal. He was a heroin addict. This homeless       man with torn clothing, could not access a treatment center.       His last-ditch effort was to sit on the steps of a church and       pray, scream, for a miracle.        A miracle is ``a highly improbable or extraordinary event,       development, or accomplishment that brings very welcome       consequences.'' Miracles are meant for things we cannot       control, not things we can control like making help available       for drug addicts.        By funding public drug rehabilitation centers, we can help       drug addicts to recover from their addictions. No addicts can       do it alone and adequate support is the only way to help with       these problems.        An analysis from Blue Cross Blue Shield found that from       2010 to 2016, the number of people diagnosed with an       addiction to opioids climbed 493 percent. Yet, at the same       time, there was only a 65 percent increase in the number of       people getting medication-assisted treatment to manage their       addiction.        Why do we allow the drug abuse problem to skyrocket well       beyond treatment resources? Perhaps it is because drug       treatment centers come at a cost. They can range from       $20,000-$60,000 for a 30-90 day inpatient stay. No wonder       77.7 percent of addicts cannot afford it. But for society,       the costs go well beyond treatment.        The opioid crisis in America is increasing by the day and       with it comes increased deaths and suffering. Some suggest       creating injection sites to supervise heroin users to help       with the growing death toll. But this is a short term fix.       Rehab is a long-term fix and gives opioid abusers a chance to       reclaim normal lives.        Making rehabilitation centers more accessible to       financially strapped addicts will help the opioid epidemic.       Reducing or eliminating the financial blockades to treatment       that exist for nearly 80 percent of addicts will answer the       prayers of an increasing number of victims of this plague.       Affordable rehabilitation centers will eliminate the need for       miracles.           ella whitman, champlain valley union high school, junior         When my high school principal told us that there were only       three rules we had to follow I was shocked. How can you sum       up every expectation that must be demanded of a young adult       into three things? He went on to inform us that we must take       care of ourselves, take care of each other, and the place.       While thinking about these three guidelines it became       apparent that achieving them can be challenging at times but       the step to do it is simple; you must respect all things.       Looking at our Nation today it is clear that lack of respect       creates the most conflict in our Nation. Our negligence to       respect each other's bodies, opinions, ethnicities, races,       backgrounds and beliefs leads us to discrimination, hatred       and prejudice. We see endless examples in our lives today.        The lack of respect for one another's opinion is vividly       apparent in politics today. The Pew Research Center recently       reported how the partisan divide on our Nation's politics is       increasing. A study concluded, ``The shares of Republicans       and Democrats who express very unfavorable opinions of the       opposing party have increased dramatically since the 1990's,       but have changed little in recent years.'' This is alarming       because if we as people cannot see others perspective, we       will not be able to collaborate or work with one another to       collectively strengthen our Nation. By respecting others'       opinions we can gain insight and also learn their specific       needs.  [[Page S650]]         Not only is respect lacking towards each other's opinions,       but to others wellbeing as we have recently seen millions of       women come forward with stories of sexual abuse. Not only in       our Nation's history but in present day, women are treated as       objects. Just within the last twenty four hours, additional       notable people have come forward with their previous stories       of harassment such as Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Lawrence       and Molly Ringwald, not to mention the 12 million others who       have also shared their own stories on Facebook.        Looking back, maybe our principal had a point. To function       not only as a school, but as a community or even a nation we       must have respect. To advance our Nation from its biggest       struggles and alleviate the consequences that come with it,       each person must learn how to see out of another's eyes. Each       person must treat one another with dignity. Respect is       important to our country because it allows us to adjoin       together as one. Our Nation was created upon respect and       embracing one another for their differences. Each person's       difference allows us to be the unique nation we are today. We       must embrace and respect every opinion that each one of us       has, every talent each one of us possesses and every person       each one of us is.        name withheld upon request, burlington school district, senior         The biggest issue we face in America today is that we       neglect our incarcerated population. I'm part of the juvenile       incarcerated population, and as a resident I don't feel like       I'm getting the appropriate treatment I need. I was already       here once and the skills I learned were not enough to keep me       from coming back.        Incarcerated people need to be given the opportunity and       resources to identify what gets them in trouble and to work       on their problems. If a person has a history of violent       behaviors and is incarcerated because of his behaviors, he       shouldn't be doing groups on drugs and alcohol. Instead he       should be focusing his time and attention on working to       better his violent behaviors so he can be successful when he       gets out.        Another issue is that there are many young people in the       system who do not need to be. There are almost 7,000 youth       behind bars for ``technical violations'' of their probation.       Also, about 600 youth are behind bars for ``status offense,''       which are behaviors that are not law violations for adults,       such as running away, truancy, and incorrigibility.        There are another 840,000 people on parole and about 3.7       million people on probation. I would like to see better       support for these people who come out of jail. If previously       incarcerated people relapse for certain types of offenses       like drug and alcohol offenses, breaking curfew, or violating       probation, they should be given opportunities to fix that       before it becomes a pattern, rather than being thrown back in       jail.        I also think they should have more adult programs like       juveniles have such as short or longterm programs away from       their environment. A placement that juveniles go to after       being released from a locked facility is called a step down.       Laraway is an example of this, where a juvenile can go and be       allowed back in the community. They are given the opportunity       and supports to help them find a job and enroll back in       school.        I hope that policymakers and the public carefully consider       better treatment within locked facilities and alternatives to       incarceration for people who are not a threat to public       safety. We should ask whether legitimate social goals are       served by maintaining the status quo.                            ____________________
