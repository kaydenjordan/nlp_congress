 Mr. Speaker, this week I was pleased to introduce  legislation to adopt the Revised Organic Act of the Virgin Islands and  its amendments as the constitution of the Virgin Islands of the United  States.   My legislation provides for the adoption of the Revised Organic Act,  as it has been approved by Congress, signed into law, and amended, as  the constitution of our territory.   While the Revised Organic Act presently serves as the main governing  document of the Virgin Islands, we have been unable to enact changes on  a territorial level. If the Revised Organic Act and its amendments are  adopted as the constitution by Federal law, it would then free the  Virgin Islands to make further amendments without congressional  engagement or approval.   As such, my legislation includes an amendment process to allow the  Virgin Islands to revise the constitution once adopted.   In May of 2020, the Virgin Islands legislature passed bill 33-0292,  which included a referendum on the general election ballot on calling a  constitutional convention to adopt the Revised Organic Act. This  proposal was approved by 72 percent of people voting on this measure.   There is a clear public preference for the adoption of a constitution  for the  [[Page H2255]]  Virgin Islands. My legislation enables a base constitution to be  enacted and a local process for self-determination and a level of  autonomy in our constitutional maturation.   I am asking all Virgin Islanders to speak with individuals you know  who can help support this act, and I am asking Members of our diaspora  living in the mainland to lobby their current congressional and Senate  Representatives for support.    Preventing Further Growth of the Virgin Islands National Park on St.                                   John.     Mr. Speaker, this week I introduced legislation to  prohibit the net increase of federally owned land in the Virgin Islands  National Park Service on St. John. The Virgin Islands National Park  boundary encompasses nearly two-thirds of the island of St. John.  Within the park boundary, there is both federally owned and privately  owned land. There is a finite amount of land for the residents of St.  John who are already confronting housing shortages. This legislation  takes the necessary steps to prevent an increase in land owned by the  park.   This legislation prevents any net increase of federally owned land in  the park. Individuals and entities would still be able to donate or  exchange land with the park, but if the Virgin Islands National Park  acquires any land, an equal acreage of land must be conveyed out of  Federal ownership.   The legislation includes stringent guidelines to ensure the park does  not utilize bureaucratic processes to cause excessive delays. When the  park elects to sell Federal land to avoid an increase in net acreage,  it must offer the land for sale within a year at fair market value. Six  months after the land is first offered for sale, if it is not under  contract or sold, then the price is reduced by 10 percent each month.   This legislation addresses the concerns I hear consistently from  Virgin Islanders about an ever-expanding presence of the park on St.  John. The park has a responsibility as stewards and also as partners of  the Virgin Islands. That has not always been the case.   Unfortunately, often the park seems to be solely engaged in  protecting land, not the people who were the original inhabitants of  that land or the people brought over as enslaved people who fought for  freedom and through sweat and toil were able to obtain land on that  island.   Albeit sometimes well-intentioned, what they have done is effectively  crowded out Native people in furtherance of neocolonial bourgeois  wildlife ideals acting under the assumption that the local people-- interestingly, people of color--cannot care for the land themselves.   As we look at the history and the future of the Virgin Islands  National Park, our decisions must be intentional to support St. John  and the entire Virgin Islands, which includes its land, its people, its  history, its culture, and our future.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with my colleagues to advance  this legislation.                            ____________________
