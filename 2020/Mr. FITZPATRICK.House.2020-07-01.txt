 Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk about the very  important topic of police reform and qualified immunity.   Last week, I joined my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in  voting in favor of the Justice in Policing Act, a bill that the  National Fraternal Order of Police said, ``we believe, after good-faith  discussions, will create a law that will have a positive impact on law  enforcement and policing in our country.''   My Republican colleagues who voted in favor of this bill did so  because we must move the legislative process and negotiations forward  so we can begin to repair the social contract again between our police  officers around the nation and the communities that they serve.   That being said, we believe that the qualified immunity provision in  the bill, as it is currently drafted, must be fixed so that we can  ensure that we protect our hero police officers both from physical harm  and potentially frivolous lawsuits.   Qualified immunity is a judicially created doctrine that grants  government officials who are performing discretionary functions  immunity from civil suits unless the plaintiff shows that the official  violated clearly established statutory or constitutional rights that a  reasonable person would have been aware of.   Madam Speaker, to put it simply, qualified immunity states that if an  officer acts in good faith and is doing what he or she believes is in  line with their responsibilities of being a police officer, then they  are protected from personal liability.   While I believe that qualified immunity is a very important doctrine,  it should be reformed but not abolished. There must be reforms that  address personal responsibility, accountability, and transparency in  law enforcement, no doubt. However, the Justice in Policing Act  includes a provision on qualified immunity that must be amended in  conference committee prior to final passage. I, for one, will be  insisting on that prior to any bill being sent to the President's desk.   Madam Speaker, as it currently stands, this provision would specify  that a defendant is not immune from lawsuits just because they were  acting in a way that they thought was reasonable or lawful at the time  or because they were not violating a clearly established law.   The overwhelming majority of our Nation's police officers conduct  themselves responsibly, appropriately, and within the confines of the  law. Madam Speaker, I know this because I was one myself. We must  reform qualified immunity to allow our police officers to act in a way  they need to to perform their jobs while also removing protections that  would shield those who illegally deny citizens of the rights given to  them by the United States Constitution.   Having served as a lifelong Federal law enforcement agent and a  Federal prosecutor, I will be playing an active role in bridging this  gap and bringing  [[Page H3052]]  our law enforcement officials in our communities together, as will my  Republican colleagues who voted in favor, as we move to conference  committee to merge the Senate and House proposals into one bill that  works for everybody and protects our police officers.   I will insist that the final package be written in a way that both  protects citizens' constitutional and civil rights and preserves the  noble profession of law enforcement--the profession that I have  dedicated the majority of my adult life to, the profession that my  great-uncle Phil sacrificed his life and paid the ultimate price for  having been killed in the line of duty as an NYPD police officer.   Madam Speaker, this moment calls on all of us to come together and  repair this social contract so that we as Americans can start to heal.  I firmly believe that we are all capable of rising to this challenge  because my own community in Bucks and Montgomery Counties in  Pennsylvania has been a model when it comes to police-community  relations.   We need to apply the community model of my amazing colleagues back  home in law enforcement, always making improvements based on self- reflection, listening, understanding, and learning, and show the rest  of our Nation and the world that we are a country of law and order, a  country that respects the rights, dignity, and equality of every single  individual, and a country where police officers are one with the  communities in which they serve, which is certainly the case back home.   I am so proud of our law enforcement officers. We have a chance at  real positive change, Madam Speaker. Let us not miss this moment. We  can support our law enforcement officers and enact meaningful reform.  I, for one, will be insisting on both before any final bill goes to the  President's desk.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
