 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  leadership on this.   The last time there was tax reform was 31 years ago. Since then, 96  percent of income growth went to the top 10 percent of the people in  the country. Ninety-six percent went to the top 10 percent. The top 1  percent control 90 percent of the wealth in this country.   Sixty-three percent of average families in the United States of  America could not withstand a $500 emergency.   We have pensions collapsing, we have communities that have eroded,  wiped out, and the Republican plan to fix all of this is to go to the  Chinese Government, borrow $2.3 trillion and bring it back to the  United States and give it to the wealthiest people in this country.   That is not going to fix a damn thing in the United States. It is not  going to help Flint, or Springfield, or Youngstown, or Pittsburgh, or  Gary. I am talking about Gary, Indiana, will get hammered from this  thing.                                time  1830    We have tried this before, and many of you were here. President Bush  did  [[Page H9356]]  this. He said: We are going to cut taxes for the wealthy. It is going  to lead to growth. Wages are going to go up.   We had the most stagnant decade of growth since the Great Depression,  and it ended in a complete economic collapse. This is a canard. This  economic philosophy stinks. It doesn't work, and it hammers working  class people.   To put a little salt in the wound, Madam Speaker, you keep the  deduction that allows a corporation to outsource jobs from our  communities to other countries.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Madam Speaker, the only place this is going to  create a job is in Beijing, China.
