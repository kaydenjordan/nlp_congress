 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we gather this morning in an America battling the  coronavirus on two fronts: medically and economically.   Today's vote is about saving lives and livelihoods, providing the  urgent relief needed to keep workers on the job, helping those who have  lost theirs, and preserving Main Street businesses so they can ride out  this crisis and rebound strongly.   In 20 short days, our economy has taken a hit like we have rarely  seen in America's history. Thankfully, due to President Trump and  Republicans in Congress, America had the strongest economy in the world  heading into this challenge. Still, Congress must act aggressively and  act together now to stem the economic damage.   Senate Democrats, aided by Speaker Pelosi, unfortunately, delayed  this bill for days and used this crisis to advance a frivolous  political agenda. It failed, but the Senate found unanimous, if not  perfect, common ground.   This bill arms families with economic support, tax rebates of $1,200  per person and $500 per child, to help them ride this out. We also make  it easier for Americans to access their savings penalty-free and let  seniors over 72 keep their savings intact.   Workers get unprecedented help. Unemployment is being expanded by  $250 billion to make sure the self-employed, the contractor, the  freelancer, the furloughed, and the Uber driver all have a lifeline to  ride out this crisis. We are temporarily increasing the size of  unemployment checks and lengthening them if more time is needed to get  on your feet.   We take unprecedented action to save America's local businesses and  their workers. Main Street businesses face a crushing cash-flow  problem. Their customers have disappeared. They now face a cascading  sequence of layoffs and closures.   Through temporary tax relief and lending, this bill injects cash  directly into our local businesses, small and large, to stop this cash- flow crisis. We focus on preserving business to preserve jobs, to get  them through these next few weeks.   Businesses can keep their payroll taxes in their bank accounts this  year, and quickly turn their mounting losses into tax relief so they  have more cash on hand to keep workers and to survive. These two  actions alone keep $500 billion in our local economy.   For small businesses, we offer fully guaranteed loans through your  local banker, with the promise that if you keep your workers on the  payroll, that portion of the loan will be forgiven.   For larger and the most distressed businesses, we provide loans, too,  knowing your survival is crucial to millions of American workers.   These loans aren't bailouts. They are given with oversight and  repayment to companies that did nothing wrong but suffered collateral  damage as a result of this virus.   Finally, the new worker retention credit, championed by Ways and  Means Republicans and Leader Kevin McCarthy, is to help our local  businesses keep workers on the job. For businesses closed or partially  closed due to a government order that have seen their incomes drop by  50 percent or more, if they pay half of their workers' salaries, we  will pay the other half, up to $10,000, through this crisis.   The sooner we lock down the coronavirus, the sooner we unlock this  economy. To quicken that, we give our hospitals, doctors, nurses,  nonprofits, and rural healthcare providers on the front lines over $140  billion in new resources.   We give unprecedented flexibility to telehealth. We increase by 20  percent reimbursements for coronavirus treatments. We accelerate  Medicare funding, and we give patients more flexibility to use their  health savings accounts.   Mr. Speaker, while no one will agree with every part of this rescue  bill, we face a challenge rarely seen in America's history. We must act  now, or the toll on lives and livelihoods will be far greater. I  strongly urge its passage.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Walden), who is the top Republican on the Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Chabot), who is the Republican leader of the Small Business  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis), who is the Republican leader of the House  Administration Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Rogers), the leading Republican on the Committee on  Homeland Security.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon).   Miss GONZALES-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, the CARES Act  ensures that all citizens in Puerto Rico are treated equally under the  Federal grants and benefits incorporated in this bill, which I strongly  support.   Puerto Rico has been in lockdown since March 15, and more than 48,000  people lost their jobs already. This bill will help our small  businesses, people, and the nutrition assistance program, as well as  the health industry, to tackle those issues.   Puerto Ricans are ready because we have the infrastructure of a great  pharmaceutical and skilled workforce that stands ready to ramp up and  deliver medications and devices when backed up by the Defense  Production Act.   We need to rebuild our American workforce in a domestic territory.  That is the reason I thank the President and the leadership of the  Senate and the House for putting together this economic health package  to give our  [[Page H1828]]  localities the resources to tackle this crisis affecting our Nation so  we can focus on staying safe and healthy.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Leader McCarthy for his strong and relentless  leadership. I thank him for allowing each of us to bring to the table  the pro-growth policies that brought about the strongest economy on the  planet as we headed into this challenge. Thanks to our House leaders  and to our ranking members on all the key committees: Representatives  Granger and Foxx, Representatives Walden, McHenry, Cole, and Chabot.  These are Members here today who have engaged in this historic  agreement. Thanks to the professional teams who have backed us every  moment, night and day, in this endeavor.   I want to thank our Democratic colleagues for working with us on this  bipartisan bill and our Republican colleagues in the Senate. I  especially want to thank Secretary Mnuchin, the point man for President  Trump on these negotiations, as well as all of the Cabinet and the  White House economic team.   I especially want to thank President Trump for his strong and  results-oriented leadership at a time of unprecedented crisis for this  great country.   In times of challenge, I lean on this proverb: Fear knocked. Faith  answered. No one was there.   Coronavirus has knocked at America's door and with it fear. Faith is  answering. We answer with faith in ourselves and our abilities, faith  in our free enterprise system, faith in our amazing healthcare system,  and, yes, faith that when the chips are down, Congress can come  together with our President to help hardworking families and businesses  when they need it most.   We answer that door at this crucial moment with faith in our creator  and faith in our great American spirit.   This is the challenge of a lifetime, but if we keep pulling together  and if we pass this bill today without delay, then we take another step  toward that day when we answer the door and fear is no longer there.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of President Trump and the Republican  Congress, we urge support for this bill, and I yield back the balance  of my time.
