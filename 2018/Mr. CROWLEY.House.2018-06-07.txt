 Mr. Speaker, I rise to denounce and condemn the Trump  administration's heartless and inhumane policy of separating immigrant  children from their mothers and their parents at our borders. Americans  across the Nation are horrified by the actions undertaken to separate  and punish children seeking safety and refuge here in the United  States.   This isn't about politics. This is about basic humanity. This is not  who we are as a people.   Or I ask the President: Is it? Is this whom we have become?   And let's be honest about what is really happening. This  administration is terrorizing children and persecuting families who are  fleeing for their lives, families that are not sneaking into the United  States but surrendering willingly, surrendering and seeking out border  agents and asking for asylum, not committing a crime or an offense  against the American people, simply asking for asylum, fearing for  their lives and for the safety of their children.   Is asking for asylum a criminal act? Since when has asking for asylum  become a criminal act?   It is not just against American values. It is against any principles  of common decency.   And the White House knows that what it is doing is wrong. White House  Chief of Staff John Kelly said, in early May, that taking children away  from their families `` . . . would be a tough deterrent.''   Let me respond to that. Hurting children isn't tough. It is an  abomination, and it will create lifelong consequences for those  children. It will also leave an indelible mark against us as a people.  They fled violence and terror in hopes that America would protect them  and give them a fair shot, and I can understand why they would think  that.   After World War II, when tens of millions of people fled their homes,  the United States began helping to draft the Refugee Convention that  created laws and policies to protect those fleeing from persecution.  The foundation of that convention is not turning people away at the  borders but, instead, giving them a full chance for an asylum claim.  This started under then-President Roosevelt and came into full force  under then-President Harry Truman.   Now, Donald Trump, Jeff Sessions, and Kirstjen Nielsen are running  their policy into the ground. Who do they think they are to do this?  Who are they to make children suffer? Who are they to punish children  when their parents are simply trying to save their lives?   For centuries, America has been a beacon for those fleeing violence  and oppression and poverty. The symbol of our Nation that welcomed  millions, the Statue of Liberty, has engraved on it Emma Lazarus'  famous poem:       Give me your tired, your poor,      Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.    No one is more deserving of a chance to breathe free than a child and  a family fleeing from violence.   Agents of the U.S. Government should not be ripping 18-month-old  babies from the arms of their mothers. Instead, we should help to  address the situation that led them to flee from their home in the  first place. We should keep families together while their cases are  considered for asylum, and we should immediately end this zero- tolerance policy.   So I strongly urge the Trump administration to immediately end this  disgusting stain on America's human rights record. I condemn this  policy. Put an end to this heinous family separation policy. Stop  taking babies from their mothers.   This isn't America. We are better than this.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the Spending  Cuts to Expired and Unnecessary Programs Act.   This bill strips $7 billion from the Children's Health Insurance  Program, CHIP. Mr. Speaker, $7 billion for sick kids.   It is really unbelievable if you stop and consider it. Republicans  are asking children to pay for their tax break to the rich.   This is just another illustration of the GOP's convoluted priorities.  Mr. Speaker, $1.5 trillion goes to corporations and special interests;  and when the budget comes up short, Republicans dip into healthcare for  children to make up for their recklessness.   It doesn't have to be this way. CHIP was, for decades, a bipartisan  piece of legislation because, despite any policy differences we may  have or may have had, Democrats and Republicans were always able to  come together and agree that CHIP is a fundamentally important program  for our Nation.   What changed? Where did your consciences go?
