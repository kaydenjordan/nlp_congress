 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2922, the  Elder Abuse Protection Act.   As we have seen through the recent pandemic, American seniors are  among the most vulnerable population. As a former State senator, I  dealt with many issues our elderly Hoosiers are facing in their lives.   The Trump administration made great strides in achieving justice for  elderly Americans victimized by fraud and abuse. By standing up the  Elder Justice Initiative, the administration charged nearly 1,000  defendants with fraud totaling over $2.2 billion.   The Elder Abuse Protection Act makes permanent this initiative, which  will continue its important work under this bill to ensure criminals  are held accountable.   This legislation is a very important step in the right direction to  protect and take care of the people who used to care for us.   I thank my colleague, Representative Sylvia Garcia, for leading this  critical effort, and I urge my colleagues to support this good  legislation.
