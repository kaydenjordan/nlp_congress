 Madam President, I thank the Senator from Alabama for  including me today in the reading of Dr. King's letter from the  Birmingham jail.   Senator Jones has standing to do this not just because he is from  Alabama but because of his work as a U.S. attorney prosecuting Klansmen  who blew up a church on 16th Street in Birmingham, killing children.   Senator Jones said that all of this was not too long ago. It was not  too long ago for me. I remember a day--on August 28, 1963. I was a  student at that time at New York University School of Law with an  internship in the U.S. Department of Justice. It was a hot summer day,  and the streets were filled with the March on Washington. It was about  lunchtime, I believe, that I went outside into that crowd, and I heard  a booming voice from a man who was standing on the steps of the Lincoln  Memorial. I heard the words that he hoped his four little children one  day would ``live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color  of their skin.'' I am not sure, at that time and at that age, that I  understood fully what I was seeing and hearing, but I was hearing Dr.  King's ``I Have a Dream'' speech.   In 1962, a year earlier, I was a senior at Vanderbilt University in  Nashville. It was not that long ago, but a lot has changed since then.  Vanderbilt, a prestigious institution, just in that year was  desegregating its undergraduate school. I was a part of that effort.  But even then, Black Americans couldn't go to the same restaurants,  stay at the same motels, or go to the same bathrooms--even then, and it  was not that long ago.   Four months before I heard Dr. King speak in August of 1963, he wrote  a letter from the Birmingham jail on the 16th of April, 1963. This was  Dr. King's letter:         My Dear Fellow Clergymen:        While confined here in the Birmingham city jail, I came       across your recent statement calling my present activities       ``unwise and untimely.''    Dr. King's letter went on to say:         I think I should indicate why I am here in Birmingham,       since you have been influenced by the view which argues       against ``outsiders coming in.'' I have the honor of serving       as president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference,       an organization operating in every southern state, with       headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. We have some eighty five       affiliated organizations across the South, and one of them is       the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights. Frequently       we share staff, educational and financial resources with our       affiliates. Several months ago the affiliate here in       Birmingham asked us to be on call to engage in a nonviolent       direct action program if such were deemed necessary. We       readily consented, and when the hour came we lived up to our       promise. So I, along with several members of my staff, am       here because I was invited here. I am here because I have       organizational ties here.        But more basically, I am in Birmingham because injustice is       here. Just as the prophets of the eighth century B.C. left       their villages and carried their ``thus saith the Lord'' far       beyond the boundaries of their home towns, and just as the       Apostle Paul left his village of Tarsus and carried the       gospel of Jesus Christ to the far corners of the Greco Roman       world, so am I compelled to carry the gospel of freedom       beyond my own home town. Like Paul, I must constantly respond       to the Macedonian call for aid.        Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all       communities and states. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and       not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice       anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in       an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment       of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all       indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the       narrow, provincial ``outside agitator'' idea. Anyone who       lives inside the United States can never be considered an       outsider anywhere within its bounds.        You deplore the demonstrations taking place in Birmingham.       But your statement, I am sorry to say, fails to express a       similar concern for the conditions that brought about the       demonstrations. I am sure that none of you would want to rest       content with the superficial kind of social analysis that       deals merely with effects and does not grapple with       underlying causes. It is unfortunate that demonstrations are       taking place in Birmingham, but it is even more unfortunate       that the city's white power structure left the Negro       community with no alternative.        In any nonviolent campaign there are four basic steps:       collection of the facts to determine whether injustices       exist; negotiation; self purification; and direct action. We       have gone through all these steps in Birmingham. There can be       no gainsaying the fact that racial injustice engulfs this       community. Birmingham is probably the most thoroughly       segregated city in the United States. Its ugly record of       brutality is widely known. Negroes have experienced grossly       unjust treatment in the courts. There have been more unsolved       bombings of Negro homes and churches in Birmingham than in       any other city in the nation. These are the hard, brutal       facts of the case. On the basis of these conditions, Negro       leaders sought to negotiate with the city fathers. But the       latter consistently refused to engage in good faith       negotiation.    Dr. King's letter continues:         Then, last September, came the opportunity to talk with       leaders of Birmingham's economic community. In the course of       the negotiations, certain promises were made by the       merchants--for example, to remove the stores' humiliating       racial signs. On the basis of these promises, the Reverend       Fred Shuttlesworth and the leaders of the Alabama Christian       Movement for Human Rights agreed to a moratorium on all       demonstrations. As the weeks and months went by, we realized       that we were the victims of a broken promise. A few signs,       briefly removed, returned; the others remained. As the weeks       and months went by, we realized that we were the victims       of a broken promise. A few signs, briefly removed,       returned; the others remained. As in so many past       experiences, our hopes had been blasted, and the shadow of       deep disappointment settled upon us. We had no alternative       except to prepare for direct action, whereby we would       present our very bodies as a means of laying our case       before the conscience of the local and the national       community. Mindful of the difficulties involved, we       decided to undertake a process of self purification. We       began a series of workshops on nonviolence, and we       repeatedly asked ourselves: ``Are you able to accept blows       without retaliating?'' ``Are you able to endure the ordeal       of jail?''    Dr. King's letter continues:         We decided to schedule our direct action program for the       Easter season, realizing that except for Christmas, this is       the main shopping period of the year. Knowing that a strong       economic-withdrawal program would be the by product of direct       action, we felt that this would be the best time to bring       pressure to bear on the merchants for the needed change.        Then it occurred to us that Birmingham's mayoral election       was coming up in March, and we speedily decided to postpone       action until after election day. When we discovered that the       Commissioner of Public Safety, Eugene ``Bull'' Connor, had       piled up enough votes to be in the run off, we decided again       to postpone action until the day after the run off so that       the demonstrations could not be used to cloud the issues.    Dr. King continued:         Like many others, we waited to see Mr. Connor defeated, and       to this end we endured postponement after postponement.       Having  [[Page S2310]]       aided in this community need, we felt that our direct action       program could be delayed no longer.    Madam President, I yield the floor to the Senator from California,  Ms. Harris.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy  of my opening statement at the Subcommittee on Energy and Water  Development's budget hearing for the Department of Energy's fiscal year  2020 budget request be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:            Department of Energy Fiscal Year 2020 Budget Request          The Subcommittee on Energy and Water       Development will please come to order.        Today's hearing will review the administration's fiscal       year 2020 budget request for the Department of Energy.        This is the Subcommittee's first budget hearing this year.        We will have three additional hearings with the National       Nuclear Security Administration, the Corps of Engineers and       Bureau of Reclamation, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission       over the next five weeks. Senator Feinstein and I will each       have an opening statement.        I will then recognize each Senator for up to five minutes       for an opening statement, alternating between the majority       and minority, in the order in which they arrived.        We will then turn to Secretary Perry for his testimony on       behalf of the Department of Energy.        At the conclusion of Secretary Perry's testimony, I will       then recognize Senators for five minutes of questions each,       alternating between the majority and minority in the order in       which they arrived. Earlier this week I proposed a New       Manhattan Project for Clean Energy, a five year project with       Ten Grand Challenges that will use American research and       technology to put our country and the world firmly on a path       toward clean, cheaper energy.        Meeting these Grand Challenges would create breakthroughs       in advanced nuclear reactors, natural gas, carbon capture,       better batteries, greener buildings, electric vehicles,       cheaper solar and fusion. To provide the tools to create       these breakthroughs, the federal government should double its       funding for energy research and keep the United States number       one in the world in advanced computing. This strategy takes       advantage of the United States' secret weapon, our       extraordinary capacity for basic research especially at our       17 national laboratories. It will strengthen our economy and       raise our family incomes.        As we review the Department of Energy's fiscal year 2020       budget request today and work on drafting the Energy and       Water Development Appropriations bill, I will be keeping       these Ten Grand Challenges in mind.        I would like to thank Secretary Perry for being here today.       This is Secretary Perry's third year to testify before the       subcommittee.        I also want to thank Senator Feinstein, with whom I have       the pleasure to work with again this year to draft the Energy       and Water Development Appropriations bill. Our subcommittee       has a good record of being the first of appropriations bills       to be considered by the Committee and by the Senate each       year. For each of the past four years, Senator Feinstein and       I have been able to have our bill signed into law.        Last year, we worked together in a bipartisan way on the       fiscal year 2019 Energy and Water Development Appropriations       bill that was signed into law before the start of the fiscal       year--the first time that happened since 2000.        We provided $6.585 billion for the Department's Office of       Science, the fourth consecutive year of record level funding,       which supports basic science and energy research at our 17       national laboratories and is the nation's largest supporter       of research in the physical sciences.        The bill also provided $366 million for ARPA-E, to continue       the important research and development investments into high-      impact energy technologies--another record funding level in a       regular appropriations bill.        We also provided $1.3 billion for Department's Office of       Nuclear Energy, which is responsible for research and       development of advanced reactors and small modular reactors.       Finally, the bill we passed last year provided $15.2 billion       for the National Nuclear Security Administration, including       record funding levels for our Weapons Program and Naval       Reactors.        This year, the Department of Energy's budget request is       about $3.9 billion below what Congress provided last year.  [[Page S2321]]         I'm pleased that the Department's budget request       prioritizes supercomputing, and includes approximately $809       million to deploy exascale systems in the early 2020's.        Unfortunately, the budget request this year again proposes       to decrease spending on federally funded research and       development, terminates ARPA-E and the loan guarantee       programs, and cuts other funding, specifically:        The Office of Science by $1 billion;        Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy by $2 billion;        Nuclear Energy by $502 million; and        Fossil Energy by $178 million.        And that is why we are holding this hearing: to give       Secretary Perry an opportunity to discuss the Department's       priorities, so Senator Feinstein and I can make informed       decisions as we begin to write the fiscal year 2020 Energy       and Water Development Appropriations bill over the next few       weeks. Governing is about setting priorities, and we always       have to make some hard decisions to ensure the highest       priorities are funded.        Today, I'd like to focus my questions on five main areas,       all with an eye toward setting priorities: Prioritizing       federal support for science and energy research; Maintaining       a safe and effective nuclear weapons stockpile; Demonstrating       that we can build safe, affordable advanced reactors; Keeping       America first in supercomputing; and Solving the nuclear       waste stalemate. The Department of Energy's research programs       have made the United States a world leader in science and       technology, and these programs will help the United States       maintain its brainpower advantage to remain competitive at a       time when other countries are investing heavily in research.      Demonstrating that We Can Build Safe, Affordable Advanced Reactors         Today, nuclear power accounts for 60% of our carbon-free       electricity and, if we are going to slow the effects of       climate change, nuclear power will be necessary into the       future. However, the cost to build and operate today's large       nuclear reactors is too high. If we don't do something soon,       nuclear power will not have a future in the United States.       Advanced reactors have the potential to be smaller, cheaper,       less wasteful, and safer than today's reactors.        To demonstrate their potential, we need to build some of       these advanced reactors, enable them to get licensed, and       make sure they are available to replace the existing reactors       when they come offline. Secretary Perry, I'd like to hear       your views on this, including whether you think it would be       helpful for the Department of Energy, working with the       private sector and the National Laboratories, to manage a       program that would build and demonstrate current advanced       reactor technologies.          Maintaining a Safe and Effective Nuclear Weapons Stockpile         A key pillar of our national defense is a strong nuclear       deterrent. Last February, the administration issued an       updated nuclear policy, called the Nuclear Posture Review.       The updated Nuclear Posture Review recommends continuing many       of the things Congress has been working on for the last       several years--things that I support, including: continuing       Life Extension Programs to make sure our current nuclear       weapons remain safe and effective; and continuing to invest       in the facilities we need to maintain our nuclear weapons       stockpile. This includes the Uranium Processing Facility, the       Plutonium Facility, and the facilities to process lithium and       tritium.        I'm pleased to know the Department continues to make       progress on construction of the nuclear buildings for the       Uranium Processing Facility, and I'll be asking some       questions about that project today. The Nuclear Posture       Review also calls for two low yield warheads to be added to       the stockpile, largely in response to capabilities being       developed by Russia and other countries, and I know the       Department is working on this important issue.        I'd like to hear more about that today, and look forward to       hearing about the progress being made on the Uranium       Processing Facility.        China, Japan, the U.S. and the European Union all want to       be first in supercomputing. The stakes are high because the       winner has an advantage in advanced manufacturing, simulating       advanced reactors and weapons before they are built, finding       terrorists and saving billions of Medicaid waste, and       simulating the electric grid in a natural disaster, and other       progress.        The U.S. regained the number one spot last year, thanks to       sustained funding by Congress during both the Obama and Trump       administrations. I am pleased that this budget request       proposes to continue development of exascale supercomputers--      the next generation of supercomputers that will develop a       system a thousand times faster than the first supercomputer       the U.S. built in 2008.        To ensure that nuclear power has a strong future in this       country, we must solve the decades' long stalemate over what       to do with used fuel from our nuclear reactors. Senator       Feinstein and I have been working on this problem for years,       and I'd like to take the opportunity to compliment Senator       Feinstein on her leadership and her insistence that we find a       solution to this problem. To solve the stalemate, we need to       find places to build geologic repositories and temporary       storage facilities so the federal government can finally meet       its legal obligation to dispose of nuclear waste safely and       permanently.        This year's budget request for the Department of Energy       includes $110 million to restart work for Yucca Mountain       repository and $6.5 million to study ways to open an interim       storage site or use a private interim storage site. I       strongly believe that Yucca Mountain can and should be part       of the solution to the nuclear waste stalemate. Federal law       designates Yucca Mountain as the nation's repository for used       nuclear fuel, and the Commission's own scientists have told       us that we can safely store nuclear waste there for up to one       million years.        But even if we had Yucca Mountain open today, we would       still need to look for another permanent repository. We have       more than enough used fuel to fill Yucca Mountain to its       legal capacity. So Senator Feinstein and I, working with the       leaders of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,       Senator Murkowski and then Senators Bingaman, Wyden,       Cantwell, and now Senator Manchin, have a bill to implement       the recommendations of the President's Blue Ribbon Commission       on America's Nuclear Future, which we're working to       reintroduce this year.        The legislation complements Yucca Mountain, and would       create a new federal agency to find additional permanent       repositories and temporary facilities for used nuclear fuel.       But the quickest, and probably the least expensive, way for       the federal government to start to meet its used nuclear fuel       obligations is for the Department of Energy to contract with       a private storage facility for used nuclear fuel.        Two years ago, you told this subcommittee that the       Department of Energy has the authority to take title to used       nuclear fuel, but you were hesitant to agree that it has the       authority to store the used fuel at a private facility       without more direction from Congress. I understand that two       private companies have submitted license applications to the       NRC for private consolidated storage facilities, one in Texas       and one in New Mexico, and that the NRC's review is well       underway.        I look forward to working with Secretary Perry as we begin       putting together our Energy and Water Development       Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2020 and hearing what       Secretary Perry's priorities are. I also expect that the       Department will continue to fund projects consistent with       Congressional intent in the fiscal year 2019 Consolidated       Appropriations Act.        I will now recognize Senator Feinstein for her opening       statement.                            ____________________     Madam President, nearly two years ago, just before the  Senate voted to confirm Dr. Gottlieb to lead the Food and Drug  Administration, FDA, I said that he was ``the right person to lead the  FDA in [its] vital mission and move the agency forward so that  America's patients can benefit from the remarkable discoveries . . .  that our nation's researchers are working on.''   Since then, Dr. Gottlieb's leadership at FDA has proved that  prediction correct.   Dr. Gottlieb has been one of the President's best appointments.   Two years ago, I also said that ``there's never been a more important  time to capitalize on the significant funding Congress has given to  medical research.''   Congress has given the National Institutes of Health, NIH, a $9  billion increase from 2015-2019, almost $40 billion dollars in 2019,  and FDA plays a key role in bringing new treatments and cures to  American patients.   In 2016, Congress passed what Leader McConnell called the most  important legislation of the Congress, the 21st Century Cures Act, to  help speed the development of new drugs and devices.   This exciting time in medicine also brings great promise to patients  to lower the cost of medicine, as more promising treatments come to  market, we see increased competition, which helps to drive down how  much patients pay for medicines they need.   Dr. Gottlieb's successful tenure at the agency includes helping to  bring more competition to the market. In 2018, FDA approved or  tentatively approved over 1,000 generic drugs, approved 34 novel orphan  drugs, which are drugs to treat rare diseases, and designated 18  regenerative medicines as regenerative medicine advanced therapies, so  they can be reviewed faster.   Here are just a few other important things Dr. Gottlieb has  accomplished:   When Dr. Gottlieb took over at FDA, Congress was working to  reauthorize the four medical product user fee agreements that make up  about a third of FDA's funding.   In addition to reauthorizing the four user fee agreements, Congress  worked with Dr. Gottlieb and authorized an expedited approval process  for generic  [[Page S2322]]  drugs where there is little or no market competition, called the  Competitive Generic Therapies pathway, as part of the FDA  Reauthorization Act of 2017.   Since August 2018, FDA has approved five new generic drugs under this  pathway and has designated over 140 generic drug applications as  qualifying for this pathway.   Dr. Gottlieb also announced a new plan, called the Biosimilar Action  Plan, to bring generic versions of biologic drugs, called biosimilars,  to help improve competition for biologics by increasing market entry of  biosimilars and providing more treatment options for patients.   FDA has approved a total of 18 biosimilar products since 2010, when  the biosimilar pathway was created, 13 of which were approved under Dr.  Gottlieb's watch.   At his confirmation hearing, Dr. Gottlieb described the opioid crisis  as ``having staggering human consequences. I think it's the biggest  crisis facing the agency. . . . I think it's going to require an all- of-the-above approach . . .''   Last year, 72 senators worked on legislation to combat the opioid  crisis.   Dr. Gottlieb provided us with crucial advice as we worked on this  legislation and has begun to take advantage of the new law.   He has taken steps to help prevent illicit fentanyl, which is 100  times more powerful than heroin, from coming across the border.   He worked with Congress to clarify his authority to require opioids  to be packaged in blister packs, such as a 3 or 7-day supply, to  encourage doctors to prescribe responsibly; and clarified FDA's  authority to require safe disposal options to accompany opioid  packaging.   Dr. Collins, who leads the NIH, has predicted a nonaddictive opioid  in the next decade, which really is the Holy Grail for fighting the  opioid crisis and for helping the 50-100 million Americans living with  pain.   I believe Dr. Gottlieb has laid groundwork to encourage the  development of nonaddictive and nonopioid medicines and therapies to  treat pain.   Dr. Gottlieb was integral to Congress's ability to reauthorize the  animal drug user fees, which authorize the FDA to collect user fees to  speed the review and approval of new drugs that farmers, families, and  veterinarians rely on to keep their animals healthy and the food supply  safe.   The 21st Century Cures Act created the Regenerative Medicine Advanced  Therapy Designation, which is similar to the very successful  breakthrough drug pathway that safely shortened the development and  review time for certain drugs, to get them to patients who need them  more quickly.   While we worked on that law, I heard the story of Nashville resident  Doug Oliver.   In 2007, Doug began to have trouble seeing and, after a near  accident, had his driver's license taken away and was declared legally  blind.   The culprit was a rare form of macular degeneration.   His doctor at the Vanderbilt Eye Institute told him that while there  were no cures, Doug could search online for a clinical trial.   Doug found a regenerative medicine clinical trial in Florida, where  doctors took cells out of the bone marrow in his hip, spun them in a  centrifuge, and then injected those into his eye.   Three days later, he began to see.   His eyesight eventually improved enough to get his driver's license  back, and he became an effective advocate for more support for  regenerative medicine, which we included in the 21st Century Cures Act.   So, with his improved vision, he began writing letters and visiting  me to advocate for more support for regenerative medicine, which we did  in the 21st Century Cures Act.   Two years ago, Doug gave me the cane he had used while he was blind.  He said: ``I don't need it anymore.''   In Cures, we included a pathway to bring new regenerative medicine  treatments, similar to the treatment Doug received, to patients more  quickly.   Dr. Gottlieb has worked to implement that new pathway to help develop  safe treatments to ensure more patients are able to take advantage of  this cutting-edge, personalized medical technology.   Additionally, Dr. Gottlieb has helped the agency develop and advance  guidances for gene therapies that will help new innovative companies  developing these promising therapies, some of which may be for specific  diseases and conditions that provide roadmaps for biotechnology  companies who are leading the way in precision medicine.   During this exciting time in biomedical research, we are fortunate  that Dr. Gottlieb was willing to serve.   The FDA and the biomedical community is in better shape today to  advance medical innovation and develop the treatments and cures of the  future because of his leadership.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of  my opening statement at the Subcommittee on Energy and Water  Development's budget hearing for the National Nuclear Security  Administration's fiscal year 2020 budget request be printed in the  Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:     National Nuclear Security Administration Fiscal Year 2020 Budget                                  Request          The Subcommittee on Energy and Water       Development will please come to order.        Today's hearing will review the administration's fiscal       year 2020 budget request for the National Nuclear Security       Administration.        This is the second of the Subcommittee's four budget       hearings this year.        We heard from Secretary Perry last week, and we'll have two       more hearings in the coming weeks to review the Nuclear       Regulatory Commission and the Army Corps of Engineers and the       Bureau of Reclamation budget requests.        Senator Feinstein and I will each have an opening       statement.        I will then recognize each Senator for up to five minutes       for an opening statement, alternating between the majority       and minority, in the order in which they arrived.        We will then turn to Administrator Lisa Gordon-Hagerty to       present testimony on behalf of the National Nuclear Security       Administration and then give Admiral Frank Caldwell an       opportunity to give a brief statement.        At the conclusion of the witnesses' testimony, I will then       recognize Senators for five minutes of questions each,       alternating between the majority and minority in the order in       which they arrived.        First, I would like to thank our witnesses for being here       today, and also Senator Feinstein, with whom I have the       pleasure to work with again this year to draft the Energy and       Water Appropriations bill.        Our witnesses today include: Ms. Lisa Gordon-Hagerty, the       Administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration       (NNSA); Dr. Charles Verdon, Deputy Administrator for Defense       Programs; Dr. Brent Park, Deputy Administrator for Defense       Nuclear Nonproliferation (Dr. Park is a former Associate       Laboratory Director from Oak Ridge National Laboratory); and       Admiral Frank Caldwell, Deputy Administrator for Naval       Reactors.        Our subcommittee has a good record of being the first of       the appropriations bills to be considered by the Committee       and by the Senate each year. For each of the past four years,       Senator Feinstein and I have been able to have our bill       signed into law.        Last year, we worked together in a bipartisan way on the       fiscal year 2019 Energy and Water Development Appropriations       bill that was signed into law before the start of the fiscal       year--the first time that happened since 2000.        In last year's appropriations bill we provided $15.2       billion for the National Nuclear Security Administration,       including $1.9 billion for the six life extension programs,       which fix or replace components in weapons systems to make       sure they're safe and reliable.        We also funded the Uranium Processing Facility at the Y-12       National Security Complex at $703 million, which will       continue to keep this project on time and on budget, with a       completion year of 2025 at a cost no greater than $6.5       billion.        I look forward to working with Senator Feinstein on another       strong bill this year.        We're here today to review the administration's fiscal year       2020 budget request for the National Nuclear Security       Administration (NNSA), the semi-autonomous agency within the       Department of Energy that is responsible for a vital       mission--maintaining our nuclear weapons stockpile, reducing       the global dangers posed by weapons of mass destruction, and       providing the Navy with safe and effective nuclear power.        The president's fiscal year 2020 budget request for the       NNSA is $16.5 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion (or 8       percent) over last year (the fiscal year 2019 enacted level).        Today, I'd like to focus my remarks and questions on three       main areas:        1. Effectively maintaining our nuclear weapons stockpile;        2. Keeping critical projects on time and on budget; and        3. Supporting our nuclear Navy.        When the Senate agreed to ratify the New Start Treaty in       December 2010, we also agreed to support funding to modernize       and maintain our nuclear weapons stockpile, plus the       facilities to do the work. A vital part of NNSA's mission is       completion of the five ongoing life extension programs, which       fix or replace components in weapons systems to make sure       they're safe and reliable. The budget request includes $2.1       billion to continue the life extension programs. I want to       make sure we are spending taxpayer dollars effectively.        Completing all of the work that needs to be done for these       weapons systems will result in a higher workload than the       weapons program has had in any time since the height of the       Cold War, and it will require a large number of highly-      trained experts at the production sites, like Y-12 in Oak       Ridge Tennessee, the weapons laboratories, and the federal       employees that work for NNSA. I'd like to hear more today       about whether NNSA has enough qualified people to do this       work. I would also like to discuss today whether NNSA will be       able to keep the life extension programs on time and on       budget.        The NNSA is responsible for some of the largest       construction projects in the federal government. Senator       Feinstein and I have worked hard to keep costs from       skyrocketing. We want to make sure hard-earned taxpayer       dollars are spent wisely and that these projects are on time       and on budget.        First we focused on our oversight on the Uranium Processing       Facility in Tennessee. We held routine meetings with the       Department's leadership to discuss the project--particularly       how the Department implemented the recommendations of a Red       Team review, completed in 2014, to get the project on track.        After completing more than 90% of the design for the       nuclear facilities, NNSA began construction of the Uranium       Processing Facility last year. I'd like to hear more about       the progress on construction from the witnesses today.        Senator Feinstein and I also worked with the Department on       ways to get excess plutonium out of South Carolina more       quickly and for less cost. Last year, Secretary Perry       canceled the MOX project in favor of the Dilute and Disposal       alternative, which the Department of Energy estimated will       save taxpayers more than $20 billion. I'd like to hear more       today on the progress NNSA is making at removing the       plutonium from South Carolina.        Lastly, the NNSA is restarting our ability to make       plutonium pits for the stockpile. The budget request includes       $712 million for plutonium sustainment, which is 97% more       than the current funding level. This difficult, but important       work, will be done in New Mexico and South Carolina. The NNSA       has  [[Page S2324]]       decided to use existing facilities and expertise in New       Mexico to make some pits, and repurpose the MOX facility in       South Carolina to make the remainder. That's a good plan and       I support it. I want to hear from Administrator Gordon-      Hagerty today how NNSA is applying the lessons we learned       from UPF and MOX to make sure we get the pit production       restart done on time and on budget.        Naval Reactors is responsible for all aspects of nuclear       power for our submarines and aircraft carriers. Naval       Reactors has a lot on their plate right now--they are       designing a new reactor core for the next class of       submarines, refueling a prototype reactor, and building a new       spent fuel processing facility for nuclear waste from defense       activities.        Admiral Caldwell and I had an opportunity talk about the       new spent fuel processing facility earlier this week. It is a       part of the Navy's consolidated interim storage for its used       nuclear fuel.        The Navy's program shows that it can be done safely and       effectively, but that does not replace the need for a       permanent repository at Yucca Mountain. That used nuclear       fuel will still need to go to Yucca Mountain once it is       built. I look forward to Admiral Caldwell's comments today on       the progress he's making on his important work, and       particularly how Naval Reactors stores used nuclear fuel. I'd       also like to hear what is being done to keep the new       Columbia-Class submarine design on track.        The NNSA needs to complete a lot of important work, and       this work is going to require good planning and effective       oversight. I look forward to working with Administrator       Gordon-Hagerty as we begin putting together our Energy and       Water Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2020, and also with       Senator Feinstein, who I will now recognize for her opening       statement.                            ____________________
