 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Plaskett for starting off this  Special Order hour on racism and discrimination in the age of Trump.  [[Page H4839]]    I really think that this is important and timely that we talk about  this because, as you mentioned, these incidents are on the rise and we  need to start to discuss them. We need to have open and honest, frank  discussions about them, to be quite forward, because, if we don't, then  we are never going to be able to move past this or be able to have a  better America in regards to racism, hate, and discrimination if we  don't begin to have that open dialogue.   Not only does the country need to have an open dialogue, but I think  that, as Members of Congress, we need to be the leaders in this area,  and we should be the ones who are kicking off the dialogue and starting  this.   Make no mistake about it, I know a lot of people will tell you that  racism is dead, that discrimination is a thing of the past, that it was  something that happened to people that are baby boomers and older and  that the effects of discrimination are no longer with us, but we know  that is not true.   We know that, again, as Ms. Plaskett just mentioned a second ago,  since 2016, there has been a disturbing number of incidents that have  occurred, a disturbing number of things that have been said, things  that have been tweeted, the rise of the alt-right, and so many other  things that we should be concerned about.   The Southern Poverty Law Center supports this very claim. This  organization has collected over 1,300 reported bias incidents between  the day after the election and February 7.   Let me point out, because I know that, sadly, there are some people  that will cast doubt towards the Southern Poverty Law Center, but the  Southern Poverty Law Center has done a tremendous job over the last  couple of decades or so of not only helping identify people that commit  acts, but groups like the KKK, neo-Nazi groups, and others.   Quite frankly, I don't know why anyone would want to try to undermine  or put down an organization that wants to put down groups like that,  like the KKK, skinheads, and Nazis. It makes no sense. I hate when I  hear people say bad things about the Southern Poverty Law Center  because of the time, money, and effort that they put into fighting  groups like I just mentioned.   Let me be clear, because oftentimes when we talk about race, it turns  into a very divisive topic, and we don't need for this to be a divisive  topic. We need to sit down, come together, and talk because we need to  create an opportunity here in America where we can change people's  attitudes and make sure that our Nation's history is not repeated.                                time  1930    I also think that, as parents, we have to openly talk about race,  bigotry, and hate with our children. One of the things that disturbs me  as a parent and, quite frankly, just as a proud American is I will hear  people say: Well, I don't say racist things in my house, so my kids  would never hear that. If kids are saying racist things, then it must  be because they are hearing it at home.   But I have to tell you, as a parent of an 11-year-old, I know that  there are influences outside of my home. I know that there is a lot of  peer pressure on kids. I know there are a lot of things on social  media, and kids want to fit in. Kids want to be cool. So you can never  utter one bad thing about a different nationality or race or someone of  a different sexual orientation than yours in your house, and your kid  could still end up being caught up in something bad like bigotry or  racism just because of inappropriate influences at school.   That is why it is important, in my opinion, that, as parents, we talk  about this with our children, as uncomfortable as it may make us, but  we need to have the discussion. We need to know and our children need  to know that it is important to us that we recognize other people's  culture; that we recognize other people's faith and sexual orientation  and religion so that, as they are forming and they are growing, they  understand that this is a nation that is a great nation that is open to  everybody, regardless of race, ethnic, or gender background.   I know that for some people, having to talk about racism, it can be  very uncomfortable because it makes people guilty. A lot of times when  it comes up or you are talking about this, you just--you hear people  trying to come up with different examples to sort of assuage any sort  of guilt that they may have. It makes them very uncomfortable.   But, again, we have to tackle this head-on. We have to come together  to confront these issues of social injustice because it really is time  that our Nation heals. It is time that our Nation heals and it is time  that we break the chains of our plagued history.   I know that we have other Members here on the House floor that want  to talk, and I have some things that I am going to mention a little bit  later, just some of the unfortunate incidents that have happened with  the President, with the Commander in Chief, the history that he has  with racism that I would, quite frankly, like to see him address.  Whether it is HUD discrimination, Central Park joggers, after they were  exonerated by DNA, I think that his comments were: ``Well, they still  did something bad,'' so on and so on. Just some of the issues at the  casino that he owned in New Jersey, we need to talk about those.   Quite frankly, he can be a leader--he can actually be a leader in  discussing these incidents that happened under his control and under  his command, whether it was at his private corporation or whether it  was commenting on the Central Park joggers, about how it was a learning  experience for him, how he is never going to let it happen again, and  how he is never going to let those words utter out of his mouth.   But before I go into that, I am going to turn it back over to the  Representative Plaskett from the Virgin Islands. I, again, thank her  very much for kicking this off.    Absolutely. We do need action taken by this  administration, Representative Plaskett.   I mentioned to you earlier that I wanted to talk about the  President's history on racism and some of the things that came out in  the campaign--not anything new but, nevertheless, very disturbing--and  why we need for the President honestly to lead this discussion.                                General Leave     Very briefly, we have the President's history on racism  from the very beginning of his candidacy, of course, and the way he  disparaged Mexicans and Mexican Americans in this country by calling  people rapists and accusing people of bringing disease and crime into  the United States, pretending that he didn't know who David Duke was.  It is unbelievable, pretending to not know who David Duke was.    Even condoning the beating of a Black Lives Matter  protester, his history extends before that.   Of course, it was very well covered, very well chronicled during the  campaign about the Justice Department suing his real estate company and  his father's real estate company for not renting apartments to Black  people, not renting apartments to African-American potential tenants.  Of course, they ultimately settled that lawsuit because of the  wrongdoing that happened there.    The gentlewoman is absolutely correct.   In 1989, he encouraged and celebrated the wrongful imprisonment of  the Central Park Five and took out full-page ads in New York area  newspapers calling for the return of the death penalty in response to a  very infamous case in which a woman was beaten and raped while jogging  in Manhattan's Central Park.   Back then, before he was President, Donald Trump said: They should be  forced to suffer, and when they kill, they should be executed for their  crimes. I want these murderers and always will.   Of course, there was a lot of public outrage over that case. It was  very well talked about. It was on all the talk shows and what have you.   Those men wrongfully spent time in prison because the DNA evidence  exonerated them.    They were teenagers at the time.   Even after the DNA evidence exonerated them, he still said that maybe  they could be guilty of something. I thought that was a terrible thing  to say.   Of course, the New Jersey Casino Control Commission fined Trump Plaza  Hotel and Casino $200,000 in 1992 because managers would remove  African-American car dealers at the request of certain big-time  gamblers that would come in.   In 1996, 20 African Americans in Indiana sued Trump for failing to  honor a promise to hire mostly minority workers for a riverboat casino  on Lake Michigan.   Let me tell you why, even despite this, the President has the ability  to lead a discussion on race.   You might remember Shirley Sherrod. I don't know if that name rings a  bell with you. She was an African-American agricultural worker who  worked for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Georgia Department  of Agriculture, and was given an example of how she overcame her own  bias and her own racism.   Of course, her comments were misconstrued and the tapes were made to  sound one way. She ultimately lost her job. She was offered her job  back after it was proven this conservative newspaper had actually tried  to disparage her so they could have some sort of a racism equivalent or  something to try to make the readers feel better.   The reason why I bring that up is because here was a woman that was  being honest about and trying to give an example about how she overcame  bias and how she overcame prejudice. The President has an opportunity  to talk about Central Park, to talk about racism in his apartments, to  talk about the issues at the casino, to talk about the other areas in  his life where he has fallen quite short when it comes to fairness and  honesty and racism. So we need him to lead that discussion so we can  begin to talk more and begin to heal our country.
