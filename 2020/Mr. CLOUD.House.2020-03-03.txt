 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to congratulate Mrs. Stacie  Konvicka, who was this year's recipient of the Educator of the Year  Award from the Wharton County Chamber of Commerce and Agriculture.   This award is given to a teacher who exemplifies professionalism,  dedication, leadership, and enthusiasm.   Mrs. Konvicka is a fourth grade math and science teacher at Wharton  Elementary School.   Having been a teacher for 22 years, she has learned the value of  going above and beyond for her students in the classroom.   Wharton Elementary School is a title I campus, which means over 90  percent of the students come from economically disadvantaged homes.   Mrs. Konvicka invests so much into her students. At the end of the  day, she wants to ensure that they feel cared for.   Many have benefited from her high-quality instruction as they are  pushed to do their best.   American ragtime composer Scott Hayden once said: ``Teachers have  three loves: the love of learning, the love of learners, and the love  of bringing the first two loves together.''   Mrs. Stacie Konvicka has these three loves, and we, as south Texans,  are thankful for her service in lovingly shaping the minds of future  generations.                        Remembering Marie Jordan Speer     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember Marie Jordan Speer,  who passed away at 98 years of age in Corpus Christi, Texas, on October  19, 2019.   Marie's kindness and compassion touched the lives of those around  her, and through her various achievements, she served her community  well.   In 1942, she married Mr. Edward Jordan, but 2 years later, he was  drafted to fight in World War II and heroically, but tragically, died  in combat.   Marie ultimately used her suffering and loss to help others. She  founded the Gold Star Wives of America in order to comfort and create a  community for other widows who had lost their husbands in the war.   The first meeting she organized was a lunch with other military  widows from town. This lunch morphed into a small volunteer group,  which, in time, grew into a national organization that today has 35  chapters throughout the United States.   The Gold Star Wives not only provide comfort and support for families  who have lost loved ones; on Capitol Hill, they fight to secure  victories for the spouses and children of fallen soldiers.   We owe these families a debt that we cannot repay. Their husbands and  fathers have made the ultimate sacrifice in order to protect our  country.   Today, and every day, we pray for God's peace for these families.   Marie continued to work on behalf of the Gold Star Wives, eventually  settling in Corpus Christi, Texas, where she started three local  newspapers and became heavily involved in the Coastal Bend community.   South Texas is a better place because of Marie. Her life truly is a  testament to the power of sacrificial love, determination, and  compassion.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Marie's family for sharing Marie with our  Nation. We are sorry for their loss.                            ____________________
