 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the White House has apparently decided to  spend June focusing on the economy.   President Biden kicked things off with an op-ed in the Wall Street  Journal entitled ``My Plan for Fighting Inflation.''   Before he gets to the actual ``plan,'' though, the President spends  the first half of the op-ed touting his supposed economic successes. As  usual, he takes credit for the economy's recovery from COVID-related  woes, even though the recovery was well underway before he became  President and was a natural result of the economy reopening after COVID  shutdowns.   He touts job creation figures without mentioning the fact that  businesses are struggling to find workers to fill jobs. He touts the  number of new small business applications in 2021 without mentioning  that small business optimism is at its lowest level since April 2020 at  the height of the pandemic shutdowns. And he mentions ``millions of  Americans getting jobs with better pay,'' while leaving out the fact  that inflation continues to outstrip wage growth, meaning that, on  average, Americans are experiencing a de facto pay cut.   In all, he spends multiple paragraphs attempting to convince  Americans that the economy is thriving, which I have to think feels  pretty meaningless to the millions of Americans struggling with massive  increases in the cost of gas, groceries, and other everyday goods.   In fact, a poll released yesterday found that just 27 percent of  Americans believe they have a good chance of improving their standard  of living, and it is no wonder. The President can talk about his  supposed economic achievements all he wants, but that means little to  Americans who have seen their disposable income eaten up by price hikes  or whose raise failed to keep even pace with the increase in the cost  of living.   And, of course, the President completely omits the fact that it was  his economic plans that helped create our current inflation crisis in  the first place. When President Biden took office, inflation was at 1.4  percent, well within the Federal Reserve's target inflation rate of 2  percent. Today, it is at 8.3 percent, near a 40-year high.   And how did we get from there to here? In substantial part, via the  President's so-called American Rescue Plan. Democrats' massive partisan  spending spree flooded the economy with unnecessary government money,  and the  [[Page S2798]]  economy overheated as a result. But that is not something the President  mentions when he talks about fighting inflation.   So what is the President's so-called plan to fight inflation?   Well, after spending half the op-ed touting his supposed economic  successes, the President finally gets to the plan part, and the first  part of his three-part plan involves having someone else address  inflation. Controlling inflation, the President says, is primarily the  job of the Federal Reserve, and he is going to leave them alone to do  that job.   The next part of the President's plan involves things like fixing  broken supply chains and boosting the productive capacity of our  economy over time.   Now, I am a big supporter of improving our supply chains, which is  why I have introduced the Ocean Shipping Reform Act, which, hopefully,  will pass the House of Representatives and head to the President's desk  soon. But given that the President has so far demonstrated little  progress in addressing supply chain challenges, I am not holding my  breath waiting for the White House to take action.   I am also a big fan of boosting the productive capacity of our  economy. My concern is that the President fails to give any examples of  how he might actually do that. He mentions high gas prices, but instead  of talking about ways to address high energy prices by unleashing  American energy production, he pivots to touting his release from the  Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a highly temporary band aid that did next  to nothing to address the cause of high gas prices, except for briefly  causing their rise to what are record highs.   He also claims Congress can help by passing his clean-energy tax  credits and investments--which he says would result in a $500 decrease  in utility bills for American families. First, nothing about the  President's clean-energy tax credits is likely to drive down energy  prices, especially in the near term, and Americans can't afford to  wait.   In fact, for Americans to take advantage of some of these credits,  they would need to spend more money--on an electric car, for example-- which is how the administration suggests Americans deal with these  historic gas prices.   And the President's claim that his energy tax credits and investments  would decrease utility bills for American families by $500 is 100  percent false.   And you don't have to take my word for it. The Washington Post Fact  Checker column gave the President's claim four--four Pinocchios--a  rating that the Post reserves for, and I quote, ``whoppers.''   And if the President has the idea that his tax credits can somehow  magically move the United States to a place that we can abandon gas and  oil overnight, well, he has another thing coming. No matter how much  Democrats might wish it were otherwise, the fact of the matter is that  clean energy technology has simply not advanced to the point where we  can replace all traditional energy resources with renewables. And  pretending--pretending that we don't need gas and oil--or discouraging  American oil and gas production will only result in higher energy  prices for American consumers.   If the President really wanted to reduce gas prices and ``boost the  productive capacity of our economy over time,'' as he said in his op- ed, he would embrace American energy production, including conventional  energy production.   Instead, he is doing the opposite. He continues to discourage  domestic production of conventional energy sources that Americans rely  on. And the result is likely to be continued high energy prices well  into the future.   Finally, the President turns to the third part of his plan to fight  inflation, and that is reducing the deficit. Unfortunately, it is a  little hard to take the President seriously on this issue. The  President touts a Congressional Budget Office prediction that the  deficit will fall by $1.7 trillion this year.   What the President doesn't mention is that the reason this year's  projected deficit drop looks so substantial is because Democrats  inflated the deficit last year with their American Rescue Plan spending  spree. Of course, the deficit will look lower this year without a  massive $1.9 trillion piece of legislation financed entirely with  deficit spending.   And I am not getting my hopes up about future deficit drops, since  many Democrats still want to use reconciliation rules to force through  another big, party-line Democrat spending bill. This one is $5  trillion. If they come up with a proposal that is anything like their  original Build Back Better proposal, we will undoubtedly be looking at  more deficit spending.   One news outlet had this to say about President Biden's op-ed and his  plan to reduce the deficit:         Is it really a `plan' when the President points fingers?       While the president's op-ed purports to lay out a plan for       addressing inflation, a close read shows that he actually       seems to be pushing the burden off on others . . .    That is a fair assessment. Unfortunately, it is pretty par for the  course for President Biden. He is happy to take credit for positive  economic numbers even when he had nothing to do with them, but when it  comes to taking responsibility for a situation, he is frequently  nowhere to be found.   He won't acknowledge that his own economic proposal, the American  Rescue Plan, helped create our inflation crisis in the first place.  Indeed, he largely ignored the inflation crisis until it started to  become absolutely necessary for him to address it, if he wanted to  survive politically.   And he has displayed a similar lack of ownership of crises on his  watch. The actions he has taken to weaken border security and  immigration enforcement have helped create an unprecedented immigration  crisis on the southern border.   But from the President's attitude you barely even know that there is  a problem, much less one that he has a particular responsibility to  address.   His hostile attitude toward American energy production helped drive  up gas prices and left families struggling--struggling--to fill their  cars. Yet the President is ready to push off responsibility for  conventional energy production to other nations, leaving our Nation  less secure and even more vulnerable to price spikes.   The President closes his op-ed by noting:         The economic policy choices we make today will determine       whether a sustained recovery that benefits all Americans is       possible.    Well, the President is right about that. Unfortunately, it is pretty  clear that the economic policy choices that he is making are wrong.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from North Dakota (Mr. Cramer).
