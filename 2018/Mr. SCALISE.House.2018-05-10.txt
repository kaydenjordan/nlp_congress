 Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague from Illinois (Mr.  Shimkus) for his leadership on this issue. For so long we have been  trying to get a solution and to get proper use made out of Yucca  Mountain and the billions of dollars that ratepayers all across the  Nation have spent.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the bipartisan amendment as  well that is brought forward by the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  Keating) to bring more light to show the ratepayers of the country what  is exactly happening with this Nuclear Waste Fund.   But the underlying bill is critical to our national energy strategy  because, for decades, going back to the 1980s, this country, through  Congress, established that there will be a national nuclear waste  storage facility, and yet it has gone unused. The money has gone  unutilized, and there is no facility right now that is working.   We have got to make this work for the ratepayers all across the  country who pay billions of dollars into this fund. We need a national  repository for spent nuclear fuel. This bill finally achieves that.   I congratulate my friend, Mr. Shimkus, for spending years finally  getting us to a point where we can move this bill across the House  floor, and hopefully the Senate moves this bill to the President's desk  so we can finally resolve this long-lasting issue that ratepayers all  across the Nation deserve to have an answer to.
