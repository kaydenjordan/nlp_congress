 Madam Speaker, what began with a rallying cry of, ``We are  going to impeach the `expletive deleted,' '' to a crowd of liberal  activists and young children by my colleague from Michigan on the very  first day of this new Congress is now the majority's flagship  initiative. What a shame, and what a waste of time in the people's  House.   In my view, our President was doing his job, ensuring that if  taxpayer dollars from my constituents and yours were going to the other  side of the world, that it would be paired with a commitment to crack  down on corruption at all levels, no matter who someone's daddy is or  what their political ambitions are.   I think we all know that this was inevitable. From the moment Donald  J. Trump was elected, the ends of harassment and impeachment have just  been waiting for the means, and they think that they have found them.  They are wrong.   There is, however, one small measure we can take as one House to  bring a shred of dignity to these disgraceful proceedings. I can stand  and be counted. We can stand and be counted, one by one, and announce  our ``yea'' or ``nay'' with a vote by a call of the roll.
