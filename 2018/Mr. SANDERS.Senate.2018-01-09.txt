 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of nearly  800,000 Dreamers, young people who were brought to this country as  children who today are living in fear and uncertainty. As a result of  the Trump administration's decision to end the DACA Program, these  young people are at risk of losing their legal status and, in fact,  face deportation from the only home that most of them have ever known,  and that home is the United States of America.   This is one of the great moral issues of our time, and it is an issue  that must be dealt with now as part of the budget negotiations. It  cannot be kicked down the road any longer. We must pass the Dream Act  now as part of the current budget negotiations.   In the last 6 years since the DACA Program was established, these  young people--again, people who were brought to this country as  infants, in many cases--were finally able to breathe a sigh of relief.  For the first time in their lives, they could walk the streets of this  country without fear, without worrying about being arrested, without  worrying about being deported. Think about what it means to live in  this country every single day knowing that, at any moment, you could be  arrested or deported. What DACA finally did is to give these 800,000  young people a legal status and a protection so they could go out and  work, so they could go to school, and so they could serve in the U.S.  military without fear.   As we all know, tragically, on September 5, 2017, President Trump  announced the end of the DACA Program through Executive order.  President Obama had established it through Executive order, and  President Trump ended it through Executive order. In his announcement,  President Trump noted:         I look forward to working with Republicans and Democrats in       Congress to finally address all of these issues. As I have       said before, we will resolve the DACA issue with heart and       compassion, but through the lawful democratic process. It is       now time for Congress to act.    That is Donald Trump.   The President was right. It is time for Congress to act. It is time  for Congress to not kick the can down the road.   Our Republican President, Mr. Trump, told the Republican-led Congress  to get to work on a DACA fix, and I say today to the Republican  leadership: Let's do it. Let's do it now. That is what President Trump  asked you to do. Listen to him, and let's do it--not next month, not in  March, but right now--as part of the budget agreement.   People are working on this issue now. We can come to a consensus. We  can pass the Dream Act if there is a political will to do it.   Let us also be very clear. Despite what some have said, this is an  urgent matter that must be addressed now. Since President Trump  rescinded the DACA Program in September, more than 15,000 Dreamers have  already lost their DACA status and are now subject to deportation. Each  day the Congress does not act, 122 people lose their DACA protections,  and 851 people each and every week. This is a matter of urgency, and we  have to act accordingly.   But I want to assure my Republican colleagues that not only is this  the right thing to do from a moral perspective and from an economic  perspective, but it is also exactly what the American people want.  Nobody here is asking anybody in the Senate to rise up and to be  extraordinarily brave and courageous. Why don't you just do what the  American people want us to do? No profiles in courage are needed now.  Poll after poll has shown that the overwhelming majority of the  American people want to provide legal status to the Dreamers and to  protect them from deportation. From a political perspective, this is  not a difficult decision.   A Washington Post-ABC poll from September 2017, a few months ago,  found that 86 percent of Americans support allowing Dreamers to stay in  the United States. So 86 percent of the American people support  providing legal status to Dreamers. This is not a tough political  decision.   Another recent poll conducted by Quinnipiac found that 77 percent of  voters and 65 percent of Republicans support legislation to protect  Dreamers and provide them an opportunity to work, to go to school, and  to pursue a pathway to citizenship.   Another poll conducted by CNN last month found that by an 83-percent  to 13-percent margin, Americans support efforts to allow Dreamers to  remain in the United States instead of facing potential deportation.  Only 15 percent believed that Dreamers should be deported.   Passing the Dream Act is also in our national security interests.  Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates recently noted:         The United States faces extraordinary security challenges       that are placing growing pressure on our Armed Forces. That       is why we need legislation that will provide a pathway to       citizenship for those immigrants who, among other attributes,       are serving or have served in the military, whether they are       in America legally or were brought here illegally as       children.    That is former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates.   In addition, just last week three former Secretaries of Homeland  Security wrote to House and Senate leadership expressing both their  strong support for a DACA fix and for the urgency of acting now.  Secretaries Chertoff, Napolitano, and Johnson warned of the need for  Congress to act immediately and emphasized how the agency needs time to  implement a new program. Without it, they caution that the delay will  sow uncertainty in the business community and drive undocumented  individuals further into the shadows, with immediate deportation  looming for tens of thousands every single month.   Let us be very clear that when we talk about the DACA Program and  when we talk about these young people receiving legal status, these  young people are vetted, they pay a fee, and the vast majority of them  are now at jobs important to our economy. They are in school or they  are in the military. In order to get DACA status, they could not be  convicted of a felony or a significant misdemeanor or pose a threat to  national security or public safety. As almost everybody recognizes,  these  [[Page S92]]  are fine young people whom we should be very proud of and should not be  talking about deporting them.   DACA gave these young people a shot at the American dream, and having  been given that opportunity, they seized it and they are excelling and  contributing to our country--to their country--in so many ways. With 91  percent of DACA recipients in the workforce, they play an important  role in our economy. Many hundreds of Dreamers have taken up the call  to serve in our Armed Forces. Can my colleagues imagine a young Dreamer  now serving in the Armed Forces, putting his or her life on the line to  defend this country, and then reading about Members of Congress who  think we should deport them? How outrageous is that?   Furthermore, there are some 20,000 DACA recipients who are currently  teaching in our schools. We desperately need good teachers, and 20,000  DACA recipients are doing just that.   Yet, because of President Trump's cruel decision to rescind the DACA  Program, as well as the Republican-controlled Congress's failure to  act, these young people's lives and livelihoods have been thrown into  chaos and uncertainty.   It is our job to enact a legislative fix now. The President has  called for a fix. The vast majority of the people of this country want  to see a fix. A fix is important to our national security. It is the  right thing to do. Let us do it.   I am, however, very concerned that President Trump is using the  800,000 Dreamers as a bargaining chip to force the taxpayers of this  country to pay for an $18 billion wall. Now, some may remember that  during his campaign for President, Donald Trump told the American  people that it was the Mexican Government that would be paying for the  wall. Well, it turns out that it didn't quite work out that way, and  now it is the taxpayers of this country who are supposed to pay for a  wall.   Let me be as clear as I can be. We cannot and we must not hold the  lives of 800,000 young Dreamers hostage in order to fund a wall that  the vast majority of the American people oppose. We cannot and we must  not allow Donald Trump to shut down the government to fund this wall,  but that, it appears, may very well be--for whatever reason--what  Donald Trump wants.   Let me remind my colleagues what Donald Trump said last August at a  rally in Arizona, the Presiding Officer's home State: ``Believe me, if  we have to close down our government, we're building that wall.''  August 22, 2017, Donald J. Trump.   Now, I do not know why Donald Trump may be pushing for a government  shutdown. Maybe he thinks it will work well for him or work well for  the Republican Party politically. I have no idea, but I do know that  the idea of a government shutdown is a very bad idea. Maybe Republicans  will gain from it, maybe Democrats will politically gain from it. I do  not have a clue. What I do know is, the American people will lose from  a government shutdown, and, in a bipartisan manner, we must do  everything we can to prevent that shutdown.   A shutdown would harm tens of millions of Americans who would be  unable to access vital government services; it would disrupt the lives  of hundreds of thousands, or more, Federal employees who depend upon a  check to provide for their families; and, in fact, it would endanger  members of the U.S. military who are putting their lives on the line to  defend our country.   The U.S. Congress has a responsibility to the American people to  prevent a government shutdown and to work in a bipartisan manner to  reach a budget agreement that is fair and that addresses the very  serious problems facing not only DACA recipients but the working people  of our country.   So I say to my Republican colleagues, you control the White House,  you control the U.S. House, and you control the U.S. Senate. You have a  responsibility to govern.   For President Trump and the Republican leadership to allow DACA to  expire without a new program in place is not only a failure to govern,  it is an act of extraordinary cruelty.   We know President Trump wants to build a wall, I guess somewhat like  the Great Wall of China. The problem is, building walls may have made  sense in the 14th century, but I would inform the President that  technology has somewhat changed since then, and our job is to provide  strong border security in the most cost-effective way we can, and that  way is not building a wall. Ironically, while the President wants to  spend $18 billion to build a wall, he is taking money away from other  far more important and effective border security measures.   Let me quote from an article that appeared in today's New York Times:         The Trump administration would cut or delay funding for       border surveillance, radar technology, patrol boats and       customs agents in its upcoming spending plan to curb illegal       immigration--all proven security measures that officials and       experts have said are more effective than building a wall       along the Mexican border.        The wall also has become a bargaining chip in negotiations       with Congress as lawmakers seek to prevent nearly 800,000       young undocumented immigrants from being deported.        But security experts said the president's focus on a border       wall ignores the constantly evolving nature of terrorism       immigration and drug trafficking.    In other words, if we want strong border security, if we want to keep  people out of this country who should not be coming into this country,  if we want to keep drugs out of this country, building a wall is not  the most cost-effective way. It may have been a great idea in the 14th  century in China when they built their Great Wall, but it is not a  great idea in 2018, in the United States of America.   So let me just conclude by saying, we are at a very important moment  in history. If we do not do the right thing, if we do not do the moral  thing, if we allow some 800,000 young people--people who have spent  virtually their entire lives in this country, who know no other  country, who see the United States of America as their home--if we  betray them, if we take away their legal status, if we allow them to be  deported, this will be a moral stain on this country that will never  ever be wiped out.
