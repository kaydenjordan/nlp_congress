 Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer perspective on  the purpose and mission of this 118th Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to speak here on the House floor for the  first time. I am the first nuclear submarine veteran to serve in the  United States House of Representatives in the last 50 years, and only  the second in our Nation's history.   One particular submarine patrol, we pulled into Pearl Harbor to take  World War II veterans out to sea with us for the day. By naval  tradition, we stood at attention and saluted the USS Arizona as we  passed by. One part of the experience we shared with these veterans was  to demonstrate the tremendous pressure of the ocean.   In the control room with the periscopes, we would tie a string from  one side of the hole to the other, about the width of this rostrum  behind me. Our submarine's hole is made of high-strength steel to keep  the water out and the crew safe. On the surface, this string would be  taut like a guitar string and would sit about a foot off the deck. But  as we submerged our boat, the pressure of the sea would compress the  hole and that string would begin to droop. By the time we reached many  hundreds of feet below the ocean, that string would lay flat on the  deck. The incredible pressure of the ocean visible for everyone to see.   Now, like that submarine that I served on, America is under  tremendous pressure. And like that string sitting on the deck, we can  all see it. It is inflation. It is the border. It is the lawlessness of  our Federal agencies. It is clear that our Nation is in trouble.   The failed policies of the current administration are only taking us  deeper and deeper. Now, with a Republican  [[Page H159]]  majority led by Speaker McCarthy, we have the leadership for this  critical moment in time.   In 1963, the nuclear submarine, the USS Thresher, was conducting  engineering trials off of Cape Cod when they encountered an engineering  problem. The crew was able to bring the boat to within 100 feet of the  surface, but they lost their battle as the submarine descended below  what is called ``the crush depth,'' all hands were lost.   Americans have voted for a Republican majority in this House to  reverse the policies of the current administration and to start to  relieve the pressure that is all around us. The commitment to America  is exactly that plan for exactly that purpose--to unite this Chamber  and to lead America back to safer waters.   A typical submarine crew would be about a quarter of the number of  seats in this Chamber. Imagine for a moment that many people together  in a steel tube, hundreds of feet below the ocean for months at a time.  I have spent 500 days at sea, and I can tell you that after so many  days not everyone on the boat is going to like each other. The thing  about submarines is there is no easy way off. No matter what we think  of each other at the end of the journey, we arrive in the same place  together.   Let's talk about where we want to end up. For starters, when  something is broken on the submarine you don't scuttle the boat with  the crew aboard. You keep fighting to fix what is broken, triaging  critical systems, and getting the boat to a safe depth. That is exactly  what we witnessed last week as we chose Speaker McCarthy. He has been  chosen to restore faith in this Chamber and unite our party.   Freedom is a fragile thing. We saw that under Democrats' one party  rule. A strong Republican Conference is key to securing a better future  for our children, our grandchildren, and for generations to come.                            ____________________
