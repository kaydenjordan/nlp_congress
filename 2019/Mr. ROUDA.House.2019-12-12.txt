 Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman from Michigan for  yielding 1 minute.   Madam Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 3, the Elijah E.  Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act.   Earlier this year, Chairman Cummings convened our first Oversight and  Reform Committee hearing to examine the impact of soaring prescription  drug costs on our constituents. It is fitting we named this legislation  to honor our friend who used his gavel to highlight the stories of  Americans who are suffering and dying because they couldn't afford  astronomical drug prices while living in the greatest and richest  country in the world.   This bill would institute negotiation for fair drug prices, lower  out-of-pocket costs for seniors, improve coverage for Medicare  beneficiaries, and invest in innovative new treatment in our fight  against the addiction crisis.   Madam Chair, I support this legislation because it would improve  access to affordable prescription drugs for more than 600,000 of my  constituents, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and  ensure our constituents have access to lifesaving medication.
