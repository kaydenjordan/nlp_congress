 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support  of H.R. 8844, the STEP Improvement Act of 2022.   I was proud to join Representatives Flood, Evans, and Newman to  introduce this bill to help our small businesses expand exports and  reach new markets.   The STEP Improvement Act would reauthorize the State trade and export  program from fiscal year 2023 to 2026, for 3 more years, and improve  the program by streamlining the application process for small  businesses and implementing strong metrics so the program works as  intended.   Since STEP's creation in 2011, my home State of California has  received $8.5 million in STEP funding, helping more than 1,200 small  businesses create jobs and generate more than $85 million in export  sales. That is 10 times the return on our investment.   Mr. Speaker, I thank all of my colleagues who helped to pass this  legislation yesterday in the House.                            ____________________
