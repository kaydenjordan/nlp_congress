 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate  Francis Bellamy, one of the most influential individuals from Mount  Morris, New York. Francis Bellamy is the author of the Pledge of  Allegiance.   Tomorrow marks the 125th anniversary of the Pledge of Allegiance,  which was first published in a magazine called The Youth's Companion on  September 8, 1892.   The pledge was initially written as part of a campaign to put  American flags in every school in the country. In its original form, it  read:   ``I pledge allegiance to my flag and the Republic for which it  stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.''   In 1923, the words, ``the flag of the United States of America'' were  added. In 1954, Congress added the words, ``under God,'' creating the  31-word pledge we have today.   Bellamy's words are recited millions of times every day and are  ingrained in our society as an expression of national pride and  patriotism.                            ____________________
