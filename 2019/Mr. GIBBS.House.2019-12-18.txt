 Madam Speaker, Democrats started with quid pro quo. That  didn't work so well. Then it was bribery and extortion. Then they  brought the witnesses in, and not one could answer if they saw any  evidence of bribery, extortion, or any crime when questioned. It was  just silence. Then the witnesses testified they heard this from so-and- so. When the Democrats brought their star witness in, Ambassador  Sondland, when asked, he said: I presumed the aid was held up.   I presumed?   Testimony was all hearsay, conjecture, and assumptions. So now it is  abuse of power with no underlying crime, which is opinion. Abuse of  power to the Democrats is they don't like his policies, or he treated a  reporter harshly.   Obstruction of Congress: there are three coequal branches of  government. When the executive branch and the legislative branch have  an impasse, that is when the judicial branch intervenes. They didn't do  that. The Democrats didn't take that route.   Every President, including George Washington, could have been  impeached based on these factless articles. There is no crime, and  there is no victim as Ukraine received their aid before the December 30  deadline and no witnesses who witnessed anything.   This isn't about the rule of law. It is politics at its worst. It is  disgraceful. It is time to end the charade and scam on the American  people.   Madam Speaker, I urge everybody to vote ``no'' on these Articles of  Impeachment.
