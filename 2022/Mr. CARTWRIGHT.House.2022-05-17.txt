 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding,  and I appreciate the opportunity to speak about my critical amendment  to the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act.   As a Nation, what we want to do is help our young working population  find jobs and meet their career potential. That is exactly what  YouthBuild has done for the last 40 years.   The YouthBuild program funds workforce training initiatives focused  on 16- to 24-year-old individuals without a high school diploma. These  young adults come from challenging backgrounds and they need skills and  resources to successfully participate in the domestic labor market, and  YouthBuild gives them just that opportunity.   However, there is always room for improvement--and that is why we  have this amendment--especially when it comes to ensuring that young  adults with disabilities are best positioned to successfully enter the  workforce. Currently, lack of affordable and accessible transportation  creates significant barriers for disabled people that want to work.   Madam Speaker, 13.4 million Americans have disabilities which limit  their ability to travel, including traveling to the workplace. We have  to ensure that transportation to and from the workplace is available  for disabled youth transitioning into the workforce.   My amendment to the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act allows  disabled YouthBuild participants to use funds for transportation. With  this amendment, we can remove a massive obstacle from the path of these  disabled young adults. We can make going to work one step easier so  they can earn a living and support their families. No American should  be deprived of a fair chance to become and remain productive members of  our American society.   Madam Speaker, I urge my fellow Members to support my amendment and  allow designated YouthBuild funding to be used for work-related  transportation.
