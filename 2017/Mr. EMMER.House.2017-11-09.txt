 Mr. Speaker, while government isn't meant to create jobs,  with the help of the President, Congress can set Federal policies that  establish a pro-worker, pro-business environment that lifts people out  of poverty, helps families, and drives our country forward.   One problem today that is impeding job growth is access to capital  for small businesses. American businessmen and -women are often unable  to get the loans they need to start a new enterprise or to grow an  existing one.   Additionally, if a firm would like to publicly sell stock to raise  money, it must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission,  which costs $2.5 million, on average; an amount most small businesses  simply cannot afford.   Small and emerging businesses are a key to the economic engine in  America. The Small Business Administration found that these businesses  create over half of the new jobs on an annual basis in this country.  More importantly, today's small businesses are tomorrow's success  story.   Just think of all the great businesses in this country that started  with a dream in a garage: Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Disney, Harley- Davidson, and Minnesota's own Medtronic. We want to empower the  entrepreneurs in this country to dream, innovate, and create jobs that  grow our economy.   That is why I introduced the Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act. This  bill will make it easier for entrepreneurs and  [[Page H8669]]  small businesses to raise money from family, friends, and their  personal network without running afoul of the vague and undefined  ``private offering'' safe harbor provisions in the Securities Act of  1933.   Thus, the Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act helps bring clarity to  existing law so that our current and future job creators can easily  raise capital within the confines of an easy-to-understand provision  without the help of an expert.                                time  0930    This legislation requires three specific criteria to be met  simultaneously in order to trigger a safe harbor exemption for a  security offering instead of just one or more. These criteria ensure  that: one, each purchaser has a substantive preexisting relationship  with an owner; two, there are no more than 35 purchasers of securities  from the issuer that are sold in reliance on the exemption during the  12 months proceeding; and, three, the aggregate amount of all  securities sold by the issuers does not exceed $500,000 during the 12- month period preceding the offering. The bill also exempts any of the  aforementioned security offerings from blue-sky laws, while maintaining  antifraud provisions at the Federal and State level.   These provisions protect Americans from criminals trying to swindle  them out of their hard-earned money, while making capital more  accessible to businesses by investors from around the country.   In fact, I will be offering an amendment to enhance these antifraud  provisions. This amendment, which incorporates the suggestions made by  my colleagues on the other side of the aisle during a legislative  hearing in the last Congress, will ensure that individuals who have  been disqualified under the ``bad actor'' disqualification standard, as  is listed under current law, are prohibited from using the exemption  provided under H.R. 2201, establishing yet an additional layer of  investor protection.   Entrepreneurs and small-business owners need access to capital in  order to achieve the American Dream. Although small businesses  accounted for 99.7 percent of all the businesses in the United States  last year, only half of them will survive longer than 5 years,  according to our Bureau of Labor Statistics.   Lack of capital or difficulty accessing capital is one of the main  causes of failure for many of these small businesses. A 2015 survey  conducted by BlueVine found that 75 percent of small and emerging  businessowners reported their primary source of funding comes from  their own personal finances, followed by banks at 16 percent and family  and friends at 6 percent.   While banks and credit unions do their best to offer the funding  these businesses need to grow and thrive, there are still 3 million  fewer small business loans made annually, today, than there were before  the 2008 financial crisis. H.R. 2201 seeks to build off the success of  the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, better known as the  JOBS Act, and will continue to spur capital formation for the true job  creators and drivers of our country's economy.   The Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act helps small and emerging companies  add another tool to the toolkit, enabling them to confidently find  alternative ways of raising these funds without having to pay for  costly securities experts and without the fear of lawsuits if they  operate within these easy-to-understand parameters.   That is why the Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act is endorsed by the  National Small Business Association; the Small Business &  Entrepreneurship Council; the National Federation of Independent  Business; the Chamber of Commerce; Heritage Action; and Engine, ``The  Voice of Startups in Government.''   The House approved an identical version of this legislation during  the 114th Congress as part of the Accelerating Access to Capital Act,  and language similar to H.R. 2201 was included in the Financial CHOICE  Act, which was adopted by this Chamber in June.    Mr. Speaker, the time has come for Congress to come  together and help small businesses help themselves by making this  important update and improvement to the Securities Act of 1933.   I want to thank Chairman Hensarling; Capital Markets, Securities, and  Investment Subcommittee Chairman Huizenga; and all of the staff on the  Financial Services Committee for their hard work on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and  hope that both parties will use H.R. 2201 as a way to show their  support for more opportunities and better lives for our job creators.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters from the National Small  Business Association, the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council,  the United States Chamber of Commerce, Heritage Action for America, and  Engine.                                National Small Business Association.      Hon. Tom Emmer,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Emmer: On behalf of the National Small       Business Association (NSBA), the nation's first small-      business advocacy organization, with more than 65,000 small-      business members representing every state and every industry       across the country, I commend your leadership for introducing       the Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act (H.R. 2201) as it will       have an immediate and direct impact on small businesses       looking to raise capital. NSBA has long supported the kind of       simplification this legislation would bring for small       businesses.        Capital is the lifeblood of any small business, and often       small-business owners need capital at various stages; some at       their startup and others later when they are looking to       expand. Despite this ongoing need, small-business lending       from banks has decreased over the last decade and many small       businesses have few options for obtaining capital. According       to NSBA's 2016 Year-End Economic Report, small-business       access to capital remains stubbornly unchanged since the       previous year, with just 69 percent of small firms reporting       they are able to get adequate financing. This drop has real-      world implications: 41 percent said lack of capital is       hindering their ability to grow their business or expand       operations, and 20 percent said they had to reduce the number       of employees as a result of tight credit.        Therefore, raising capital though securities is an       attractive alternative option for many small-business owners.       However, the current regulatory requirements are quite       onerous for small businesses, often requiring expensive       specialized counsel for even very small securities offerings.        NSBA supports this targeted legislation that creates a safe       harbor for small securities offerings which meet requirements       clearly identified in the legislation. Under the legislation,       these exemptions include offerings in which each purchaser       has a substantive pre-existing relationship with the owners,       where the issuer has less than 35 purchasers utilizing the       exemption in the preceding 12 month period, or where the       total amount raised during the preceding 12 month period is       less than $500,000. By creating three safe harbor exemptions       for ``non-public offerings,'' businesses can operate with       clarity and a clear conscience knowing that they would be       exempted from registering with the Securities and Exchange       Commission (SEC). Additionally, the legislation also exempts       transactions meeting the specified requirements from state       registration requirements, commonly referred to as ``blue sky       laws.''        Raising capital for small businesses from friends and       family already takes place on a regular basis, except those       transactions often lack the legal protections and structure       of securities law. In addition to expanding access to capital       for small businesses, this legislation will bring those       transactions under a recognized legal framework, and make       resolving disputes that arise much more efficient. Finally,       bringing these existing transactions under an existing legal       framework will provide a sound legal basis for subsequent       larger offerings requiring registration with the SEC.        Access to capital continues to be one of the most pressing       issues facing the small-business community. All small       businesses need an injection of capital at one point or       another, unfortunately in the past several years it has       become difficult for small businesses to get the funds they       need to grow and expand. NSBA is pleased to support the Micro       Offering Safe Harbor Act as it will help small businesses       around the country expand and create new jobs in their       communities.            Sincerely,                                                    Todd McCracken,      President & CEO.                                   ____                                                    Small Business &                                        Entrepreneurship Council,                                       Vienna, VA, October 10, 2017.      Hon. Tom Emmer,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Emmer: On behalf of the Small Business       & Entrepreneurship Council (SBE Council) and our nationwide       membership of entrepreneurs and small business owners, I am       writing to voice our support for the Micro Offering Safe       Harbor Act, H.R. 2201.  [[Page H8670]]         When it comes to raising capital, the existing regulatory       system is onerous and complex. Even for small securities       offerings, compliance and navigating the rules are very       expensive. H.R. 2201 is a needed solution that makes smart       changes to existing law, providing certainty and an effective       option for small businesses that need to raise capital.        H.R. 2201 would exempt from registration requirements with       the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) offerings made       only to the entrepreneur's friends and family, to less than       35 purchasers, and when $500,000 or less is raised. The       offering would be exempt from state registration and       qualification rules, thus reducing costs and complexity. H.R.       2201 would appropriately scale SEC rules and regulatory       compliance for our nation's small businesses, which in turn       will provide another practical option for entrepreneurs to       raise the capital they need to start or grow their firms.        The United States has much work to do when it comes to       fostering capital formation and encouraging investment and       entrepreneurship. The Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act is a       smart solution that will help many entrepreneurs successfully       start and grow their businesses. Thank you for your       leadership.            Sincerely,                                                    Karen Kerrigan,      President & CEO.                                   ____                                          Chamber of Commerce of the                                        United States of America,                                   Washington, DC, October 10, 2017.      Hon. Jeb Hensarling,      Chairman, Committee on Financial Services,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Ranking Member, Committee on Financial Services, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Hensarling and Ranking Member Waters: The       U.S. Chamber of Commerce strongly supports several bills the       Committee is scheduled to markup on October 11, 2017. The       Chamber appreciates the Committee's ongoing work to enhance       capital formation, hold regulators accountable, and reduce       red tape burdens upon American businesses and consumers. The       Chamber supports the following bills.        H.R. 477, the ``Small Business Mergers, Acquisitions,       Sales, and Brokerage Simplification Act of 2017,'' would       simplify Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)       registration requirements for certain mergers and       acquisitions (M&A) brokers who perform services related to       the transfer of ownership of smaller private companies. The       legislation properly balances regulatory relief for brokers       and businesses involved in such transactions with important       investor protections to prevent abuse. H.R. 477 would require       disclosure of relevant information to investors and would not       exempt M&A brokers from existing rules designed to prevent       those who violate the law from continuing to work in the       securities business.        H.R. 1116, the ``Taking Account of Institutions with Low       Operation Risk (TAILOR) Act of 2017,'' would direct federal       banking regulators to scale rulemakings in order to properly       reflect the various risk profiles of financial institutions.       One of the unfortunate developments in recent years has been       ``one size fits all'' regulation in the banking sector. This       legislation would ensure that community and regional       financial institutions are not forced to comply with       regulatory regimes more suited for global, interconnected       institutions.        H.R. 1585, the ``Fair Investment Opportunities for       Professional Experts Act,'' would expand the definition of       ``accredited investor'' under securities laws by allowing       those who can demonstrate relative education or work       expertise to invest in certain private offerings, regardless       of their income or net worth. In addition to providing Main       Street households with greater opportunities to build wealth,       H.R. 1585 would expand the pool of capital available to       private businesses.        H.R. 1645, the ``Fostering Innovation Act of 2017,'' would       extend the Sarbanes-Oxley 404(b) internal controls exemption       for certain emerging growth companies (EGCs) from five years       to ten. This change would prevent the premature phase out of       one of the more popular provisions of the 2012 Jumpstart our       Business Startups (``JOBS'') Act, and would provide a further       incentive for companies to enter public markets.        H.R. 2201, the ``Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act,'' would       provide a means for businesses to solicit and raise limited       amounts of capital without running afoul of securities laws.       Private businesses would be permitted to seek community-based       financing of up to $500,000 per year in order to expand or       hire new employees. Importantly, the bill includes a number       of robust investor protections that would help prevent fraud       and abuse in the market.        H.R. 2396, the ``Privacy Notification Technical       Clarification Act,'' would amend the 1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley       Act by clarifying that financial institutions are only       required to send customers annual privacy notifications if       there have been changes in the institution's privacy       policies. It also clarifies that such notices need not be       physically provided to a customer if they are made available       online at the customer's request. These provisions would save       costs for consumers and mitigate confusion related to privacy       notices.        H.R. 2706, the ``Financial Institution Customer Protection       Act of 2017,'' would help prevent another ``Operation       Chokepoint'' by prohibiting federal agencies from directing a       financial institution to terminate an account without a       material, documented reason for doing so. This bill would       ensure that agencies do not unjustifiably discriminate       against certain industries. The bill would also clarify       liability under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery,       and Enforcement Act. A House investigation of Operation Choke       Point revealed the Obama administration Department Of Justice       had radically and inappropriately reinterpreted the law.        H.R. 3299, the ``Protecting Consumers Access to Credit Act       of 2017,'' would codify the ``valid-when-made'' doctrine,       which states that the characteristics of a loan are valid at       origination, and are not unenforceable when assigned to       another party. The recent Second Circuit decision in the       Madden vs. Midland Funding, LLC case has undermined this       doctrine and threatens to impose a chilling effect on credit       markets nationwide. H.R. 3299 would restore the longstanding       ``valid-when-made'' legal principle and protect consumers and       businesses that rely on robust credit markets.        H.R. 3312, the ``Systemic Risk Designation Improvement Act       of 2017,'' would replace Dodd-Frank's arbitrary asset       threshold for labeling a bank ``systemically important'' with       a multi-factor, tailored assessment that considers size,       interconnectedness, substitutability, complexity, and cross-      jurisdictional. Mid-size and regionals banks do not generate       systemic risk and are critical to small business lending. By       tailoring regulation and rejecting a one-size-fits-all       approach, H.R. 3312 would promote Main Street access to       credit and unlock economic growth.        H.R. 3857, the ``Protecting Advice for Small Savers (PASS)       Act of 2017,'' would repeal the misguided ``fiduciary rule''       issued by the Department of Labor (DOL) in 2016. The DOL rule       was built upon a fundamentally flawed and theoretical       analysis that has been refuted by real life experience. A       recent Chamber survey demonstrated the harm that DOL's rule       is already inflicting upon investors, and we have long called       for the SEC to assert its jurisdiction regarding standards of       conduct for broker-dealers and investment advisers. H.R. 3857       would rightly direct SEC to craft a rulemaking under the       securities laws to protect investors and preserve access to       investment choice.        H.R. 3903, the ``Encouraging Public Offerings Act of       2017,'' would allow any company--regardless of size or EGC       status--to take advantage of the popular provisions under       Title I of the 2012 JOBS Act, which include allowing       investors to submit confidential draft registration       statements with the SEC and to ``test the waters'' before       filing an IPO. Title I of the JOBS Act has proven to be a       true policy success, and Congress and the SEC should continue       to explore how more companies can take advantage of its       provisions.        H.R. 3911, the ``Risk-Based Credit Examinations Act of       2017,'' would authorize the SEC to utilize `risk-based'       examinations of Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating       Organizations (NRSROs), which would allow the SEC to focus       its limited resources and prioritize its examination agenda,       while reducing unnecessary compliance burdens on regulated       entities.        H.R. 3948, the ``Protection of Source Code Act,'' would       amend the Securities Act of 1933 to require that the SEC       actually issue a subpoena before requiring a person or entity       to produce trading ``source code.'' Source code is the       intellectual property of certain market participants, and       there is no reason for the SEC to put into place a broad       collection mechanism for such sensitive information. This       legislation is necessary after past attempts by the Commodity       Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to collect source code       without a subpoena.        H.R. 3972, the ``Family Office Technical Correction Act of       2017,'' would provide certainty for ``family offices''       defined under securities laws by clarifying that such offices       are accredited investors. This bill would preserve the       ability of family offices to invest in certain private       offerings and help them remain an important source of capital       for growing businesses.        H.R. 3973, the ``Market Data Protection Act of 2017,''       would delay any reporting to the consolidated audit trail       (CAT) until the SEC, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority       (FINRA), and CAT operators develop sufficient cybersecurity       protocols to protect the information that is set to be       collected under the CAT. Recent cyberattacks have       demonstrated that vulnerabilities exist within our capital       markets, and H.R. 3973 would help safeguard the personal and       sensitive information of market participants. The SEC should       also explore alternatives to using personally-identifiable       information as part of its data collection efforts under the       CAT.        Collectively, these bills would modernize capital markets,       preserve consumer choice and access to credit, and require       more transparency and accountability of the federal financial       regulators. We look forward to working with the Committee and       Congress as these bills advance through the legislative       process.            Sincerely,                                                      Neil Bradley.  [[Page H8671]]                                          ____                                       Heritage Action for America.      To: Interested Parties      From: Heritage Action for America      Date: November 7, 2017      Subject: Micro-Offering Safe Harbor Act (H.R. 2201)        The Micro-Offering Safe Harbor Act (H.R. 2201) would remove       unnecessary regulatory impediments for the smallest       businesses seeking to raise capital to launch, to grow and to       create jobs. It would create an exemption to the Securities       Act registration requirement for businesses that make a       securities offering to 35 or fewer people with whom they have       a pre-existing relationship and that raise $500,000 or less.       This will reduce the need for main street businesses to       retain sophisticated securities counsel and improve their       access to capital.        Heritage Action supports this legislation.                                   ____                                                           Engine,                                San Francisco, CA, October 11, 2017.      Hon. Jeb Hensarling,      Chairman, House Committee on Financial Services, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Financial Services, House           of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Hensarling and Ranking Member Waters: On       behalf of Engine and our community of startups,       entrepreneurs, investors, and innovators, I write to express       support for several bills scheduled for consideration before       the House Committee on Financial Services tomorrow.       Specifically, Engine reiterates its support for H.R. 2201,       the ``Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act,'' which will facilitate       capital access for promising startups.        Engine is a nonprofit and advocacy group that supports       high-growth, high-tech startups through research, advocacy,       and policy analysis. We work to foster and promote forward-      looking government policies and a regulatory environment in       which entrepreneurs can launch innovative, new companies that       grow and thrive. Through conversations with diverse startups       across the country, we know that capital access remains a top       challenge in getting a business off the ground.        A large portion of startups rely on small, nonpublic       offerings (also known as a ``private placements''), such as a       ``friends and family'' round, to raise seed capital. In fact,       a 2014 survey by the Kauffman Foundation found that over 28       percent of startups raised some amount of funding from their       personal network. However, the Securities Act does not       clearly define what constitutes a public offering, or       conversely, a nonpublic offering, making it easy for early       stage companies to unintentionally run afoul of the law when       doing a private placement.        H.R. 2201 would create three bright line safe harbor       exemptions for non-public offerings. Under the legislation,       offerings would be exempt from registration with the       Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) if each purchaser       has a substantive pre-existing relationship with the issuer,       there are 35 or fewer purchasers, or the amount being raised       does not exceed $500,000. These exemptions would bring much       needed clarity for startups and ensure that a company doing a       small, private placement is not forced to complete burdensome       paperwork or spend precious resources on an expensive lawyer       in order to comply with ambiguous regulatory requirements.        Finally, H.R. 2201 would exempt these micro-offerings from       state blue sky registration and qualification laws,       decreasing the regulatory complexity for startups doing a       small raise.        Engine appreciates the Committee's consideration of this       bill and its continued work on capital access issues for       emerging firms. We look forward to further engagement with       the bills' sponsors and Committee members on these important       issues.            Sincerely,                                                     Evan Engstrom,                                                Executive Director.     Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the amendment I am offering today will enhance antifraud  and consumer protections for small businesses and startups seeking to  take advantage of the micro offering exemption outlined in the  underlying bill.   While the legislation itself requires three specific criteria to be  met simultaneously in order to trigger a safe harbor exemption for a  security offering, my amendment adds an additional layer of protection  to further safeguard investors from bad actors.   Specifically, my amendment prohibits the exemption from being  available for those who have been disqualified under the bad actor  disqualification standard established by the SEC. This language was  included with the support of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle  during consideration in committee in the 114th Congress, and I am  hopeful they will support its inclusion again in the 115th.   I want to reiterate that nothing in the base text of this bill erodes  or limits the ability of Federal or State regulators to prosecute  fraud, nor would it prevent private common law causes of action for  fraud or breach of contract between the interested parties.   This amendment builds upon these existing protections and drives home  the point that the Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act is purely focused on  helping our small businesses and entrepreneurs access the tools they  need to grow and create jobs in an orderly and legal manner.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I will close at this point.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member for her encouragement  and her compliments, and I want to just point out that the Micro  Offering Safe Harbor Act was actually improved as a direct result of  the ranking member's suggestions.   So, again, I want to thank her for her compliments here today, her  encouragement in helping us make this an even better bill for  entrepreneurs and small businesses across the country. At this point, I  would encourage support for the amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
