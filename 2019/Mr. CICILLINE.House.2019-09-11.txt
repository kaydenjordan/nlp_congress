 Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1941, the  Coastal and Marine Economies Protection Act.   Mr. Chair, the administration's proposed 5-year plan for expanded oil  and gas leasing would pose significant danger to our Nation's coastal  waters which are home to thousands of plant and animal species that  rely on a well-balanced marine ecosystem.   According to Oceana, oil and gas exploration could have untold  effects on fish and marine wildlife, from decreasing fish catches, to  increase stranding or beaching of marine mammals.   On top of this, our oceans are an enormous driver of our States'  economies. In my home State of Rhode Island, ocean industries such as  fishing, tourism, and recreation account for nearly $2 billion in  annual economic activity and support more than 41,000 jobs.   Throughout New England, it accounts for more than $17 billion  annually. Our States cannot afford to risk the dangers posed to our  oceans and coasts by the administration's misguided proposal to expand  oil and gas drilling in the Atlantic. We cannot afford to sit by and  watch the President plunder our oceans for the benefit of the big oil  companies at the expense of polluting our oceans, endangering fishing  and tourism industries, and harming coastal communities.   I was proud to introduce legislation earlier this year, the New  England Coastal Protection Act, which would prohibit drilling in the  Outer Continental Shelf off of the coast of the New England States,  which I am proud to say has the support of every Member of Congress  from New England, and which is incorporated in this bill before the  House today.   It is imperative that this country pursue a cleaner, more sustainable  energy future which protects our oceans and coastlines, stimulates  innovation, and spurs job growth.   I strongly urge passage of this legislation.
