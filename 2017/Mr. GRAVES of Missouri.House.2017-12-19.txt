 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 4 of rule  XVI, I move that when the House adjourns this legislative day, it  adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. on Wednesday, December 20, 2017, for morning- hour debate and 10 a.m. for legislative business.   The motion was agreed to.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (S. 1393) to streamline the process by which active duty  military, reservists, and veterans receive commercial driver's  licenses.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1393         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Jobs for Our Heroes Act''.       SEC. 2. MEDICAL CERTIFICATE FOR VETERANS OPERATING COMMERCIAL                     MOTOR VEHICLES.         (a) Qualified Examiners.--Section 5403(d)(2) of the FAST       Act (49 U.S.C. 31149 note; 129 Stat. 1548) is amended to read       as follows:        ``(2) Qualified examiner.--The term `qualified examiner'       means an individual who--        ``(A) is employed by the Department of Veterans Affairs as       an advanced practice nurse, doctor of chiropractic, doctor of       medicine, doctor of osteopathy, physician assistant, or other       medical professional;        ``(B) is licensed, certified, or registered in a State to       perform physical examinations;        ``(C) is familiar with the standards for, and physical       requirements of, an operator required to be medically       certified under section 31149 of title 49, United States       Code; and        ``(D) has never, with respect to such section, been found       to have acted fraudulently, including by fraudulently       awarding a medical certificate.''.        (b) Conforming Amendments.--Section 5403 of the FAST Act       (49 U.S.C. 31149 note; 129 Stat. 1548) is amended--        (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``physician-approved       veteran operator, the qualified  [[Page H10216]]       physician'' and inserting ``veteran operator approved by a       qualified examiner, the qualified examiner'';        (2) in subsection (b)(1)--        (A) by striking ``the physician'' and inserting ``the       examiner''; and        (B) by striking ``qualified physician'' and inserting       ``qualified examiner'';        (3) in subsection (c)--        (A) by striking ``qualified physicians'' and inserting       ``qualified examiners''; and        (B) by striking ``such physicians'' and inserting ``such       examiners''; and        (4) in subsection (d)--        (A) by redesignating paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) as       paragraphs (3), (1), and (2), respectively, and by moving the       text of paragraph (3), as redesignated, to appear after       paragraph (2), as redesignated; and        (B) in paragraph (3), as redesignated--        (i) in the paragraph heading, by striking ``Physician-      approved veteran operator'' and inserting ``Veteran operator       approved by a qualified examiner''; and        (ii) by striking ``physician-approved veteran operator''       and inserting ``veteran operator approved by a qualified       examiner''.        (c) Rulemaking.--The amendments made by this section shall       be incorporated into any rulemaking proceeding related to       section 5403 of the FAST Act (49 U.S.C. 31149 note; 129 Stat.       1548) that is being conducted as of the date of the enactment       of this Act.       SEC. 3. COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE STANDARDS FOR CURRENT AND                     FORMER MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES.         Section 31305(d) of title 49, United States Code, is       amended--        (1) in the subsection heading, by striking ``Veteran       Operators'' and inserting ``Operators Who Are Members of the       Armed Forces, Reservists, or Veterans'';        (2) in paragraph (1)(B), by striking ``subparagraph (A)       during, at least,'' and inserting ``subparagraph (A)--        ``(i) while serving in the armed forces or reserve       components; and        ``(ii) during''; and        (3) in paragraph (2)(B)--        (A) by inserting ``current or'' before ``former'' each       place the term appears; and        (B) by inserting ``one of'' before ``the reserve       components''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on S. 1393.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   S. 1393 would exempt current members of the armed services or reserve  components from certain testing requirements for commercial driver's  licenses if they had qualifying experience while serving in the armed  services or reserve components.   This bill also expands the types of medical professionals at the  Department of Veterans Affairs who could certify that veterans meet the  physical standards required to operate a commercial vehicle.   These commonsense changes will help remove barriers to employment for  the men and women who have served our country in uniform.   This bill is a combination of H.R. 2547, the Veterans Expanded  Trucking Opportunities Act of 2017, sponsored by Representative Rob  Woodall, and H.R. 2258, the ADVANCE Act, which is sponsored by  Representative Pete Aguilar. The House passed both bills under  suspension on June 26, 2017. The bill we are considering today passed  the Senate by unanimous consent on September 14, which means this will  head to the President's desk once the House approves it.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend Mr. Woodall and Mr. Aguilar for  their leadership on the House bills and Senator Cornyn for his work in  the Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support S. 1393, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to  join me in supporting this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (S. 1532) to disqualify from operating a commercial motor  vehicle for life an individual who uses a commercial motor vehicle in  committing a felony involving human trafficking.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1532         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``No Human Trafficking on Our       Roads Act''.       SEC. 2. LIFETIME DISQUALIFICATION WITHOUT REINSTATEMENT.         Section 31310(d) of title 49, United States Code, is       amended--        (1) in the heading, by striking ``Controlled Substance       Violations'' and inserting ``Lifetime Disqualification       Without Reinstatement'';        (2) by striking ``The Secretary'' and inserting ``(1)       Controlled substance violations.--The Secretary''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following:        ``(2) Human trafficking violations.--The Secretary shall       disqualify from operating a commercial motor vehicle for life       an individual who uses a commercial motor vehicle in       committing a felony involving an act or practice described in       paragraph (9) of section 103 of the Trafficking Victims       Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7102(9)).''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on S. 1532.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, human trafficking is a terrible crime with an estimated  20 million victims worldwide. It is incumbent upon Congress to take the  steps necessary to combat this crime whenever possible.   Just this past summer there was a case in San Antonio in which 10  people died while being illegally trafficked in a commercial motor  vehicle. Drivers have been the first line of defense in helping  identify and report these sorts of activities within the trucking  community. We need these drivers to stay vigilant and we need to weed  out the bad actors.   In addition to the criminal penalties, drivers who knowingly take  part in human trafficking should never again be able to drive  commercially. Current law prohibits an individual from operating a  commercial motor vehicle if they are convicted of one of nine different  crimes, including alcohol abuse, negligent manslaughter, and drug  trafficking.   S. 1532 disqualifies individuals from operating a commercial vehicle  for their lifetime if they ever use that commercial vehicle to commit a  felony involving human trafficking.   This bipartisan bill passed the Senate with unanimous consent, and I  would like to commend Mr. Katko for his leadership on the House version  of this bill, and I would urge my colleagues to support S. 1532.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko).    Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to  join me in supporting this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (S. 1536) to designate a human trafficking prevention  coordinator and to expand the scope of activities authorized under the  Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's outreach and education  program to include human trafficking prevention activities, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1536         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Combating Human Trafficking       in Commercial Vehicles Act''.       SEC. 2. HUMAN TRAFFICKING PREVENTION COORDINATOR.         The Secretary of Transportation shall designate an official       within the Department of Transportation who shall--        (1) coordinate human trafficking prevention efforts across       modal administrations in the Department of Transportation and       with other departments and agencies of the Federal       Government; and        (2) in coordinating such efforts, take into account the       unique challenges of combating human trafficking within       different transportation modes.       SEC. 3. EXPANSION OF OUTREACH AND EDUCATION PROGRAM.         Section 31110(c)(1) of title 49, United States Code, is       amended by adding at the end the following: ``The program       authorized under this subsection may support, in addition to       funds otherwise available for such purposes, the recognition,       prevention, and reporting of human trafficking, while       deferring to existing resources, as practicable.''.       SEC. 4. EXPANSION OF COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE FINANCIAL                     ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.         Section 31313(a)(3) of title 49, United States Code, is       amended--        (1) in subparagraph (D), by striking ``or'' at the end;        (2) by redesignating subparagraph (E) as subparagraph (F);       and        (3) by inserting after subparagraph (D) the following:        ``(E) support, in addition to funds otherwise available for       such purposes, the recognition, prevention, and reporting of       human trafficking; or''.

(a) Establishment.--The Secretary shall establish an       advisory committee on human trafficking.

(5) Compensation.--Committee members shall serve without       compensation.        (c) Authority.--Not later than 9 months after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall establish and       appoint all members of the Committee.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on S. 1536.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 1536 empowers the Department of Transportation to  play an important role in combating human trafficking. Specifically  what this bill does is it directs the Secretary of Transportation to  designate a human trafficking prevention coordinator from within the  Department; it expands the scope of activities authorized under the  Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's outreach and education  program and under the Commercial Driver's License program  implementation grants to include human trafficking prevention  activities; and it requires the Secretary to establish an advisory  committee on human trafficking.   S. 1536 is supported by Members on both sides of the aisle, and it  passed the Senate with unanimous consent.   I would like to commend Ms. Esty for her leadership on the House  version of this bill. Because of her work and her partnership on this  with Mr. Katko, the House version passed through committee unanimously.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support S. 1536, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I don't have any speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me  in supporting this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
