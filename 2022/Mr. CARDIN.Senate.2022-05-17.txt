 Madam President, I rise today in recognition of Asian  Pacific American Heritage Month. This annual recognition offers the  opportunity to celebrate the unique impact the Asian American and  Pacific Islander community has made and continues to make in the United  States.   On this heritage month, we reflect on the incredible achievements of  this minority community and honor the unique combination of traditions  and cultures that create the rich tapestry of the Asian American  Pacific Islander diaspora and experience. We also use this time to  educate ourselves on the nuances of the AAPI identity and better  understand the challenges this community faces.   In 1977, then-Representative Frank Horton of New York introduced a  resolution to designate the first 10 days in May as AAPI Heritage Week.  The month of May was appropriate because of two key anniversaries that  occurred in that month. On May 7, 1843, the first Japanese immigrants  came to the United States.   On May 10, 1869, the first transcontinental railroad was completed,  largely due to the backbreaking work of Chinese laborers, some of whom  lost their lives in the construction.   Congress did not enact Representative Horton's initial resolution.  The following year, however, with the persistent help of then- Representative Norman Mineta, Congress enacted a new resolution to  designate the 7-day period beginning on May 4 as Asian American Pacific  Islander Heritage Week. In 1992, Congress authorized the entire month  of May as AAPI Heritage Month, which we now celebrate.   The presence and influence of the AAPI community in the United States  has been growing steadily since the 19th century. The 1870 census  classified approximately 63,000 individuals as Asian. By 1960, when the  census allowed respondents to select their race, that number grew to  980,000. As of 2019, there are 22.4 million AAPI individuals in  America, 475,000 of whom call Maryland home.   It is important to remember that the AAPI community is not a  homogenous group. It is an incredibly diverse community, made up of a  wide array of cultures spanning many countries and territories, which  includes over 50 ethnicities, over 100 languages, and multiple  religions. Each subset draws from a unique set of traditions, and we  cannot assume they have one shared, uniform experience. We know that  the AAPI community makes up about 7 percent of our total population,  and this rich and diverse community has an outsized impact on every  pillar of our society. We cannot forget the many barriers to success  this community has overcome to reach such heights, which makes this  community's successes all the more impressive.   To understand the profound influence the AAPI community has, we need  not look further than Capitol Hill. This year, we mourned the passing  of my good friend and former colleague, Norman Mineta. A passionate  defender of justice, talented strategist, and exemplary patriot,  Representative Mineta dedicated his life to service as a mayor,  Congressman, and Cabinet member. In 1941, the U.S. Government interned  his family along with hundreds of thousands of other Japanese  Americans. Perhaps both in spite of and because of that experience,  Representative Mineta pursued a career as a public servant. During his  tenure as a legislator, he cofounded and chaired the Congressional  Asian Pacific American Caucus.   He led the charge on the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, which directed  the Federal Government to issue a formal apology to and compensate the  survivors of Japanese internment. He inspired generations of Asian  Americans to get involved in politics. We miss him, but his legacy will  live on for years to come.   As chairman of the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship  Committee, I am in awe of the resilience and determination we have seen  from AAPI small business owners over the past 2 years. In Maryland  alone, there are 13,375 AAPI-owned businesses, many of which include  restaurants and eateries. In fact, if you use cuisine predominance as a  barometer of cultural impact, the Asian American influence is  unparalleled.   In 2021, the New York Times published a list of the 50 most exciting  restaurants in the United States. Seventeen of the top 50 restaurants,  or 34 percent, incorporate AAPI food or have an AAPI head chef, more  than any other foreign cuisine. Through food, AAPI culture has become  inextricably linked to the American identity. In my home city of  Baltimore, a group of volunteers known as the China Collective  organizes a pop-up market named the Charm City Market. I have watched  as the event has grown in both attendance and footprint over the years,  celebrating the AAPI community's diverse food and entrepreneurship  landscape. Each year, I look forward to the market's ever-growing  celebration and empowerment of AAPI small business owners and  entrepreneurs.   Asian American Pacific Islanders also played a massive role in our  COVID-19 response, oftentimes finding themselves on the front lines as  essential workers. Despite facing racial bias and prejudice largely  attributed to Donald Trump's deliberately inflammatory use of the term  ``China Virus,'' the AAPI community remained a steadfast lifeline for  Americans in need. At Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Erika Rono,  an emergency room nurse who came to the U.S. from the Philippines in  2014, continues to work every day through the harrowing realities of a  hospital overrun by COVID-19 patients. Over the past 2 years, she has  toiled day and night, putting her own life at risk, to save  [[Page S2541]]  Baltimoreans. We cannot thank her and her colleagues enough for their  bravery.   Despite the vital role the AAPI community plays in the U.S., they  still endure racism and discrimination. I am broken-hearted to see an  unprecedented increase in hate crimes against the AAPI community in  recent years. According to a study by the Center for the Study of Hate  and Extremism at California State University in San Bernardino, there  was a 44-percent increase in anti-Asian American hate crimes across 16  of the largest cities in the United States. In 2021, 81 percent of  Asian Americans who participated in a report by Pew Research stated  that violence against them was increasing.   One in 4 AAPI small business owners has experienced vandalism or  threats to their business at least once between 2020 and 2021, and one  in five Asian Americans worries daily about potential racial threats  and attacks. On top of this fear of retaliation, there is also concern  in the community, as with everyone else, about contracting the virus.   We must continue to do all that we can to preserve, protect, and  support the AAPI community. Last year, Congress enacted and President  Biden signed into law S. 937, the ``COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act,'' which  formally condemns anti-Asian violence and creates pathways for the  expedited reporting and prosecution of such abhorrent events at the  Federal, State, and local levels. There is no place for hate in our  society.   Today, as I think about my late, great colleague Norm Mineta and all  the Asian Americans who make America what it is today, I re-emphasize  my gratitude for the AAPI community and reaffirm my commitment to  eliminating systemic barriers to its success.                            ____________________
