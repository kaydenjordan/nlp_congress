 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  75th Ranger Regiment for their role in the historic elimination of ISIS  leader al-Baghdadi.   On Saturday, October 26, the 75th Ranger Regiment, along with other  Army Special Forces, flawlessly executed an operation that led to the  removal of one of the world's most dangerous terrorists.   This operation is a moment of pride for all Americans because of the  atrocities he and his group have committed against innocent men, women,  and children. It is an especially proudful moment for Georgia, in the  First Congressional District that I have the honor and privilege of  representing, because of the reported role of the 75th Ranger Regiment.   Mr. Speaker, while the 75th Ranger Regiment is headquartered at Fort  Benning, I am proud to represent one part of it through the 1st Ranger  Battalion, stationed at Savannah's Hunter Army Airfield.   I thank all of those in the 75th Ranger Regiment for their service to  our Nation and for their bravery.   While details will be restricted, I am proud of the regiment's  continued role  [[Page H8884]]  in our Nation's defense and those who serve in the 1st Battalion and  call our area home.                            ____________________
