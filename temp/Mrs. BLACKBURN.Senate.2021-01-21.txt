 Madam President, I consider it an honor and a  privilege to acknowledge for the official record Houston County, TN,  sesquicentennial anniversary.   Each State is its own melting pot of history and culture, and  Tennessee is no exception. In Houston County, the Irish roots of the  pioneers who explored the Cumberland River run deep, having buried  themselves in the rugged, foggy hills and creek beds that so resembled  the founders' homeland.   First settled in the 1780s, the Houston County area served as a new  frontier for early pioneers. What began as a small working settlement  flourished into a community that bore witness at the crossroads of the  Civil War, embraced the possibilities of crisscrossing railroads, and  led the charge toward progress that we now look back on as a major  industrial boom.   On January 21, 1871, the Tennessee legislature officially established  Houston County, named in honor of Texas freedom fighter and the sixth  Governor of Tennessee, Sam Houston. Since then, the people who call  Houston County home have turned their little  [[Page S91]]  piece of rural Tennessee into a beautiful place to live, work, and  raise a family.   Congratulations are in order to the members of the Houston County  Historical Society and, most importantly, to the citizens of Houston  County. I ask my colleagues to join with me in wishing them another 150  years of progress and prosperity.                            ____________________
