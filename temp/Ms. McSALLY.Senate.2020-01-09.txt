 Mr. President, in April of 1981, President George  H.W. Bush said ``think about every problem, every challenge, we face.  The solution to each starts with education.'' These words were true  then, and they are just as true today. Education is the bedrock of our  society, and it allows our country to advance.   It is difficult to think of someone who exemplifies President Bush's  words more than Vail School District Superintendent Calvin Baker. I  have been privileged to get to know Cal and his wife Nancy over the  last many years. I also live in Vail School District--VSD--so I have  seen the impact he has made in our community firsthand.   Cal moved back to Arizona in 1987 to become the principal of the only  school in the Vail School District, serving 500 students. He was  appointed as the superintendent of the district in 1988 and has been at  the helm ever since. During his nearly 33 years of service to students  and families in our community, Cal led the growth to now 22 schools  serving over 14,000 students. The growth was not by accident. Families  want to move to VSD so their kids can experience the world-class  educational experience thanks to Cal's extraordinary leadership and  success.   As with any organization, leadership matters, and for effective  leadership, character matters. Calvin Baker sets the example of  integrity, selfless service, and humility for all to follow. He is  truly a good man.   In his tenure, Cal built an impressive team of educators and support  staff and created a culture of innovation, parent involvement, and  dedication to students. Cal's vision for success was based on the  principle that education is a community effort. He has been the glue  that kept our growing and diverse community together united with a  common goal of educational excellence. In a recent letter Cal sent to  parents in his district, he said, ``I encourage each of you to invest  deeply in your child's education and our local schools. It is that  investment that is the `secret sauce' of Vail's success.''   Calvin Baker is a trailblazer on innovation in education for so many  other districts in the State and country to follow. Empire High School  was the first school in the United States to eliminate textbooks in  favor of computers. He pioneered the Beyond Textbooks program that  combines Vail's successful instructional methodology with an online  delivery system. Cal didn't just want Vail students to benefit from  this effective approach. Now, 115 school districts across Arizona and  six other States use this program, some of which have become top  performing districts in their States.   Baker's creative and visionary leadership didn't stop there. When  enrollment in the district surpassed capacity, he developed a year- round track system to ensure educational standards were high while new  infrastructure was planned and built. Under his leadership, Vail  schools are consistently labeled as ``A+'' by the Arizona Department of  Education.   Calvin Baker's legacy is immense and immeasurable. It will continue  on with the thousands of children in a generation who received an  amazing education in Vail School District under his leadership,  propelling them on a path of opportunity for their futures. Cal is the  longest serving superintendent of any school district in Arizona and  has left an indelible mark on education for Arizona and the country.  Appropriately, Pima County passed a resolution naming December 20 as  Calvin Baker Appreciation Day, an honor in which Cal is more than  deserving.   Last year, Cal confronted another challenge when he was diagnosed  with multiple myeloma. His example of faith, grit, and courage as he  faced the diagnosis and treatment continues to be an inspiration to us  all.   I want to personally thank Cal for his service and wish him, Nancy,  and their whole family all the best in his much-deserved  retirement.                            ____________________
