 Mr. President, this week the Senate is continuing to  make progress in consideration of the President's nominees. By the end  of this week, three more executive branch and five court vacancies will  have been filled with thoroughly qualified individuals.   Already, these uncontroversial nominees have earned overwhelming  bipartisan support. Yesterday, more than two-thirds of the Senate voted  to confirm William Cooper to serve as general counsel for the  Department of Energy. Mr. Cooper's expertise and energy policy was  evident to Chairman Murkowski and our colleagues in committee who voted  by voice to report this nomination to the full Senate. Now we have put  a sharp lawyer on the job at DOE.   Later in the day, we confirmed two more well-qualified executive  branch nominees to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the  State Department's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs by even wider  margins. Each received bipartisan support in committee. So, again, I am  glad to see a similar degree of swift, reasonable consideration here on  the floor.   I might add that these are the kinds of nominees who, a few years  ago, would have been approved on a voice vote. Today the Senate will  turn to a slate of judicial nominees with their own impressive trail of  credentials--things like prestigious clerkships and strong reviews from  the American Bar Association. Most importantly, all have demonstrated  their commitment to the rule of law.   Celebrating small wins for comity in the personnel business is, of  course, only necessary in the wake of, literally, years of  unprecedented partisan obstruction. But I will readily express my hope  that in the coming days and weeks, we will continue to work toward  clearing the Executive Calendar backlog and confirming more well- qualified nominees.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, while the Senate may  be writing a new chapter of bipartisan productivity, the same cannot be  said for the House under Democratic leadership. On this side of the  Capitol, we have passed timely legislation to address real, urgent  policy priorities. S. 1, for example, helps fight back against anti- Semitism and attends to several other pressing matters with respect to  American foreign policy in the Middle East.   The Senate debated the bill and passed it by a wide bipartisan  majority. We sent it over to the House, and now it is just sitting  there, gathering dust. It is gathering dust because Democratic  leadership is more interested in making flashy political points and  picking fights with the President than in making meaningful bipartisan  progress.   House Democrats are uninterested in our important foreign policy  legislation. What has captured their energy and attention instead? This  week they are giving prime billing to a scheme  [[Page S2534]]  that would snatch away the private health insurance plans that more  than 180 million Americans rely on and jeopardize the Medicare coverage  counted on by tens of millions more. That is what they are up to this  week.   The House Rules Committee, and by extension the Democratic  leadership, have officially granted a platform to this proposal, which  could best be described as Medicare for None. That is not just some  cute phrase. It is literally what the plan would usher in--an end to  the Medicare Program as American seniors have known it for generations.  Democrats want to take the program that seniors have paid into, which  we ought to be shoring up and stabilizing, and, instead, pile every  other American into it--one size fits all. That is what it is: End  Medicare as we know it; reuse its name for a new sort of built-from- scratch, government-administered plan, and make sure the resulting  Washington nightmare is the only game in town by outlawing choice and  competition from the private sector. That is what they want to do.   To the 60 million seniors on Medicare, most of whom like things the  way they are, Democrats say: Too bad. To the 180 million-plus other  Americans who rely on private health coverage from their employers,  many of whom like their own plans, our Democratic colleagues say: Too  bad. All of these things that American families count on, I guess my  Democratic colleagues want to wipe them all away in favor of this  untested government takeover--completely untested.   In Congresses past, this kind of far-left proposal would have been  unlikely to even receive a hearing. Democrats would have taken one look  at this socialist steamroller and run away from it like the plague.  Jeopardize current health coverage for nearly all Americans--one way or  another--for the sake of leftwing ideology? Who would go for that?   Needless to say, times seem to have changed. Now, across the aisle,  this level of radical intrusion is the proud rallying cry both here in  Congress, and, of course, out on the Presidential campaign trail. One  of the major ironies is that Medicare is not even safely on autopilot  as things stand right now, let alone herding every other American into  the system. As I have noted, the Administrator of CMS herself recently  explained that ``the program's main trust fund for hospital services  can only pay full benefits for seven more years.'' That is the Medicare  we have now.   Instead of a serious plan to shore up Medicare or address costs for  middle-class families, Democrats are focused on raising taxes  massively, trading consumer choice for Washington control, and  destabilizing the current system in the process.   Senate Republicans will stay focused on middle-class families'  priorities. We will leave the destructive daydreams to our friends  across the aisle.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
