 Madam Speaker, huge critical elements of our Federal  Government have now been shut down for 26 days. 800,000 blameless  Federal employees have already missed their paychecks, and they don't  know when their next paychecks are coming.   These furloughed workers are in crisis. They are facing impending  loan defaults, utility shutoffs, long-term reductions in their credit  scores, and potentially foreclosure or eviction proceedings. They are  unable to buy necessities for themselves and their families, including  necessary medications like insulin.   About 42,000 of those Federal workers are in my home State of  California, and they are hurting. The costs of housing are a real  challenge for families in my district, California's 45th. Thousands of  Orange County residents  [[Page H670]]  rely on Federal affordable housing programs to pay the rent each month.   Nationwide, this shutdown has already forced the expiration of over  1,100 rental assistance contracts between the government and private  landlords and developers. These housing units are at risk of being  permanently removed from our affordable housing stock.   In my district, California's 45th, the tenants of 749 homes rely on  the Department of Housing and Urban Development to help pay their  monthly rent. Our local Public Housing Authority distributes those  funds to needy families. As required by law, 75 percent of these funds  help applicants who are low-income.   Orange County's rental costs are the ninth highest in the country,  averaging over $2,000 per month. The cost of living is entirely  unaffordable for many tenants without this Federal housing assistance.                                time  1915    This past spring, our Federal Reserve found that 40 percent of  Americans--4 in 10 Americans--don't have the cash to pay for an  unexpected $400 expense without selling a belonging or borrowing funds.  American workers cannot withstand the financial shock of going unpaid.   For workers living paycheck to paycheck, this shutdown can easily  spiral into bankruptcy. Even if we provide workers with backpay, which  we have passed legislation to do, it will not make the harms of this  shutdown erased.   The government isn't paying for groceries or utilities or child care.  When the government reopens, it won't be paying the late fees that  these workers have incurred in the meantime. It also won't pay the  interest on new loans taken out by Federal workers to try to make ends  meet until the President chooses to put people over politics.   These families will still have $30 late fees on credit card payments.  They will still have to pay interest on mortgage payments, which can be  hundreds of dollars. They will still have delinquencies on their credit  reports, which can drop their credit scores and stay on their records  for up to 7 years.   That is why I have asked the major financial institutions of this  country to step up and provide relief to Federal workers and their  families who, through no fault of their own, have found themselves in  financial distress. These banks and credit card companies should waive  fees, pause debt payments, and stop eviction and foreclosure  proceedings until weeks after workers receive their pay.   Lenders should also stop reporting negative information to credit  reporting agencies during this difficult time.   Many of our Nation's credit unions are offering zero percent  interest, short-term loans to help furloughed workers.   I have sent letters to all of the Nation's largest lenders and, each  day, have been meeting with representatives of the major banks, urging  them to do more to help those affected by this shutdown. I have been  pleased with some of their responses.   For example, Discover is allowing furloughed workers to use its  existing disaster relief program to cope with the financial shock of  going unpaid. This generous program halts all payments and prevents the  imposition of late fees.   Ally Financial has created a customer assistance program that offers  help to those hurt by the shutdown. Ally is willing to refund  transaction fees, to eliminate bounced check fees, to waive late  charges, and to remove early withdrawal penalties on CDs and other  savings accounts.   Wells Fargo is waiving fees and pausing negative credit reporting,  auto repossessions, and foreclosure proceedings for furloughed workers.   I urge all lenders to contact our office to share what they are doing  proactively to help customers, their customers, who are going unpaid  through no fault of their own.   I will continue to share with my colleagues what banks and lenders  are doing so that they may do outreach to constituents in their  districts who are being affected by the furlough.   The damage the shutdown has caused, and will continue to cause,  doesn't end there. Thousands of IRS employees have been furloughed  because of the shutdown, which has delayed tax refunds and income  verification processing.   Without income verification documents, lenders may not be able to  finance or refinance mortgages or other loans. For families  experiencing recent financial hardship, access to refinancing could be  critical to helping them right themselves.   These delays in tax processing are particularly harmful to low-income  filers, especially those who qualify for the earned income tax credit  and the additional child tax credit. The EITC is one of our  government's largest anti-poverty programs, and millions of taxpayers  rely on tax refunds each year to catch up on bills, to pay off debts,  and to fund items like delayed medical procedures.   Understaffing will make it difficult for the IRS to answer taxpayer  questions this year. This is the first year that taxpayers will be  filing after the Republican tax law was implemented.   As a result of President Trump's tax law, Californians are, for the  first time in our country's history, unable to deduct all of their  State and local taxes. The elimination of this deduction is incredibly  punitive to Californians in my district. At this moment, Californians,  who are about to owe more Federal taxes than they did a year ago, don't  have access to the Federal Government, to the IRS, to help them  navigate this tax morass.   From late January through March 2, 2018, the IRS paid out tax refunds  totaling over $147 billion to 48.5 million households. Californians  submit more tax returns than any other State. For families expecting an  average refund of about $3,000, the shutdown will have very real  consequences.   If that weren't enough, the shutdown has also created an open season  on the American consumer. Consumer protection websites run by agencies,  like the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications  Commission, are closed due to lack of funding.   The FTC maintains the National Do Not Call Registry. Consumers can't  sign up, and telemarketers can't check the updated lists. There is no  one on the beat to enforce robocalling regulations.   The FTC has also shut down its critical website identitytheft.gov. In  normal times, victims of identity theft can use this website to file a  report and get the paperwork that they need to prove to banks and  businesses that someone stole their identity. That website is no longer  operating.   I want to take a minute to speak directly to every American hurt in  any way by the shutdown.   Whether you are a Federal employee or someone who relies for support  on one of those employees, I encourage you to ask for help. The  shutdown is not your fault and you could not have predicted the longest  shutdown in our history. I know how hard it is to ask for help. But do  not let embarrassment prevent you from protecting your credit score and  maintaining your financial well-being.   I have spent the last few days meeting with those representatives  from our Nation's banks. Every bank I have met with has said to please  contact them and ask for help, and do it sooner rather than later. They  will waive your late fees. They will push back your payment deadlines,  whether it is car insurance or your mortgage or credit card or some  other line of credit. If you need something specific, like to delay  foreclosure or have a bounced check fee waived, ask for that thing.   I have cast my vote to end the shutdown multiple times, and it makes  me sick to think about how working families are hurting. I have  dedicated my career to protecting consumers from financial hardship and  from bankruptcy. I am proud to have the opportunity to use that  expertise to help my constituents and unpaid Federal workers across  this country.   Call your lender, call your bank, call your credit card company and  ask for help. And if you need more help, call my office. Until the  President ends this shutdown, it will be my priority in Congress to  help all those who are being hurt by it.
