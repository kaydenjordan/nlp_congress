 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share how the recent  enactment of the bipartisan infrastructure law is already delivering  for organized labor and businesses in the First District of Indiana.   My district is home to three airports that are drivers of our  economy. They are essential to moving goods and people throughout the  region and Nation and create good-paying jobs and increased economic  opportunities.   According to the Federal Aviation Administration, three regional  airports are expected to receive funds under the bipartisan  infrastructure law, including over $150,000 to the Michigan City  Municipal Airport, almost $300,000 to the Porter County Regional  Airport, and over $750,000 to the Gary/Chicago International Airport.   I look forward to continuing the work in a spirit of cooperation with  local and State officials to harness the impact of the bipartisan  infrastructure law.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, it is my honor today to rise in support of  H.R. 1836, the Guard and Reserve GI Bill Parity Act. I am so grateful  for the sacrifices and the services of all our National Guard and  Reserve members. They stand ready at a moment's notice to protect our  Nation, our democracy, and the health of our communities.   Two instances jump out at me when I think of the heroism of the  Indiana National Guard members from this past year. The first was being  able to spend time with our brave National Guard members last year in  the cafeteria of the Department of Labor on the other side of the  Capitol complex when they bravely rushed to our Nation's Capitol to  defend our Constitution and to protect our democracy.   The second was when I was able to stand side by side with them in the  city of Gary when they operated a Federal COVID-19 vaccine site, which  provided over 60,000 vaccines in Northwest Indiana at a critical time  during our pandemic.   The First District is also home to the proud Slovak community. And I  am particularly appreciative that the Indiana National Guard has a  flourishing military partnership with our strong ally, the country of  Slovakia. We also have the 113th Engineering National Guard, which I  have shared time with, who the men and women have sacrificed their  time, dedication, and efforts to go over to Afghanistan. What this bill  does is it gives us the opportunity to have equitable training and  equitable educational opportunity for our National Guardsmen.   Mr. Speaker, our Nation today has the opportunity to treat their  Active Duty service on par with all branches of the military and ensure  that every day the National Guard Reserve member serves our Nation in  uniform is a day that counts toward their GI Bill benefits.   Thank you to the leadership of Congressman   Mike Levin, Chairman  Takano, and all of my fellow members of the Committee on Veteran  Affairs for your commitment to our Guard and Reserve members and for  bringing this measure to the floor today.   I also thank Chairman Takano on his leadership to protect the  National Guardsmen on the burn pits and the toxic fumes that we have  passed and how we are providing benefits and making sure that that is  distributed fairly and equitably and making sure they receive the  benefits necessary.    Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this important  legislation.
