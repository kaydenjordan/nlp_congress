 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of En  Bloc 3 that includes my Rules amendment number 110 to increase funding  for diversity in the aviation field.   Being an aircraft pilot is an in-demand, high-paying profession, with  the median annual wage for a commercial pilot being over $99,000.  Unfortunately, the aviation industry is impressively homogenous.  According to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, 93 percent of aviation  pilots and engineers in 2021 were White with only 6.1 percent being  Hispanic/Latino, 3.9 percent being Black, and 1.5 percent being Asian.  Approximately 95 percent of aviation pilots and engineers are men.   Prior to the pandemic, the pilot pipeline was untenably low, We have  heard repeatedly this summer about how the recent travel problems occur  in part due to a pilot shortage. The high cost of pilot training is a  key barrier to entering the profession, especially for people of color.  Pilot training can cost between $80,000 to $100,000.   My amendment gives Congress an opportunity to help individuals enter  aviation careers while increasing the diversity of the field. My  amendment increases and decreases the Research, Engineering, and  Development program by $10 million to highlight the need to double  funding for the Aviation Workforce Development Grants. The Aviation  Workforce Development Grants program invests in training and  diversification of aircraft pilots and aviation maintenance workers.  The aircraft pilot program and the aviation maintenance program each is  currently authorized at $5 million. My amendment highlights how  doubling funding for these grants would help address the immediate need  to increase the aviation workforce with a focus on individuals  currently underrepresented in the profession.   Further, my amendment focuses on how the Aviation Workforce program  could include more students of color by expanding partnerships with  Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges and  Universities, and the five Minority Serving Institutions, including:  Asian American Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions;  Alaska Native and  [[Page H6845]]  Native Hawaiian Serving Institutions; Hispanic Serving Institutions;  Native American-Serving Non-Tribal Institutions; and Predominantly  Black Institutions. These institutions have expertise in educating and  graduating low income students of color. Collaborating with these  institutions is an effective way to target grants to students from  racial/ethnic backgrounds with financial need.   In closing, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to bring  attention to the need to increase funding for aviation workforce  training and diversity.
