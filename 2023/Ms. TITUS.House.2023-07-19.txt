 Mr. Chairman, as a member of the Aviation Subcommittee and  co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional Unmanned Systems Caucus, I  support the FAA reauthorization bill that passed unanimously out of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee just weeks ago. It includes  provisions that will benefit all the airports in Nevada's First  District, and it will remove regulatory hurdles for drones so they can  be used commercially, for search and rescue, and for fire detection and  suppression.   Furthermore, my district, which is one of the world's top travel  destinations, welcomes visitors from all backgrounds and abilities. I  am proud to say that this bill includes provisions from the Air Carrier  Access Amendments Act. This was an act previously introduced by my good  friend, former Representative Jim Langevin. It will protect the rights  of disabled passengers by establishing aircraft accessibility standards  and setting a timeline for DOT to investigate and respond to  disability-related complaints.   Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, Aviation  Subcommittee Ranking Member Cohen, and Chairman Graves for their hard  work and cooperation on this bill, as well as Chairman Van Drew, the  Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the airlines for their collaboration  on the disability provisions.    Mr. Chair, I urge passage of this bill.
