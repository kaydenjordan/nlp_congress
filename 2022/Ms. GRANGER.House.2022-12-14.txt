 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this short-term continuing  resolution through December 23. I am very disappointed that we are,  once again, discussing a CR because full-year appropriations bills have  not been signed into law.   I want to explain why we find ourselves in this place. Republican  Members opposed the trillions of dollars in nondefense spending that  Members on the other side of the aisle pushed through this Congress.  That new spending was provided outside the normal process, and it is  roughly twice the amount of funding we provide in a year through the  annual appropriations bills.   After these unprecedented levels of spending, nondefense programs  should not require another large increase in fiscal year 2023. We need  to focus on reducing government waste, fighting inflation, and focusing  our limited resources on true priorities like border security and our  Nation's military.   Democrats have had all year to put bills on the floor that address  these concerns and can be signed into law. Time is up. We should be  passing a continuing resolution into next year instead of buying more  time to rush through a massive spending package.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Cline), a member of the Committee on  Appropriations.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
