 Mr. Speaker, I do rise today in support of H.R.  1430, and I appreciate the primer that we were just given from the  other side on what an emergency is.   I would remind my good friend on the other side that, on November 8,  2016, the Americans stood up and said: We have an emergency. We need to  change directions. And they elected Donald Trump to be President to do  just that. So that is a good reminder.   Mr. Speaker, our constituents have a right to know whether or not EPA  regulations are based on sound science and if they benefit the American  people.   Keeping in the vein with what I just said, we have a better way.  Speaker Paul Ryan has put out his plan for A Better Way. Donald Trump  has been elected for that better way. The American people deserve a  better way.   This is called the HONEST Act, which I am proud to be a cosponsor of.  It is a better way. It is simple and straightforward. It is a message  to government bureaucrats they cannot propose costly new regulations  without providing sufficient transparency. As my good friend from  Washington said: Why would anybody be opposed to transparency and a  right for the American public to know?   Opponents of this bill apparently think Americans do not deserve to  know the truth, not to mention the ``science'' behind EPA burdensome  regulations.                                time  1245    Trust me when I say Americans deserve the truth from the very start.   Mr. Speaker, EPA's regulatory agenda should not require secret  science, much less 30-year-old data, in order to sell it to the  American people. The other side likes to claim that there are a lot of  scientists behind this climate change theory, but they won't release  that data.   So what are they hiding behind?   By the way, I remember Mark Twain said that sometimes the majority  simply means that all the fools are on one side.   Mr. Speaker, it is long past time for Congress to increase the  transparency of the EPA. This HONEST Act will do exactly that by  prohibiting the EPA from proposing or finalizing regulations based upon  data that is either outdated, it is not transparent, nor is it publicly  available for review.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Smith for bringing this important  legislation to the floor today, and I thank the fine gentleman from  Washington State (Mr. Newhouse).   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for his speech, but it  was on a different bill than the one we are talking about right now.  That was a rule we debated yesterday. The rule passed, but we are going  to be talking about it today. So I was a little confused trying to  follow the gentleman.   I also want to remind the gentleman that he mentioned Donald Trump's  election. I will remind him that less than half of the people of the  United States actually voted for him. Hillary won the popular vote by  close to 3 million. The gentleman keeps on talking about a better way,  a better way, a better way.   Was that what was on display last week when we spent 15 hours in the  Rules Committee debating a repeal-and-replace bill on health care that  only 16 percent of the American people thought was worth it and that  had to be pulled because it was such a lousy process?   If that is the better way, I don't think people want anything to do  with it.   I would say to the gentleman, my colleague, Mr. Newhouse, who is  talking about trying to justify the closed process and saying that some  of these bills were CRAs, just repealing regulations, well, my friends  chose to bring up these repeal regulation bills under a very closed  process. Interestingly enough, these rules were made under a very open  process where agencies solicited input from stakeholders and from the  public, and it was all out in the open. But the Republicans chose to  bring measures to the floor to repeal regulations in such a way that  that agency can't even go back and revisit the same subject of that  particular regulation.   I think people need to understand this. I don't think I can ever  recall a more closed, authoritarian process than the one that we have  experienced under this leadership. This is not only something that I  know Democrats have a problem with; I know a lot of Republicans do,  too, because what this closed process means is that anybody with a good  idea can't bring it to the floor and can't have an opportunity to  debate the issue.   It was funny last night in the Rules Committee, my colleague from  Texas (Mr. Burgess) was kind of crowing about the fact that no  amendments were brought before the Rules Committee. I reminded him the  reason why no amendments were brought before the Rules Committee is  because this bill was noticed as an emergency and there was no call for  amendments. Members weren't asked to bring their ideas or their  amendments to the Rules Committee. This would be laughable if it  weren't so tragic. I would say to my colleagues that it is this same  closed process that brought us this disastrous health repeal bill that  my friends had to pull last week that is on display today. When you  have a lousy process, you end up with lousy legislation.   This is the people's House. We are supposed to deliberate, and here  is a radical idea: let us deliberate a little bit. Open it up. Open it  up a little bit. Let there be some amendments on both sides of the  aisle.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous  question. If we defeat the previous question, I will bring to the floor  an amendment, which I am going to talk about right now because, Mr.  Speaker, we are deeply concerned by reports from our intelligence  community regarding Russian interference in last year's election and  even more troubled by FBI Director Comey's sworn testimony that the FBI  is now investigating the possibility of collusion between members of  President Trump's campaign team and Russia.   Mr. Speaker, the legitimacy of our electoral system is at stake, and  it is time that this Republican-controlled Congress does its job and  gets to the bottom of this. Unfortunately, recent actions by the House  Intelligence Committee chairman have left many Members from both sides  of the aisle convinced that the committee will not be able to conduct  an impartial investigation of this crucial matter of national security.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to bring up Representative Swalwell's and  Representative Cummings' bill, which would create a bipartisan  commission to investigate Russian interference in our 2016 election.  For the life of me I don't know why this is controversial. My  colleagues on the Republican side should be just as interested in  getting to the truth and getting to the truth in a way that has  credibility with the American people as we on the Democratic side do.  [[Page H2532]]    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Farenthold). Is there objection to the  request of the gentleman from Massachusetts?    There was no objection.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly) to discuss our proposal.
