 Mr. Speaker, we have been out of session for a week, and  much has happened in America. Of course, the most dreadful thing is  Parkland, Florida, and the Douglas High School. I shed quite a few  tears thinking about those students and looking at the teachers who  lost their lives.   The system failed. The FBI failed to follow up. Apparently, the  sheriff's department failed to follow up. Mr. Speaker, our President  failed because he failed to see the problem that we have in this  country is not giving teachers guns, but giving teachers more respect  and giving them more counselors and giving them more aid to be able to  teach. He failed to see that the problem is not just in schools, where  it is so important and there have been shootings and killings, but  there are killings in Texas churches and in Las Vegas concerts, and by  people over 21 years of age.   Banning bump stocks, which was the response to Las Vegas, is right  and good and needs to be done by law to be done legally. Banning  assault weapons being purchased by under 21-year-olds is good, but we  need to ban assault weapons for everybody, for the 58 victims in Las  Vegas as well as the victims in that church in Texas--and high-capacity  magazines. We need to let the CDC study. We need to act.   God save America and the Chamber.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise today in support of the  Stop, Observe, Ask, and Respond to Health and Wellness Act, which is  the acronym SOAR.   In April of 2016, I worked with the Department of Homeland Security  to host a Human Trafficking Awareness Training program in Memphis at  the University of Tennessee. We gathered State and local law  enforcement, first responders, healthcare workers, faith-based groups,  and educators to discuss the importance of and strategies to combat  human trafficking. This event solidified my stance and activated me to  go forward with the legislation to address the human trafficking that  is occurring in the United States.   Shortly after, I was proud to introduce this bipartisan bill along  with my colleagues: Congressman Kinzinger from Illinois, Congressman  Cardenas from California, and Congresswoman Wagner from Missouri in the  House, as well as Senators Heitkamp and Susan Collins in the Senate.   Human trafficking is the second fastest-growing crime in Tennessee,  and it is amazing that every 2 minutes someone in the United States is  entered into human trafficking. Every 2 minutes. In 2016, 8,042 cases  were reported to the National Human Trafficking Hotline,  [[Page H1236]]  with 110 of those occurring in Tennessee. Those are just the cases that  were reported. Human trafficking remains a hidden crime, and victims  rarely seek help because of cultural barriers or due to fear of their  traffickers, law enforcement, or of being deported, because many are  imported into our country to engage in sex crimes.   In April 2016, I joined with the Department of Homeland Security in  hosting our conference in Memphis, and from there came our legislation.  The SOAR Act directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to  establish a program to provide training to healthcare providers at all  levels on human trafficking.   Trafficking victims often end up in healthcare settings, and because  traffickers want to maximize profits, victims will not have health  insurance and will not often follow up on treatment. And pimps and  johns will beat up the women, and they will end up in a public  healthcare facility because they don't have insurance.   Mr. Speaker, 57 percent of trafficking victims report physical  injuries, and nearly all report having faced either sexual abuse or  physical violence. These injuries caused a reported 63 percent of  trafficking victims to go to the emergency room when they are being  exploited. Many victims also end up with sexually transmitted  infections, including HIV, and are at high risk of pregnancy. As a  result, nearly 88 percent of trafficked victims are seen by a  healthcare provider at some point and, more likely than not, it is in  an emergency room. So these are the people we seek out most to train  and see the signs of trafficking to be able to report it to law  enforcement and help these ladies out of the situation they are in.   Despite this, out of more than 5,600 hospitals in the country, only a  handful have a plan for treating patients who are victims of  trafficking, and over 95 percent of emergency room personnel are not  trained to identify trafficking victims. As a result, it is estimated  that only 1 percent of human trafficking victims are identified when  they seek emergency care.    We must encourage healthcare professionals to be alert to possible  instances of human trafficking when victims appear in clinics or  doctors' offices for needed care, and we must provide them the  additional training and resources to accomplish this goal.   I am proud to work on the SOAR to Health and Wellness Act and I urge  my colleagues to help pass it today. I thank my cosponsors and the  Republican leadership for scheduling this bill.
