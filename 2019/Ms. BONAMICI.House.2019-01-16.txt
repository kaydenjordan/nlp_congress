 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Maryland for  yielding time.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the rule and the Disaster  Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2019, which will provide relief and  recovery assistance for those affected by natural disasters.   I am pleased that this bill includes $150 million for commercial  fishery and fishery resource disasters declared by the Secretary of  Commerce.   Oregon's commercial salmon fisheries were devastated in 2016 and 2017  when they saw more than a 70 percent decline in their salmon catch  compared to the 5-year average.   Despite considerable Federal and State investment in Chinook salmon  recovery, many factors outside of the control of the fishing industry,  including drought and changing ocean conditions exacerbated by climate  change, continue to impede salmon populations. In Oregon, the 2016  salmon catch levels were so low that they measured among the worst  nationwide fisheries disasters of the year. And 2017 was even worse, at  less than half of the 2016 value.   These disastrous salmon seasons have already hurt the distressed  economies of the coastal communities that rely on the commercial  fishing industry.   I have heard from salmon fishermen like Jeff Reeves. He fishes, he  farms, and he logs to make ends meet. He scraped, and he invested  $200,000 in a boat. Then the back-to-back disaster seasons arrived, and  he had to sell it.   As Jeff points out, fishermen are small business owners, and a bad  season can be devastating for their livelihoods.   I was proud to lead my Oregon colleagues in calling on Secretary Ross  to declare a disaster declaration for ocean troll Klamath River fall  Chinook salmon fisheries, and I was glad to see that the secretary  issued that declaration last fall.   The $150 million included in this bill will allow those hard-hit  communities that depend on fisheries revenue, like those in the Pacific  Northwest, to seek Federal assistance and begin the recovery process.                                time  1315    I thank Chairman McGovern and Chairwoman Lowey for their leadership,  and Mr. Raskin, as well, on this commonsense bill to support  communities affected by natural disasters across the country. I urge  all of my colleagues to support this bill.
