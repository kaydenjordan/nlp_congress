 Madam President, first, I am so pleased to work with my  good friend Chairman Murkowski on something she has worked on for quite  some time with Senator Cantwell. Taking up this new position, I want to  make sure I help them the best I can to bring this to fruition. That is  what we are working on right now. To have S. 47 in front of us is  pretty special.   The public lands package includes such a wide variety of bills, as  the chairman has spoken about. There are currently more than 130  different pieces of individual legislation that will address many  Members' priorities for public lands and natural resources in their  respective States. A public lands package doesn't come together that  often. I think it has been 5 years, as was said, and they are far and  few between. When it does, we try to accommodate and do the right thing  that really helps our country and future generations.   Many of the bills in this package provide technical corrections and  improvements to existing policies but do not have a significant impact  outside their local sphere. However, these minor bills will improve the  way our public lands are managed and conserved at the ground level.  While these bills are important to the residents of the small towns  like mine across America and Members of this body who represent them,  rarely will these individual bills receive the floor time they truly  deserve. Because of this, it is necessary for us to move these bills  together in this package, which is what we have coming up before us  probably by tomorrow.   This package was literally years in the making. As I said, it builds  on the package that was negotiated last December by Chairman Murkowski,  then-Ranking Member Cantwell, then-Chairman Bishop, and then-Ranking  Member Grijalva of the House Natural Resources Committee. Together,  this group came together and negotiated a large package. Unfortunately,  the Senate could not pass the package last December, which is why we  find ourselves here today.   I am grateful for the opportunity to serve as the ranking member of  the committee and to be working with my friend from Alaska Chairman  Murkowski on this package but also on many other issues we will  consider in the committee in the coming time.   I would also like to take this moment to thank the committee staff,  the majority and minority, as well as the floor staff for their  diligence in working on this package. I would like to include a list of  names who worked on the package for both me and Senator Cantwell and in  our committee over the last few months. I would also like to include  the names of the floor and leadership staff.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that this list of names be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         S. 47 Lands Package Staff Team: Mary Louise Wagner,       Democratic Staff Director; Sam Fowler, Democratic Chief       Counsel; David Brooks, Democratic General Counsel; Bryan       Petit, Democratic Senior Professional Staff Member; Rebecca       Bonner, Democratic Professional Staff Member; Camille Touton,       Democratic Professional Staff Member; Sarah Venuto,       Democratic Staff Director; Lance West, Democratic Deputy       Staff Director; Elliot Howard, Democratic Professional Staff       Member; Lauren Vernon, Democratic Research Assistant; Tom       Schaff, National Park Service Bevinetto Fellow; David Poyer,       Democratic Staff Assistant; Kennedy Woodard, Democratic Staff       Assistant; Cameron Nelson, Democratic Research Assistant;       Sean Byrne, Legislative Assistant; Gary Myrick, Secretary for       the Minority; Tricia Engle, Assistant Secretary for the       Minority; Ryan McConaghy, Floor Assistant to the Democratic       Leader; Daniel Tinsley, Floor Assistant to the Democratic       Leader; Brad Watt, Floor Assistant to the Democratic Leader;       Stephanie Paone, Democratic Cloakroom Assistant; Maalik       Simmons, Democratic Cloakroom Assistant; Nathan Oursler,       Democratic Cloakroom Assistant; Mary Frances Repko, Minority       Staff Director; Andrew Rogers, Minority Chief Counsel;       Christophe Tulou, Minority Senior Counsel and Policy       Director; Elizabeth Mabry, Minority Professional Staff       Member; and John Kane, Minority Senior Professional Staff       Member.     This package enjoys the support from numerous national  stakeholder organizations across the political spectrum. For example,  the National Wildlife Federation and the Congressional Sportsmen's  Foundation are two of its strongest and most dedicated advocates. I  thank them for their support. I ask unanimous consent that the list of  organizations writing in support of this bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         The organizations include: Bi-partisan Policy Center       Action; League of Conservation Voters; Boone and Crockett       Club; Ventura County; Chugach of Alaska Corporation; The       Wilderness Society; conservation groups including National       Audubon Society and the Sierra Club; livestock groups such as       the Public Lands Council, National Cattlemen's Beef       Association, and American Sheep Industry Association; outdoor       recreation groups including Access Fund, American Alpine       Club, American Canoe Association, American Whitewater,       Colorado Mountain Club, International Mountain Bicycling       Association, Outdoor Alliance, Outdoor Industry Association,       Surfrider Foundation, The Conservation Alliance, The Mazamas,       The Mountaineers, Winter Midlands Alliance; organizations       representing the Outdoor Recreation  [[Page S901]]       Roundtable including American Horse Council, American       Sportfishing, Association Archery Trade Association,       Association of Marina Industries, Boat Owners Association of       the United States, The Corps Network, International       Snowmobile Manufacturers, Association Marine Retailers,       Association of the Americas Motorcycle Industry Council,       National Association of RV Parks and Campgrounds, National       Marine Manufacturers Association, National Park Hospitality,       Association National Shooting Sports Foundation,       PeopleForBikes, Recreational Off-Highway Vehicle Association,       RV Dealers Association RV Industry, Association Specialty       Equipment Market, Association Specialty Vehicle Institute of       America; sportsmen's groups including American Fly Fishing       Trade Association, American Sportfishing Association,       American Woodcock Society, Angler Action Foundation, Archery       Trade Association, Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, Bass       Anglers Sportsman Society (B.A.S.S.), Bear Trust       International, Bonefish & Tarpon Trust, Boone & Crockett       Club, California Waterfowl Association, Camp Fire Club of       America, Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation, Conservation       Force, Council to Advance Hunting and Shooting Sports, Delta       Waterfowl, Ducks Unlimited, Fly Fishers International,       Houston Safari Club, Izaak Walton League of America, Land       Trust Alliance, National Deer Alliance, National Marine       Manufacturers Association, National Shooting Sports       Foundation, National Wildlife Federation, North American       Falconers Association, Orion: The Hunter's Institute, Outdoor       Industry Association, Outdoor Recreation Roundtable,       Pheasants Forever/Quail Forever, Pope & Young Club, Public       Lands Foundation, Quality Deer Management Association, Rocky       Mountain Elk Foundation, Ruffed Grouse Society, Sportsmen's       Alliance, Texas Wildlife Association, The Nature Conservancy,       Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, Trust for Public       Land, Whitetails Unlimited, Wildlife Forever, Wildlife       Management Institute; and The Corps Group Network with many       national and regional organizations including Appalachian       Trail Conservancy Leadership Corps, Citizens Conservation       Corps, Harpers Ferry Job Corps Civilian Conservation Center,       and Stewards Individual Placement Program.     This package should be warmly received by both Democrats  and Republicans. It is truly a bipartisan effort. For starters, the  package includes numerous land exchanges and conveyances, designates  over 1.3 million acres of wilderness, designates 367 miles of wild and  scenic rivers, and provides boundary adjustments, designation changes,  and management improvements to numerous areas in all four corners of  the country. All of this will improve access, provide recreational  opportunities, and allow four of our Federal public land management  Agencies--the Bureau of Land Management, the Forest Service, the Fish  and Wildlife Service, and the National Park Service--to better serve  the public through their varying missions as directed by Congress.   Our public lands are truly one of the Nation's greatest treasures,  and we are unique in how we set aside some of our most special places  in the country to be conserved, protected, and easily accessible to the  public so we can all enjoy the beauty these areas offer. Usually, these  lands are located in rural areas, with few other economic  opportunities, making these treasures economic engines for the  surrounding communities. In fact, data from the U.S. Department of  Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis shows the outdoor recreation  economy accounted for 2.2 percent of GDP and grew faster than the  overall economy.   According to the Outdoor Industry Association, outdoor recreation  supports 7.6 million direct national jobs and $887 billion in consumer  spending. Overall, this contributes billions to the Federal, State, and  local governments in tax revenue.   In West Virginia, outdoor recreation supports 91,000 direct jobs and  $9 billion in consumer spending. Each year, 67 percent of West Virginia  residents take to the outdoors to escape the hustle and bustle of their  daily lives to enjoy the peace and certainty of our wild and wonderful  outdoor heritage. It is truly almost heaven. If you haven't been there,  we welcome you.   This package provides permanent reauthorization of the Land and Water  Conservation Fund, which Senator Murkowski has pointed out. This is  something most every one of us--535 Members of Congress--is truly  supportive of because it affects our States and our districts. LWCF is  a simple yet highly effective conservation tool with unrivaled success  over the last 50 years. Every year, $900 million in royalties paid by  energy companies drilling for oil and gas on the Outer Continental  Shelf are put into this fund.   Unfortunately, LWCF expired last September. The National Resource  Management Act provides permanent reauthorization of the LWCF. That is  enough to bring all of us together.   This permanent reauthorization ensures that States and Federal public  land management Agencies have the ability to continue to protect and  conserve our natural resources for the next generation, and it does so  without relying on taxpayer dollars.   Since 1965, more than $243 million in LWCF funds have been spent in  my little State of West Virginia on more than 500 projects, both on  State and Federal lands. This includes improvements to local parks and  public spaces and 54 of our little State's 55 counties. It also funded  acquisition for our most cherished public lands, such as the Gauley  River National Recreation Area, the New River Gorge National River, and  Dolly Sods in the Monongahela National Forest.   This package also includes some long-awaited priorities for our  sportsmen's groups. Each year, more than 350,000 hunters take to the  woods in West Virginia to pursue game. These hunting traditions  directly benefit rural communities, generating annual revenue and  supporting 5,000 jobs. According to the West Virginia Division of  Natural Resources, hunting-related expenditures total nearly $270  million of the State's economy. Aside from this, and perhaps most  importantly, hunting in West Virginia is one of our oldest pastimes in  which friends and families can gather and spend quality time together.   As I work with other Members of this very body on difficult issues  where we may strongly disagree with each other, we are able to set  aside differences when it comes to sportsmen's traditions. The  conversations quickly turn to stories of hunting a deer with our  children and grandchildren or taking a child to the first deer camp. It  is important that we provide opportunities to keep these traditions  alive.   The Natural Resource Management Act will expand and enhance  sportsmen's access by making Federal lands throughout West Virginia and  the Nation ``open unless closed'' for fishing, hunting, recreational  shooting, and other outdoor activities.   As a hunter myself and as vice chair of the Congressional Sportsmen's  Caucus, I know how frustrated sportsmen's groups have been in trying to  get their bills passed the last few years. That is one of the reasons I  am pleased that Chairman Murkowski's bill, of which I am an original  cosponsor, the Sportsmen's Act, is included in this package.   The Natural Resource Management Act also establishes several national  heritage areas, including one in West Virginia, the Appalachian Forest  National Heritage Area. National heritage areas are designated by  Congress as places where natural, cultural, and historic resources  combine to form a cohesive, nationally important landscape. The  Appalachian Forest National Heritage Area has been operating as an ad  hoc national heritage area for more than a decade. Despite not having  official designation, the Appalachian Forest Heritage Area has  continually done a great deal for West Virginia. For example, the  Appalachian Forest Heritage Area administers a credible AmeriCorps  program. In one recent program year, 38 AmeriCorps members completed  more than 65,000 service hours directly benefiting local rural areas in  West Virginia, as in every State. These 38 members improved 1,700 acres  of public land and managed more than 1,000 total volunteers.   By providing the official NHA designation, the Appalachian Forest  Heritage Area can earn the national recognition it deserves and is now  also eligible for grants and technical assistance from the National  Park Service. This will take their programmatic efforts and other  services they provide to the region to the next level.   I believe that this package is a great bill for both my Republican  and Democratic friends. Numerous pieces of legislation that have been  longstanding priorities for many Members are included.   I would like to thank Chairman Murkowski again, as well as other  members of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, for their  efforts to reach an agreement on this bill. For those of  [[Page S902]]  our colleagues who felt that they were not able to get exactly what  they wanted or exactly what they would love to have had in this bill,  we are committed to working with them to further help them in getting  access to any other piece of legislation we will have working through  the committee.   I want to thank the majority leader for his willingness to bring this  bill to the floor. I believe it is time to send the bill to the House  and to the President for his signature. We have had a great working  relationship with Chairman Grijalva, and he is committed to working  with us as we work through this process.   There are many pieces of good legislation in this package that will  be valued for years to come by communities across the country and each  one of our States. I strongly encourage Members to vote yes on this  final package.   Thank you.   I yield the floor to the Senator from Montana.
