 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, tonight, we join Texans back home in a day of  celebration for the State of Texas. The State of Texas, as you have  heard, began its formation not just at the Alamo but as people came to  Texas with the understanding that we wanted the freedom of our own  country.   That is when, on February the 24th, the day after the siege of the  Alamo began, heroism and opportunity filled the Alamo with ideas not  only that they wanted to have their own country, but about a land, a  land of people, a land of freedom, and a land that would be full of  opportunity.   Mr. Speaker, that is what we still stand for in Texas, a State that  has distinguished itself not only in honor and in principle but in the  opportunity to be a part of the United States of America, one Nation  under God, the opportunity to serve in war after war with the United  States military, the armed forces of this country. Texas has produced  for years, not just heroes like Davy Crockett and Colonel William  Barret Travis, but produced in every single war in this country those  men and women who would stand for the opportunity to make this country  stronger and better.   Tonight, as we begin the celebration of Texas Independence Day, it  should be remembered that here in Washington, D.C., this delegation is  proud of not only who we are and what we stand for, but we are proud to  be the 28th State in the United States of America.   In 1845, we left Texas being a country to join the United States of  America. The heroism, the pride of authorship, and the love which we  have for the State of Texas we also share for our country, the United  States of America.   I thank the gentleman for leading the Texas delegation tonight as we  stand on the floor to give thanks.   ``Texas, our Texas. All hail the mighty State.''
