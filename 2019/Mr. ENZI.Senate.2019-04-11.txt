 I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Association Health  Plans Act of 2019. I have been championing association health plans,  which I sometimes call small business health plans, for more than 15  years. As a small business owner, I understand firsthand the  difficulties these employers face trying to provide health insurance  for their employees. Small business owners want to provide  comprehensive health insurance to their employees, but it can be a real  struggle to afford those plans. In part due to these pressures, the  number of small businesses offering coverage has dropped substantially  over the years, from 47 percent in 2000 to 30 percent in 2017.   Few families are shielded from the rising costs of healthcare and, by  extension, the rising cost of health insurance, but among the hardest  hit are American small businesses.   Small businesses have limited ability to pool risk and lack coverage  in the market, so they often end up paying more for health insurance  than large employers who have more buying power. According to the  National Conference of State Legislatures, small businesses pay about 8  to 18 percent more on average than large businesses for the same health  insurance policy.   To put it another way, one family shoe store probably can't get an  insurance company to play ball, but 1,000 family shoe stores probably  could. This is the premise of the association health plans. Let's let  small businesses band together and leverage their shared power in  numbers to obtain comprehensive and affordable health insurance as  though they were a single large employer.   This does not mean they are allowed to cut corners. The coverage  offered to association members is subject to the consumer protection  requirements that apply to large employers. That includes important  consumer protections established on a bipartisan basis under the  Employee Retirement Income Security Act, ERISA, the Health Insurance  Portability and Accountability Act, HIPAA, and the Consolidated Omnibus  Budget Reconciliation Act, COBRA. Association health plans also comply  with the Affordable Care Act requirements for large-employer health  plans.   Association health plans are not a new concept. They have long been  permitted under Federal law. For example, the Wyoming Chambers Health  Benefit Plan has served Wyoming's Chambers of Commerce since 2007. It  currently offers comprehensive and affordable coverage to 11 local  Chambers of Commerce, 52 employers, and 255 employees.   Last year, the Trump administration issued a new rule that made it  easier for small businesses to band together for the purposes of  offering an association health plan. Specifically, the Department of  Labor created a new ``pathway'' for forming the association so that  small businesses can band together by common industry or common  geography. For example, flower shops across the Nation might band  together to offer an association health plan, or small businesses in  unrelated professions might band together just within my State of  Wyoming.   The final rule also allowed self-employed Americans to receive  coverage through association health plans established under the new  pathway. It did not rescind the old pathway, so association health  plans in existence before the final rule can continue to operate  unchanged, or new ones can use that pathway to form.   The final rule also does not change existing ERISA preemption rules  that authorize broad State insurance regulation of association health  plans either through health insurance issuers or directly in the case  of self-insured association health plans. I will repeat that again. The  final rule does not change existing ERISA preemption rules that  authorize broad State insurance regulation of association health plans  either through health insurance issuers or directly in the case of  self-insured association health plans.   Roughly 30 association health plans have formed under the new pathway  since the Department of Labor finalized the rule. For example, the Las  Vegas Chamber of Commerce formed an association health plan covering  500 small businesses and 100 sole proprietors. The Georgia Chamber of  Commerce began taking steps to launch a new self-insured association  health plan that could eventually enroll 800,000 people. Two Michigan  small business associations joined forces to create an association  health plan that has enrolled nearly 400 small businesses throughout  the State.   There are likely more to come. According to the Congressional Budget  Office, about 4 million people are expected to enroll in association  health plans by 2023, including 400,000 who would otherwise be  uninsured.   All of this is to demonstrate one simple fact: Association health  plans work. They provide coverage to people who would not otherwise  have it, and they provide comprehensive health benefits at an  affordable price.   Unfortunately, a Federal district judge vacated the Labor  Department's final rule, threatening to disrupt coverage for tens of  thousands of enrollees in association health plans formed under the  final rule and threatening to restrict the ability of small businesses,  working families, and self-employed Americans to band together to  obtain affordable and high-quality health insurance in the future.   My bill will simply codify the Labor Department's final rule to  provide certainty for current enrollees and to ensure the pathway  remains available for new association health plans to form. It is not  intended to disrupt the State authority. That is important so we don't  need to build another Washington bureaucracy, and you can be assured of  better help if you need it. Our State insurance commissioners are much  closer to the real problems confronted by insurance consumers and are  better able to deal with those issues at a local level. It is also not  intended to affect association health plans created by other means than  the pathway established in the final rule.   There has been a lot of discussion in the Senate lately about  protections for people with preexisting conditions. I support  protecting people with preexisting conditions. Every Republican Senator  I know does too. It is important to point out that robust coverage  doesn't mean very much if you can't afford to buy it. Unfortunately,  that has been the experience for a lot of small business owners and  self-employed Americans in my State. Association health plans can help  solve this problem for small businesses. The Labor Department's final  rule didn't just expand eligibility for a type of health insurance that  has long been available for some small business owners in the United  States. It made the promise of comprehensive and affordable health  insurance coverage a reality for the same Americans who have identified  the cost of health insurance as the No. 1 problem facing small  businesses for the last 30 years.   This is not to say there is not more that can be done. The final rule  is an important step forward, but it is not a silver bullet. There is  more Congress can do to advance association health plans, and there is  more Congress can do to improve our healthcare system and address the  issues of rising healthcare costs and rising drug prices, all while  ensuring protections for people with preexisting conditions, but one  thing we can do immediately to help people with preexisting conditions  is to pass the bill I am introducing today. The district court judge  struck down the Labor Department's final  [[Page S2439]]  rule and did not issue a stay, so thousands of currently covered  individuals are at risk of losing their health insurance coverage.  Passing this bill will ensure that they do not.   Small businesses ought to have the opportunity to band together and  leverage their combined strength so they can negotiate and provide  their employees with comprehensive and affordable health insurance  coverage. That coverage should be subject to the same consumer  protection requirements that apply to large employers offering similar  coverage. Small businesses and their employees are the bedrock of our  country's economy, and proper health insurance coverage is a key  element of family well-being and peace of mind. This bill will  strengthen those foundations so we can continue to prosper as a  country.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Association Health  Plans Act of 2019.
