 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 962,  the Born-Alive Survivors Protection Act, and I ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.    A parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker.    I understand the guidelines the Chair decided, Mr.  Speaker, but seeing no objection from either side of the House, would  that constitute clearance and allow the Chair to entertain my motion  under the rules of the House?    Further parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker.    Again, seeing no objection on either side of the aisle,  Mr. Speaker, can the Chair advise what is required pursuant to section  956 of the House rules to allow my motion to be considered?    So, Mr. Speaker, is there any guidance under section 956  of the House rules to have that motion be in order?    Mr. Speaker, can the ruling of the Chair be challenged?    Mr. Speaker, I ask the Chair to rule on the motion of  unanimous consent.    So, Mr. Speaker, is there a motion that can be made  under the rules that have been cited to allow for the immediate  consideration of H.R. 962?    Mr. Speaker, if this unanimous consent request can't be  entertained, I would urge the Speaker and the majority leader to  schedule the born-alive bill immediately so we can stand up and protect  the sanctity of human life, and I would ask all others to join in in  that request.
