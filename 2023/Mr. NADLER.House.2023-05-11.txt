 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today, the majority has brought forward a cruel,  extreme, and unworkable piece of legislation, which would wreck our  economy, destroy the asylum system, criminalize visa overstays, send  unaccompanied children back to dangerous situations, and jail children  indefinitely.   Once again, my Republican colleagues show us that they are not  interested in finding real solutions to tough issues. This bill  attempts to combine a variety of different bills, each one more cruel  and heartless than the last into one contradictory and overlapping  mess. This bill has no chance of being enacted into law and it is  nothing more than pure political theater.    My Republican colleagues are trying to take us back to the failed,  illegal, and immoral policies of the Trump administration. Former  President Trump's radical, inhumane, and racist immigration actions  weakened the U.S. economy, undermined our moral standing in the world,  and did not make us any safer.   While trampling on some of our most deeply held American values, his  erratic approach also failed to stem the flow of migrants across our  border. Let's be very clear about what this legislation would do. When  taken together, this bill serves as a wholesale ban on asylum. No one  would be able to seek asylum in the United States if they cross between  ports of entry or if they had or could have had even temporary status  in a third country.   Let me give you an example of what this means. If the Russian  dissident Aleksey Navalny, who Putin attempted to poison twice, was  somehow released from his prison in Siberia and took a flight to seek  political asylum in the United States, but the plane touched down for  refueling in Bulgaria, he would have to stay in Bulgaria. He couldn't  come to the United States.   During the Judiciary Committee's markup, Democrats offered a variety  of amendments to exempt the most vulnerable from some of these  draconian requirements. This included those fleeing Communist and  totalitarian regimes and unaccompanied children, but the majority was  not even willing to exempt children under a year old.   The one place where we were able to make some bipartisan headway was  on the issue of E-Verify. E-Verify is an electronic employment  eligibility verification system that began as a voluntary pilot program  and is currently  [[Page H2259]]  used by a small percentage of the Nation's employers.   This bill would make that system mandatory for all employers in the  United States. Without providing other reforms, however, including any  meaningful opportunity for undocumented workers to regularize their  status, this title would damage the U.S. economy, harm American  workers, and result in billions of dollars in lost government revenue.   In particular, mandatory E-Verify would decimate the agriculture  industry, putting U.S. farms out of business, shipping millions of  American jobs overseas, and increasing U.S. reliance on imported food.  Mandatory E-Verify would result in hundreds of thousands of unfilled  farm jobs and would leave unpicked crops rotting in the fields as we  saw in Georgia in 2011 when a mandatory E-Verify law in the State  resulted in over 11,000 farm jobs going unfilled during the peak  harvest season.   Unfortunately, it appears that some of my Republican colleagues with  significant agricultural interest in their districts are now willing to  support this draconian legislation. Despite sincere concerns about how  this provision would affect their constituents, they have caved to  Republican leadership with the mere addition of a sense of Congress.  That is pathetic.   I have only scratched the surface of the many problems contained in  this legislation. I have not even mentioned how this bill strips all  protections from unaccompanied children and requires all families who  come to our borders seeking protection to be detained indefinitely or  the extreme lengths to which it goes to narrow the eligibility grounds  for asylum or how this bill would severely restrict this and any future  administration's ability to parole individuals into the United States,  even going so far as to end the current parole initiatives for  Ukrainians fleeing Russia and for certain military families.   What this means is that no Ukrainians fleeing the war with Russia  would be allowed into this country. It also means that all Ukrainians  here after a certain time would have to return to Ukraine, even if the  war is still going on.   Mr. Speaker, immigration reform is a complicated problem that  requires complicated solutions, and an enforcement-only strategy simply  doesn't work. Democrats have put forward real proposals, and we stand  ready to work with serious Republicans to pass meaningful solutions.   Democrats take this humanitarian crisis seriously. Our proposals  address the root causes of migration, improve border security, and  create additional legal pathways for people to enter the United States  lawfully.                                time  1130    But Republicans have chosen a narrow path that imposes extreme pain  and hardship on the most vulnerable people, while doing nothing to  actually solve the problem.   I encourage my colleagues to oppose this wrongheaded bill, and I ask  the majority to go back to the drawing board.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Escobar).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Ivey).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Garcia).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Correa).  [[Page H2262]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, when I hear the rhetoric on the other side,  it is one of the very few times I say to myself: Thank God for the  existence of the United States Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington  (Ms. Jayapal).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Washington.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).    Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time I have remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Casar).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Chu).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from New York.

Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Arizona.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Garcia).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Frost).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Soto).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, organizations, associations, and industry leaders from  across the political spectrum oppose passage of H.R. 2, the child  deportation act. They include among them the American Immigration  Lawyers Association, Service Employees International Union, AFL-CIO,  U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Kids in Need of Defense, Unidos,  and National Education Association.   This bill is a microcosm of what we have seen in the first 4\1/2\  months of this new Republican majority, a chaotic majority that has no  real interest in legislating or making positive change. Instead, they  pass cruel and unworkable messaging bills that have no chance of  becoming law and are dead in the U.S. Senate, and then they pat  themselves on the back.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this draconian and  unworkable bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   This will be a 5-minute vote.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 219,  nays 213, not voting 3, as follows:                               [Roll No. 209]                                 YEAS--219       Aderholt      Alford      Allen      Amodei      Armstrong      Arrington      Babin      Bacon      Baird      Balderson      Banks      Barr      Bean (FL)      Bentz      Bergman      Bice      Biggs      Bilirakis      Bishop (NC)      Boebert      Bost      Brecheen      Buchanan      Buck      Bucshon      Burchett      Burgess      Burlison      Calvert      Cammack      Carey      Carl      Carter (GA)      Carter (TX)      Chavez-DeRemer      Ciscomani      Cline      Cloud      Clyde      Cole      Collins      Comer      Crane      Crawford      Crenshaw      Curtis      D'Esposito      Davidson      De La Cruz      DesJarlais      Diaz-Balart      Donalds      Duncan      Dunn (FL)      Edwards      Ellzey      Emmer      Estes      Ezell      Fallon      Feenstra      Ferguson      Finstad      Fischbach      Fitzgerald      Fitzpatrick      Fleischmann      Flood      Foxx      Franklin, C.
