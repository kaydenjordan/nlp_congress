 Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve a  coordinated, fully funded response to keep us safe from the  coronavirus. But instead of taking the situation seriously, the  President has mounted a confusing and chaotic response.   He designated Mike Pence to lead the public health response, Mike  Pence, a man whose terrible public health polices as Governor of  Indiana allowed the worst HIV epidemic in the State's history to take  root in 2015.   The President's budget earlier this month slashed almost $700 million  from the CDC. He has left vacant critical positions responsible for  managing pandemics, and now he has proposed raiding funds that were  appropriated by Congress for other life-threatening public health  emergencies.   To be blunt, the President's response has been a disaster.   The American people deserve better, and that is why the House will  advance  [[Page H1233]]  a strong, strategic funding package that fully addresses the scale and  seriousness of this public health crisis.   Let's hope the President follows our lead.                            ____________________
