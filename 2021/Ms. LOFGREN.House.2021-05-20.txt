 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the bill. It  provides funding to respond to the January 6 attack, during which  violent insurrectionists, incited and encouraged by the former  President, attacked this Capitol where we stand today.   Since the attack, the Committee on House Administration, assisted by  General Honore, has reviewed Capitol security and has been examining  the Capitol Police's preparation for and response to the attack.   The supplemental narrowly tailors a response to that attack. It makes  sure that we have the physical improvements we know will need to be  taken, and it supports the Capitol Police with wellness and trauma  support and provides officers with the training and riot control  equipment they should have had on the 6th.   For those who say we should not do anything today, it is a mistake to  say if we can't do everything at the same time, we should do nothing.   This bill is a first step toward having a more secure facility that  lodges the legislative branch of government. There are measures that we  sent to the House Administration Committee for further review. I  welcome that.    Madam Speaker, to fail to act today is really to turn  your backs on the men and women who fought as Capitol Police officers  just yards from where we stand today. They were maimed. Their eyes were  gouged. They lost fingers. Some of them died.   Don't turn your backs on them and vote against this bill.    Madam Speaker, we had a hearing yesterday that went for  more than 3 hours. We are likely to have additional hearings on that  matter. It is not clear at the moment whether the board needs to be  replaced, whether it was failings of the structure, or whether it was  failings of the individuals holding the positions in that structure.   If I may, we will come forward with our best analysis of what changes  should be made in the weeks to come.   Meanwhile, these officers need our support today. We can't hold back  and do nothing.    Madam Speaker, I would take exception to that. The House  Administration Committee has had more oversight and more hearings, both  at a Member level and a staff level, than any other committee in the  House or Senate about the Capitol Police.   We don't have jurisdiction over everything, but we have not been  derelict in our duty. And I take exception on the part of the whole  committee, Republicans and Democrats, and their staff.  [[Page H2626]]         Will the gentlewoman yield?    Madam Speaker, most of what is in this bill doesn't need  a change in the law. You don't need a change in the law to provide  training to the Capitol Police. That is baseline what our obligation  is.   We failed to actually do what we are required to do, and to think  that some further legislative action is needed is simply false.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on House Administration be discharged from further consideration of the  joint resolution (H.J. Res. 27) providing for the appointment of  Barbara Barrett as a citizen regent of the Board of Regents of the  Smithsonian Institution, and ask for its immediate consideration in the  House.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.
