Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of the Pandemic and  All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018, known as  PAHPA. I am proud to have introduced this important bill with Energy  and Commerce Chairman  Greg Walden, Ranking Member Frank Pallone, and  my good friend Representative Eshoo, who is one of the original authors  of the 2006 PAHPA bill and lead author of the last reauthorization in  2013.   This bipartisan public health and national security effort will  ensure our Nation is better prepared to respond to natural disasters  like hurricanes; emerging infectious diseases like Zika and Ebola; and  chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear attacks, whether from  terrorist groups or from nation-states.   Seventeen years ago, Congress was the target of a biological attack  when letters laced with anthrax arrived in Member offices just days or  soon after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. In the aftermath of 9/11, the  Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense was formed. It was led by  bipartisan leaders: former Senator Joe Lieberman, former Governor Tom  Ridge, and many others.   In October 2015, after extensive discussions around the country where  they learned from experts, they created their ``National Blueprint for  Biodefense,'' which provided us with a roadmap in drafting this  important legislation.   I was the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Indiana  during those 2001 anthrax attacks, and my own office dealt with an  anthrax hoax when we received a letter with white powder inside. Of  course, at the time, we didn't know it was a hoax. It was incredibly  stressful for that staff member, who had to worry about their very own  health. But that personal experience illustrated to me the importance  of preparedness and sparked my interest in biodefense.   In the years since then, we know that the threat of a chemical,  biological, radiological, or nuclear incident continues to grow. Every  day, our adversaries are looking for more effective and faster ways to  reduce the threat. It is not really a question of if we face the  threat. It is a question of when.   Thanks to PAHPA and the 21st Century Cures Act, we are more prepared  than ever for biological threats and attacks.   In July of just this last year, the FDA approved the first drug to  treat smallpox. It is called TPOXX. But TPOXX isn't the only recent  approval at the FDA. In July, the FDA also approved an autoinjector  that provides a one-time dose of an antidote to block effects of a  nerve agent. This new antidote and TPOXX will help protect Americans  from biological attacks.   But PAHPA is much more than just a biodefense bill. It also ensures a  coordinated healthcare response, whether to hurricanes or other natural  disasters.   Florence has just hit the East Coast and residents in both North and  South Carolina are still recovering and dealing with ongoing flooding.  During the 2017 hurricane season, whether it was Hurricane Harvey,  Irma, Jose, or Maria, far too many Americans were killed. It showed us  that we need to do better to prioritize the needs of every person in  our communities.   The PAHPA bill we are considering today does just that. It  prioritizes our Nation's most vulnerable populations: our children,  senior citizens, and those with disabilities. It reauthorizes the  advisory committee focused on the specific needs of children and  creates new advisory committees to ensure the needs of the elderly and  those with disabilities are considered.   The bill provides liability protections for healthcare professionals  who volunteer after medical disasters. In addition to these types of  Good Samaritan provisions, the bill ensures more healthcare  professionals like nurses, doctors, and others can be hired and trained  when facing a public health crisis by strengthening our National  Disaster Medical System, which provides grants to our regional  healthcare network.   It also ensures we have a robust supply of vaccines and basic  equipment like gloves, hazmat suits, masks, personal protective gear,  and more in our strategic national stockpiles located all across the  country, so that our healthcare professionals and first responders have  what they need.   PAHPA ensures our preparedness and response capabilities will include  a robust pipeline of medical countermeasures by reauthorizing and  increasing funding for the BioShield Special Reserve Fund and BARDA,  the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.   BARDA's work over the last decade has resulted in FDA approvals for  more than 42 different medical countermeasures. The development of  medical countermeasures is a lengthy and often risky endeavor, which is  why sending a clear signal that BARDA remains a strong and committed  partner with academic institutions and the private sector in these  efforts is so very important.   Last week, we saw even another example of a success of research  funded by BARDA when FDA approved a product called ReCell, the first  spray-on skin product ever approved for use in the United States. This  new treatment will help treat burn victims so they can heal faster and  with less risk of infection from painful skin grafts. By using a piece  of a patient's skin about the size of a credit card, a doctor can turn  it into a single cell-based solution that can be sprayed over the  patient's burns so that new skin can grow and replace the damaged skin.   These types of investments BARDA is making into innovative research  are critical, but it is also important that we continue to address  threats that have been around for years.   It has been 100 years since the 1918 pandemic influenza killed  millions of people around the globe, including 675,000 Americans. Some  experts predict that we are actually due for the potential of another  global pandemic influenza.   To address that threat, the bill we are considering today authorizes  $250 million for the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response,  the ASPR, to address threats like pandemic influenza. Specifically, the  bill directs the ASPR to work to increase manufacturing capacity and  stockpile medical countermeasures.   While the PAHPA bill we are considering today authorizes funding for  research into known threats like pandemic influenza, it also maintains  the flexibility that is the foundation of our medical countermeasure  enterprise to deal with unknown threats for which we may have no  defense today.   Even today, the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues to deal  with an ongoing Ebola outbreak. In order to ensure we are better  prepared when we face an outbreak like Ebola or Zika, the bill we are  considering today does three important things.   First, it improves the existing emergency response fund so that the  Secretary of Health and Human Services does not have to wait on  approval from Congress to immediately fund response measures needed to  contain an outbreak and save lives. This emergency response fund will  create a bridge so that immediate funding is available, so we can then  supplement with an emergency appropriations bill later.   Secondly, the bill requires GAO to conduct a review of the emergency  response fund to help appropriators decide what funding levels and  resources are needed.   The third thing the bill does to help address threats like Ebola and  Zika is to authorize $250 million in funding for an emerging infectious  disease program so that BARDA can invest in new research.   The PAHPA bill reauthorization we are considering is the process of  months of committee work in both the House and the Senate, and I want  to thank all the staff members and all of the organizations, everyone  who has been involved, and all the Members who have participated,  whether it is subcommittee or committee hearings on this bill,  examining our response to threats. I thank everyone involved for their  dedication and commitment to  [[Page H8777]]  making sure we have the procedures, resources, and support in place to  protect our fellow citizens from public health and national security  threats.   I can't emphasize enough how critically important it is to  reauthorize PAHPA. We have a duty as Members of Congress to keep  Americans safe and secure. This bill is an essential component of  accomplishing that goal. I urge all Members to support this critical  bipartisan piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters from many organizations  that support the bill.

AVAC includes more than fifty organizational leaders in       health and public health who are committed to raising       awareness of and engaging in advocacy on the importance of       adult immunization. AVAC priorities and objectives are driven       by a consensus process with the goal of enabling stakeholders       to have a voice in the effort to improve access to and       utilization of adult immunizations.        The bipartisan reauthorization of the PAHPA provides       improvements to key preparedness and response programs,       enhances personnel and hiring authorities, as well as       prioritizes cybersecurity in health care and provides       necessary resources for the development of medical       countermeasures for pandemic influenza and emerging       infectious diseases. We are delighted the Managers' Amendment       included references to immunization programs and immunization       information systems under Section 319D. These additions will       help to strengthen and enhance coordination and integrate       immunization programs and immunization information systems       (IIS) capabilities into public health emergency preparedness,       planning, and response activities.        Immunization Information Systems (IIS), or registries,       confidential, population-based, computerized systems can       record immunization doses administered by participating       providers to persons residing within a given jurisdiction.       They provide state and local public health agencies aggregate       data on immunization coverage rates for disease surveillance       and program operations. IIS' can serve as a vital component       for emergency preparedness and response activities and are an       optimal tool for use during a pandemic or other emerging       infectious disease event by enabling communication with       providers, identifying variations in access and utilization       of immunization, and enabling implementation of targeted       strategies during emergency preparedness and response       activities.        Congratulations on putting together a strong, bipartisan       reauthorization package that reflects many of the important       priorities shared by stakeholders. We look forward to working       with you throughout the process to enact the 2018 Pandemic       and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act.            Sincerely,      Lisa Foster,        AVAC Manager.      Abby Bownas,        AVAC Manager.                                   ____                                           Alliance for Biosecurity,                                        U.S. Chamber of Commerce,                                                      July 27, 2018.        To the Members of the U.S. House of Representatives: On       behalf of the Alliance for Biosecurity and the U.S. Chamber       of Commerce, we support H.R. 6378, the Pandemic and All-      Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018,       and urge the House to pass this bipartisan legislation before       the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA) expires       at the end of September 2018. H.R. 6378 is central to       protecting American citizens, organizations, and communities       against natural and man-made biosecurity hazards.        H.R. 6378 would authorize crucial funding for the Project       BioShield Special Reserve Fund and Biomedical Advanced       Research and Development Authority (BARDA). However, we urge       policymakers to account for inflation to ensure that future       spending levels adequately support the Public Health       Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE)       Strategy and implementation Plan, the BARDA Strategic Plan,       and related efforts.        H.R. 6378 would establish several important programs within       BARDA, especially a Pandemic Influenza Program to support       research and development activities to enhance responses to       pandemic influenza and an Emerging Infectious Disease Program       to monitor and address infectious diseases that could cause a       deadly pandemic. Both programs would be funded at $250       million per year through FY 2023.        The bill would also create new and sustainable market-based       incentives to advance cutting-edge biomedical research. Our       groups support developing strategic partnerships between       BARDA and the business community to mitigate threats that       could pose a significant risk to U.S. health and safety.        Reauthorizing PAHPA would also help ensure the       sustainability of the medical countermeasures enterprise by       transferring the authority that governs the procurement of       medical countermeasures from the Centers for Disease Control       and Prevention (CDC) to the Office of the Assistant Secretary       for Preparedness and Response (ASPR).        The legislation would codify ASPR's role in coordinating       Strategic National Stockpile operations with CDC. We also       believe that such teamwork would make the U.S. better       equipped to tackle public health emergencies and natural       disasters.        We urge the full House to swiftly consider and pass H.R.       6378.            Sincerely,      The Honorable Jack Kingston,        Secretariat, Alliance for Biosecurity.      Neil L. Bradley,        Executive Vice President and Chief Policy Officer, U.S.       Chamber of Commerce.                                   ____                                                Allied BioScience,                                           Plano, TX, July 23, 2018.      Hon. Susan Brooks,      Member of Congress,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Brooks: I write to thank you for a       provision in your recently introduced legislation, H.R. 6378,       the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing       Innovation Act of 2018. This provision updates the       authorization for the Biomedical Advanced Research and       Development Authority (BARDA) to include the mitigation of       infectious disease. This provision will make our nation       safer.        Allied BioScience (ABS) has engaged BARDA with ideas for       collaboration that have the potential to enhance the       biological safety of our nation by combating antimicrobial       resistance through environmental intervention. Under the       existing authorization, BARDA is limited to developing       pharmacological interventions. This limitation precludes       collaboration at this time. Your legislation amends the       definition of ``qualified pandemic or epidemic products'' to       include ``a product manufactured, used, designed, developed,       modified, licensed, or procured to diagnose, mitigate,       prevent, treat, or cure an infectious disease (as defined in       section 319F-1(a)(2))''. This change would create a path       forward to collaborate to develop novel solutions to       antimicrobial resistance that will provide a safer nation.        ABS has developed a semi-permanent antimicrobial coating       that creates a long-lasting barrier to microbial growth. In       clinical trials, ABS's coating, when applied in an ICU       setting has shown to reduce the presence of Multi-Drug       Resistant Organisms (MDROs) by up to 70% with an efficacy of       at least four months per application. Comparable reductions       in Hospital Acquired Infections have seen a corresponding       reduction. Reduction in rates of infection decreased the need       to treats MDRO's and breaks the cycle of mutation that       creates increasingly potent ``superbugs''. Our research       demonstrates that environmental mitigation is a key component       to addressing antimicrobial resistance.        Thank you again for your efforts to modernize BARDA to       provide the flexibility needed to combat ever-evolving       threats. We enthusiastically support H.R. 6379, and look       forward to its swift passage and enactment into law. If you       have any questions about ABS I would be happy to talk further       with you at your convenience.            Sincerely,                                                        Mike Ruley,      CEO.                                   ____           American Association of Blood Banks, America's Blood             Centers, American Red Cross,                                                     July 25, 2018.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, House Energy and Commerce Committee, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Susan Brooks,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Ranking Member, House Energy and Commerce Committee,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Anna Eshoo,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Walden, Ranking Member Pallone, and       Representatives Brooks and Eshoo: AABB (formerly known as the       American Association of Blood Banks), America's Blood Centers       and the American Red Cross commend the House Energy and       Commerce Committee's commitment to improving the nation's       preparedness and response capabilities through the       reauthorization of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness       Advancing Innovation Act (PAHPAIA) of 2018 (H.R. 6378).       Collectively, our organizations represent the nation's blood       collection establishments, transfusion services, and       transfusion medicine professionals.        We would like to especially highlight two sections of the       bill important to us and our collective members:        Section 116 is a significant step in examining the unique,       and often overlooked, role of the nation's blood supply in       emergency  [[Page H8778]]       preparedness and response systems and the specific challenges       associated with donor recruitment, implementation of safety       mandates and innovation, and adequacy in the face of public       health emergencies. We believe that policies that support the       availability of a safe and adequate blood supply are needed.       The report required by this section is critical to evaluating       possible solutions.        We strongly support the Committee's specific recognition of       the blood supply in Section 207, which requires the Assistant       Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) to develop       guidelines for regional health care emergency and response       systems. We support the provision that requires the ASPR to       consult with blood banks and other key stakeholders when       developing and updating guidelines. Including blood centers       in this process is paramount and consistent with the       Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) recognition of       blood as one of the core functional areas in Emergency       Support Function #8 of the National Response Framework. We       also commend the Committee for recognizing potential       financial implications for blood centers to implement and       follow the guidelines. Given that blood is an essential part       of the nation's trauma system, emergency preparedness and       response system and healthcare system generally, it is       essential that financial barriers not impede the availability       of safe blood ahead of and during response activities.        AABB, America's Blood Centers and the American Red Cross       welcome the opportunity to work with the Committee to ensure       that these important provisions promoting the safety and       availability of the U.S. blood supply remain during       conference negotiations with the Senate.      Mary Beth Bassett,        President, AABB.      Kate Fry,        Chief Executive Officer, America's Blood Centers.      James C. Hrouda,        President, Biomedical Services, American Red Cross.                                   ____                                                 American College of                                            Emergency Physicians,                                                      July 18, 2018.      Hon. Susan Brooks,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Anna Eshoo,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representatives Brooks, Eshoo, Walden, and Pallone: On       behalf of the American College of Emergency Physicians       (ACEP), our 38,000 members, and the more than 140 million       patients we treat each year, I am writing to express ACEP's       support for H.R. 6378, the ``Pandemic and All-Hazards       Preparedness and Advancing Innovation (PAHPAI) Act of 2018.''        In particular, ACEP appreciates your legislation's focus on       improving regionalized emergency preparedness and response       systems, inclusion of the MISSION ZERO Act's provisions to       facilitate the use of military trauma teams in civilian       trauma centers, and the addition of Good Samaritan liability       protections for health care professionals who volunteer       during federally-declared disasters.        Regionalized systems for emergency care response are vital       to ensuring patients are transported and treated in the most       appropriate setting. While it is important to maximize our       resources and capabilities on a daily basis, it becomes       imperative when health care providers respond to a natural or       man-made disaster. We would like to thank you for emphasizing       the establishment and enhancement of these systems,       especially the demonstration program designed to improve       medical surge capacity, build and integrate regional medical       response capabilities, improve specialty care expertise for       all-hazards response, and coordinate medical preparedness and       response across states, territories, and regional       jurisdictions.        ACEP is very supportive of the trauma system improvements       included in H.R. 6378, specifically the grants for military-      civilian partnerships in trauma care as established in the       MISSION ZERO Act (H.R. 880). ACEP believes this policy serves       three purposes. First, it makes additional trauma care       personnel available to treat severely injured civilian       patients. Second, it allows military trauma teams to maintain       their skills in between rotations to conflict areas. Third,       it allows trauma team members to train together so that when       they are deployed, everyone performs his/her duties in a       coordinated manner with the other members, thereby improving       care to injured military personnel.        The Good Samaritan liability protections established in       this legislation will help encourage availability of health       care professionals during times of disaster, which can be       crucial to supplementing the efforts of emergency physicians       and the Disaster Medical Assistance Teams (DMATs) on-site.       ACEP believes volunteers responding to a disaster, whether       declared by the President of the United States or the       Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services       (HHS), should be protected from liability while they are       providing care within the scope of their expertise and are       acting in good faith. We appreciate your efforts to include       this essential provision in H.R. 6378.        Other aspects of the legislation that are important to       emergency physicians and will help ensure the nation is       prepared to contend with all disasters and unexpected       emergencies include your provisions to improve the National       Disaster Medical System (NDMS); expand public health       surveillance; study DMAT readiness capabilities; improve the       Public Health Emergency Fund (PHEF); strengthen the       Healthcare Preparedness and Response Program (HPRP), formerly       the Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP); extend authorization       for the Emergency System for Advanced Registration of       Volunteer Health Professionals (ESAR-VHP); and study hospital       preparedness capabilities. ACEP would also like to commend       you on your oversight of the Assistant Secretary for       Preparedness and Response's (ASPR) efforts to reunify       children who were separated from their parent or guardian       (due to the ``zero tolerance'' policy) and placed into the       custody of HHS.        Finally, we would once again urge the Committee and the       Congress to ensure sufficient funding is provided for the       PHEF, HPRP, NDMS, and Medical Reserve Corps (MRC) to ensure       their effectiveness and we encourage you to seek a       sufficient, guaranteed federal funding stream. Without a       dedicated and appropriate amount of federal resources for       these critical programs, we are greatly concerned that the       nation as a whole, and emergency medical providers       specifically, will not have the infrastructure, personnel, or       tools necessary to provide optimal care during a natural or       man-made disaster or infectious disease outbreak.            Sincerely,                                    Paul D. Kivela, MD, MBA, FACEP,      ACEP President.                                   ____                                     American College of Surgeons,                                                      July 20, 2018.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington,           DC.        Dear Chairman Walden and Ranking Member Pallone: On behalf       of the more than 80,000 members of the American College of       Surgeons (ACS), we would like to express our support for the       Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness and Advancing       Innovation Act of 2018 (PAHPAI), H.R. 6378. We appreciate the       work the Energy and Commerce Committee has accomplished to       incorporate important improvements to trauma care and begin       the process for establishing the framework for a trauma       system that can fully meet the needs of any disaster and       provide the highest-quality health care.        ACS is particularly appreciative of the inclusion of the       Mission Zero Act, H.R. 880 in the PAHPAI. Establishing and       maintaining high-quality and adequately-funded trauma systems       throughout the United States, including within the Armed       Forces, is a priority of the ACS and our Committee on Trauma       (COT). The Mission Zero Act authorizes $15 million in grant       funding to assist civilian trauma centers in partnering with       military trauma professionals and creates a pathway to       provide patients with excellent trauma care in times of peace       and conflict. In addition, this legislation requires       utilization of trauma data reporting as a requirement for the       grant program. The measuring and recording of data is a       cornerstone of advancing not only trauma care, but health       care as a whole. Overall, the Mission Zero Act is a critical       step toward achieving the goal of zero preventable injury       deaths after injury.        Inclusion of the Good Samaritan Health Professionals Act,       H.R. 1876, which is legislation that would reduce barriers       for health care providers looking to volunteer during a       federally-declared disaster, is a welcome addition to PAHPAI.       This section in PAHPAI will help to greatly decrease loss of       life as well as improve outcomes during federally declared       public health emergencies.        We also applaud the Committee for highlighting the critical       issue of improving our trauma care system by including       language creating a demonstration project promoting a       regionalized approach to disaster response. Trauma systems       have been organized across the country to manage the time-      sensitive crises of acutely injured patients in an efficient       manner on a daily basis. Trauma systems span the continuum of       care including prior to the point of injury and through       rehabilitation. As a result, these systems engage in numerous       activities aimed at improving care and outcomes, including       bystander training, emergency medical services (EMS) training       and coordination, hospital preparedness, injury prevention       efforts, and continuous quality improvement. All of these       activities will assist with responding to public health       emergencies such as biological, radiological, nuclear events,       and other mass casualty incidents.        The ACS believes the PAHPAI represents significant progress       in the process of ensuring that trauma systems, centers, and       health care providers are able to meet the needs of all       Americans. We thank you for your leadership on this       significant legislation and stand ready to work with you       toward final passage in the House.            Sincerely,                                        David B. Hoyt, MD, FACS,                                Executive Director, American College                                                       of Surgeons.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess), the subcommittee chair for the  Subcommittee on Health.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), who also serves on the  Subcommittee on Health.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to particularly thank Dr. Burgess and the  ranking member of the Subcommittee on Health, Gene Green, for their  leadership in working with so many of us who have brought this  legislation to the floor at this time.   It is really so very critical that all relevant Federal agencies,  particularly the leadership of CDC and the ASPR, work together with our  local and State partners that are truly on the ground; and I certainly  urge my colleagues to  [[Page H8781]]  pass this important piece of legislation not only to ensure that public  health is of paramount importance in this country, but, also, because  this is an incredibly important piece of national security legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I include the following letters  in the Record.                                                     Health Industry                                        Distributors Association,                                                      July 17, 2018.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, House Energy and Commerce Committee, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Susan Brooks,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Ranking Member, House Energy and Commerce Committee, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Anna Eshoo,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Walden, Ranking Member Pallone, Congresswoman       Brooks and Congresswoman Eshoo: On behalf of the Health       Industry Distributors Association (HIDA), we appreciate the       opportunity to express our support for H.R. 6378, the       Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing       Innovation Act of 2018 (PAHPAI). HIDA commends you for your       leadership on this issue and appreciates the active       engagement of your staff with industry to incorporate lessons       learned from recent events such as Ebola and the 2017       hurricane season, in H.R. 6378, to continually improve our       nation's preparedness capabilities.        HIDA is the trade association representing medical products       distributors, all of which deliver medical products and       supplies, manage logistics, and offer customer services to       more than 294,000 points of care. HIDA members primarily       distribute items used in every day medical services and       procedures, ranging from gauze and gloves to diagnostic       laboratory tests. Their customers include over 210,000       physician offices, 6,500 hospitals, and 44,000 nursing home       and extended care facilities throughout the country, as well       as numerous federal agencies and their healthcare facilities.        As you know, the medical supply chain plays a critical role       in preparedness, as it supplies key infection prevention       products and protective equipment such as respirators, face       shields, hoods, impermeable gowns and gloves to first       responders and health care providers. Additionally, the       medical supply chain is the primary source for the diagnostic       and point-of-care rapid tests needed to identify infectious       disease, as well as the ancillary products such as gloves,       needles and syringes needed to deliver medical       countermeasures effectively.        HIDA and its members have collaborated with federal       agencies on identifying opportunities to improve coordination       and develop solutions that create more elasticity in the       supply chain for key products. One of the many lessons       learned during the 2017 hurricane season was a considerable       need to improve coordination during an emergency response,       ensuring appropriate infrastructure partners are included in       a prioritization process for access to affected areas after       an event. We appreciate the Committees' acknowledgement of       the importance of this issue in the legislation, as well as       the recognition of the healthcare supply chain in H.R. 6378.       Specifically, we support the following:        Section 101 provisions important to the healthcare supply       chain including        The value of public and private sector coordination during       an event to ensure critical supplies are delivered and       information is shared.        The requirement that ancillary products needed to deliver a       medical countermeasure are incorporated into the Public       Health Emergency Medical Countermeasure Enterprise planning       process.        Section 319C-3 provisions that create a regional healthcare       system plan and that it be communicated to supply chain       partners so needed product can be redirected during a       response.        HIDA thanks you for your continued commitment to       preparedness and look forward to working with you on H.R.       6378.            Sincerely,                                            Linda Rouse O'Neill,                                 Vice President, Government Affairs,                          Health Industry Distributors Association.

Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, Energy & Commerce Committee, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Ranking Member, Energy & Commerce Committee, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Susan Brooks,      Energy & Commerce Committee,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Anna Eshoo,      Energy & Commerce Committee,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Walden, Ranking Member Pallone,       Representative Brooks and Representative Eshoo: Thank you for       your leadership in introducing H.R. 6378, the Pandemic and       All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018       (PAHPAI) that both reauthorizes and strengthens the Pandemic       All-Hazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA). IDSA represents over       11,000 infectious diseases physicians and scientists. Many of       our members work on the frontlines of public health       emergencies, including bioterror attacks, outbreaks, and       natural disasters (e.g., hurricanes that carry significant       infectious diseases risks).        The programs and authorities contained within PAHPA provide       essential resources for communities and health care       facilities to prepare for and respond to public health       threats. Further, PAHPA provides critical support for the       research and development (R&D) of life-saving medical       countermeasures (including vaccines, diagnostics, and       antimicrobial drugs). In particular, IDSA is pleased to offer       our strong support for the provision in H.R. 6378 to       reinstate loan repayment authority for the Centers for       Disease Control and Prevention to improve programs that train       public health responders and future leaders, such as the       Epidemic Intelligence Service. We also support the bill's       attention to antimicrobial resistance. We look forward to       working with the Committee on continued efforts to address       this urgent public health threat.        A successful response to a public health emergency depends       upon skilled personnel. Section 115 of H.R. 6378 will       strengthen the ability of the CDC to recruit physicians to       serve in the Epidemic Intelligence Service--a fellowship       program that trains expert responders to infectious disease       outbreaks and other public health emergencies. We greatly       appreciate your inclusion of this important provision.        IDSA remains deeply concerned about antimicrobial       resistance that threatens our national health security. We       appreciate language in Section 302 authorizing the Biomedical       Advanced Research and Development Authority to undertake       strategic initiatives to address antimicrobial resistance, as       well as Section 406 that codifies the Advisory Council on       Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria. These substantive       efforts will continue to strengthen our national response to       antimicrobial resistance, though we believe additional       efforts will be essential to spur the research, development       and appropriate use of urgently needed new antibiotics.        Once again, IDSA thanks you for your dedication to our       nation's health security. We look forward to continuing to       work with you on these crucial issues.            Sincerely,      Paul G. Auwaerter, MD, MBA, FIDSA,        President, IDSA.                                   ____                                    National Association of County &                                           City Health Officials,                                      Washington, DC, July 18, 2018.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, House Energy & Commerce Committee, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Susan Brooks,      U.S. House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Ranking Member, House Energy & Commerce Committee, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Anna Eshoo,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Walden, Ranking Member Pallone, and       Representatives Brooks and Eshoo: On behalf of the National       Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO), I       am writing in support of the ``Pandemic and All-Hazards       Preparedness Advancing Innovation Act (PAHPAIA) of 2018''       (H.R. 6378). NACCHO is the voice of the nearly 3,000 local       health departments across the country that prepare       communities for disasters, respond if emergencies occur, and       lend support throughout the recovery process. PAHPAIA will       provide needed stability for the nation's emergency       preparedness and response enterprise. We thank you for your       leadership on this legislation that is essential to       protecting our nation and look forward to working with you to       strengthen the legislation as it moves forward.        Among the many provisions in the bill, NACCHO highlights       the following:                                PHEP, HPP, MRC         The programs reauthorized in PAHPAIA are vital to local       health departments. The Public Health Emergency Preparedness       (PHEP) program and Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP),       reauthorized in PAHPAIA, are complementary programs with       different purposes. PHEP supports local health departments'       response to public health threats and helps to build       resilient communities. HPP enables health care systems to       save lives during emergencies that exceed day-to-day capacity       of health and emergency response systems. In addition, the       Medical Reserve Corps (MRC) program provides additional       public health personnel to respond to emergency needs as well       as everyday health threats.        The PHEP, HPP and MRC programs deserve a level of funding       that is consistent with the threats that are experienced on       the ground level in cities and counties across the nation. In       2017, Congress spent a record breaking $80 billion to provide       relief from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, and       devastating wildfires in California. Without the support of       PHEP, HPP and MRC, the cost could have been much higher. A       comprehensive, cost saving and proactive public health       approach to disaster preparedness helps communities to       effectively mitigate the damage and costs of disasters and       help recover in the aftermath. Sustained funding to support       local preparedness and response capacity helps local health       departments build and convene diverse partners such as       police, fire, transportation, planning departments, and       community based organizations and develop and implement       evidence-based, community-centered strategies.                           Medical Countermeasures         NACCHO supports the codification of the Public Health       Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE). The       PHEMCE Strategy and Implementation should require that state       and local health departments be involved in all phases of the       medical countermeasures (MCM) enterprise including in initial       investment; research and development of vaccines, medicines,       diagnostics and equipment for responding to emerging public       health threats; and distribution and dispensing of       countermeasures. NACCHO urges that state and local public       health departments have a permanent place in the PHEMCE       membership to ensure that all decisions that will affect       state and local health functions are vetted by public health       authorities.        Current funding, support, and expertise provided to state       and local health departments for the Strategic National       Stockpile must be maintained regardless of the infrastructure       or location of the SNS--it is too vital to this country's       ability to respond in the midst of a variety of large-scale       emergencies.                         Public Health Emergency Fund         NACCHO appreciates that the bill strengthens existing       authorities for the Public Health Emergency Fund (PHEF). A       standing rapid response fund to provide bridge funding       between base preparedness funding and supplemental       appropriations for acute emergencies and emerging threats is       absolutely necessary.        NACCHO also appreciates the inclusion of provisions to       maintain the pipeline of workers in the Epidemic Intelligence       Service and to improve preparedness for children, seniors and       people with disabilities. NACCHO appreciates the Committee's       acknowledgement that pandemic influenza, antimicrobial       resistance and other emerging infectious diseases are under       the umbrella of the Biomedical Advanced Research and       Development Authority's (BARDA) mission. Recent years have       demonstrated that infectious diseases represent as       significant a threat to our national security as a natural       disaster or terror attack.        Thank you for your work to strengthen and enhance our       nation's preparedness and response system. We look forward to       continuing to work with you as this legislation moves       forward.            Sincerely,                                         Lori Tremmel Freeman, MBA,      Chief Executive Officer.                                   ____                                                 The Partnership for                                   Inclusive Disaster Strategies,                                      Charleston, SC, July 18, 2018.      Letter of Support for H.R. 6378--Pandemic and All-Hazards           Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018.         Dear Representative Eshoo and Representative Brooks: The       Partnership for Inclusive Disaster Strategies (the       Partnership) is the nation's only coalition of national,       state and local stakeholder organizations working together to       advocate for equal access to emergency and disaster services       and programs for children and adults with disabilities       before, during and after disasters. The footprint of our       membership reaches every congressional district in the       country, with a presence in virtually every community.        The Partnership drives disability community leadership,       training, technical assistance, policy and operational       initiatives that improve outcomes for disaster impacted       communities through self-determination, health, safety,       independence, empowerment, integration and inclusion of       children and adults with disabilities in all aspects of       community preparedness, response and disaster resilience.        Our leaders include the nation's leading experts on       disability inclusive emergency management. We have maintained       a daily presence in support of disaster response, recovery       and mitigation initiatives in TX, FL. USVI and PR since       hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria made landfall in 2017, and       our current focus includes the impact on individuals  [[Page H8783]]       with disabilities and disaster impacted communities from the       wild fires in CA and the lava flows in Hawaii.        Despite thousands of disaster related deaths and the       disproportionate impact of the disasters on countless people       with ``chronic health conditions'' (also clearly defined as       disabilities under the ADA legal definition) in 2017 & 2018,       the recently released FEMA After Action Report only mentions       disability in a footnote and a list of acronyms defining the       position of Disability Integration Advisors, never in any       other context.        Further, according to FEMA, ``the hurricanes and wildfires       collectively affected more than 47 million people--nearly 15       percent of the Nation's population''. Given these statistics,       it is likely that close to 10 million of these disaster       impacted individuals should have been provided with the civil       rights protections of equal access to emergency services and       programs. It is unfortunate that there is no indication of       any focus in the document on FEMA's obligations, efforts or       recommendations.        Clearly there is an urgent need for advice and consultation       from disability inclusive emergency management experts to       improve outcomes for disaster impacted children and adults       with disabilities and their communities.        We are writing in support of H.R. 6378-Pandemic and All-      Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018,       with specific support for Section 110, the establishment of a       NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES       IN ALL-HAZARDS EMERGENCIES.        The Advisory Committee will:        1. provide advice and consultation with respect to       activities carried out pursuant to section 2814, as       applicable and appropriate;        2. evaluate and provide input with respect to the public       health, accessibility, and medical needs of individuals with       disabilities as they relate to preparation for, response to,       and recovery from all-hazards emergencies; and        3. provide advice and consultation with respect to State       emergency preparedness and response activities, including       related drills and exercises pursuant to the preparedness       goals under section 2802(b).        We are especially interested in the Committee report which       will include recommendations that offer specific improvements       that could be made across local, State, tribal, territorial,       and Federal efforts to improve outcomes in areas that       include--        ``(A) preparedness;        ``(B) planning;        ``(C) exercises and drills;        ``(D) alerts, warning, and notifications;        ``(E) evacuation;        ``(F) sheltering;        ``(G) health maintenance;        ``(H) accessing emergency programs and services;        ``(I) medical care (including mental health care);        ``(J) temporary housing;        ``(K) mitigation; and        ``(L) community resilience; and        ``(2) assess the strength of existing policies to       incorporate such individuals as well as the efficacy of       implementation.        We offer our enthusiastic support for the membership of       this Committee, which will include        at least four representatives who are individuals with       disabilities that have substantive expertise in disability       inclusive emergency management policy and operations;        at least two non-Federal health care professionals with       expertise in disability accessibility before, during, and       after disasters, medical and mass care disaster planning,       preparedness, response, or recovery; and        at least two representatives from State, local,       territorial, or tribal agencies with expertise in disability-      inclusive disaster planning, preparedness, response, or       recovery.        The Partnership applauds your leadership and welcomes every       opportunity to work with you, and your colleagues to ensure       that establishment of this vital Advisory Committee is       included in final passage of the Pandemic and All-Hazards       Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018.            Sincerely,                                                       Marcie Roth,      Chief Executive Officer.                                   ____                                            PEW Charitable Trusts,                                      Washington, DC, July 17, 2018.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, House Energy and Commerce Committee, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Ranking Member, House Energy and Commerce Committee,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Susan W. Brooks,      House Energy and Commerce Committee, Washington, DC.      Hon. Anna G. Eshoo,      House Energy and Commerce Committee, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Walden, Ranking Member Pallone, Congresswoman       Brooks and Congresswoman Eshoo: The Pew Charitable Trusts       thanks you for your continued efforts to respond to the       ongoing threat of antibiotic resistance through the       introduction of H.R. 6378, the Pandemic and All-Hazards       Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018 (PAHPA).       This important legislation reauthorizes the essential work of       the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness       and Response (ASPR)'s Biomedical Advanced Research and       Development Authority (BARDA) to address public health       emergencies and bring desperately-needed antibiotics to       patients. Effective antibacterials are central to the       nation's ability to respond to public health threats,       including chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear       attacks (CBRN), pandemic influenza, and emerging infectious       disease--antibiotics are an integral part of the nation's       armament to address these threats.        We especially want to thank the Members of the House Energy       and Commerce Committee for including language related to       antibiotic resistance in Section 302 of PAHPA. This language       will ensure that BARDA is explicitly authorized to address       all CBRN threats--both intentional and naturally occurring--      through robust support of innovative approaches in both       preclinical and clinical development. BARDA's unique       experience working with industry to drive innovation is       particularly important to advance novel therapeutics and       preventive interventions and to help bridge the gap between       basic science and successful clinical drug development.        BARDA safeguards our nation's health infrastructure by       revitalizing and encouraging antibacterial innovation to       ensure that we have a healthy pool of candidate products to       address emerging threats. The CARB-X accelerator addresses       critical gaps along the early stages of the antibacterial       pipeline, and BARDA's Broad Spectrum Antimicrobials program       advances therapeutics into late stage clinical development.       The two programs work in tandem to support a robust pipeline       of novel approaches for highly resistant infections and       emerging threat pathogens.        Thank you for continued support of this important work.            Sincerely,                                                  Kathy Talkington,      Antibiotic Resistance Project Director.                                   ____                                             American Association of                                          Poison Control Centers,                                      Alexandria, VA, July 20, 2018.      Hon. Susan Brooks,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Anna Eshoo,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congresswomen Brooks and Eshoo: The American       Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) would like to       extend our support for H.R. 6378, the Pandemic and All-      Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018.        As you already know, AAPCC supports the nation's 55 poison       control centers in their efforts to prevent and treat poison       exposures. Poison control centers across the U.S. receive       approximately 3 million calls annually that cover a variety       of substances, including prescription and over-the-counter       medications, illegal drugs, household products, pesticides,       cosmetics, environmental toxins, food, plants, and animal       bites and stings. These calls come from a wide variety of       individuals, including the public, health care providers, 911       PSAPs (Public Safety Answering Points), schools, health       departments, law enforcement, and other safety agencies. The       centers operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a       year and are accessed through a federally funded nationwide       toll free number: 800-222-1222 (Poison Help).        When someone calls 800-222-1222, the calls are answered by       highly trained Specialists in Poison Information (pharmacists       and nurses), who diagnose, triage, and offer treatment       recommendations to callers with 24-hour oversight from Board       Certified Medical and Clinical Toxicologists. We answer calls       from every state and territory in our nation. We know that       you and your staff are already familiar with the wonderful       work of the Indiana Poison Center and the California Poison       Control System.        There are three references, all in Title II, to poison       centers in Public Law 113-5 (the Pandemic and All-Hazards       Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013). These provisions       allow states and public health departments to work directly       with their regional poison center and have resulted in       improved preparedness preparations in multiple communities       throughout the nation. Thank you for keeping these poison       center references in H.R. 6378.        We also deeply appreciate your inclusion of poison centers       in Section 207, Regional Health Care Emergency Preparedness       and Response Systems. Poison centers have a unique set of       knowledge and are the primary source for poisoning       information. Our employees are trained to handle stressful,       potentially life altering situations on a daily basis and we       already have the infrastructure in place as a 24/7 365 days a       year call center. We are a vital resource on a number of       topics from chemical spills to mass exposure to an unknown       toxin to a public health emergency including the pandemic flu       or Ebola and Zika. The poison control system is a well-      established, nationwide network made up of sophisticated and       specially trained medical professionals who handle calls       related to over 420,000 products and substances and their       related toxicities.        Our poison centers support your efforts and look forward to       our work together on this important topic. Finally, a special       thank you to your staff, Catherine Knowles and Rachel Fybel       for all of their assistance. Thank you, as always, for your       continued support of our 55 poison centers.        Warmest regards,      William Banner, Jr., MD, PhD,        President, AAPCC, Oklahoma Center for Poison & Drug       Information.

Mr. Speaker, I include the following letters  in the Record.                                                   American Society                                                for Microbiology,                                      Washington, DC, July 23, 2018.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, Energy and Commerce Committee, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Susan Brooks,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Ranking Member, Energy and Commerce Committee, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Anna Eshoo,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan, Minority Leader Pelosi, Chairman Walden,       Ranking Member Pallone, Representative Brooks and       Representative Eshoo: The American Society for Microbiology       (ASM) congratulates the Energy and Commerce Committee on its       passage of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and       Advancing Innovation Act of 2018 (H.R. 6378) and encourages       its swift passage in the House.        ASM is the largest single life science society, composed of       more than 32,000 scientists and health professionals. Our       mission is to promote and advance the microbial sciences,       including programs and initiatives funded by the federal       government departments and agencies, by virtue of the       pervasive role of microorganisms in health and society.        Antimicrobial resistance is among the most consequential       issues facing world today. ASM is therefore pleased that H.R.       6378 includes Section 406, a provision that would guarantee       the continued work of the Presidential Advisory Council on       Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria (PACCARB) by       codifying the Advisory Council. A guarantee of PACCARB's       continuance also sustains the One Health partnerships--the       integration of human, animal, and environmental domains--that       have been formed since the establishment of PACCARB.        This year marks the 100th anniversary of the Influenza       Pandemic of 1918, which killed almost 40 million people, and       serves a reminder that the United States must be prepared to       rapidly respond to declared and potential public health       emergencies, including infectious disease epidemics.        ASM strongly supports the legislation's reauthorization of       the Biomedical Advanced Research Development Authority       (BARDA) and is pleased to see inclusion and authorization of       a Pandemic Influenza Program and Emerging Infectious Disease       Program. Authorization of funding for the Strategic National       Stockpile and the Bioshield Special Reserve Fund are all       critically important to our public health security.       Therefore, it is important that reauthorization be met with a       corresponding commitment of federal resources.        Lastly, ASM appreciates that the legislation points to the       need for an adequately funded Public Health Emergency Fund       (PHEF) and strengthens existing authorities for which PHEF       dollars may be used, including in anticipation of a potential       public health emergency. Vigilance will be required to make       sure our country is adequately prepared to make financial       resources available in a timely manner to potential or       immediate public health emergencies, and so we look forward       to your continued leadership in this regard.        ASM believes that H.R. 6378 will further our nation's       preparedness to respond in a timely and coordinated manner to       declared and potential public health threats. Toward this       end, ASM strongly supports swift final passage by the Senate       and House. We appreciate your championship of these issues       and stands ready to work with you towards this goal. Should       you have any questions, please contact Allen Segal, Director,       ASM Public Policy and Advocacy.            Sincerely,      Stefano Bertuzzi, Ph.D., MPH,        CEO, American Society for Microbiology.      Allen D. Segal,        Director, Public Policy and Advocacy, American Society for       Microbiology.                                   ____                                        ASTHO, September 23, 2018.       Hon. Lamar Alexander,      Chairman, Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee,           U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Gregg Walden,      Chairman, Energy & Commerce Committee, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Patty Murray,      Ranking Member, Health, Education, Labor and Pensions           Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Frank Pallone, Jr,      Ranking Member, Energy & Commerce Committee, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Alexander, Ranking Member Murray, Chairman       Walden, and Ranking Member Pallone: The Association of State       and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO) submits this letter       in support of most of the public health provisions included       in the ``Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing       Innovation Act of 2018'' (H.R. 6378). ASTHO is the national       nonprofit organization representing the state and territorial       public health agencies of the United States, U.S.       territories, and Washington, D.C. ASTHO's members, the chief       health officials of these jurisdictions, are dedicated to       formulating and influencing sound public health policy and       assuring excellence in public health practice.        ASTHO is pleased that this bill retains elements proven to       be necessary, reasonable, and successful, while making       further refinements to the underlying statute, as well as       responding to and including many of ASTHO's priorities. These       priorities, outlined in previously submitted comment letters,       include suggestions for clarifications and acknowledgments       regarding the importance of state, local, territorial, and       tribal public health. These provisions include:        Reauthorizing the Public Health Emergency Preparedness       Program (PHEP) and Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP). PHEP       and HPP are key to the foundational capabilities of public       health preparedness and healthcare        Codifying the role of CDC to administer the PHEP program        Bolstering the Public Health Emergency Rapid Response Fund       and mechanisms to quickly distribute funds        Requiring that the Public Health Emergency Medical       Countermeasure Enterprise (PHEMCE) solicit and consider input       from state, local, tribal, and territorial public health       departments or officials        Improving the nation's ability to take a ``OneHealth''       approach to preparedness and response capabilities        Reauthorizing the temporary reassignment of state and local       personnel during public health emergencies        Requiring the HHS secretary, in collaboration with ASPR and       CDC, to maintain the strategic national stockpile        Including a provision to strengthen the Epidemic       Intelligence Service by increasing the loan repayment amount       from $35,000 to $50,000        In addition, ASTHO expresses our concern and seeks       clarification from the committee on changes to HPP,       particularly those that alter eligibility requirements for       funding from a ``partnership'' to``coalitions.'' One of the       most crucial functions of HPP is to bring together and       incentivize ``diverse and often competitive healthcare       organizations to work together.'' As neutral conveners, state       and territorial public health departments are the most       appropriate entities and stewards of taxpayer dollars. They       are also responsible for statewide planning and coordination       of services and fundamentally serve all residents in their       jurisdictions--not just lives covered under a plan or       specific catchment area. With the establishment of hundreds       of Healthcare Coalitions across the country, ASTHO seeks       assurance that the letter, spirit, and intent of this       modification does not in any way change the current       cooperative agreement structure and stature, nor does it       alter the role and responsibilities of states, territories,       and directly-funded cities as awardees of funds under HPP.        ASTHO also remains concerned that authorization levels--      $685 million for PHEP and $385 million for HPP--are       significantly lower than our suggested authorization levels       of $824 million for PHEP and $474 million for HPP. ASTHO is       concerned that authorizing at these proposed levels will be       insufficient. Both PHEP and HPP must be resourced at       sufficient levels to ensure that every community is prepared       for disasters. An efficient and effective state and local       workforce depends heavily on reliable, ongoing funding       support for a network of state and local expertise,       relationships and trust that is carefully built over time       through shared responses, training, and exercises.        Regarding sections that speak to ``reservations of amounts       for regional systems,'' ASTHO would also like to reiterate       that HPP is already funded at a vastly insufficient level       given the task of preparing the healthcare system for a surge       of patients, continuity of operations, and recovery. Any       funding reductions to HPP through a tap will have an adverse       impact on real-time all-hazards preparedness and response       activities carried out by the existing healthcare coalitions.       The costs associated with exploring the development of a       regional system or network should not be at the expense of       current critical medical readiness and patient care services.        Finally, while we appreciate that the bill strengthens       existing authorities for the Public Health Emergency Fund, we       continue to urge Congress to create a mechanism to fund and       replenish it. Without sufficient and dedicated funding, it       will be impossible to quickly access funds when needed.        ASTHO appreciates the opportunity to provide our comments       on this critical legislation and the bipartisan efforts of       both the House and Senate committees.            Sincerely,      John Wiesman, DrPH, MPH,        ASTHO President, Secretary of Health, Washington State       Department of Health Olympia, WA.

Hon. Susan Brooks,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Anna Eshoo,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representatives Brooks and Eshoo: On behalf of the       Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO), I am writing to       express our strong support for final passage of H.R. 6378,       the ``Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing       Innovation Act of 2018''. I wish to commend you for your       extraordinary work getting this legislation to the House       floor.        BIO represents more than 1,000 biotechnology companies,       academic institutions, state biotechnology centers and       related organizations across the United States and in more       than 30 other nations. BIO's members are committed to       investing in, developing, and delivering innovative vaccines,       therapeutics, and diagnostic tools that are transforming how       we protect, treat and cure people from devastating infectious       diseases. Many of BIO's members are active partners with the       U.S. government to strengthen our national health security       through the development and stockpile of medical       countermeasures (MCM) against the myriad threats facing our       nation. The value that these MCMs offer to first responders,       patients and their caregivers, and the global community is       phenomenal.        BIO was pleased to see the Act continue to provide support       for critical preparedness programs such as the BioShield       Special Reserve Fund (SRF), the Biomedical Advanced Research       and Development Authority (BARDA), and the Strategic National       Stockpile (SNS)--all of which are necessary to ensure that we       can maintain a robust medical countermeasures enterprise that       can address known and unknown threats. We are also pleased to       see that significant threats such pandemic influenza,       emerging infectious diseases, and antimicrobial resistance       are specifically recognized in the Act and that BARDA has       been authorized appropriations to address these dangerous       threats. We are very supportive of the overall authorization       of $2.4 billion annually to the MCM enterprise, which will       allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to more       fully prepare for many of the threats affecting our national       health security.        BIO thanks you for your commitment to our national health       security and your important work to ensure that our nation is       adequately prepared to respond to the myriad threats we face       domestically and abroad. BIO and our member companies look       forward to continuing to work with you to further strengthen       our preparedness against all potential national security and       public health threats as outlined in the National Biodefense       Strategy.            With Sincerest Regards,                                                James C. Greenwood,      President and CEO.                                   ____                             California Life Sciences Association,                                                      July 16, 2018.      Hon. Susan Brooks,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Anna G. Eshoo,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representatives Brooks and Eshoo: On behalf of       California Life Sciences Association (CLSA)--the statewide       public policy organization representing California's leading       life science innovators, including medical device,       diagnostic, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies,       research universities and private, non-profit institutes, and       venture capital firms--I am writing to express our support       for H.R. 6378, the Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness and       Advancing Innovation (PAHPAI) Act of 2018, your legislation       that will strengthen and improve our national preparedness       and response for public health emergencies, and accelerate       medical countermeasure research and development. Thank you       for your leadership on this critically important issue.        As you know, the recent Ebola and Zika outbreaks and       ongoing threats from terrorist organizations like ISIS have       repeatedly exposed our nation's continued vulnerability to       bioterror and pandemic threats, demonstrating the need for       robust biodefense preparedness. Robust, long-term funding,       and strong and sustained public-private partnerships remain       critical in ensuring a well-funded, well-coordinated, swift       and effective response from all stakeholders. This includes,       critically, a robust statutory framework for securing our       nation from chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear       (CBRN) threats, as well as from pandemic influenza (PI),       antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and emerging infectious       diseases (EID).        To that end, H.R. 6378 strengthens our country's national       preparedness and response efforts for public health       emergencies by codifying the Public Health Emergency Medical       Countermeasure Enterprise and the duties of the Assistant       Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), while       maintaining the important role of the Centers for Disease       Control in emergency and response activities. The legislation       also provides the authorization and federal resources to       invest in programs related to Pandemic Influenza and Emerging       Infectious Diseases.        We are pleased the bill provides new authorities to the       Director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development       Authority (BARDA) to develop strategic initiatives for       threats that pose a significant level of risk to national       security, including antimicrobial resistant pathogens. We       also encourage you to continue working with you colleagues on       the House Committee on Energy & Commerce and congressional       leadership to explore the creation of new incentives to       encourage investment into the development of products to       treat or prevent a disease attributable to a multi-drug       resistant bacterial or fungal pathogen.        According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention       (CDC), each year at least two million people in the United       States are infected with bacteria that cannot be treated with       an antibiotic, resulting in roughly 23,000 deaths and health       care costs as much as $20 billion annually. These staggering       statistics illustrate a dangerous reality: even as the rate       of anti-microbial resistance has grown, research and drug       development has not kept pace with the dire need for new       medicines to treat these increasingly lethal ``superbugs.''        Given the threat that these deadly pathogens pose to public       health in the United States and across the world, the need       for effective public-private partnerships between the       government, academia and industry has never been greater. The       growing epidemic of multidrug-resistant infections knows no       borders and the reestablishment of antibiotic development as       a viable investment for life sciences innovators is       imperative to public health and preparedness.        Thank you again for your leadership of H.R. 6378, as well       as your long-standing support for legislation and policy       measures that improve our nation's biodefense preparedness       and response capabilities.        CLSA is pleased to join a broad group of stakeholders in       offering our strong support for H.R. 6378, the Pandemic and       All Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of       2018. Please let me know if CLSA can be of assistance to you.            Sincerely,                                           Jennifer Nieto Carey,                                  Vice President--Federal Government      Relations & Alliance Development.                                   ____                                                        Cellphire,                                       Rockville, MD, July 18, 2018.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, House Energy and Commerce Committee, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Susan Brooks,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Ranking Member, House Energy and Commerce Committee,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Anna Eshoo,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Walden, Ranking Member Pallone and       Representatives Brooks and Eshoo: We write in support of HR       6378, the Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA)       Reauthorization. Cellphire supports the Committee's inclusion       of the national blood supply in the Committee mark-up of       PAHPA. Numerous inquiries and hearings conducted after 9/11       revealed the need for a coordinated response to insure       preparedness through maintaining an adequate blood supply and       providing a rapid coordinated response system to distribute       blood products immediately to the affected area(s) as well as       recruit and manage donations required for continual resupply       during the crisis. The need for a coordinated response to the       nation's blood needs was first recognized in the National       Response Plan, Emergency Support Function #8, Public Health       and Medical Services Annex:        Blood, Organs, and Blood Tissues--ESF #8 may task HHS       components and request assistance from other ESF #8 partner       organizations to monitor and ensure the safety, availability,       and logistical requirements of blood, organs, and tissues.       This includes the ability of the existing supply chain       resources to meet the manufacturing, testing, storage, and       distribution of these products.        We applaud the Committee's recognition of the national       blood supply's importance as referenced in Section 116 which       requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to       provide a report on recommendations related to maintaining an       adequate blood supply Hospitals across the nation as well as       blood product companies like Cellphire are dependent on the       stability of the blood supply and the ability of the U.S.       blood supply ``system'' to respond to disaster. The       organizations representing the nation's blood centers,       hospital-based blood banks and transfusion services, and       transfusion medicine professionals have requested that you       consider asking the Office of the Assistant Secretary for       Preparedness and Response (ASPR) to make the sustainability       of our nation's blood supply a critical element of our       emergency preparedness and response systems. In addition, a       joint letter to the New England Journal of Medicine authored       by Harvey Klein MD, Chief Department of Medicine, the NIH       Clinical Center, Chris Hrouda, President ARC Biomedical       Services, and Jay Epstein MD, Director, Office of Blood       Research and Review, Center for Biologics Evaluation and       Research, FDA, warned of an approaching crisis in the       sustainability of the U.S. Blood System. The concern       regarding the sustainability and responsiveness of the U.S.       blood supply was also raised by a RAND Corporation study       initiated by the Department of Health and Human Services,       ``Toward a Sustainable Blood Supply in the United States, An       Analysis of the Current System and Alternatives to the       Future''.  [[Page H8786]]         The goal at Cellphire, currently supported by the ASPR       through BARDA, is to develop and field a freeze-dried       platelet product to stop hemorrhage that can alleviate       platelet shortages and lead to a life-saving product that       controls bleeding and can be stockpiled. Supplying,       distributing and resupplying this and other blood products       during a crisis requires a sustainable blood supply.        The PAHPA Re-authorization bill includes language for the       Assistant Secretary of Preparedness Response (ASPR) to       include the stability of the blood supply as it considers       guidelines for infrastructure. Section 203 further lists the       blood banks in the stakeholder groups with whom ASPR should       engage to obtain feedback on financial implications as it       relates to regional preparedness planning pursuant to the       guidelines.        We believe the reference to the national blood supply and       the inclusion of the blood collection centers and hospital       blood banks in ASPR guidelines to establish infrastructure       and regional preparedness planning will ensure our nation's       blood supply is ready and prepared for surge capacity in the       event of a disaster or terrorist attack.        Thank you for your leadership in addressing the blood       supply in HR 6378, the PAHPA Reauthorization. We support the       Committee's attention to this urgent matter of national       security.            Sincerely,      Michael Fitzpatrick, Ph.D , COL (Ret.) U.S. Army,        President and Director of Research, Cellphire, Inc.                                   ____                                              Coalition for Epidemic                                        Preparedness Innovations,                                                      July 17, 2018.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman,      Washington DC.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Ranking, Energy and Commerce Committee, Washington DC.        Dear Chairman Walden and Ranking Member Pallone: I write in       strong support of HR 6378, the Pandemic and All-Hazards       Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act (PAHPA.) As you       know, public health emergencies can result from natural       disasters, emerging pathogens, or man-made threats. Just last       year we saw health challenges emerge on multiple fronts due       to hurricanes, a virulent strain of the flu, and outbreaks of       plague, Lassa, Nipah and Ebola overseas. The United States       must do everything in its power to prepare for health       emergencies, and HR 6378 goes a long way towards helping the       Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) achieve that       goal.        As the CEO of CEPI, an international coalition whose       mission it is to develop vaccines to prevent future       epidemics, I am heartened to see language in the bill asking       HHS to report on its work developing vaccines to prevent       epidemics, including its collaborations with international       organizations (Section 303). As we saw in the recent Ebola       outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, vaccines and       international coalitions can play a critically important role       in outbreak response and HHS should maximize its support for       this kind of vaccine research and development.        I am also pleased that HR 6378 creates an emerging       infectious disease program within the Biomedical Advanced       Research and Development Authority (BARDA) [Section 302].       CEPI would welcome the opportunity to partner with BARDA on       future vaccine candidates for emerging infectious diseases of       global significance. In addition, the codification of the       Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasure Enterprise       (PHEMCE) is another important feature of this bill [Section       101]. The PHEMCE works to ensure that medical countermeasure       development is aligned across the government and that       bottlenecks can be anticipated and prevented, which is       important to prevent costly duplication of work and other       inefficiencies.        In summary, I believe that HR 6378 will strengthen US       public health preparedness, particularly when it comes to       vaccines and medical countermeasure development and       coordination, and I am pleased that it will be considered by       your committee.            Sincerely,                                             Richard Hatchett, CEO.     Mr. Speaker, I include the following letters  in the Record.                                                           Cerus,                                         Concord, CA, July 17, 2018.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, House Energy and Commerce Committee, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Ranking Member, House Energy & Commerce Committee, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC,        Dear Chairman Walden and Ranking Member Pallone: As you       review and deliberate over H.R. 6378, the Pandemic and All-      Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018, we       wanted to provide our support for the efforts in the       legislation to preserve and protect the nation's blood       supply--especially in a public health emergency.        As you know, the American public expects the nation's blood       supply is safe and available every day, but especially in       situations of natural or man-made disasters. Blood       transfusions can be lifesaving measures, but this depends on       our collective ability to ensure the safety and availability       of the blood supply. Though the danger of transfusion-      transmitted infections has decreased in recent years due to       improved blood testing for specific pathogens such as HIV and       hepatitis, these tests do not detect the presence of all       viruses, bacteria, and parasites known to contaminate blood       donations. In 2015 at the height of the Zika epidemic in       Puerto Rico, the FDA released guidance calling for the use of       blood treatment pathogen reduction technology as an option to       reduce the risk of transfusion-transmission of Zika. This       pathogen reduction technology helped ensure that very ill       patients would have adequate access to safe blood and that       they would not contract Zika virus infection from their       therapeutic blood transfusions.        Section 116 is critical to ensuring the blood collection       community, in concert with the Department of Health and Human       Services, begins to cohesively examine the challenges with       preserving capacity in the nation's blood supply for major       emergency care, addressing issues like recruiting sufficient       donors to ensure the adequacy of the current supply to meet       public health emergencies and implementation of innovative       and best safety practices.        The inclusion of blood banks in Section 203 is also       critical for ensuring the blood banking community has an       opportunity to engage along with hospitals, health care       facilities, public agencies and others to provide input into       our nation's new ``Healthcare Preparedness and it Response       Program.'' The inclusion of blood banks is critical in       providing feedback on the financial implications for the       program as the industry faces many challenges in ensuring a       transfusion-ready blood supply.        I sincerely appreciate the time and effort that both of       you, your fellow Committee members and the staff have placed       in drafting, reviewing, and deliberation over H.R. 6378. I       look forward to continuing to work with all of you in       supporting our nation's ability to respond in public health       emergencies.            Sincerely,                                            Dr. Laurence Corash, MD      Chief Scientific Officer, Cerus.                                   ____                                                      July 19, 2018.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC.      Hon. Susan W. Brooks,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Anna Eshoo,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Walden, Ranking Member Pallone, and       Representatives Brooks and Eshoo: Child Care Aware of America       cares deeply about the health and well-being of children and       their success in child care. We would like to thank you for       your bipartisan commitment to reauthorizing the Pandemic and       All-Hazards Preparedness Act. As the Pandemic and All-Hazards       Preparedness (PAHPA) and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018       moves forward, we want to voice our support for extending and       expanding the authorization of the National Advisory       Committee on Children and Disasters (NACCD) to address the       ongoing gaps in our nation's preparedness and response for       children. Recent natural disasters such as Hurricanes Harvey,       Irma and Maria have demonstrated that our nation still is not       fully prepared to respond to the child care needs of       children.        We also appreciate the proposed additional expertise to the       NACCD to include non-federal experts in pediatric mental or       behavioral health, pediatric infectious disease, children's       hospitals, and children and youth with special health care       needs, and particularly, professionals with expertise in       child care or school settings.        The NACCD was established to provide advice and       consultation to the Department of Health and Human Services       (HHS) Secretary and the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness       and Response (ASPR) on issues related to the medical and       public health needs of children before, during, and after       disasters. The NACCD has completed several reports in recent       years focused on youth leadership, surge capacity, and the       provision of human services. Their expertise has been       invaluable in ensuring that children are protected during       public health emergencies and disasters.        Our organization learned that after Hurricane Irma, 22% of       the child care facilities in the state of Florida were closed       due to the storm. In the Miami-Dade-Monroe area specifically,       32% of facilities were closed. Following Hurricane Harvey,       18% of child care facilities were closed in the Houston area.       This means that thousands of children and their families were       left without child care. This carries an incredible burden on       families as they struggle to find child care when they are       needed at work. Furthermore, the interruption of normalcy can       cause stress on children leading to negative consequences for       brain development. Including expertise in child care will       help in making sure that the needs of the 11 million children       in child care will be met before, during, and after a       disaster.        Children are not little adults. They have specialized needs       that must be considered when planning for, responding to, and       recovering from a disaster. This includes having a strong,       well-funded public health and medical system. We thank you       considering the many needs of children and including them  [[Page H8787]]       in the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness (PAHPA) and       Advancing Innovation Act of 2018.            Sincerely,      Child Care Aware of America.                                   ____                                                    CHIME & AEHIS,                                                      July 23, 2018.      Re Inclusion of Cybersecurity in the Pandemic and All-Hazards           Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, House Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Energy and Commerce, House           of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Walden and Ranking Member Pallone: The       College of Healthcare Information Management Executives       (CHIME) and the Association for Executives in Healthcare       Information Security (AEHIS) sincerely appreciate the       inclusion of cybersecurity provisions in section 401 of the       Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing       Innovation Act of 2018. This critical section of legislation       recognizes the importance of ensuring the nation's health       systems are better prepared and better able to respond in the       event of a cybersecurity incident.        CHIME is an executive organization dedicated to serving       chief information officers (CIOs), chief medical information       officers (CMIOs), chief nursing information officers (CNIOs)       and other senior healthcare IT leaders. Consisting of more       than 2,600 members in 51 countries, our members are       responsible for the selection and implementation of clinical       and business technology systems that are facilitating       healthcare transformation. CHIME members are among the       nation's foremost health IT experts, including on the topic       of cybersecurity. Launched by CHIME in 2014, AEHIS represents       more than 850 chief information security officers (CISOs) and       provides education and networking for senior IT security       leaders in healthcare. CHIME and AEHIS members take their       responsibility to protect the privacy and security of patient       data and devices networked to their system very seriously.        The widespread attacks experienced by health systems       worldwide during the spring of 2017 highlighted the need to       consider the cybersecurity readiness of the healthcare sector       and demonstrated the importance of increased preparedness and       rapid response in the event of an incident. Cybersecurity       threats are growing in frequency and sophistication coming       from a variety of actors seeking to send our country's       healthcare system into disarray. Our members continue to       worry about the threats to patient care and safety posed by       cybersecurity attacks.        CHIME and AEHIS appreciate the inclusion of cybersecurity       in the Pandemic All Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act       of 2018. We agree that cybersecurity threats and the       recognition of their potential to disrupt healthcare delivery       is of the utmost importance to patient safety and therefore,       needs to be a part of the National Health Security Strategy.       CHIME and AEHIS believe it is imperative that cybersecurity       is treated as a threat to our nation in similarity to other       hazards. We also appreciate the designation of the Assistant       Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) as the leader       within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in       the event of a cybersecurity incident. Our members have       repeatedly cited confusion, leading to frustration, about       which operating division within HHS has responsibility over       cybersecurity and serves as a liaison to the industry.        We appreciate your continued interest and leadership on       this important and increasingly urgent subject. We stand       ready to work with you and your colleagues to pursue       legislative solutions to improve the cybersecurity readiness       of the nation's healthcare sector.            Sincerely,      Cletis Earle,        Chair, CHIME Board of Trustees Vice President, CIO       Information Technology,        Kaleida Health.      Erik Decker,        Chair, AEHIS Board CISO and Chief Privacy Officer,        University of Chicago Medicine.                                   ____                                            Emergent BioSolutions,                                                      July 17, 2018.      Hon. Susan Brooks,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Anna Eshoo,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Washington, DC.        Dear Reps. Brooks, Eshoo, Walden, and Pallone: Thank you to       you and your staff for your hard work in introducing H.R.       6378, the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing       Innovation Act of 2018. This legislation, like PAHPRA and       PAHPA before it, is vital to ensuring our nation is safe from       and prepared for both human-deployed and natural chemical,       biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats.       Emergent is pleased to support PAHPAI.        We are appreciative of your staff for taking the time to       meet with us and solicit feedback about the PAHPAI. Thank you       for your leadership in ensuring the legislation further       strengthens our nation's preparedness for biological threats.        Funding Levels: Emergent strongly supports the robust       funding levels authorized in PAHPAI. This funding is needed       to continue to grow the public-private partnership Congress       created to ensure the U.S. is adequately prepared for CBRN       threats. Sustained and expanded investment in these programs       is a vital market pull to ensure private partners produce       medical countermeasures for the most serious threats we face       as a nation, such as anthrax, smallpox, and chemical threats.       If the government fails to adequately support the Special       Reserve Fund, BARDA, and the SNS, the nation faces the dual       risk of squandering resources already invested into research       and preparedness, while also being underprepared or       unprepared for material threats to our national security.        Identified Authorization Funding Levels for Key Programs:       Emergent is strongly supportive of the inclusion of specific       funding authorization that breaks out the minimum amounts for       the critical Pandemic Influenza and Emerging Infectious       Disease (EID) activities supported through BARDA. Specific       authorizations help ensure that BARDA's priorities receive       consistent funding needed to drive the development of       countermeasures to respond to material threats, pandemic       influenza, emerging infectious diseases, and other public       health hazards.        Other Transaction (OT) Authority: We appreciate your       efforts to update the medical countermeasure enterprise's OT       authority and harmonize it with the OT authority of other       agencies. These changes will provide the enterprise needed       flexibility to better prepare for manmade and naturally-      occurring biological threats.        The public health threat matrix is real and growing.       Reauthorization of PAHPAI is vital to ensuring our nation is       prepared for the most severe threats facing the country. As       introduced, PAHPAI will greatly enhance our nation's       biosecurity preparedness. We believe that Emergent is       uniquely positioned to enable the U.S. and allied governments       to address many of these threats based on our growing       portfolio of medical countermeasures, decades of experience       and expertise in government partnering and contracting, and       our broad and deep manufacturing capabilities. We hope we can       be a resource as the committee continues to work towards       passage of PAHPAI.            Sincerely,                                                       Chris Frech,        Senior Vice President, Global Government Affairs, Emergent       BioSolutions, Inc.                                   ____                                                        Genentech,                                       Washington, DC, 17 July 2018.      Hon. Anna G. Eshoo,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Susan W. Brooks,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Representatives Eshoo and Brooks, Chairman Walden, and       Ranking Member Pallone: Genentech, Inc. (Genentech) would       like to express our strong support for H.R. 6378--The       Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness and Advancing       Innovation Act of 2018. We applaud your shared leadership and       bipartisan efforts to strengthen the nation's public health       preparedness and response programs. We are particularly       appreciative that H.R. 6378 authorizes a specific Pandemic       Influenza program at the Biomedical Advanced Research and       Development Authority (BARDA) to support research and       development activities to enhance a rapid response to       pandemic influenza.        As you continue your work toward reauthorization, Genentech       welcomes the opportunity to share our relevant experience and       provide any needed feedback.            Sincerely,                                                        David Burt,      Senior Director, Federal Government Affairs.                                   ____                                           Grifols Public Affairs,                                      Washington, DC, July 24, 2018.      Hon. Susan Brooks,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Anna Eshoo,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congresswoman Brooks and Congresswoman Eshoo: Thank       you for your leadership on healthcare issues in the Congress.       Grifols is proud to join the public health and infectious       disease communities in expressing our strong support for H.R.       6378, the ``Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and       Advancing Innovation Act of 2018.'' This legislation is       critical to maintaining our national preparedness in response       to public health emergencies.        Grifols is a global healthcare company with a 75-year       history of producing plasma-derived medicines, diagnostic       tools and hospital pharmacy products. Grifols is a leader in       transfusion medicine as a supplier of blood and plasma       infectious disease screening systems that are critical to       safeguarding the U.S. blood supply.  [[Page H8788]]         The Nation's experience with emerging infectious diseases,       such as Zika, demonstrates the need for a coordinated       response to public health threats. In a report commissioned       by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of the       Assistant Secretary of Health, the RAND Corporation found       there are 86 emerging or recently emerged pathogens that       threaten the safety of the blood supply. The threat posed by       these emerging infectious diseases exhibits the need to plan       for managing potential outbreaks.        In particular, Grifols is supportive of the provisions in       H.R. 6378 to aid the development and appropriate utilization       of multiuse platform technologies for diagnostics, vaccines,       and therapeutics; virus seeds; clinical trial lots; novel       virus strains; and antigen and adjuvant material; as well as       the provisions aimed at strengthening the U.S. blood supply:        Requiring a report on the adequacy of the national blood       supply        Establish guidelines, in consultation with health care       providers--including blood banks, relating to emergency       preparedness which consider the needs of the blood supply,       taking into account resiliency, geographic and rural       considerations, as well as the financial implications of       implementing such guidelines        Seeking input from all blood supply stakeholders in the       development of emergency preparedness guidelines will help       strengthen the public health infrastructure by ensuring that       the unique needs of the blood supply are met.        In the interests of U.S. public health, we encourage       Congress to pass H.R. 6378 to ensure a robust response to       public health threats.            Sincerely,                                                Christopher Healey,                                                    Vice President.     Mr. Speaker, I include the following letters  in the Record.                                                      July 18, 2018.      Hon. Susan Brooks,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Anna Eshoo,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representatives Brooks and Eshoo: I am writing on       behalf of Roche Diagnostics Corporation in support of H.R.       6378, Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing       Innovation Act of 2018. Congratulations on advancing this       legislation out of the Energy and Commerce Committee.        We applaud your efforts in improving the nation's overall       preparedness and response capabilities. We especially       appreciate the Committee's recognition that diagnostics can       play a key role in responding to public health and medical       emergencies.        We look forward to continuing to work with you as this       legislation advances in Congress.            Sincerely,                                                Russell C. Ring,                                 Vice President, Government Affairs,      Roche Diagnostics Corporation.                                   ____                                        Strategic Health Information                                          Exchange Collaborative,                                                      July 18, 2018.        Reps. Brooks and Eshoo and Members of the Energy and       Commerce Committee: On behalf of the Strategic Health       Information Exchange Collaborative (SHIEC), which represents       more than 60 Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) across the       nation, thank you for your leadership on the reauthorization       of the Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Act (PAHPAI).       SHIEC HIEs have played an important role across the country       and have a strong interest in emergency preparedness and       disaster relief. SHIEC HIEs have demonstrated the important       role they play in federal, state, and local governments. In       2017 SHIEC HIEs in Texas partnered with local providers and       patients to access critical medical information in the wake       of Hurricane Harvey, and SHIEC HIEs in New York helped to       thwart a ransomware attack and safeguard patient information.       SHIEC is a recognized leader in medical record       interoperability via the Patient Centered Data Home. This       initiative allows patients, no matter where they are--whether       caught up in emergencies while traveling or displaced by       disasters--access to their medical information when and where       they need it.        SHIEC is pleased with the proposed direction for this       reauthorization of PAHPAI, particularly the broadened scope       of Title II regarding ``Optimizing State and Local All-      Hazards Preparedness and Response.'' State and local agencies       and hospitals are not the only healthcare stakeholders during       a crisis. There are many entities that should be consulted in       emergency-planning. Addressing the problems and solutions       more broadly allows state and local agencies and hospitals to       better prepare and handle disasters.        To this end SHIEC applauds the Committee's inclusion of not       just the brick and mortar infrastructure, but also the       ``technological infrastructure'' while developing guidelines       and protocols. SHIEC is also happy to see the broad reference       to ``healthcare or subject matter experts'' which replaces a       more restrictive reference to healthcare providers and       agencies.        SHIEC recommends inclusion of HIEs specifically. As the       data trustees in a community, SHIEC HIEs offer vital services       to support a community in crisis. Awareness and realization       of this full benefit has yet to be achieved in some areas.       Without inclusion of clarifying language, SHIEC is concerned       HIEs may still be left out of planning. SHIEC hopes however,       that the broader, more inclusive language that the Committee       has proposed will be expansive enough to ensure HIEs a seat       at the emergency preparedness and disaster relief table.        Thank you,                                             Kelly Hoover Thompson,      CEO.                                   ____                                                           Takeda,                                       Cambridge, MA, July 20, 2018.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chariman, House Energy and Commerce Committee,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Susan W. Brooks,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon.

Eshoo,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Chairman Walden, Ranking Member Pallone, and       Representatives Brooks and Eshoo: Takeda Vaccines appreciates       the opportunity to support H.R. 6378, the Pandemic and All-      Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018.       The legislation contains important provisions to improve the       nation's ability to respond to public health emergencies and       to accelerate research and development of medical       countermeasures. Of particular note is the creation of the       Emerging Infectious Disease Program within the Biomedical       Advanced Research and Development Authority (``BARDA'') that       will support research and development and manufacturing       infrastructure with respect to emerging infectious diseases.        Takeda is a global, research and development-driven       pharmaceutical company committed to bringing better health       and a brighter future to patients by translating science into       life-changing medicines. In addition to its efforts in       oncology, gastroenterology, and neuroscience, Takeda is       actively engaged in the research and development of vaccines       including one for the deadly Zika virus. We appreciate the       collaboration with BARDA to advance innovation in this       disease state.        Takeda applauds the action of the House Energy and Commerce       Committee to pass H.R. 6378 on July 18, 2018, and thanks the       Members and staff for their hard work on this critical bill.            Sincerely,                                             Rajeev Venkayya, M.D.,                  President, Global Vaccines Business Unit, Takeda       Pharmaceutical Company Limited.                                   ____                             Trauma Center Association of America,                                                      July 24, 2018.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, House Committee on Energy & Commerce,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Susan Brooks,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Energy & Commerce,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Anna Eshoo,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Walden, Ranking Member Pallone, Rep. Brooks       and Rep. Eshoo: The Trauma Center Association of America       (``TCAA'') strongly supports H.R. 6378, the Pandemic and All-      Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018. We       applaud your bipartisan leadership in developing this       legislation that will help improve and strengthen the       preparedness and response capabilities of our nation's trauma       care system.        We appreciate your willingness to work with TCAA and our       members as you crafted this important piece of legislation.       Specifically, we are pleased to see that the bill       reauthorizes federal grant funding to support the core       missions of trauma centers to offset the cost of activities       such as patient stabilization and transfer, trauma education       and outreach, coordination with local and regional trauma       systems, essential personnel, trauma staff recruitment and       retention, ensuring surge capacity, and trauma-related       emotional and mental health services.        Additionally, TCAA has long advocated for the MISSION ZERO       Act, and we strongly support the inclusion of language to       establish a grant program for military-civilian partnerships       in trauma care that will allow both sectors to benefit from       the others' expertise and experience. This will benefit       patients both on and off the battlefield and we look forward       to continuing to work with you to implement this program.        Finally, we were pleased to see that the bill requires the       development of guidelines, and the authorization of a       demonstration program, to promote coordination and surge       capacity among regional systems of hospitals and other public       health facilities during a public health emergency. This will       help improve our nation's response capabilities and give more       patients access to high quality trauma care.        We look forward to passage of H.R. 6378 and continued work       with the Senate to ensure that this legislation becomes law.       Again, thank you for your hard work and commitment to       preparing and equipping our  [[Page H8789]]       healthcare system for future disasters and public health       emergencies.
