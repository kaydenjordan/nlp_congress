 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for  yielding.   It is an honor to stand in support of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade  agreement.   Trade is a vital part of our economy. It has made America the world's  land of opportunity. We have been a vital part of the world's economy.   Certainty is needed in trade right now. This deal certainly isn't  perfect, but far too often here in Congress we let perfect become the  enemy of good.   Frankly, we have a choice between no NAFTA, NAFTA, or an improved  NAFTA, so it is not a hard multiple choice test. It is an improvement,  and I look forward to continuing to work to advance the cause of  capitalism and free trade in the United States of America.   Opportunities are going to make things better for Ohio's Eighth  District, from manufacturing to agriculture, to financial services, and  I thank everyone who has had a hand in making this come to fruition.
