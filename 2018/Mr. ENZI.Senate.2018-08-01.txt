 Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of Hight Proffit,  who is being inducted into the Wyoming Agriculture Hall of Fame. Every  year since 1992, Wyoming has recognized individuals who have made  substantial contributions to agriculture in our State. During his life,  Hight displayed a special talent for agriculture and was a dedicated  public servant for his neighbors and friends. Hight is a well-deserved  recipient of this great honor.   Hight moved to Wyoming at a young age during the middle of the Great  Depression when it wasn't easy to make a living, let alone to be a  rancher. Much like he would show throughout his life, he showed what  you can accomplish through hard work and resolve and learned to make  the best out of everything.   He is remembered as a handyman, as well as an innovator. Hight  excelled in improving agriculture and left his mark on the long, proud  history of Wyoming agriculture. He worked hard to improve not only his  ranch, but also the community around him, from fairly distributing  water to expanding electric power.   Among his many accomplishments, perhaps the greatest was the  dedication he showed to his family. By his side for over 60 years, was  his loving wife, Dorothy. As his son Don puts it, Hight and Dorothy  ``established a ranch with the help of the Federal Land Bank on the  Bear River, where they raised cattle, sheep and horses, as well as four  children.'' Hight and Dorothy were then blessed with numerous  grandchildren and great-grandchildren.   Not only did he serve as a role model for his family, but his  community as well as a dedicated public servant. Hight served on  numerous boards and committees, as a Unita County commissioner, a State  representative, and as a State senator. He also served as a mentor to  countless young people through 4-H, Boy Scouts of America, Farm Bureau,  and his church.   Although it has now been 16 years since Hight has passed, his memory  lives on and his example continue to inspire others. I want to extend  my congratulations to the family of Hight and Dorothy. Hight truly  lived the code of the West, and I am proud to have the opportunity to  recognize his achievements and his memory as an inductee into the  Wyoming Agriculture Hall of Fame. Wyoming is well served by his lasting  and continuing contributions to our State.                            ____________________
