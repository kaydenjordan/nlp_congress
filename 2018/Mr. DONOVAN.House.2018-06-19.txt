 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4991) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to  establish the National Urban Security Technology Laboratory, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4991         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Supporting Research and       Development for First Responders Act''.       SEC. 2. NATIONAL URBAN SECURITY TECHNOLOGY LABORATORY.         (a) In General.--Title III of the Homeland Security Act of       2002 is amended--        (1) by redesignating the second section 319 (relating to       EMP and GMD mitigation research and development) as section       320; and        (2) by inserting after section 320, as so redesignated, the       following new section:       ``SEC. 321. NATIONAL URBAN SECURITY TECHNOLOGY LABORATORY.         ``(a) In General.--The Secretary, acting through the Under       Secretary for Science and Technology, shall designate the       laboratory described in subsection (b) as an additional       laboratory pursuant to the authority under section 308(c)(2).       Such laboratory shall be used to test and evaluate emerging       technologies and conduct research and development to assist       emergency response providers in preparing for, and protecting       against, threats of terrorism.        ``(b) Laboratory Described.--The laboratory described in       this subsection is the laboratory--        ``(1) known, as of the date of the enactment of this       section, as the National Urban Security Technology       Laboratory;        ``(2) previously known as the Environmental Measurements       Laboratory; and        ``(3) transferred to the Department pursuant to section       303(1)(E).        ``(c) Laboratory Activities.--The laboratory designated       pursuant to subsection (a), shall--        ``(1) conduct tests, evaluations, and assessments of       current and emerging technologies, including, as appropriate,       cybersecurity of such technologies that can connect to the       internet, for emergency response providers;        ``(2) conduct research and development on radiological and       nuclear response and recovery;        ``(3) act as a technical advisor to emergency response       providers; and        ``(4) carry out other such activities as the Secretary       determines appropriate.''.

Social media working group. ``319. Transparency in research and development. ``320. EMP and GMD mitigation research and development. ``321. National Urban Security Technology Laboratory.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include any extraneous materials on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4991, the Supporting Research  and Development for First Responders Act. H.R. 4991 authorizes the  National Urban Security Technology Laboratory, NUSTL, within the  Department of Homeland Security's Science and Technology Directorate.   Located in New York City, NUSTL has been a critical resource in  protecting our homeland since 1947. Today, NUSTL is a one-of-its-kind  test and evaluation laboratory for the first responder community.   I had the opportunity to visit NUSTL last year and saw firsthand the  impressive work being done there on a daily basis. During my visit, I  witnessed NUSTL's work to test and validate equipment used by our first  responders to protect our communities. NUSTL has conducted more than  1,000 assessments on current and emergency first responder equipment.   I also learned about NUSTL's radiological and nuclear research and  development, which focuses on response and recovery efforts.   Additionally, last November, Chief Timothy Rice from the New York  City Fire Department testified before the Subcommittee on Emergency  Preparedness, Response, and Communications, which I chair, on the  importance of NUSTL to FDNY's daily operations. Chief Rice highlighted  that the fire department's relationship with NUSTL has ``strengthened  the department's ability to save life and property, and ultimately,  make the people of New York and millions of visitors to the region  safer each day.''   Simply put, this bill will authorize the test and evaluation and  research and development activities currently being conducted at NUSTL.  Given the current threat environment, we need to ensure that DHS  continues to support our first responders, and this bill will do just  that. H.R. 4991 will ensure that the valuable work being done at NUSTL  will continue for years to come.   I want to recognize the tireless efforts of the staff at NUSTL to  support first responders and secure our homeland.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that this bill is supported by the American  Federation of Government Employees, and I include in the Record their  letter dated June 15, 2018.                                              American Federation of                                   Government Employees, AFL-CIO,                                      Washington, DC, June 15, 2018.        Dear Representative, On behalf of the American Federation       of Government Employees, AFL-CIO (AFGE), which represents       more than 700,000 federal and DC government workers who serve       the American people in 70 different agencies, including 20       employees at the National Urban Security Technology       Laboratory (NUSTL), I am writing to indicate our support of       H.R. 4991, the Supporting Research and Development for First       Responders Act. This bill would provide for the authorization       of this important program.        The National Urban Security Technology Laboratory (NUSTL)       works primarily on testing technologies used by first       responders. The scientists and engineers at NUSTL ensure       first responders are safe and equipped to perform their       duties. They support the training of first responders to use       radiation detection equipment to interdict a terrorist act       involving radiological dispersion devices (RDDs) or       improvised nuclear devices (INDs). They also publish reports       that allow first responders to purchase radiation and       explosives detection equipment best suited for their needs.       They ensure unmanned aerial vehicles or drones are not used       as weapons.        NUSTL labs give police officers, fire fighters and other       first responders the opportunity to test drive technological       equipment and offer feedback for how to make it safer and       more effective. NUSTL allows first responders to test       prototypes of products in the pipeline at DHS to help improve       them. They also offer training about how to respond to       emergencies and natural disasters. NUSTL employees' work       keeps first responders safe and up to date with the latest       technologies. NUSTL ensures our communities are safe and       thriving.        AFGE strongly supports H.R. 4991, the Supporting Research       and Development for First Responders Act.            Thank you,                                                    Thomas S. Kahn,                          Director, Legislative Affairs Department.     Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in voting for  the Supporting Research and Development for First Responders Act, and I  reserve the balance of my time.

In addition, should a conference on this bill be       necessary, I would support a request by the Committee on       Science, Space, and Technology for conferees on those       provisions within your jurisdiction.        I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional       Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor.       I thank you for your cooperation in this matter.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague, Mr. Langevin from  Rhode Island, for his help in this matter. And I once again urge all of  my colleagues to support H.R. 4991, as amended, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5762) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to  authorize a Joint Task Force to enhance integration of the Department  of Homeland Security's border security operations to detect, interdict,  disrupt, and prevent narcotics, such as fentanyl and other synthetic  opioids, from entering the United States, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5762         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Joint Task Force to Combat       Opioid Trafficking Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION OF JOINT TASK FORCE TO COUNTER OPIOIDS.         Section 708 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C.       348) is amended--        (1) in subsection (b)(2)(A), by adding at the end the       following new clause:        ``(iv) Enhancing the integration of the Department's border       security operations to detect, interdict, disrupt, and       prevent narcotics, such as fentanyl and other synthetic       opioids, from entering the United States.''; and        (2) in subsection (b)--        (A) by redesignating paragraphs (9) through (13) as       paragraphs (11) through (15), respectively; and        (B) by inserting after paragraph (8) the following new       paragraph:        ``(9) Engagement with the private sector.--        ``(A) In general.--The Director of a Joint Task Force may       engage with representatives from a private sector       organization for the purpose of carrying out the mission of       such Joint Task Force, and any such engagement shall not be       subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the opioid epidemic continues to devastate communities  across this Nation every day. One hundred fifteen Americans die every  single day from an opioid overdose. Opioid abuse doesn't discriminate.  It touches people from every age group, race, class, gender, and  background.                                time  1700    In my home State of New York, more than 3,000 lives were lost in 2016  alone. Mr. Speaker, 3,000.   Some Americans are becoming addicted after taking doctor-prescribed  doses for an injury or surgery. Others are trying them in illicit forms  and are becoming addicted. Opioids are highly addictive and  overprescribed. It is a major part of this epidemic.   Another disturbing trend we are seeing is illicit drugs being laced  with fentanyl, which is 100 times more powerful than morphine, leading  to accidental overdoses. I have seen estimates concluding that more  than 2 million of our fellow Americans are addicted to opioids. Too  many lives have been lost, and too many families have been destroyed.   As we work to confront the epidemic, we must prevent the abuse of  opioids, stop the flow of opioids into the United States, and treat  those Americans who have become addicted. Last week, the House passed  35 bills to address the opioid epidemic through stronger prevention,  treatment, and enforcement activities. Today, we continue that work.   H.R. 5762 would further enable law enforcement to stop the flow of  opioids such as fentanyl from entering the United States. This bill  would create a joint task force within the Department of Homeland  Security to organize opioid interdiction efforts across multiple  components and agencies. The task force would coordinate the assets and  personnel of Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs  Enforcement, Citizenship and Immigration Services, the Coast Guard, and  other resources to track, interdict, and prevent the illicit flow of  opioids through the United States in a unity of effort campaign.   It will also leverage domestic and international partners to provide  a multifaceted approach to tackling this issue. Most illicit opioids  are produced in China, being smuggled by mail, where vulnerabilities in  the postal system are exploited. We are also seeing increased traffic  from Mexico, with opioids hidden in vehicles and cargo entering through  our ports of entry.   The joint task force approach to the opioid epidemic is effective  because it fosters information sharing and exchange between all  relevant stakeholders to combat the opioid epidemic.   There is no quick or easy solution to this epidemic, though H.R. 5762  is a step in the right direction. It empowers the Department of  Homeland Security and its mission partners to tackle the opioid crisis  head-on by organizing a joint task force focused on preventing opioids  from reaching our communities.   Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will  join me in voting for H.R. 5762, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5762. I  thank my friend from Rhode Island for his leadership on this bill, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4627) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to  authorize expenditures to combat emerging terrorist threats, including  vehicular attacks, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4627         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Shielding Public Spaces from       Vehicular Terrorism Act''.       SEC. 2. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.         The Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended--        (1) in paragraph (11) of section 302 (6 U.S.C. 182), by       inserting ``research and development to combat emerging       terrorist threats, such as vehicular attacks, and'' before       ``the long-term''; and        (2) in subparagraph (B) of section 308(b)(2) (6 U.S.C.       188(b)(2))--        (A) in the matter preceding clause (i), by striking       ``expertise in--'' and inserting ``expertise in the       following:'';        (B) by redesignating clause (xiv) as clause (xv); and        (C) by inserting after clause (xiii) the following new       clause:        ``(xiv) Combatting emerging terrorist threats, including       vehicular attacks.''.       SEC. 3. ALLOWABLE USES.         Section 2008 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C.       609) is amended--        (1) in subsection (a)--        (A) by redesignating paragraphs (11) through (14) as       paragraphs (12) through (15), respectively; and        (B) by inserting after paragraph (10) the following new       paragraph:        ``(11) addressing security vulnerabilities of public       spaces, including through the installation of bollards and       other target hardening activities;''; and        (2) in subsection (b)--        (A) in paragraph (3)(B), by striking ``(a)(10)'' and       inserting ``(a)(12)''; and        (B) by adding at the end the folllowing new paragraph:        ``(6) Firearms.--        ``(A) In general.--A grant awarded under section 2003 or       2004 may not be used for the provision to any person of a       firearm or training in the use of a firearm.        ``(B) No effect on other laws.--Nothing in this paragraph       may be construed to preclude or contradict any other       provision of law authorizing the provision of firearms or       training in the use of firearms.''.       SEC. 4. REPORT.         The Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to the       Committee on Homeland Security of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs of the Senate a report on  [[Page H5270]]       potential terrorism vulnerabilities relating to emerging       automotive technologies that support driverless vehicles and       the associated threat such vehicles may pose to people in       public spaces. Such report shall also compare any public       benefit of such vehicles against any such vulnerabilities and       threats.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4627, the Shielding Public  Spaces from Vehicular Terrorism Act. As Secretary Nielsen testified  before the Committee on Homeland Security earlier this year, the  threats to our Nation from terrorist groups are serious and more  dispersed.                                time  1715    As she noted: ``Terrorists are adapting. They are taking an all-of- the-above approach to spreading violence. That includes promoting  attacks on soft targets. . . . `'   Rather than solely focusing on recruiting people to join the fight  overseas, terrorist organizations, like ISIS, are encouraging  extremists to commit terrorist acts in their homeland by any means  necessary. In fact, in September 2014, now-deceased ISIS senior leader  Abu Mohammed al-Adnani urged those attacks, stating: ``Smash his head  with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your  car, or throw him down from a high place, or choke him, or poison  him.'' Unfortunately, people are heeding this call.   The Committee on Homeland Security's Terror Threat Snapshot has  documented 21 ISIS-linked terror plots against the West using vehicles,  79 using or attempting to build or use explosives, and 56 using a knife  or other edged weapon.   We have seen examples of this in the United States as recently as the  vehicular attack on a pedestrian pathway in October and the detonated  explosive device at a transit station in December, both in my hometown  of New York City.   As terror tactics evolve, so must our ability to combat them. That is  why I introduced the Shielding Public Spaces from Vehicular Terrorism  Act. This bipartisan bill requires the Department of Homeland  Security's Science and Technology Directorate to conduct research and  development activities to combat emerging terrorist threats, such as  vehicular attacks.   The bill also ensures that our Nation's first responders can use  vital State Homeland Security Grant Program funding and Urban Areas  Security Initiative funding to address the security vulnerabilities of  public spaces, such as surface transportation facilities and mass  gathering locations.   In this time of increased threats, it is necessary to assess security  vulnerabilities, identify and implement the most effective safeguards,  and support our first responders to the greatest extent possible in  order to protect innocent lives in public spaces.   This bill is supported by the Security Industry Association. Mr.  Speaker, I include in the Record their letter of support.                                  Security Industry Association,                                                   January 31, 2018.      Hon. Dan Donovan,      Chairman, House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Emergency           Preparedness, Response and Communications, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Donald Payne,      Ranking Member, House Homeland Security Subcommittee on           Emergency Preparedness, Response and Communications,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Donovan and Ranking Member Payne: On behalf       of the Security Industry Association (SIA), I would like to       express our strong support for H.R. 4627, the Shielding       Public Spaces from Vehicular Terrorism Act, which would       assist our communities in addressing this evolving threat.       SIA is a non-profit international trade association       representing nearly 800 companies that provide security and       life safety solutions vital to enhancing public safety.        H.R. 4627 requires the DHS Science and Technology       Directorate to engage in research and development activities       to address emerging terrorist threats such as vehicular       attacks, and stipulates that federal homeland security grants       can be used to address ``security vulnerabilities of public       spaces, including through the installation of bollards and       other target hardening activities.''        Unfortunately, public areas and places where crowds gather       for events have become targets for vehicular attacks around       the world and recently in New York City and Charlottesville,       VA. In addition to purposeful attacks, accidents involving       vehicles and buildings or crowded events injure thousands and       kill hundreds of Americans every year.        The strategic placement of bollards, traffic control       systems and other security barriers in key locations are       critical to protecting the public in these locations, and       require significant security and engineering expertise to       deploy affordably and effectively. As you know, these safety       systems saved countless lives in Times Square during an       incident on May 18, 2017, stopping a vehicle used in a       ramming attack by a drugged driver.        We believe leadership and assistance from DHS is critical       as many community leaders responsible for public safety seek       to increase these protections. SIA and its members stand       ready to serve as a resource to you as you continue work on       this critical issue. Thank you for your leadership and       attention to this important matter.            Sincerely,                                                      Don Erickson,                                CEO, Security Industry Association.     Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting  the Shielding Public Spaces from Vehicular Terrorism Act, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers, and I, again,  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to take a moment to recognize Sarah Jorgenson of  my subcommittee staff. This is Sarah's last week with the subcommittee,  and I thank her for her work on this bill and for all of her work on  the subcommittee to enhance the security and resiliency of our Nation.  I wish her the very best in her new role at the Department of the  Interior.   Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4627,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
