 Madam Speaker, today, we recognize a historic day in our  Nation, the 100th anniversary of the House passage of the 19th  Amendment, which, once ratified, granted most women the right to vote,  bringing them one step closer to equality with their male peers.   That ratification was 10 years in the making. Sadly, this pace of  progress, this slow pace, is still all too common. Throughout history,  women have had to fight for the same rights automatically afforded to  men. Today, that fight continues.   As we stand on the shoulders of all the women who challenged  convention, who fought and refused to quit so that we could be here in  a moment where some 68 million women vote in America and the first two  Latina women represent Texas in the people's House, our responsibility  is to continue that fight against the erosion of women's rights that we  are witnessing today and to fight for equal treatment and opportunity  for all.                            ____________________
