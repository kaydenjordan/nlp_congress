 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor some of the most  powerful and outstanding women in my hometown of central Florida during  Women's History Month.   These awe-inspiring women broke glass ceilings, pioneered change,  fought for equal rights, and championed a better tomorrow for the  people of Florida:   Congresswoman Corrine Brown, part of the first group of Black  lawmakers from the State of Florida to serve in the United States House  of Representatives since 1876.   Linda Chapin, the first elected mayor of Orange County.   Stina D'Uva, who serves in our community through the West Orange  Chamber of Commerce.   Veteran Tangia Hill-Smikle, who gave back to central Florida in too  many ways to count.   Suneera Madhani, a pioneer in financial technology.   Linda Landman Gonzalez and Kay Rawlins, leaders with our local  beloved sports teams, the Orlando Magic and Orlando City Soccer Club.   Lastly, human rights advocates like Nikole Parker and Martha Are, and  journalists like Beth Kassab are on the front lines of fighting for the  free press.   Today, I honor them and thank them for all they have done for central  Florida.   Madam Speaker, I also have to say, moments of silence are incredibly  important to remember those who have been taken from us, but faith  without work is dead. If we don't work to end gun violence, our  children will suffer the same fate.                            ____________________
