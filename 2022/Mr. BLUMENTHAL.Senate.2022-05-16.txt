 Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the  University of Connecticut School of Law as it celebrates 100 years of  extraordinary legal education.   In 1921, George William Lillard and Caroline Eiermann Lillard founded  the Hartford College of Law to provide Hartford insurance company  employees with a legal education. Among the members of the first  graduating class was Miss J. Agnes Burns, who was the first female  attorney to present to the Connecticut Supreme Court.   The college continued to grow during the 1930s, even amid unstable  economic times. It reached a student body of 100 part-time night  students with three full-time instructors. In September 1933, the  American Bar Association--ABA--approved the college, and the examining  committee of the Connecticut  [[Page S2518]]  Bar Association accredited the institution. The Hartford College of Law  also appointed their first full-time dean, Thomas A. Larremore. Within  the decade, the school amended the charter to organize the college as a  nonprofit educational corporation and added the day division program to  allow for full-time study.   During World War II, when enrollment dropped dramatically, the  University of Connecticut, based in Storrs, CT, agreed to take  responsibility for the Hartford College of Law to prevent it from  closing. The initial lease was for 5 years, and the full title was  conveyed to the university on September 1, 1948, renaming the college  as the University of Connecticut School of Law. The first class at the  newly established school of law was also the first class to have all of  its members pass the State bar.   In 1964, a new home for the law school was opened, with a modern look  designed by the architect of the Storrs campus' renowned Jorgensen  Auditorium, Frederic C. Teich. The West Hartford News called the law  school's new campus reveal a ``most significant event in our state's  history.'' The opening received an entire section in the local  newspaper, including a two-page photo layout and an article praising  the building's lighting and the library's book collection and  technological elements.   With the new building came a 40-percent increase in admissions. Soon,  the new building was overflowing, and by the late 1970s, the ABA  expressed concerns about the facilities meeting accreditation  standards. In June 1978, Governor Ella Grasso signed legislation that  allowed for the purchase and renovation of the then empty Hartford  Seminary campus to accommodate the increased demand for legal  education. The law school remains at that location, housed in a  beautiful campus, with ornate structures befitting a century old,  august institution.   Since its founding, the University of Connecticut School of Law has  grown exponentially in both size and stature. It opened its first  clinic, the Criminal Clinic, in 1969. Further degree programs were also  established: in 1994, its first LLM program, in U.S. legal studies; and  in 2013, the doctor of the science of laws program.   Many illustrious alumni have entered public service, working on  behalf of the State and the Nation. Others have contributed to the  ongoing evolution of the law, especially in areas such as property,  tax, and insurance law. The law school, through its clinics, has  assisted many Connecticut residents who otherwise could not afford  lawyers.   As the former Connecticut Attorney General, I can attest to the fact  that many of the assistant attorneys general, who graduated from the  law school, provided the State with dedicated and insightful legal  representation.   On October 25, 2021, hundreds of students, alumni, faculty, and staff  celebrated Founders' Day, in honor of the Lillards. The event began a  yearlong celebration, which culminates on June 11, 2022, with the  centennial gala.   The University of Connecticut School of Law has had an immeasurable  impact on our State and countless residents. As the school celebrates  its centennial, I applaud its exemplary record of success and  achievement. I hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating the  University of Connecticut School of Law on 100 years of  excellence.                            ____________________
