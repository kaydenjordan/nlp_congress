 Madam Speaker, Monday of last week was liberals' favorite  holiday: Tax Day--which usually serves as an annual reminder of just  how big the government has gotten.   However, instead of paying taxes on only one day of the year,  Americans are being forced to pay an invisible tax every day this year:  inflation--which is a constant reminder of the cost of Big Government  and big deficit spending.   Make no mistake, President Biden's and congressional Democrats'  willingness to borrow trillions of dollars to pay for ever-growing  wasteful government programs has caused record-high inflation. Prices  at the pump and at the grocery store were already skyrocketing well  before Vladimir Putin's evil invasion of Ukraine.   Unfortunately, the Biden administration wants to double down on these  disastrous, inflation-inducing spending bills. His budget proposal  calls for shelling out $73 trillion over the next 10 years and would  only add to the pain we all feel when we reach for our pocketbooks.  Tennesseans can't afford another year of one-party Democratic control  of Government.                            ____________________
