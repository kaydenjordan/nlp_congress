 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Collins) for yielding me the time.   I have been thinking a lot this morning about my growing up in South  Carolina. I still remember as a young man driving in a driving rain  from Charleston, South Carolina, going up to the little town of  Kingstree in Williamsburg County, which I now represent here in this  body.   On that day, Martin Luther King, Jr., was coming to Williamsburg  County to extol the necessity of voting to all of us. I will never  forget his theme that day, ``march to the ballot box.''   It was just a few months after the 1965 Voting Rights Act had been  passed into law, and that law has been renewed time and time again  throughout the years. But several years ago, the Supreme Court took a  look at the law and decided that the formula that had been used in  section 4 should be updated.   This bill, thanks to the work of Terri Sewell from Alabama and Marcia  Fudge from Ohio, we have had 17 hearings around the country, eight by  the Judiciary Committee--I thank Chairman Nadler so much for that--and  nine by Marcia Fudge's committee. We have wrapped all of those findings  into one bill because we are adhering to what Chief Justice Roberts  asked us to do: update the formula.   We have updated the formula. We are putting it on the floor today,  and I do believe that this piece of legislation is deserving of  bipartisan support.   I can remember when this voting rights bill would pass both houses  unanimously. Let's do that today and demonstrate that we are making  this democracy work for all.
