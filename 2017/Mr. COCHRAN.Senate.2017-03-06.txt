 Mr. President, I would like to bring attention to an  important anniversary in the history of the U.S. Senate. Today marks  the 150th anniversary of the creation of the Senate Committee on  Appropriations.   In 1867, the Senate passed a resolution creating a standing committee  on appropriations. The committee was founded to bring greater  discipline to government spending by consolidating the control,  management and oversight of federal expenditures.   The primary role of the Congress in appropriating taxpayer dollars is  explicit in our Constitution. It is an important responsibility and  must not be taken lightly.   The Appropriations Committee has served the American people by  working together to make thoughtful decisions in the allocation of  public funds. It is challenging work. Each year we consider a vast  amount of input from public hearings, expert sources, our fellow  Senators, and our constituents. We do our best to weigh competing  priorities and make responsible recommendations.   The Appropriations Committee faces great pressures as discretionary  spending is increasingly crowded out by mandatory spending and  persistent deficits. It is more important than ever that the  appropriations bills be brought before the Senate for careful  consideration. I hope we can find a way to do that in the coming months  and years.   As we mark the 150th anniversary of the Senate Committee on  Appropriations, I look forward to working with my friend and vice  chairman, the Senator from Vermont. I hope all Senators will work with  us to enact appropriations bills that provide for a strong national  defense and support our country's domestic and international  priorities.
