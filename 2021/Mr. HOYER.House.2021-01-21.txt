 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and Mr. Rogers from  Alabama, the ranking member, for bringing this forward as a bipartisan  effort.   Mr. Speaker, I rise as one of those who opposed the waiver for  General Mattis. People ask me, well, what is the difference? Mr.  Gallagher raised this. You change your mind.   Let me tell you what makes the difference for me, Mr. Speaker. I  think this law is a very relevant law. It is a very important law. It  anticipated, when the Congress passed it, that there would be reasons  for waiver, or it would not have included it. It would have made a  preclusion. It did not do that.   It said under circumstances that the Congress considers, it may be  well be in order to have a waiver. This, I think, is one of those  times.   Very frankly, one of the reasons I voted ``no'' on Mr. Mattis is  because Mr. Trump did not know Mr. Mattis, his outstanding military  service.                                time  1445    General Mattis really didn't know Mr. Trump; and that relationship  did not go well, unfortunately. In my view, General Mattis was a great  tower of strength and independence in leading the Department of  Defense. So I congratulate him for his service, although I participated  in a meeting in the White House in which President Trump was very harsh  in his analysis of General Mattis, which I thought was unfortunate. But  this difference that I see today is a very important one.   What is that difference?   The President of the United States--the Commander in Chief, the  civilian leader--knows General Austin, has worked with General Austin,  and has taken the measure of General Austin, and they have a  relationship, a positive relationship.   In addition to that, of course, the son of the President, Beau Biden,  serving in the military, served with General Austin and took the  measure of the man and his commitment to civilian leadership in the  Armed Forces--a critically important concept for the Secretary of  Defense.   One problem that dictates the speediest possible passage of this bill  is the security situation in which we find ourselves. Always in a  transition the enemy can think you are weak and not able to respond in  an effective way. That is why, traditionally, Mr. Speaker, the  Congresses do, in fact, confirm the Secretary of Defense and the  Secretary of State.   Ms. Avril Haines was just confirmed as the head of the DNI. It is  because we do not want a long period of time between having somebody in  charge in the Defense Department and, in this case, somebody in charge  who obviously knows and agrees with the principles of the President of  the United States.   I am sure he will give good advice and sometimes he will disagree,  but we have a confidence relationship. So very, very important.   This is not a moment for our country to be without a Secretary of  Defense. Secretary-designate Austin is a highly qualified nominee,  spoken to by the bipartisan support that this waiver will garner this  day in the Congress of the United States. Mr. Speaker, he would make  history, of course, as has been pointed out, and not an insubstantial  mark on history.   Secretary-designate Austin is the first African American who will be  Secretary of Defense. At this time, our country is fighting to overcome  the legacy of slavery, segregation, and prejudice, as has been pointed  out by my friend, Mr. Brown, who served as a lieutenant colonel in the  Armed Forces.   Secretary-designate Austin served in Iraq. Forty percent minorities.  What a symbol and a bridge between those of the majority and those of  the minority in our services, which will coalesce and bind together  better the units, which is extraordinarily important.  [[Page H214]]    Secretary-designate Austin served our Nation admirably in uniform and  oversaw the safe and successful drawdown of our troops in Iraq, as has  been pointed out by Representative Khanna. In doing so, he earned the  trust of then-Vice President Biden and Beau Biden.   Because of Secretary-designate Austin's recent military service, he  requires a waiver. But, again, the waiver is included so that the  Congress can make a determination as to whether this is appropriate. I  can't think of a more appropriate Secretary of Defense than somebody  who has great knowledge and confidence of the Commander in Chief. We  ought to take that action without delay.   Mr. Speaker, we must always have a clear delineation between the  military and civilian authorities in this country. I have a picture  hanging on my wall, which is also in the rotunda. I have it in my  office because it is in the Maryland State Senate, the Old Chamber. It  is still in existence, still in the capitol in Annapolis, of George  Washington resigning his commission as Commander in Chief of the  Continental Army. And I always point out to people who come into my  office that the Members of the Continental Congress are seated  notwithstanding their inclination in the presence of this great, iconic  figure was to stand and pay reverence to him. And George Washington  said, ``No, you sit,'' because the civilian government is superior to  the military. What a great lesson George Washington taught us at that  time, which, thank God, has been revered until this time.   I think this appointment is the right appointment. I think it will be  good for America. I think it will be good for the Armed Forces of the  United States of America. I think the President has chosen well.   I urge my colleagues to grant this waiver. This, I would add, is not  confirmation. Our brothers and sisters in the United States Senate will  still have to judge and give advice and consent to this appointment,  but this waiver is a precondition to their considering it on the  merits. I hope that we will give them that.
