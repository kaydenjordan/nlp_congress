 Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Aguilar and Ranking Member  Davis for their work in bringing this bill to the floor.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the National Museum of the  American Latino Act, this bipartisan legislation that would establish a  new museum at the Smithsonian to share the Latino American experience,  not just with the Nation, but with the world, an experience that we  know all too well in my district on the central coast of California, an  experience that has not been told enough, but one this country is  somewhat familiar with, sacrificing so much to come to this country to  give their children better lives, living the American Dream, but by  doing so, contributing so much, not just to their families, but to our  culture, to our economy, and, of course, our communities.   By fighting for security abroad in all American wars, to fighting for  dignity at home in the grape wars, to influencing our arts, our  agriculture, our sciences, and sports, the contributions Latinos have  made to American culture and history are innumerable and must always be  told.   I say this not just because it is deserved; I say this because Latino  history is our history. That is why the Latino experience should be  captured, portrayed, and highlighted in our Nation's museum at the  Smithsonian.   I look forward to voting on this bipartisan bill and watching this  pass on a bipartisan basis.
