 Mr. Speaker, while Republicans continue to fight  amongst themselves, Democrats remain united in working for the American  people.   I rise to applaud the USDA Food and Nutrition Services' efforts to  give more of America's students access to universal free school meals.   A new final rule published by USDA makes more schools eligible for  Federal funds to cover the costs of healthy, nutritious breakfasts and  lunches for all students.   This Federal program, called the Community Eligibility Provision,  eliminates school meal debts, minimizes shame in the lunch line, and  reduces paperwork for school nutrition staff and families.   It will hopefully encourage more States to adopt permanent universal  free school meals as my home State of Massachusetts recently did.   Mr. Speaker, this is a big deal. Thank you to President Biden, Vice  President Harris, Secretary Vilsack, and Deputy Under Secretary Dean  for delivering on commitments coming out of the White House Conference  on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health.   I am thrilled that in the richest country in the world, we are making  progress to ensure that all kids have access to nutritious food as part  of their school day.   Together, we can continue this progress, and together, we can end  hunger now.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Indiana for  yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this rule would bring three measures to the House floor.  First, H.R. 5933, the DETERRENT Act. Democrats and Republicans agree  there ought to be transparency if higher education institutions get  money from foreign countries.   Thankfully, President Biden has worked to improve compliance with  existing laws. Because of that, over $1.5 billion more per year have  been reported publicly under this President than the prior one.   Instead of working together and building on this progress,  Republicans are trying to advance this bill that adds onerous new  reporting requirements, making it harder for our academic institutions  and researchers to remain number one in the world.   The second bill here, H.R. 4468, the Choice in Automobile Retail  Sales Act of 2023, blocks the Environmental Protection Agency's final  authority to finalize a car emissions rule protecting Americans from  motor vehicle pollution.   The message House Republicans are sending here is pretty simple. Yet  again, they are putting polluters over people and picking winners and  losers in our transportation sector.   Over 100 million Americans live in counties with unhealthy air  pollution, with children, the elderly, low-income communities, and  communities of color being disproportionately at risk. Air pollution is  associated with over 100,000 premature deaths in the United States  every single year.   The health impacts of rolling back these standards are bad enough.  Frankly, it is outrageous that this majority continues to actively  fight against innovation and against lower energy costs and against the  private sector making decisions based on what people actually want.   The reality is that EVs are already popular. American demand for EVs  is largely outpacing supply as demand has increased by over 350 percent  in the last few years alone. They are also cheaper to own, decreasing  fuel costs by 50 percent or more, and ongoing technological  advancements are translating to better options for consumers every  year.   I must point out that Republicans oppose our investments in American  EV manufacturing. They are actually advocating for American industry to  stand down. Rather than conceding ground to global adversaries like  China, Democrats want to invest in America's ability to compete and  beat our economic competitors.   For all these reasons and more, H.R. 4468 is a bad bill that denies  Americans immense public health and environmental benefits of the EPA  proposed standards.   Finally, we have H.J. Res. 88, a bill that would block the Biden  administration from implementing a new income-driven repayment plan to  help save borrowers money.   I want people to listen carefully to me. President Biden tried to  create a new plan to reduce people's student loan monthly payments, and  Republicans want to stop him from doing it for no other reason than  they don't care. They literally do not care about this issue.   It seems that Republicans are willing to stop at nothing to prevent  hardworking Americans from getting student loan relief. This is just  another attempt to attack the Biden administration for addressing the  serious financial concerns of low- and middle-income student loan  borrowers.   The best thing about this bill, the only good thing I can say here,  Mr. Speaker, is that it failed to pass the Senate. In other words, this  bill is going nowhere.   Another wasted week for America, Mr. Speaker, courtesy of this  Republican majority. Today, three more bills that do nothing--nothing-- to make life better for anyone.   Republicans want to increase the cost of student loans for workers  and families and make it easier for Big Oil CEOs to pollute our  communities. That is their agenda.   They have been a total and complete failure, the least productive  Congress in history, with the most rules failed in a single year. They  have dragged our country to the brink of default, almost shut down the  government twice, and wasted weeks and weeks fighting about which one  of them should be Speaker.   Bill after bill, amendment after amendment to ban abortion and attack  LGBTQ people, and now they want to impeach the President when even  their own Members say there is no ``there'' there. They are doing a  lousy job, and it shows. The only good news is that they are not going  to be in the majority after this next election.   Mr. Speaker, I will be voting ``no'' on this rule, ``no'' on the  underlying bills, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon), a distinguished member of the Rules  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will  offer an amendment to the rule to provide consideration of a resolution  which clearly states that this House will keep our promise to American  seniors and workers to protect and preserve Social Security and  Medicare against any cuts to these crucial programs.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record the  text of my amendment, along with any extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, it is important that my colleagues vote  ``yes'' on the vote to defeat the previous question because my  Republican friends have made it clear time and time again that they are  going after Social Security. The benefit cuts are on the table. They  have repeatedly made that clear.   It is important that this House speak with one voice, or at least the  majority speak, that we reject Republican attempts to renege on our  promise to our senior citizens and that we make it clear that we will  not stand for any cuts to this important program.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. Menendez) to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New Mexico (Ms. Leger Fernandez), who is a distinguished member of the  Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from New Mexico.    Mr. Speaker, I would remind the gentleman who just  yelled at us that his party is in charge.   He is talking about jamming things down the throats of Democrats and  the Senate and the White House, as if somehow that is a way to get  anything done for the American people.   He talks about standing up.   What did they do when we were on the verge of shutting the government  down? They didn't stand up. Democrats had to stand up and save the day.   Mr. Speaker, I do agree with one thing the gentleman said when he  came to the floor. He shouted: One thing--I want my Republican  colleagues to tell me one thing. Tell me one thing that I can go back  and campaign on and say that we did; one material, meaningful,  significant thing that the Republican majority has done.   The bottom line is, he is right. The Republican majority of this  House has done nothing to help the American people.   It is a disgrace. It is political malpractice.   The bills that we are debating here today, they are making it sound  like, oh, if we pass these bills, once the ink dries, this is the law.  These bills are going nowhere. These bills are going nowhere.   I mean, what they do is tell you about values. I mean, the  gentlewoman from Indiana mentioned in her opening remarks that student  loan forgiveness is not fair because not everybody goes to college.   Think about that--not fair?   By her logic, public high schools aren't fair, public middle schools  aren't fair, public elementary schools aren't fair.   My kids aren't in middle or high school anymore, but I am proud that  my tax dollars pay for other people's kids to get an education. That is  how it should work. It helps make us more competitive. It strengthens  our country when our students are the best educated in the world. It is  the right thing to do.   The bottom line is that Republicans seem to think that education is  just not a good idea, that somehow we don't benefit from a well- educated workforce.   They are wrong. They are wrong.   Democrats have a different view. We believe education is important,  and we ought to support it. We believe more Americans having a good  education helps everyone. We believe more Americans with college  degrees uplifts our whole economy, not just those who go to college.   So if my colleagues oppose student loan forgiveness because it isn't  fair--that is what they say--I guess they just want to get rid of our  whole public education system. I know some of them do. I hear them bash  public education every chance they get, but I think most people think  that is nuts.   So, again, we have an opportunity to do something, to do something  meaningful to help people, and these are the bills we bring to the  floor. I guess they are filler. I don't know, maybe they make good  posts on social media for the Republican base, but this is a complete  waste of time.   So the gentleman from Texas was right when he said, name one thing,  one thing that Republicans have done. The bottom line is he couldn't,  and nobody came to help him out because my friends on the other side  have done nothing.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, these bills are so impactful that the demand to speak is  so underwhelming that I am the only one left.   Mr. Speaker, with just one week left before we finish our official  business for this year, these are the three measures that House  Republican leadership has decided that we should focus on:  [[Page H6127]]    A bill to overcorrect a problem in a way that would hinder U.S.  global research; a bill to limit consumer choice, promote pollution,  and hurt America's economic leadership; and a bill that attacks the  Biden administration for addressing the serious financial concerns of  low- and middle-income student loan borrowers.   That is it. That is it.   Now they want to go home for the holidays instead of addressing--I  don't know--anything that matters.   I will repeat again, they have done nothing, nothing, nothing in this  Congress that helps people. It almost feels like Groundhog Day every  time we come to the floor.   We have considered multiple bills to roll back environmental rules  and protections, multiple bills that promote the far right's bizarre  culture wars, multiple bills that would help Republicans' greedy  corporate friends and billionaire donors, instead of everyday people. A  rule is taken down one day, and we are trying to elect a new Speaker  the next. We have votes on measures to destroy, deflect, and distract  but not to fix any of the very real problems that our constituents  face.   We are on an extreme MAGA merry-go-round. To be honest, Mr. Speaker,  I want to get off this ride, and so do the people I represent. They are  sick and tired of this. As we have all year, House Democrats continue  to extend the hand of partnership. We will try to find common ground so  we can lower costs and grow the middle class.   The American people deserve a Congress that can put people over  politics and meet their urgent needs. They are not getting that with  this Republican majority. As I said before, you guys are doing a lousy  job, and it shows. The only good news is that I believe after the next  election you will no longer be in the majority.   I hear from Democrats, I hear from Independents, I hear from  Republicans all the time about their disappointment with the failure of  this Congress to address any of the real concerns that they have.   Everything is a sound bite. Everything is a gotcha vote. Everything  is an appeal to the most extreme rightwing of the rightwing.   Enough. Enough.   Mr. Speaker, I hope my friends will reconsider their priorities and  actually start focusing in on things that the American people care  about.   I urge a strong ``no'' vote on this rule, a ``no'' vote on the  underlying bills, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
