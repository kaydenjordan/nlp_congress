 Mr. Speaker, our thoughts and prayers will continue for  the folks who are in harm's way with the hurricane coming ashore. I am  grateful for all of those who are serving, State, Federal, and local  officials, trying to keep people safe. They will continue to be in our  thoughts and prayers.   I am very grateful that President Trump hasn't waited. They  mobilized. They have got Federal folks on the ground ready to go.   I am also glad it got downgraded to some extent, but it is still  going to be a rough go for folks, their homes, and their goods. So we  will continue to remember them. I am grateful for those first  responders out there ready to serve.   We just remembered 9/11 this week. Those of us who were old enough to  know what happened that day will never forget what happened. We will  never forget where we were.   I will never forget the next day, September 12. In my hometown of  Tyler, just like in hundreds of thousands of towns and cities around  the country, people came together and we prayed together. We sang hymns  together. We held hands and sang together. It was a powerful day.   And I will always remember there were people from all different  races, ages, both genders, people of all walks of life, but we gathered  there in solidarity. What I noticed that day was that there were no  hyphenated Americans. We were just Americans. That is what everybody  said, and that is what everybody was.   It was an incredible day that an act of sheer hatred, evil, wanting  to destroy freedom and the freest country with the best founding  document that would allow freedom, they wanted it all destroyed. But  there was a lot of love that next day. It is unfortunate that, 17 years  later, we don't see that kind of harmony.   It used to be that, in this body, we would disagree, but, as the  House rules require, we wouldn't call into question any other elected  official's motivation, intentions. We would say we all want is what is  best for the country. We all want to keep our oath to the Constitution.   But it appears that some don't want to follow those rules anymore. In  fact, some of the very people who have been in this room, in the  Senate, here in Washington, in front of the press around the country,  people who have demanded that the Federal Government get involved and  stop bullying at all levels, including threatening, harassing little  children in elementary school because the Federal Government felt like  it had to intervene and prevent bullies even at such an early age, yet  some of those same people who have been calling for Federal  intervention to stop bullying have become the biggest bullies in the  United States of America.    It is unbelievable how people would be encouraged by elected  officials to bully, harass people with whom they disagree. If you can  find them in public anywhere, intimidate, scream at them, run them out.  Don't let them eat. Don't let them do anything. Don't let them shop.  Bully them until you drive them out and you intimidate them so much  that they are afraid to express  [[Page H8257]]  their political opinion or to continue to work in a Republican  administration or as a Republican in the House. It is just  unbelievable. It has, clearly, incited people to go out and commit  bullying and sometimes physical assaults.   But you also look at some of the other things that have gone on:  people who are completely disloyal to the President for whom they work  will go to the extent of committing crimes because they don't like the  President, even to the extent of, as a former judge, what I would call  committing a fraud upon the FISA court. That is the way it appeared to  me.   The FISA judges granted four different warrants to surveil people in  the Trump campaign and administration, one of whom, Rod Rosenstein, I  have asked him if he even read the applications and affidavits. He  never would answer the question, which, as we know from Watergate days,  that is a nondenial denial. Clearly, when they would not admit that  Rosenstein had read the application, he said: I didn't know how things  work.   Well, I know how they are supposed to work. If you come before a  judge and you sign a document in an effort to get that judge to  encroach on the constitutional rights of American citizens, you better  know what you are doing. Rosenstein defrauded the court. But the reason  they possibly did not defraud the court is if the court was engaged in  fraud itself.   The only reason I would raise that is because the FISA judges who  were granting warrants based on false information, incomplete  information, misleading information, it is possibly because they were  okay with helping to use the color of the law to violate American  citizens' rights.   Maybe there is a 1983 civil rights action there against judges and  those who participated. Who knows. I can't help but wonder about the  integrity of judges who are not upset that lawyers came in from the  Justice Department and manipulated them into signing a warrant four  times when it should never have been signed once.   Then we find out this guy, Halper, who is supposed to have identified  Mike Flynn and the relationship with Russians, it turns out he had  gotten contracts from the Defense Department--I think one was over  $600,000, another over $400,000--and it was flagged by a very  dedicated, devoted employee of the Defense Department whose job it was  to analyze contracts to make sure they were legitimate and people were  doing what they were supposed to. His name is Adam Lovinger.   He saw those contracts and thought: This is very strange, two  contracts worth over a million dollars to one person and there doesn't  appear to be anything that he is getting.   Well, he was being paid by the Federal Government to set up somebody  in the Trump campaign as someone who had been dealing with Russians,  who had been paying Russians to come speak at his conferences or  seminars, who had an ongoing relationship with Russians, so he would  later say: Gee, this guy from the Trump campaign was getting too cozy  with the Russians, so I quit.   You mean the guys that you had this ongoing relationship with and  paid them to come and speak at your conferences, you were concerned  about someone from the Trump administration or who worked with Trump in  the campaign actually speaking to the people you have been hiring for a  number of years?                                time  1730    It is just fraudulent what they were doing. Incredible. And I had  hoped, when Christopher Wray took over at the FBI--well, I don't really  know him--but maybe he'll help clean up the disaster that was created  by the weaponization of the Department of Justice, and particularly the  FBI, by Comey, McCabe, Strzok, Page, so many of those--Bruce Ohr--who  were working at DOJ or FBI.   But we got a solid piece of evidence that Christopher Wray is not the  answer; he is part of the problem. And that came as was reported in  this story Wednesday, August 29, 2018. As the headline from Newsmax  says: ``FBI: No Evidence Clinton Server Hacked Despite Trump Tweet.''   Well, Christopher Wray had to approve that, and either he is  completely, objectively incompetent or he intended to slap the  President with a fraud by omission and also to slap--figuratively  speaking--our Intel community.   It wasn't the FBI that found that Hillary Clinton's server had been  hacked and that over 30,000 of her emails--all but 4, and the 4 really  didn't amount to anything--all went to a foreign country's intelligence  apparatus. They had hacked it, put instructions on there.   So then, we know that because the Intel community has made--they knew  with 100 percent certainty that that had happened. They found it. They  found the anomaly. They found the embedded instruction that was placed  when her server was hacked.   And I know there have been allegations that perhaps Hillary Clinton's  classified information that went through the unclassified private  server may have gotten some of our undercover people killed in China. I  don't know if that is what got them killed or not, but it certainly  wouldn't have helped.   Nonetheless, the Intel community inspector general, who back then was  Chuck McCullough, and Investigator Frank Rucker are the ones who found  that. And I haven't talked to Mr. Coats, but this was a slap at the  Intel community, basically saying, Hey, we at the FBI didn't find any  evidence her private server was hacked, so anybody who says they did is  just totally wrong because, if the FBI doesn't find it, nobody in the  Intel community of the United States is competent enough to find such a  hacking.   Well, Chris Wray and whoever fed him this statement to put out  publicly were wrong. Our Intel community was good enough. They did find  that her private server was hacked. And the emails did not go to Russia  or any representatives or agency affiliated with Russia. Richard  Pollock wrote that he had confirmed that it went to China. I didn't say  that when I questioned Mr. Strzok, but that has been reported.   If Mr. Wray is going to continue in his efforts to slap-- fraudulently, really--at the President and our Intel community, he  really ought to just voluntarily step down.   The FBI has had so many thousands and thousands of honest, ethical,  upright FBI agents, because I have known many. And they need somebody  who will help the FBI get its reputation back. When the current FBI  director engages in this kind of fraud by omission, then he is not the  answer; he is trying to salvage a great reputation that has been  destroyed during the Obama administration, and he is not going to get  it back by misrepresentations, by omissions.   Hopefully he'll do the right thing and let us get somebody to replace  him soon who will clean things up. In the meantime, that is a little  scary.   Now, I also had noted an article I had never noticed before and a  friend pointed it out. I had never heard of this. I had to go back and  look. A New York publication by Chris Smith, October 20 of 2003. The  byline under it says: ``Mr. Comey goes to Washington.'' Byline says:  ``Just as his terrorism and corporate-corruption cases here are heating  up''--apparently in New York--``United States Attorney James Comey is  heading south to become John Ashcroft's deputy. What's a nice,  nonpartisan prosecutor going to do in a Justice Department like that?''   Well, it doesn't sound like they were big fans of John Ashcroft, who  is really a fine, dedicated, upstanding individual. He must have been  feeling a little bit giddy. He is going to be the deputy, Department of  Justice. And so he said far more than was good for his reputation.   It says, in the fourth paragraph: ``Comey has been savaged by William  Safire and lauded by Chuck Schumer; just what kind of Republican is he,  anyway? This sets Comey howling again.''   Then the quote from Comey. He says: ``I must be doing something  right. In college, I was left of center, and through a gradual process  I found myself more comfortable with a lot of the ideas and approaches  the Republicans were using.''   The article says: He voted for Carter in 1980, but in 1984, Comey  said: ``I voted for Reagan.'' These are Comey's words: ``I'd moved from  Communist to whatever I am now. I'm not even sure,'' Comey says, ``how  to characterize myself politically. Maybe at some point I'll have to  figure it out.''   It says in the article: ``On the surface it's an odd pairing: Comey-- who cites  [[Page H8258]]  liberal theologian Reinhold Niebuhr as a formative influence,'' which  is a little disturbing, ``and who can sing along with Good Charlotte  pop-punk hits--and Ashcroft.''   But anyway, that was interesting. I did not know that Comey had  admitted to being a commie, but Comey the commie is no longer in charge  of the FBI. And it still boggles the mind that Rod Rosenstein would do  a memorandum telling the President: You need to fire Comey. He hasn't  been intellectually honest. You need to fire him. Causes are all here.   So the President relies on Rosenstein and fires Comey; and then,  what, the next day Rosenstein turns around and says: Oh, well, there is  cause to appoint a special counsel to investigate the President for  supposedly obstruction of justice for firing Comey, because the  President followed Rosenstein's recommendation.    The mere fact that Rosenstein would appoint a special counsel to  investigate the President for doing what Rosenstein said should have  been enough to get him fired back then. What kind of manipulative  little demon would say, ``Fire Comey,'' and then the advice is followed  and then he appoints a prosecutor to try to disrupt him and remove him  from office.   I mean, it is like some kind of game: Oh, I know. I will set up the  President. I will tell him to fire Comey, and then we can use that to  investigate him for the rest of his time as President.   Well, hopefully--and I have been hoping for a long time that  Rosenstein's days are numbered. Of course, he was the U.S. attorney who  was in charge of the investigation investigating Russia and their  illegal efforts to obtain American uranium. He would also be the same  person, along with FBI Director Mueller and a guy named Weissmann, who  is currently working for Mueller, who made sure that their undercover  guy who was gathering information to show how illegally Russia was  acting, make sure he signs a nondisclosure agreement.   They threaten him, we are told, that he either sign the nondisclosure  or they would prosecute him. So he signs it. Because they did not want  anybody talking about how illegally Russia was acting because, if they  had, then the committee that had to approve foreign investments in the  United States, CFIUS, they could not have voted to allow Russia to get  a hold of 20 or so percent of American uranium. And if they were not  allowed to get hold of that much uranium, then, of course, there would  not have been the $145 million or so that went into the Clinton  Foundation.   Then we get this reporter from FOX News: ``John Kerry slammed for  `shameful' shadow diplomacy after admitting to meetings with Iran.''   Now, I think there is a word for it, but when someone goes and tries  to undermine the United States President's administration from  protecting the country, America, from the biggest supporter of  terrorism in the world, I don't know what you would call that, but it  seems like, if you have a President, in President Trump, trying to  protect America from terrorist attacks that would be funded by the  biggest supporter of terrorism in the world, Iran, and you have  somebody else from America go over and try to save the deal that was  going to help Iran be more of a threat to America--gee, that seems like  people used to get prosecuted about things like that.   Seemed like there was somebody named Rosenstein or Rosenberg back  there that was not a help to the United States. I think back then they  were hanging traitors. But, in any event, interesting.   Also yesterday, committee chair Richard Burr from North Carolina, who  has bent over backwards, done everything he can to get Justice and  Intelligence to produce any kind of evidence whatsoever showing Trump  or his administration colluded with the Russians, he comes out  yesterday and says the panel has found ``no hard evidence of  collusion'' between the Trump campaign and Russia.   So it is just amazing. It sounds like we still need a housecleaning  at the FBI at the very top.   And this out today from the New York Post that Strzok and Page texts  are a disaster and embarrassment to the FBI, DOJ.   And it has this tweet from the President: ``More text messages  between former FBI employees Peter Strzok and Lisa Page are a disaster  and embarrassment to the FBI and DOJ.   ``This should never have happened, but we are learning more and more  by the hour. `Others were leaking like mad' in order to get the  President.''                                time  1745    ``In the lengthy exchange, the two ex-lovers talk about a leak  operation for `political' purposes.   `` `Oh, remind me to tell you tomorrow about the Times doing a story  about the RNC hacks,' Page wrote to Strzok, who replied, `And more than  they already did? I told you Quinn told me they pulling out all the  stops on some story . . . '   `` `Quinn' could be referring to Richard Quinn, chief of the Media  and Investigative Publicity Section in the FBI's Office of Public  Affairs. . . .   ``Strzok then texted Page, `Think our sisters have begun leaking like  mad. Scorned and worried, and political, they're kicking into  overdrive.'   ``It's unclear,'' the story says, ``whom he was referring to as  `sisters,' but retired FBI Special Agent John Iannarelli told Fox it  could be another government agency.   ``Earlier this week, a report from Rep. Mark Meadows . . . a member  of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said a new  Strzok-Page text from April 2017 showed them discussing a `media leak  strategy'.''   So this is serious stuff. And, apparently, we don't have somebody at  the top of the FBI who will get this cleaned up. There are plenty of  FBI agents across the country that could get things cleaned up. We know  there is at least one here in Washington, D.C., that is good at  coverups, but most of the rank-and-file FBI agents are classy,  honorable, decent, upright investigators who honor their oath every  day, and, who, I keep hearing from different times, different places,  are really upset with the damage that the people like Comey, Strzok,  Page, Ohr, the damage they have done to their reputation for what used  to be a sterling FBI.   So it is time to clean house. Rosenstein has got to go. Chris Wray  needs to be replaced by somebody that is not going to try to keep  slapping the President when he is wrong about the FBI.   Hopefully, we are going to see that come in the next few weeks. We  will see.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
