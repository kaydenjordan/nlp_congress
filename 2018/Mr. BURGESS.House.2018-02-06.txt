 Mr. Speaker, we are here today considering a continuing  resolution that will provide dollars for the Federal Government and our  national defense, but it also will finally accomplish reauthorization  of funding for several important healthcare programs. These extensions  are long overdue, and I urge Members to support this legislation so  that our Nation's healthcare providers will have stability to continue  their normal operations.   The House passed many of these provisions last November. That is when  we passed the Championing Healthy Kids Act. However, since House  passage, the legislation has been stalled without action in the Senate.  Fortunately, the Children's Health Insurance Program was reauthorized  in the last continuing resolution. It seems like a long time ago, but  it was only 3 weeks ago. However, we did not complete the public health  or Medicare extenders. The continuing resolution that we are debating  today includes funding for other important healthcare programs, such as  community health centers, the National Health Service Corps, and  Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education, all of which expired  at the end of September.                                time  1530    The continuing resolution provides a 2-year extension of funding for  federally qualified health centers. One in 13 individuals nationwide  relies upon a community health center to receive necessary healthcare  services. The Community Health Center Fund plays an important role in  supplementing the services that the federally qualified health centers  are able to deliver to underserved communities by providing care to all  Americans, regardless of their income or their ability to pay.   The legislation we are considering also includes a 2-year extension  of other important public health programs, including funding for the  National Health Service Corps, the Family-to-Family Information  Centers, the Personal Responsibility Education Program, the Special  Diabetes Program for Type 1 Diabetes, and the Special Diabetes Program  for American Indians.   The package also delays the $5 billion in cuts to many hospitals in  many of our districts across the country from the Affordable Care Act- mandated Medicaid disproportionate share hospital reductions for the  fiscal years 2018 and 2019. I am certain that other Members have heard  from their hospitals, as have I; hospitals in our districts whose  ability to remain open and operational and continue to provide care  could be jeopardized by these cuts in the so-called DSH payments.   This delays but does not fix a problem that ObamaCare created for  safety net hospitals that provide care to citizens of our country who  most need this care. The committee is committed to continuing to work  on this, but this 2-year extension is important.   The bill also includes important Medicare extenders. The extension of  the ground ambulance services and cost reporting requirements will  allow our emergency responders in urban, rural, and superrural areas  another 5 years of certainty in receiving their add-on payments.   Similarly, home health providers will receive a 5-year extension of  their rural add-on Medicare payments, and certain low-volume hospitals  will continue to receive the payment adjustment for an additional 2  years.   This health extenders package permanently repeals a provision in the  Balanced Budget Act of 1997. This provision sought to cap Medicare- covered outpatient therapy services, physical therapy, occupational  therapy, and speech-language pathology. The cap was never fully put  into effect, but repealing the therapy caps will allow for certainty  and stability for Medicare beneficiaries and providers of these  services. Many of us have heard about the importance of repealing the  cap.   One of my priorities as chairman of the Health Subcommittee has been  to improve the value of our electronic health records for doctors and  for patients. Electronic health records have promise to streamline the  sharing of data amongst patients and their doctors, but they have not  yet fully lived up to this promise.   Adoption of electronic health records is growing, but the meaningful  use program, as established in the Health Information Technology for  Economic and Clinical Health Act, has burdened providers with stringent  requirements. In an effort to reduce that burden, this bill we are  considering today removes the mandate that the Secretary of Health and  Human Services make the meaningful use standards more stringent over  time.   I believe we have squeezed all the blood we can out of this turnip,  and it is time to let our doctors be doctors. This will permit the  Department to evaluate in other ways.   Lastly, this package contains important provisions that aim to  improve care for individuals suffering from chronic diseases. The  Senate has already passed these provisions in their CHRONIC Care Act.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    One of the most important pieces of this package is the  extension of the Independence At Home Medical Practice Demonstration  Program, which allows participating high-need Medicare beneficiaries  who have multiple chronic conditions to receive Medicare coverage for  home-based primary care. This program is currently in its fifth year  and has been found to save Medicare dollars, but Medicare needs more  time to evaluate the overall effectiveness of the program.   This health extenders package has responsible offsets. One of these  offsets would allow for Medicare reimbursement of outpatient physical  therapy or occupational therapy services provided by a therapy  assistant. These providers are reimbursed at 85 percent of the  physician rate, and therapy assistants must have a State license and  abide by Medicare supervision requirements.   Additionally, lottery winnings and other lump sum income of over  $80,000 would count toward income eligibility under Medicaid's modified  adjusted gross income rules. In certain cases, individuals could remain  eligible if being ineligible would lead to undue medical or financial  hardship.   Similar to the Championing Healthy Kids Act, this bill modifies the  level of funding in the Prevention and Public  [[Page H825]]  Health Fund. By law, this fund is required to receive $2.5 billion in  annual appropriations, which must be used for prevention, wellness, and  public health initiatives administered by the Department of Health and  Human Services.   If Congress does not direct the funds toward specific efforts, the  Secretary of Health and Human Services has the authority to spend the  dollars however he or she deems fit. While we are redirecting these  taxpayer dollars, the overarching purpose of the fund is still there to  improve the health and wellness of Americans through existing  mechanisms, and community health centers will do just that. With this  spending offset, we are using the Prevention and Public Health Fund for  what is intended: investing in America's well-being.
