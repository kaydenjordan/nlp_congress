 Mr. Speaker, last year, 16-year-old Julia Ruelle of  Minnetonka, Minnesota, started having headaches and exhaustion. A  sophomore at Minnetonka High School, she was diagnosed with a very rare  brain tumor.   Julia grew up loving the outdoors, and as she began her treatment,  she would often think about the Boundary Waters Canoe Area where her  family vacationed for years.   Today, Julia is recovering and is back to outdoor physical activity.  She recently won an essay contest on why the Boundary Waters are so  important and why it matters to her--winning a prize of a parent-free  weekend canoeing in the Boundary Waters wilderness.   Julia, looking strong and healthy, just visited my office last month  to advocate for protecting the Boundary Waters. She is a brave girl,  and she is a perfect example of what this national treasure means to  Minnesota and what it means to our country.   I include in the Record a copy of her essay.               2018 Boundary Waters Canoe Area Essay Contest             (Winning Essay by Julia Ruelle, Minnetonka, Minn.)         It's the start of the school year: everyone is sullen for       being forced to sit still all day and teachers try in vain to       pull us out of our school-induced slumber with a myriad of       get-to-know-you activities. As I fill out yet another form       with questions I am tired of answering, I come to the       question asking me to list my favorite activities. I pause       for a moment, wondering which activities to include this       time: running, cross country skiing, downhill skiing,       sledding, ice skating, kayaking, canoeing, paddle boarding,       camping, gardening, walking, hiking, biking, hammocking, or       exploring. As a shortcut and  [[Page H6100]]       with a melancholy glance at the sun shining through the       window, I settle with writing, ``being outside''.        Though such get-to-know-you forms are rarely very honest,       one fact always holds true to me: I love being outside. In       the summer, a typical day usually starts with running with       the cross country team as the sun rises, paddling with a       friend in the afternoon, and an evening walk with Rio, our       faithful seven year old rescue dog, around a small lake of       the over 10,000 our state is known for. For the past 5 years,       Rio and my family have been lucky to have a change in scenery       to the beautiful, pristine Boundary Waters Canoe Area       Wilderness for about four days each summer. These days are       when I feel most connected to my soul and surroundings and       most at home, with no social media or material concerns to       distract me from the purity of the air in my lungs, dirt       beneath my feet, and the sounds of birds, water, and all       things natural in my ears. My love for these lands has caused       me to be involved with the Campaign to Save the Boundary       Waters movement, regularly donating and wearing the logo on       shirts, stickers, and pins as frequently as possible. All my       classmates know of this passion of mine, as I take any       opportunity to educate my peers about the threat the proposed       Twin Metals mine poses to the pristine waters so unique to       the Boundary Waters and the many watersheds it affects.        Though Jerry Vandiver, a country singer with an album or       two about the Boundary Waters area, sings that ``winter is       for . . . pull[ing] out the map'' and ``plan[ning] a new       route'' while keeping close to the warmth of the fireplace,       to me, the snow and sub-zero temperatures of Minnesota       winters make venturing outside even more exciting! I joined       the cross country ski team last year and immediately       regretted not having tried it earlier. Skiing taught me to       love winter and pray for more snow, instead of begrudging it.       Though I grew up loving to ice skate at the park across the       street, learning to ski ignited a desire to be outside       everyday, even when the cold was biting.        Unfortunately, this winter has been a little different.       Around Thanksgiving, I started experiencing exhaustion,       headaches, and nausea at rates I had never before had to       withstand. As doctors didn't perceive any viruses to be       concerned about, we wrote it off as migraines and I continued       to participate in life as usual, going to school and ski       practices everyday. However, after trying to fight through it       for two weeks, I ended up in Urgent Care one night and       scheduled an appointment with my doctor three days later.       During those three days, I slept pretty much all day and       barely ate, thanks to debilitating headaches and nausea.       Arriving at the doctor's appointment, I threw up in the       waiting room and the nurses deemed my low body temperature       and slow heart rate alarming enough to rush me to the       emergency room in an ambulance. At the end of that day, they       still didn't have any answers as to what was causing it all.       However, the next day, my doctor suggested getting an MRI and       I squeezed into their last slot of the day. Halfway through       the MRI, my parents were rushed into a special room and my       doctors got in contact with the radiologist and a       neurologist. All in all, the verdict was that there was a       mass in my brain causing pressure build up, also known as       hydrocephalus. I required an endoscopic third       ventriculostomy, which is essentially a tube put into my head       to allow the fluids to flow, and a biopsy to find out what it       was. So there I was, getting brain surgery, which is       definitely not the curveball most expect during sophomore       year. The biopsy revealed that I had a rare brain tumor       called a germinoma, luckily with a high cure rate. Obviously,       this has changed my life completely and kept me from doing       most normal teen things. But, the worst part was not being       allowed to run, ski, skate, or do anything that had the       potential of making me fall until the surgeons deemed me       ready. Still, I made it my priority to be outside at least       once a day, usually taking short walks. Getting outside even       when I felt unable to do most other things has been a type of       therapy for me. Breathing fresh air and feeling the cold on       my face refreshed me and made me feel better, at least for a       little while, every time.        After six weeks of limited activity, the Friday I got the       OK to do any activity I wished began the best weekend since       the diagnosis. In the afternoon, I went snowshoeing on a       trail through the cattails. At night, I ice skated with       friends. The next morning, I cross country skied on a frozen       creek. On Sunday, I ran for the first time since the       diagnosis and though it was incredibly slow-paced, the       feeling of fighting through the burn and completing an entire       loop of my go-to trail can only be understood by those who       have experienced the phenomenon of a runner's high. Better       yet was the soreness that almost kept me from making it down       the stairs Monday morning. I had been sore many times due to       the chemotherapy, but this pain was something I had caused       myself by working hard and, in a weird way, made me very       proud of myself.        Reading the announcement of this essay contest in the paper       this Thursday, I could hardly withhold my excitement! I       danced around the house, imagining the essay I would write       and how much fun it would be to share my favorite place with       my friends. Though I am such a lover of the BWCA, most of my       friends have never experienced its hypnotic serenity and I've       always wanted to share it with them, but not wanted to have       to bring my parents along. This contest has the potential of       granting me this wish. In addition, I am lucky to have a       short treatment plan of chemotherapy and radiation that will       be wrapped up in early May with no physical restrictions.       This enables me to be perfectly ready for a summer trip to       the greatest place on Earth with my closest friends.        As I reviewed the details of the contest, I found something       additional that links me to this mission: Joseph [one of the       contest judges]. Hi! I read that you were diagnosed with       leukemia at 13 years old and I imagine you and I share many       similar experiences. Other than just the typical cancer       similarities, I wonder if you share the experience of growing       a little sick of your parents. I know, it might seem       impossible to them, but after being surrounded and worried       about almost exclusively by my parents for the last couple       months, I'm very ready to escape their concern for a little       while. Of course, I have always and will always love and       appreciate them for their constant love and support, but       distance makes the heart grow fonder, right? My desire to       spend a couple days deep in the wilderness, sharing unique       experiences with my closest friends, has increased greatly in       the last couple months.        As a long-time lover of the outdoors and the Boundary       Waters and a recent parent-escape hopeful, I would cherish       this opportunity to navigate the lakes and portages I'm so       fond of with my friends. I know my dreams will soon be filled       with mornings looking out over the water, long days of       paddling, dinners laughing beside the campfire, and nights       sleeping with only a tent between me and a sky full of stars.       I pray these dreams will be made a reality.                            ____________________
