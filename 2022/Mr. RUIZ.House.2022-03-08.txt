 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of Dr.  Paul Farmer, a visionary in global health, crusader for health equity,  and accomplished physician with an unparalleled passion for social  justice.   Dr. Farmer was my mentor, my professor, and my friend. He was  completely selfless, and his relentless dedication to those less  fortunate inspired me and helped shape me into who I am today.   His story begins in North Adams, Massachusetts, in 1959. He spent his  childhood there and later in Tampa, Florida, where he was raised in an  old school bus that his father had converted into a mobile home.   Encouraged by his parents, Dr. Farmer developed a strong interest in  the  [[Page H1336]]  world around him at an early age. His intellect and incredible work  ethic led him to excel in school and eventually to win a full  scholarship to Duke University. It was there, at Duke, where his  passion for service took root.   After graduating, he traveled to Haiti, where he worked in public  health clinics before pursuing his medical degree and doctorate in  anthropology from Harvard University.   In 1987, Dr. Farmer cofounded what would become his legacy, Partners  In Health, whose mission is to bring modern medical science and high- quality care to those most in need and serve as an antidote to despair.  Its banner has always been ``pragmatic solidarity'' in the fight for  health and social justice.   Dr. Farmer also used his gifts to shape young minds and the next  generation of providers. He served as chief of the Division of Global  Health Equity at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and chair of  the Department of Global Health and Social Medicine at Harvard Medical  School.   It was there, at Harvard Medical School, where our paths crossed in  what proved to be one of the biggest blessings in my life. As my mentor  and professor, Dr. Farmer embraced me, trained me, taught me, and  encouraged me in all that I did.   In short, I blossomed under his guidance. I was empowered under his  wings. He taught me to channel that very same passion that I had as a  student-activist into fighting for social justice with my medical  training.   I remember one day in the class when he told us all: All of you are  now part of the elite. The mere fact that you are sitting here at  Harvard Medical School will make you an elite.    As someone who grew up in a trailer park and was the first generation  of my family to graduate from high school, I immediately resisted that.  No way. No way. Not me. How dare he say that?   Now, I won't say what I was thinking in that moment, but ever the  mind reader, Dr. Farmer looked me in the eyes and said: ``Yes, you,  too, Raul.''   His point was that now that we are at Harvard Medical School, we need  to own that. We need to use our Harvard medical training and research  skills for the poor and give them the best care always. It was then  that I understood the opportunity that I had to make a difference and  serve those suffering from inequities with the care I would provide as  a doctor.   I spent many years under his wing, learning from him and training  with him to provide humanitarian aid and care. It was in the classroom  at Harvard, in the rainforests of Chiapas, Mexico, and in the aftermath  of the earthquake in Haiti that I learned from Paul the powerful act of  accompaniment. I admired his humility with the people; his fierce  advocacy with the powerful; his selflessness; and the enormous respect  that he showed to all he cared for, regardless of income or education.  He treated everyone as equals and worked to earn their respect.   It is because of him that I stand before you all today, both as a  physician and as a representative of the people.   Dr. Farmer was a great man, a humble servant, and a fierce warrior  for health and justice. I miss him, and I know the world will, too.   In his memory, and in honor of all that he has done and achieved, I  ask for all present to join me in a moment of silence.                            ____________________
