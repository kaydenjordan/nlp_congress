 Mr. Speaker, over the past two decades, I have traveled  to Colombia more than a dozen times. On each trip, I have had the  privilege of meeting human rights defenders and social leaders.   In cities, towns, and remote rural areas, these brave men, women, and  young people have confronted violence all their lives, and they and  their communities are targeted by illegal armed groups--paramilitaries,  guerrillas, and criminal organizations. They have been targets of the  Colombian military and too often harassed and under illegal  surveillance by the state. Simply for speaking on behalf of others,  organizing to meet basic needs, or carrying out the duties of their  profession--teacher, doctor, farmer, lawyer, journalist, and pastor-- they are threatened, assaulted, and murdered.   During my last trip to Colombia, I spent a few days in the mountains  of northern Cauca. I met with indigenous leaders defending their right  to ancestral lands. I met with Afro-Colombian leaders creating small  enterprises to support their families and their children. I met with  demobilized FARC soldiers hoping to build a new life and future. I met  with campesino farmers determined to stop growing coca and move into  the legal economy.   We sat together, and we ate together. They shared their plans and  they shared their dreams with me. They dream of a Colombia at peace and  a Colombia that values all of its people, including those who have  struggled to survive in Colombia's most violent rural areas.   Brave, generous, intelligent, creative, vulnerable, and humble, these  leaders literally have bet their lives on the peace accord being fully  implemented. They are counting on the peace accord to deliver the  protection, economic development, truth, and justice it promised.   But the Colombian state has abandoned them, just as it has throughout  all Colombia's history. The state has failed to put in place the  individual and community-based protections demanded by the peace  accord. The state has failed to dismantle the criminal networks and  armed actors who daily threaten the lives of social leaders. The state  has failed to identify and prosecute those who finance, profit by, and  order the murders and violence aimed at human rights defenders and  social leaders. Even worse, the Colombian state has chosen to remain  absent from large parts of the country, failing to establish state  presence, basic services, and leaving local leaders defenseless.   Since the peace accord was signed, over 500 rights defenders have  been murdered, according to the United Nations human rights  representative. Colombia's own ombudsman reports even higher numbers,  documenting more than 700 murders during that same period, and  nongovernmental organizations place the total even higher.   Rather than seeing this grim reality as a call to action, the  government of President Ivan Duque has tried to obscure the number of  murder victims. His government defends all the promises it has made on  paper without changing by one iota the reality on the ground. It acts  as if these murders and threats were some kind of public relations  crisis, a battle over statistics and optics.   But it is not a PR problem. It is lives on the line. Economists have  written books on the importance of human capital in the development of  a prosperous economy. Lack of political will to prevent these murders  and protect these local leaders is literally bleeding Colombia of the  very human capital it needs to consolidate peace and create a more  prosperous and dynamic future.    Two weeks ago, Human Rights Watch issued a report on the murders of  Colombia's social leaders and human rights defenders. It outlines  practical actions and reforms the Colombian federal, state, and  municipal governments could take to prevent, reduce, and even stop the  murders and violence. Sadly, these recommendations were met with  indifference, by hostility, or rejected out of hand. They were treated  more like bad press than a serious attempt to offer help and provide a  road map to interrupt the spiral of violence.   That is why I am calling on the Biden administration to make the  protection of human rights defenders and social leaders one of  America's highest priorities in its relationship with Colombia. The  Biden administration and Congress should review the Human Rights Watch  report and determine how U.S. policy and aid can advance the full  implementation of the peace accord, support its protective and justice  mechanisms, and help fulfill its promises of economic development in  neglected areas.   I call upon my colleagues to stand up for peace, for human rights,  and for an end to the violence against human rights defenders and  social leaders in Colombia. These courageous social leaders deserve  nothing less than America's full and unconditional support.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania,  a distinguished member of the Rules Committee, for yielding me the  time; and I want to thank her for her eloquent opening.   Mr. Speaker, we are just weeks away from the 53rd anniversary of  Martin Luther King, Jr.'s famous speech at the National Cathedral. That  is when he uttered the powerful line, ``The moral arc of the universe  is long, but it bends towards justice.''   In many ways, those words are as misconstrued as they are well-known,  because some have taken them to mean that if you just wait long enough,  justice is inevitable. Dr. King knew better, though. He knew that for  the moral arc to bend, people needed to be courageous enough to  actually bend it.   Just 6 years after this line was spoken, Members of this Chamber  showed that courage when they introduced the original Equality Act.  They did so in the shadow of the Stonewall riots, at a time when even  discussing LGBTQ issues publicly was seen by many as taboo.   These Members recognized the fundamental unfairness in a patchwork of  State laws being used to deny some Americans fundamental rights like  jobs and homes, just because of who they were or who they loved.                                time  1400    They had the backbone to act, giving a voice in these hallowed Halls  to the many advocates nationwide fighting for equality from the  outside.   Getting to this point has been a long, long, long road, and I am a  proud cosponsor of the Equality Act that is before us today, and I have  pushed for this day for a long time. I know this hasn't been easy. So  many people and so many organizations, though, never wavered. And along  the way, they changed hearts and minds on this issue.   What may have been a radical idea then is not now. In fact, most  people today not only support such protections for LGBTQ Americans,  they incorrectly believe that they are already in place. That is how  common sense this bill is, Mr. Speaker.   This House made history when it passed the Equality Act for the first  time last Congress, and we did so in a bipartisan way. Unfortunately,  it didn't even get a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate, and the  prior Republican President didn't support it. But now we have new  leadership in the Senate and a President who has made passing this bill  a top priority.   This moment represents our best chance yet to finally make the  Equality Act the law of the land. This moment, Mr. Speaker, is an  opportunity to bend the moral arc toward justice, toward fairness, and  toward equality, and I encourage all of my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle to seize it.   Let's support this rule and the underlying bill, and let's take a  historic step forward toward building a more fair and just society for  all Americans.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I have some good news for the gentlewoman who just spoke. The  reconciliation bill that is coming to the floor, hopefully, on Friday  will have a whole bunch of resources in it to help States safely reopen  schools. So I hope we will get a good bipartisan vote on that.
