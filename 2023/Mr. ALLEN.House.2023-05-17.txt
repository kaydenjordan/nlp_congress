 Mr. Speaker, President Biden's radical open border agenda  has resulted in the worst border crisis in our Nation's history.   Since taking office, this administration's policies have led to over  5 million encounters at our southern border; more than 1.3 million  illegal immigrants have evaded apprehension; and CBP has seized over  38,000 pounds of fentanyl. Yet, President Biden would have you believe  that the border is secure.   Exacerbating an already dire situation, in just the first 72 hours  since title 42 ended, over 14,000 illegal aliens were apprehended.   Title 42 was vital in curbing illegal immigration, allowing for swift  deportation of anyone crossing our border illegally.   While the administration continues to ignore this crisis, House  Republicans have taken immediate action. I was proud to support H.R. 2,  the Secure the Border Act, which passed the House last week. H.R. 2  upholds Republicans' commitment to a nation that is safe and a border  that is secure by restarting construction of the border wall,  increasing Border Patrol agents,  [[Page H2385]]  strengthening the asylum process, and much more.   The White House kept asking us, asking Congress, when are you going  to pass legislation to address illegal immigration? Well, folks, the  House passed it, H.R. 2. We have taken action. It is the most  comprehensive immigration bill passed out of the House in over 40  years.   Democrats and President Biden need to wake up and obey the law, the  current law. Constituents back home ask me, how is this happening? We  have laws on the books.   In other words, if you enter this country illegally, even if you  prove asylum, you have to show up for a court date. Those court dates  are some 5 to 10 years down the road now, but you have to show up for  that court date. If you don't get the asylum ruling, you have to return  to your home country for 10 years before you can enter this country  legally again.   These are laws that are on the books right now. In other words, you  have to remain at the border and await that court date. Putting people  out into this country and giving them free healthcare and other  assistance is not in accordance with the current laws on the books.   I will finish with this: Border security is national security. The  President is the Commander in Chief. Let's fix this problem.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of our law  enforcement in the 12th District of Georgia. This is National Police  Week. Not just this week but every week, the Members of this body  should honor the often unsung heroes tasked with keeping our  communities safe every day.   Unfortunately, many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  have called to defund the police and promoted antipolice rhetoric that  has resulted in a violent crime wave across the country, and in many  cases against our brave law enforcement officers.   House Republicans proudly support law and order and stand with law  enforcement nationwide. That is why our conference has dedicated this  week to passing prolaw enforcement legislation, including a bill to  make the assault of a police officer a deportable offense if you are in  the country illegally, and more.   Madam Speaker, God's word gets it right. The greatest love that you  can offer is to give up your life for another. We must always support  our brave men and women in uniform. Those who have put their lives on  the line for the safety of others should never be demonized; they  should be honored. My Republican colleagues and I will never stop  backing the blue.                            ____________________
