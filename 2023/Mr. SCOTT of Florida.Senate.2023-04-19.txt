 I call up my amendment No. 81 and ask that it  be reported by number.    Madam President, we must do more to support  firefighters, which--I support this bill. However, as we all know, we  are in a very tough financial situation. Families are struggling. We  are over $31 trillion in debt.   I have a very simple amendment. It would transfer all remaining  unobligated State and local COVID funds to offset a portion of the cost  of the Fire Grants and Safety Act.   I urge all my colleagues to support this amendment.    Madam President, I appreciate what my colleague  has said. Let's remember that President Biden declared the COVID  emergency over. These are unobligated dollars. We do have $31.5  trillion in debt. I think the right thing to do is pass this  [[Page S1239]]  bill with this amendment to support our firefighters.   I urge my colleagues to all vote for this amendment.                           Vote on Amendment No. 81
