 Mr. President, I want to begin today with a short update  on the debt ceiling. Over the past few days, we have made good progress  on this issue, and I am optimistic that we will be able to prevent the  awful prospect of the U.S. defaulting on its sovereign debt for the  first time ever. Nobody wants to see the United States default on its  debts.   As Secretary Yellen has warned, a default could eviscerate everything  we have done to recover from the COVID crisis. We don't want to see  that and I don't believe we will see that and I continue to thank all  of my colleagues for cooperating in good faith to preserve the full  faith and credit of the United States.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.
