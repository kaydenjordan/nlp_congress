 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the career of  a friend, public servant, and caring educator: Grand Valley State  University President Thomas J. Haas.   As a retired U.S. Coast Guard captain who also holds a Ph.D.,  President Haas has devoted his life of service to our country and, most  recently, to west Michigan and the students of Grand Valley State  University.   Having been appointed the university's fourth president in 2006, he  successfully laid a foundation for a culture that nurtures innovation  and excellence. Under his leadership, enrollment has soared to over  25,000 students, while 46 undergraduate and graduate programs have also  been added and the university expanded with 2.5 million square feet of  new buildings.   ``T. Haas,'' as he is affectionately called by students, and his  wife, Marcia, will forever be cherished and adored by the Grand Valley  community. Together, they have passionately dedicated themselves to  putting students first.   The now-famous selfie with T. Haas, as it is known, it is a clear  example of the way they treated every student like their own.   President Haas is the epitome of the phrase ``Laker for a Lifetime.''  It has been an honor to work with him in support of Grand Valley, its  students, and all of west Michigan.   While his time as president may be coming to an end, his legacy and  impact will forever live on.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Zeldin).
