 Madam Speaker, on August 4, a mass murderer opened fire  on innocent civilians in Dayton, Ohio's historic Oregon District.  Hundreds of people were present in the street, restaurants, and bars in  this two-block area that is less than 5 minutes from my home.   The killer wore body armor and a mask and carried over 200 bullets.  Armed with a reconfigured weapon, he fired almost 50 bullets in 32  seconds. In that time, he killed nine people and wounded 27.   Later, we heard a familiar story. People who knew him had feared that  this man was a danger. He had told people that he wanted to be a mass  shooter. However, he passed a background check in the purchase of his  weapon.   My daughter told me of the courage of the police officers at the  scene. She heard the first shots, turned and looked, and watched the  officers, unflinching, run immediately toward the gunshots. Within 32  seconds of the shooter opening fire, Dayton Police took down the  shooter.   Let me be clear: The officers didn't receive the call in 32 seconds.  The officers didn't show up in 32 seconds. They killed him in 32  seconds.   Even with the Dayton Police officers' incredible heroism, nine  innocent civilians were killed, and 27 were wounded by the shooter's  gunfire. He was armed with a magazine of 100 bullets and had another  magazine with him. If he had not been stopped, the death toll could  have been unimaginable.   When the President came to Dayton, he congratulated the police  officers on their training. Sergeant Knight responded, ``Sir, you can't  train courage.''   Today, Sergeant Knight and these courageous Dayton officers received  the Medal of Valor at the White House: Officer Jeremy Campbell, Officer  Vincent Carter, Officer David Denlinger, Officer Ryan Nabel, and  Officer Brian Rolfes.   Their bravery and quick action saved hundreds of people's lives,  including my own daughter. They are here with us today and joined by  Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley. Please join me in thanking them.   Now, Madam Speaker, we need to show the courage of these police  officers. Let's work together to pass bipartisan bills that actually  have a likelihood of becoming law and that will make our country safer.   The forthcoming debate will be about our values, American values and  human values. How could we get to a place where people are routinely  killing innocent people whom they do not know?   The debate must also be about mental health, how to identify those  who are a threat, remove their ability to do harm, and get help for  those who need it. This debate will be about violence in our culture  and the virtual world that so many of these killers have spent  countless hours training in. The American public rightfully demands  that this debate will include a conversation about guns.   As we pause for a moment of silence to think of those who were lost  in Dayton, Ohio, let's think of all of those who have been lost in mass  shootings, their families, and our obligations to them.   I am going to ask that our moment of silence lasts for 32 seconds so  that as this body thinks of those whom we have lost, the horrific  understanding of how quickly the passing of 32 seconds occurs and that,  within that time, nine people were murdered, and 27 people were  injured.   My fellow colleague from Ohio, Joyce Beatty, knows the family of one  of the victims. I have asked her to read the names of each of those  killed before I ask Members to join me in 32 seconds of silence in  honor of them.    I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio.    Madam Speaker, I now ask that Members and guests in the  House rise for 32 seconds of silence.                            ____________________
