 Mr. Chairman, two weeks ago, the Armed Services  Committee advanced the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2018 to the House floor with broad bipartisan support. I would  like to thank Chairman Thornberry and Ranking Member Smith for their  work in developing this year's bill.   I would also like to thank Congressman Turner, chairman of the  Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee, of which I am the ranking  member, for his leadership and spirit of bipartisanship this year.   This year's bill includes investments to fill genuine readiness needs  and funding that is critical to ensuring that our men and women in  uniform have the best cutting-edge resources and best equipment  possible to keep them safe when defending our Nation.   I was encouraged that the bill we have passed out of committee  directs the Defense Department to provide specific updates and reports  on a number of programs and platforms so that we can robustly conduct  our oversight responsibility on behalf of the American people.   However, as we consider the bill on the floor today and in the coming  days, I remain concerned about how we fund these needs. Substantial  budget increases for the Department of Defense at the expense of other  vital national programs undermines investments in our national  competitiveness and the future of our country and, I believe, makes us  less secure over the long term.   Providing our men and women in uniform with the resources they need  to carry out their mission is one of our most solemn obligations, but  we must also fund these resources responsibly in order to safeguard our  economic vitality and our national security.
