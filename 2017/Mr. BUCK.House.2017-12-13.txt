 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call  up House Resolution 658 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 658         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 1638) to require the Secretary of the Treasury       to submit a report to the appropriate congressional       committees on the estimated total assets under direct or       indirect control by certain senior Iranian leaders and other       figures, and for other purposes. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Financial Services. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a       substitute recommended by the Committee on Financial Services       now printed in the bill, it shall be in order to consider as       an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the five-      minute rule an amendment in the nature of a substitute       consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115-47. That       amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered       as read. All points of order against that amendment in the       nature of a substitute are waived. No amendment to that       amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be in order       except those printed in part A of the report of the Committee       on Rules accompanying this resolution. Each such amendment       may be offered only in the order printed in the report, may       be offered only by a Member designated in the report, shall       be considered as read, shall be debatable for the time       specified in the report equally divided and controlled by the       proponent and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment,       and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the       question in the House or in the Committee of the Whole. All       points of order against such amendments are waived. At the       conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the       Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with       such amendments as may have been adopted. Any Member may       demand a separate vote in the House on any amendment adopted       in the Committee of the Whole to the bill or to the amendment       in the nature of a substitute made in order as original text.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 4324) to       require the Secretary of the Treasury to make certifications       with respect to United States and foreign financial       institutions' aircraft-related transactions involving Iran,       and for other purposes. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. In lieu of the       amendment recommended by the Committee on Financial Services       now printed in the bill, an amendment in the nature of a       substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print       115-48 shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended,       shall be considered as read. All points of order against       provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as       amended, and on any further amendment thereto, to final       passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of       debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Financial       Services; (2) the further amendment printed in part B of the       report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution, if offered by the Member designated in the       report, which shall be in order without intervention of any       point of order, shall be considered as read, shall be       separately debatable for the time specified in the report       equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an       opponent, and shall not be subject to a demand for a division       of the question; and (3) one motion to recommit with or       without instructions.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Colorado is recognized  for 1 hour.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the  underlying legislation.   This rule provides for consideration of two bills dealing with Iran  and its continued support of international terrorism. In addition, the  rule makes in order all submitted amendments.   These bills were the subject of hearings in the Financial Services  Committee and were marked up and reported favorably to the House. Both  [[Page H9855]]  bills received bipartisan support in the committee, and I would expect  that we will see significant bipartisan support on the House floor.   Mr. Speaker, it is no secret that Iran's leaders have a threat to our  way of life. We don't have to look any further than Iranian support for  lethal attacks on U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, particularly  through IEDs, to witness Iran's hostility toward us. Going back several  decades, Iran has routinely terrorized the Middle East and has sought  to export terror worldwide.   Iran's numerous threats to annihilate our friend and ally, Israel,  are a steady drumbeat that should continuously remind us of Iran's  threat.   In 2001, the Ayatollah Khamenei is quoted as saying: ``It is the  mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran to erase Israel from the map of  the region.''   In 2002, a leader of Hezbollah, which is a known extension of the  Iranian regime, said: ``If Jews all gather in Israel, it will save us  the trouble of going after them worldwide.''   But lest we think these are the views of the past, the Ayatollah was  quoted in 2014 saying that ``this . . . regime of Israel . . . has no  cure but to be annihilated.''   And we could go on. The evidence of Iran's intent on the destruction  of Israel is nearly endless. Just yesterday, the commander of Iran's  revolutionary guards offered to support Palestinians if they choose to  stage an armed uprising to take by force Israel's newly recognized  capital: Jerusalem.   Any country whose leaders actively support terrorism against Israel  and whose leaders take an official position that the nation of Israel  should be eliminated from the Earth are, and always must be, a sworn  enemy of the United States.   But it is not just Israel. Other Middle Eastern allies in the United  States have been the target of Iran's hostility as well. Namely, Saudi  Arabia has been increasingly threatened by the Iranian regime.   In 2011, our FBI and DEA agents successfully disrupted a plot by Iran  to assassinate the Saudi Arabian Ambassador to the U.S. here in  Washington, D.C. The uncovered plot included bombing a restaurant in  D.C. at which the Saudi Arabian Ambassador was planning to eat. The  bombing would almost certainly have killed innocent Americans as well.   The list could go on.   Iran has fomented unrest in Iraq, has sought to subject Sunni Muslims  to Shiite militias, has supplied the Syrian regime in its years-long  civil war, has supported Hezbollah and Hamas, has flagrantly  disregarded international law by building a nuclear program, and has  taunted the United States.                                time  1230    Who can forget the image of U.S. Navy sailors, hands behind their  heads, forced to kneel under gunpoint on an Iranian military vessel? Or  the thinly veiled attacks on U.S. troops in Iraq using proxy militant  groups? Or the numerous incidents in the Persian Gulf involving  harassment of the U.S. Navy?   Yet, against this backdrop, the United States entered into an  agreement with Iran. The agreement, commonly referred to as the ``Iran  deal,'' was opposed by a bipartisan majority in the House. It relaxed  sanctions on Iran, opened channels for business investment, and allowed  Iran a pathway forward on a nuclear bomb.   Further, while having the impact of a treaty between two nations, the  Obama administration chose to call the agreement by another name and,  in so doing, bypassed the United States Senate. This political  commitment by President Obama to Iran is the reason for these two bills  today.   The first bill, H.R. 1638, the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency  Act, targets the finances of Iran's ruling class. Its goal is  threefold: One, aid U.S. authorities in their efforts to eliminate  money laundering by the Iranian regime; two, expose the sectors of the  Iranian economy that are controlled by Iran's rulers; and three, show  the Iranian people how their corrupt government accumulates wealth for  itself at the expense of the people.   The Iran deal removes sanctions on many of the known corrupt  government entities. This bill will provide the transparency necessary  to reveal the level of corruption within Iran and to inform Congress  and others about how to combat the flow of money to terrorists. It  further exposes the ruling class by publishing this information in the  most common languages spoken within Iran.   The second bill that will be considered under this rule is H.R. 4324,  the Strengthening Oversight of Iran's Access to Finance Act. This bill  will instruct the Treasury Department to report on transactions of  financial institutions related to the export of aircraft to Iran.   Under the Iran deal, President Obama removed restrictions on the sale  of American aircraft to Iran. In 2016, the Treasury Department  authorized the export of more than 200 aircraft to Iran Air, Iran's  state-owned air carrier. Yet we know that Iran Air has been the  transporter of choice for Iran's revolutionary guards as they have  ferried weapons systems around the Middle East.   The absurdity of this deal to increase the revolutionary guards'  capacity to move weapons is self-evident. The bill before us today will  require certification by financiers of the aircraft exportation deals  that none of the aircraft exported will be used for terrorism or Iran's  weapons of mass destruction program.   Due to Iran Air's continued role in transporting materials used for  terrorism, this is one step that we should take to help hold lending  institutions accountable for their support of aircraft exports to Iran.   Mr. Speaker, many of us in Congress know how bad the Iran deal was  for our security and our allies' security. That is why there was  bipartisan opposition to the deal last Congress. While in the end we  were unsuccessful in prevailing upon the administration to abandon its  bad idea, we should continue to stand in the gap against Iran's ongoing  efforts to undermine peace in the Middle East and destroy our friends  and, ultimately, the United States.   Today, we have two bills that will help our ongoing efforts to thwart  Iran's terrorist ambitions. I urge my colleagues to support this rule  and these bills.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, we have two witnesses on their way. We started  a little bit early. I reserve the balance of time.    Mr. Speaker, we have two witnesses on their way. We started  a little bit early. I reserve the balance of time.    Mr. Speaker, at this point, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, at this point, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), the former chair of the Foreign Affairs  Committee.   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Colorado  (Mr. Buck) for the time.   I want to thank Chairman Hensarling because these bills that we are  combining today came out of his committee. I want to thank him for his  leadership in bringing these important bills before us today.   I rise in support of H.R. 1638, the Iranian Leadership Asset  Transparency Act. I want to thank my good friend from Maine, Bruce  Poliquin, for his  [[Page H9857]]  work in authoring this bill. It is a critical step, a necessary step in  holding the Iranian regime accountable for its money laundering, for  its terror financing, and other wide-ranging criminal activities.   The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, known by its initials, its  acronym, IRGC, has long been at the heart of the Iranian criminal  enterprise, controlling the better part of Iran's economy in key  sectors like oil, gas, telecommunications, and transportation.   The IRGC's business empire and monopoly of these economic sectors  provides the regime with billions of dollars that it uses to do what?  To feed the people, to clothe the people, to educate the children?   No. To repress the Iranian people and to export the terror that it  has done so much damage in throughout the world, and its hateful  ideology abroad.   Two years ago, I held a hearing of our Subcommittee on the Middle  East and North Africa, where we explored the role of the IRGC and,  again, that is the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. We looked at the  role of the IRGC in Iran's economy and we raised these very concerns,  Mr. Speaker.   So I want to thank Chairman Hensarling for his leadership on this  issue and his consistent efforts to hold Iran accountable, because that  is what we are trying to do, hold these terrorists accountable.   This is one of the many issues where the Financial Services and the  Foreign Affairs Committees have done a great job of working together to  implement targeted sanctions against the Iranian regime for its illicit  activity.   For years, our Treasury Department has been working to identify and  to sanction IRGC leaders. They have shell companies. We have been  looking at what these shell companies are. Let's identify and let's  sanction them. Their proxies. Let's designate and warn foreign  companies about the risk of doing business with the IRGC's connected  entities. As fast as the IRGC can create new ones, we shut them down,  new ones pop up.   Unfortunately, the misguided JCPOA has made the Treasury's job even  harder, with the IRGC collecting billions from their financial windfall  created by new outside investments in the very sectors previously  targeted by our sanctions.   So it is important now more than ever that the Treasury publicizes  the assets controlled by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the  rest of Iran's corrupt leadership for two reasons, Mr. Speaker.   First, so that the long-suffering people of Iran, with whom we have  no problem--we want to help the people of Iran so that these people  have a window into the regime's pervasive theft and corruption that  deprives them of the most basic of commodities.   Second, so that businesses stop funneling cash into these criminal  enterprises that are financing terror throughout the world.   This bill will help shine a necessary light on these nefarious  actions of Iran both inside and outside of the country, and I urge its  swift passage.    Mr. Speaker, I have two more speakers. I yield 5 minutes to  the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Poliquin), a member of the Subcommittee  on Terrorism and Illicit Finance.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Maine.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Maine.    Mr. Speaker, I would just ask, how much time is remaining?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Colorado has 13\1/2\  minutes remaining. The gentleman from Florida has 17\1/2\ minutes  remaining.  [[Page H9858]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Williams), the vice chairman of the Subcommittee on Monetary  Policy and Trade.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, as my family and I sit around the dinner table, my wife,  Perry, and my two children, we talk politics, not surprisingly, and  there are times where we distinguish good from bad, and we know that  Iran is an enemy of the good in this world. It terrorizes the Middle  East. It seeks to eliminate Israel. It pursues the destruction of the  United States. And yet, for some reason, the prior administration  struck a deal with the Iranian regime, the same regime that has  American blood on its hands. The two bills before us today begin the  difficult work of once again ensuring Iran is stopped in its pursuit of  weapons of mass destruction and in its support of terrorism.   I thank Chairman Hensarling for bringing these bills forward and for  my colleagues from the Financial Services Committee who have joined me  on the floor today to make the case for this effort. I thank Chairman  Sessions for his leadership on the Rules Committee and for providing  the debate on this issue today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the rule,  supporting the underlying bills, and putting pressure on Iran to  abandon terror and embrace peace.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 658 Offered by Mr. Hastings         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       3440) to authorize the cancellation of removal and adjustment       of status of certain individuals who are long-term United       States residents and who entered the United States as       children and for other purposes. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 3440.  [[Page H9859]]                                          ____         The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous  question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.
