 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the more than  130 million Americans with preexisting conditions who are under attack  from the Trump administration.   Some of these people have chronic health conditions such as asthma  and diabetes. Some are waging courageous fights against cancer. Some  are tackling challenges with mental health or substance abuse. These  are our family and friends. They are our neighbors, our coworkers, our  caregivers. They are us.   Sadly, if the administration has its way, they will once more be  subjected to discrimination that could deprive them of coverage,  condemn them to a lifetime's worth of staggering medical bills, and  push their families into devastating bankruptcy.   One of my constituents in Highland Park who found coverage through  the ACA wrote me:         My preexisting condition is not a result of my lifestyle       choices, as some like to believe. I don't deserve to be       demonized and financially thrashed just because of something       I cannot control.    I agree. Seventy percent of the public also support making sure  people with preexisting conditions have protections. I urge the Trump  administration to abandon its legal effort to undermine the ACA. Enough  with the sabotage.   We owe it to these 130 million people to do better. Instead of  building barriers to healthcare, let's work together and improve our  healthcare system.                            ____________________
