 Mr. President, today I recognize Austin Eggl, an  intern in my Aberdeen, SD, office, for all of the hard work he has done  for me, my staff, and the State of South Dakota over the past several  weeks.   Austin is a graduate of Bishop Ryan High School, in Minot, ND.  Currently, he is attending Presentation College in Aberdeen, SD, where  he is majoring in business. He is a hard worker who has been dedicated  to getting the most out of his internship experience.   I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Austin for all of the  fine work he has done and wish him continued success in the years to  come.                            ____________________
