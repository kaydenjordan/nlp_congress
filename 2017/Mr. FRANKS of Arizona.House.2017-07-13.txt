 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of subtitle H of title XII, add the following       new section:       SEC. 12_. STRATEGIC ASSESSMENTS OF THE USE OF VIOLENT OR                     UNORTHODOX ISLAMIC RELIGIOUS DOCTRINE TO                     SUPPORT EXTREMIST OR TERRORIST MESSAGING AND                     JUSTIFICATION.         (a) In General.--Not later than one year after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall       conduct two concurrent strategic assessments of the use of       violent or unorthodox Islamic religious doctrine to support       extremist or terrorist messaging and justification and submit       the results of the assessments to the appropriate       congressional committees. These concurrent assessments shall       be carried out by the following:        (1) A team of United States government employees, from       relevant departments and agencies with appropriate background       and expertise to contribute to such an assessment.        (2) A team of non-governmental experts from academia,       industry, or other entities not currently a part of the       United States Government, with appropriate background and       expertise to contribute to such an assessment.        (b) Elements.--The assessments required under subsection       (a) shall include the following elements:        (1) Identification of major or significant identifiable       Islamic religious doctrines, concepts, or schools of thought       used by various extremist groups for specific purposes, such       as recruitment, radicalization, financing, or propaganda.        (2) How key elements of these doctrines, concepts, or       schools of thought are incorporated into extremist or       terrorist messaging and justification.        (3) Identification of major or significant identifiable       Islamic religious doctrines, concepts, or schools of thought       that can be used to counter the threads identified in       paragraphs (1) and (2).        (4) Recommendations for identifying key thought leaders or       proponents for these major or significant identifiable       Islamic religious doctrines, concepts, or schools of thought       in paragraphs (1) through (3).        (5) Recommendations for technological capability, training       improvements, or process developments to speed the       identification of harmful or destabilizing Islamic religious       doctrines, concepts, or schools of thought used by extremist       groups.        (c) Appropriate Congressional Committees Defined.--In this       section, the term ``appropriate congressional committees''       means--        (1) the Committees on Armed Services, Foreign Relations,       Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, and the Select       Committee on Intelligence of the Senate; and        (2) the Committee on Armed Services, Foreign Affairs,       Homeland Security, and the Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence of the House of Representatives.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 440, the gentleman  from Arizona (Mr. Franks) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.    Mr. Chairman, it has been 15 years and 10  months since the attacks on September 11, which killed nearly 3,000  people and wounded nearly 6,000 others.   Since then, America has fought five operations in eight countries,  prosecuting wars against those responsible, their allies, and  sympathizers, and the foundational ideology that fomented it. And 5,400  American heroes have given the last full measure of devotion in service  to their country to combat this vile enemy.   Yet, in spite of all of this, there are those who continue to oppose  any attempts to study the ideological roots of this enemy. Their  zealous commitment not to understand our enemies' motivations would  almost be impressive if it weren't so harmful.   As my friends across the aisle were so eager to point out, this is  not a war which can be won with bombs and bullets alone. Despite the  peerless capability of our warrior class, we cannot kill our way out of  this problem, nor is this a war which can be won by increasing the  State Department's budget for providing ``jobs programs'' for  jihadists.   It has to be noted by even the most intransigent of those who would  oppose my amendment today that so many of the young men who buy into  this destructive movement come from families who are more than  comfortable financially.   Osama bin Laden's family was not going hungry when he declared war on  America, twice. Many of the significant leaders of the various groups  and factions are men with postdoctorate degrees in Islamic studies from  some of those most prestigious universities in the Muslim world.   Yet we are told by countless talking heads and politicians that men  and women who carry out these terrible attacks and cry, Allahu Akbar,  in that moment when they detonate bombs in the midst of the crowds of  innocent men, women, and children, have nothing to do with Islamist  ideology.   Mr. Chairman, to embrace that flagrant fallacy means we will never be  able to address this evil on a strategic level, and our noble men and  women in uniform will be forced to combat it on a tactical level only.   This present struggle against the vast majority of terrorism in the  world is fundamentally one of ideas, and it will be won on the  battlefield in the hearts and minds of human beings.   Mr. Chairman, I know that there are many brands of violent extremism,  and I eagerly would join my colleagues in any effort to combat them  all. If the FBI does not have enough resources to combat neo-Nazis or  White supremacists, then I want to know about that,  [[Page H5810]]  and I want to help. There is no desire in my heart whatsoever to single  out any group of innocent people or denigrate their faith in any way.   However, the reality remains that there is one spectrum of Islamic  ideology whose variants are responsible for the 9/11 attacks, feeling  the insurgency in Iraq, the countless attacks on civilians in Europe,  and the boundless evil of the Islamic State.   In 2017 alone, there have been 1,134 attacks in 49 countries, in  which more than 8,000 people have been killed and 8,000 more were  injured.   Our allies across the world, including in the Muslim world, have now  begun to study and analyze the ideology that foments Islamic terrorism  so they can begin to resist it on a strategic ideological level.   If we in America do not also address this on a strategic level, this  underlying ideology that catalyzes the evil of jihadist terrorism  across the world, then its list of victims will only grow longer.   Mr. Chairman, my amendment will help us to categorize those  perpetrating violence in the name of Islam and help us to identify our  allies within the Muslim world who can assist in countering the Islamic  message of global jihad. Those who would oppose this amendment choose  to continue the status quo, that is to say, no strategy at all.   So, Mr. Chairman, I would just implore the Members of this body to  pass this amendment and join this sincere effort in finally identifying  our enemies, empowering our friends, and ending this evil destructive  ideology once and for all.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair,      The online version has been corrected to read: amendment. Mr.  Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. Chair,    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Mr. Chair, how much time remains on this side?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Arizona has 15 seconds  remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of  the time.   Mr. Chairman, this amendment will empower America to identify those  heroes within the Muslim world who are working so bravely to counter  the odious violent ideology which continues to use Islam to justify the  murder of tens of thousands of innocent men, women, and children. It  will save American lives, it will save Muslim lives, it will save lives  across the world, and I would encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes.''   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Franks).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.
