 Madam Speaker, it is unfortunate that we are here again  today to pass another continuing resolution. I know that the  appropriators on both sides of the aisle want to get a full fiscal year  2022 omnibus done as soon as possible.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank Chairwoman DeLauro for her tireless  efforts to negotiate a bipartisan agreement with the Senate. We have to  pass this CR today because America simply cannot afford a shutdown.   A shutdown would have a disastrous impact on our continuing economic  recovery. It would diminish our ability to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.  And Europe is facing one of the greatest threats since the end of World  War II. Our Federal Government should be sending a strong, unified  message to Vladimir Putin that we stand united with our European  allies.   As chair of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I want to  highlight a critical life, health, and safety provision in this CR for  our brothers and sisters in Hawaii. The fuel leak that occurred at the  Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility in Hawaii last November is nothing  short of an environmental catastrophe, one that has impacted thousands  of residents. This spill should have never happened. Congress will hold  the Department of Defense accountable to make this right.   Today, we provide an additional $350 million for the Department and  the services to continue their efforts to address this crisis.                                time  1600    I want to thank my colleagues from Hawaii for leading on this issue,  especially Representative Case, who also joins and serves with us on  the Appropriations Committee. You will hear from him later, Madam  Speaker.   You have my commitment that our subcommittee will do everything we  can to stay on top of this. The people in Hawaii impacted by the spill  deserve clean drinking water. They deserve to know that their drinking  water will be secure. It is just one more reason to support the CR  today.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  vote ``yes.'' Let's keep the government open and get the full omnibus  across the finish line.    Mr. Speaker, it has been 342 days since the House of  Representatives passed the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. For 11  months, Senate Republicans have filibustered this bill, blocking  meaningful change and accountability to address systemic racism and the  use of excessive force.   One critical reform that can wait no longer is restricting the use of  no-knock warrants. These extreme warrants too often create dangerous  situations for innocent bystanders as well as for suspects and law  enforcement.   That is why the Saint Paul Police Department has not issued a no- knock warrant since 2016. But the Minneapolis Police Department  continues to insist on using these no-knock warrants.   The irresponsible choice that they are making has resulted again in a  death, the killing of Mr. Locke last week, another life cut tragically  short during a no-knock search, a headline that we have become all too  familiar with. That is why we need Federal reforms now.   The House has done its job. The Senate must do its job, stop  stalling, and pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.                            ____________________
