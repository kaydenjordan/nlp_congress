 Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Larson for yielding and,  again, for offering this amendment, which has been part of a number of  initiatives that we have worked on jointly together to deal with this  issue.   Again, for the record, just to clarify what is going on here, a  concrete quarry up in north central Connecticut,  [[Page H6531]]  which had been mining aggregate for foundations in homes, it turned out  there was a material called pyrrhotite, which is an iron sulfide  material that, over time, when it is exposed to moisture, rusts and  cracks in a sickening fashion and results in the total collapse of home  foundations.   The estimate is as high as 19,000 homes have had foundations using  material from this quarry. As the gentleman pointed out, this has also  occurred in western Massachusetts. It goes as far north, actually, as  Three Rivers, Quebec, because it is a strain of pyrrhotite that runs  from Canada down through New England.   This picture shows vividly the damage caused to a home in Coventry,  Connecticut, where the repairs require you to lift the house, clean out  the old foundation, pour a new foundation, and, again, lower the house  back. It costs roughly about $200,000.   We were able to secure a tax ruling from the Treasury Department that  allows individuals like this homeowner in the picture to basically  deduct those losses, which, again, is some relief.   Frankly, there is more that we need to bring to the table. The  gentleman's amendment would allow the Federal regulators that set up  the rules for lending banks and institutions to get some flexibility  for loan-to-value ratio rules that occur when there are natural  disasters.                                time  2000    Again, in Federal natural disasters in places like Florida and Texas,  there is some flexibility to allow homeowners to get a loan perhaps  above the loan-to-value ratios so they can, again, basically conduct  repairs to make their houses habitable again. This amendment will set  up that process.   Secretary Mnuchin, as the gentleman and I know we have met with  personally, would be the Department that would organize this task force  that the amendment contemplates.   Again, it is something which the banking industry in Connecticut and  Massachusetts has expressed a strong interest in basically allowing  some relief for homeowners who, again, have poured their heart and soul  into their homes to be able to recover their losses.   I thank the gentleman for offering this amendment. We had a similar  amendment last night that was adopted by Mr. Calvert. Again, I want to  thank the majority for their understanding on this issue.
