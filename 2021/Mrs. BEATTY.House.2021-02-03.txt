 Mr. Speaker, what I am going to say is for the American  people because, for the past year, American people's lives and  livelihoods have been turned upside down because of the COVID-19  pandemic.   Whether contracting the virus, losing their jobs, working on the  front lines, at the risk of eviction or struggling to keep their  businesses open, many of my constituents--Republican constituents,  Democrat constituents--have been forced to make unimaginable decisions  and sacrifices.   In response, Congress passed the strong bipartisan CARES Act.  However, 10 months later, the virus is still wreaking havoc on our way  of life, in large part due to the failures of the prior administration.   So we are here to right the wrongs, and under the leadership of  Speaker Pelosi and the Biden-Harris administration, we are doing just  that. We must meet the moment and bookend this pandemic with a big,  bold package to ensure workers, families, and small businesses have the  support and resources to break through the dark winter and start the  process to build back better.   Think about this, Mr. Speaker: The budget reconciliation will pave  the way to doing just that.   Who is against extending emergency unemployment? Who is against  providing another round of direct stimulus? Who is against offering  rental assistance to ensure that no family is forced to live on the  streets? Who is against instituting a quicker rollout and production of  vaccines after the disastrous rollout, or lack thereof, by the previous  administration? Who is against expanding funds for child care and  increasing the child tax credit? Who is against giving aid to the very  States that we represent and localities?   So I say to my colleagues: Think about what your constituents have  called for. Think about what they are losing, and let's give our  constituents hope. Let's join together to meet the moment; not for us,  but for the American people, for the economy, and for the future.
