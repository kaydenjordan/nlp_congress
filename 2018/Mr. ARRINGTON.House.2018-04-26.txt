 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman, my colleague,  Democratic colleague, for his comments and his personal testimony, and  I respect his dad and the heritage of work that he left for his son.   I am on the Agriculture Committee, and I have got to say I am  confused, I am perplexed, and, quite frankly, I am outraged in many  ways with some of my colleagues' comments about work and the work  requirements that we are putting in the Food Stamp program. This  doesn't have anything to do about children, about disabled people,  about the elderly. This is about requiring people who are able-bodied  to work who aren't working.   We are long overdue for reforms in this country. We are long overdue  to have policies in place that encourage work. We want people to have  the blessing and dignity of work. We want people to fulfill their God- given potential. We want them to contribute to society.   We have 6 million jobs, surplus jobs. We want folks to make the best  out of the life that God has given them for their communities, for  their families, for themselves.   This is unbelievable in the United States of America. We are asking  that, if you receive assistance from hardworking, taxpaying Americans,  you would just work 20 hours a week or volunteer or be trained to work.  That is all we are asking.   I see hardworking people throughout the gallery, and I bet you they  feel the same way. I have seen the polls. Over 80 percent of the people  in this country say more people need to work and pay taxes and  contribute to this great country.   I believe in the safety net. I believe in compassion. I believe that  is the heart of God, and I think it should be reflected in our  policies. But God also expects personal responsibility, and He expects  us to have responsible policies that pull people up and out of a cycle  of dependency and poverty. That is not compassion; that is not decency;  and that is not common sense.   So I support this farm bill, and I appreciate the tone, I really do,  of my colleague. He is a gentleman, I can tell. I don't even know him,  but I can tell he is a gentleman and a statesman, but I cannot listen  to folks who, in my opinion, are scaring folks in the public and my  colleagues who are on the Agriculture Committee and here in the House  from not voting to make responsible, reasonable, compassionate, and  commonsense reforms to food stamps.   We need to do that in every government assistance program. We need to  pull people out of the welfare trap, and we need to equip them and  encourage them and support them to be the best that they can be.   I don't know how much time I have left, Mr. Speaker, but I want to  also comment on some fellow west Texans who are here in town to compete  for the 2018 National Science Bowl.   This week, Lubbock High School will join select schools across the  country who earned the opportunity to compete at the national finals. I  want to thank the Department of Energy and my fellow Texan, Secretary  Rick Perry, for sponsoring this important competition.   The students from Lubbock competing in this tournament are part of a  national effort to ensure America continues to lead the way in science  and remains the laboratory of innovation in the entire world. That is  the greatness of American innovation.   We want this generation to discover the cure to cancer, to solve the  challenges of cybersecurity, and to push the boundaries of outer space.  [[Page H3586]]    These students' commitment to science is impressive, and I am  confident that their generation will propel us to new heights of  discovery that will improve the quality of life for all humanity.   Congratulations again to Lubbock High School and to all the schools  competing in the tournament.   Go Westerners.   Mr. Speaker, as I conclude, I thank Chairman Conaway and the  leadership of the Ag Committee for providing the safety net so that we  can feed and clothe the American people, so that we can make important  investments in rural infrastructure for sustainable small towns, the  heartbeat of this country, so that we can continue to be the leader in  agriculture innovation and technology development, and so we can make  the compassionate reforms to food stamps.   God bless America.    Mr. Speaker, the Good Book says, ``a righteous man's  prayers availeth much.''   What a prayer, Mr. Crenshaw; what a man; what a great American.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize our guest chaplain and my dear  friend, Mr. Phil Crenshaw.   Mr. Crenshaw's life has taken him across the globe, from serving our  country in World War II to spreading the Gospel of Jesus in places like  Norway, Israel, Russia, and India. At every stop on his journey, Mr.  Crenshaw's mission has always been the same: simply to love God and  serve others.   While stationed in Okinawa, he ministered to marines, soldiers, and  airmen, as well as over 4,000 Japanese POWs, living out God's  commandment not just to love our neighbors, but to love our enemies as  well.   Over the years, following his return from war, Mr. Crenshaw, along  with his late wife, Ruth, to whom he was married for 66 years, opened  up their home and their hearts to more than 50 young people who were in  need of a place to stay, some of them orphans.   At 95, Mr. Crenshaw is the last living chaplain's assistant from  World War II, and he still lives every day to the fullest, serving our  community and serving the Lord with all his body, soul, and strength.   Mr. Crenshaw, your life of personal sacrifice and faithful service to  our country and to the Kingdom of God is an inspiration to all of us.  We are all honored to have you here this day.   God bless you, Mr. Crenshaw; God bless the country you fought for and  served; and, go, West Texas.                            ____________________
