 Mr. President, let me thank my friend from Illinois,  Senator Durbin. There has been no more passionate, effective, strong,  and consistent voice for the Dreamers, for those beautiful, young  people who simply want to become Americans and contribute to America.  He will never let this issue rest, nor will we. We are going to do  everything we can to help the Dreamers. We hope President Trump finally  sees it in his heart to actually get something done. We had a  bipartisan agreement. It could have passed. It had some things we  didn't like, and it had some things the other side didn't like, but  President Trump, in one of the more inept acts in terms of legislating,  blew the whole deal. We are going to keep working.   I thank my colleague from Illinois.                                  Gun Safety    Mr. President, as the Senate debates the banking bill, Americans are  wondering if the Republican majority will ever move to take up the  issue of gun safety. Tomorrow, thousands of students across the  country--awakened students--will participate in a nationwide walkout to  demand action. At 10 a.m. in high schools from one end of America to  the other, students will walk out for 17 minutes in honor of the 17 who  gave their lives at Stoneman Douglas High School, in solidarity. But  they are not going to stop there; they are going to keep working and  working and working until we get something done.  [[Page S1648]]    When the students walk out, what will this Senate, what will this  Congress, what will our Republican friends be able to say? Nothing,  because we will have done nothing in that time to address gun safety in  a meaningful way.   The unfortunate reality is that it seems there is too little courage  in the White House to take on the NRA. After sounding the right notes  when the cameras were on, President Trump has backed away from  everything but the policies to which the NRA gives its rubberstamp  approval.   I am still amazed at this. I believe it was on the issue of age that  the President criticized Senator Toomey at his televised meeting and  told him not to be afraid of the NRA. He said he wasn't.   And what does the President do? He doesn't show one one-hundredth of  the courage that Senator Toomey showed on guns.   Senator Toomey and I don't agree on much, and I would have gone  further than he did in the checks bill that he and Senator Manchin put  together, but he had the courage to buck the NRA.   President Trump, you have no courage to buck the NRA. You talk a good  game, and then, when it comes to action, you are afraid to do  anything--anything--that gets the NRA upset.   The NRA is so far away from where America is. Over 90 percent of  America wants background checks. The NRA and Trump don't. A huge  percentage--over 80 percent of gun owners--want background checks-- comprehensive and universal background checks. President Trump and the  NRA don't. The majority of Americans want protective orders so that if  a family member or a friend or a teacher sees a young person acting  like they are angry or upset and might do damage, their gun could be  temporarily taken away. Most Americans want that. President Trump and  the NRA don't, and neither do our Republican friends. The vast majority  of Americans would like a debate on assault weapons--or certainly the  majority. President Trump, the NRA, and our Republican majority don't.   Mr. President, why don't you retract what you said to Senator Toomey.  Why don't you admit that he had more courage than you? Why don't you  say that you are afraid of the NRA, because that is really what is  going on here. No one is going to be taken in by nice words spoken in  an hour in front of a TV camera when you then back off on anything. Of  course, the plan was released Sunday night. They thought, hopefully,  that it would get no news coverage, but it is still in the news.   Unfortunately, too many Republicans here on the Hill are in the same  boat as President Trump, but not Senator Toomey. They want to appear as  though they are doing something for gun safety but are only willing to  support the smallest bore policies that the NRA gives a green light to.  They say: OK, let's do these small things first; maybe we will do more  later.   We all know the game here. Everyone sees what is going on. My friends  on the other side don't dare support anything that the NRA opposes,  even though the vast majority of Americans want them to. Our friends  hope that we will pass something tiny, something small so that they can  clap their hands and say they did something on gun violence and move  on. The day they want to do something meaningful and real on gun safety  never seems to come.   My friend the Senator from Texas--he is a good friend of mine. We  banter in the gym almost every morning. I have worked with him on a  number of issues. But he comes to the floor every day and says: Let's  do the small Fix NICS bill, and then we will see about other proposals.  He knows as well as I do that Fix NICS is not even close to enough of a  response to the epidemic of gun violence in the country. He knows as  well as I do that the NRA is OK with Fix NICS but not universal  background checks.   Fix NICS only improves reporting within the existing background check  system. The big loopholes that allow so many bad people, felons, and  those adjudicated mentally ill to get guns--the gun show loophole, the  online loophole--are not touched by Fix NICS.   I say to my good friend the senior Senator from Texas, when you are a  doctor and you are sewing up a wound, you don't just do the first  stitch and then walk away and say: We did something. No, you have to do  the real job to cure the injury. I appreciate that my friend from Texas  wants to pass this bill. Democrats support it. I am a cosponsor. But as  a response to the spree of shootings in our schools, on our streets, in  our churches, movie theaters, nightclubs, concerts, and on street  corners every evening, a bill to repair just one tiny little aspect of  the background check system is not sufficient.   A policy or an attitude that says that we cannot offend the NRA on  anything will never, never, never help ameliorate our problem of gun  violence to a sufficient extent.   As my colleague Senator Murphy, Senator Cornyn's coauthor of Fix  NICS, has said: ``If we were to only debate the Fix NICS Act, we would  be slamming the door in the face of all of these kids who are demanding  change.''   He said it perfectly.   Democrats are fighting to make sure that Fix NICS isn't our only  response. I hope and pray that my Republican colleagues will find the  courage to go beyond what the gun lobbyists tell them is OK and work  with Democrats on real and significant gun safety legislation.                                    Trade    Mr. President, now on another matter, this is a happy moment because  many Democrats--certainly I--agree with the Trump administration when  they blocked the proposed bid by the Singapore-based Broadcom to  purchase the San Diego-based Qualcomm, on national security grounds.   Let me say this unequivocally: President Trump and his administration  made the right decision on blocking Broadcom from taking over Qualcomm.   We all know that China has been rapacious about trade and very smart.  They look for places where they can steal our best technology. They  develop it there in China and keep us out of their markets and then try  to flood the world with their products, sometimes dumping them. China  has been rapacious about trade. Frankly, in my opinion, neither the  Bush administration nor the Obama administration did enough. President  Trump has a much better attitude.   One particular area of concern is how frequently foreign companies  have sought controlling stakes in cutting-edge technology companies  like Qualcomm. Qualcomm has done a great job, and they are leading the  world in developing the 5G system. We need to preserve that as  Americans because it has both economic and national security concerns.   As China seeks dominance in the semiconductor and wireless  industries, the United States must be wary of attempts to acquire U.S.  leaders in these industries. As to a foreign-controlled Broadcom, I  don't know what the links are between Broadcom and China. I suspect  there may be some, but China could move to take it over and, poof, the  dominance that we would seek in 5G technology developed here would go  away. It is a national security concern and an economic security  concern.   We Democrats believe that the CFIUS model should extend not just to  national security but to economic security. When China attempts to  steal our best technology by buying American companies--whether it is  robotics, AI, or chips on Qualcomm--we ought to block it.   China doesn't play fair. Lifetime President Xi hopes to dominate in  the crown jewel of America's industries--the tech industries and  others, where we dominate because we have been so good because we have  taken immigrants, Mr. President, from around the world, and they helped  develop these great things. We have to be wary of China--wary of China.  To his credit, President Trump is more wary of China than the last five  or six administrations, and I am glad he is. I am glad his  administration is. It is just almost too late, but it is not yet.   It is no secret that President Trump and I share similar feelings on  the issue of trade, particularly when it concerns China. I have often  been critical of this administration--like I have been of previous  administrations--when it fails to follow through on the President's  rhetoric or misdirects its policies.   The recent steel and aluminum tariffs are an example of how the  administration has the right instincts but bad  [[Page S1649]]  execution. If properly calibrated, tariffs could be an effective tool  to rein in China. China certainly dumps and has sought dominance in the  steel and aluminum industries. Instead of targeting heavily subsidized  Chinese steel and aluminum, the President has put in place across-the- board tariffs that would hurt many of our domestic industries. There  was an article today about a Missouri ball bearing company that doesn't  know where it is going to get its steel from. It hurts allies like  Canada.   Canada makes its own steel and aluminum. We have a trade surplus with  Canada. Putting Canada in the same boat as China is a huge mistake.  That is why these tariffs--and I support the thrust of them--should  have been more carefully targeted.   In contrast, the action on Qualcomm is targeted and effective in  terms of protecting U.S. industry, and I urge the Trump administration  to do more of these things. They will fill a hole that previous  administrations failed to fill.                             Russia Investigation    Mr. President, finally, on Russia, we all know that the Republican  majority on the House Intelligence Committee has ended its  investigation into foreign interference in the 2016 elections. The  House Republican majority on the Intelligence Committee has so  discredited itself.   The report makes several assertions that are contradicted by already  well-known facts. It says that Russia had no preference for Donald  Trump in the 2016 elections. Remember, it is not just the intelligence  community's assessment that the Russians were trying to elect Trump,  but an independent grand jury--nonpolitical--in the special counsel's  investigation concluded the same thing on the basis of evidence  independently acquired and presented by the special counsel. By saying  they disagree with the intelligence community's assessment that Russia  interfered in the 2016 election to help Trump, Speaker Ryan and  Chairman Nunes are closer to Putin's view than the view of the CIA, the  FBI, the NSA, and the DNI--people in the administration.   It seems that there are no lengths to which Chairman Nunes and  Speaker Ryan will not go to protect this White House, even when it  damages America's security.   After Chairman Nunes's midnight run to the White House, his partisan  memo, fake memo, and fake scandals about unmasking FBI text messages,  no one should take this report seriously. I would say, to the vast  majority of Americans, Chairman Nunes has discredited himself. He is  much more of a partisan operative than a representative helping America  be secure.   The House Republican majority has never taken this investigation  seriously. From the very beginning, they have sought to distract and  kick up dust. They have shown time and again that they are willing to  put party before country--something our Founding Founders warned  against. They are willing to twist facts and ignore evidence about a  foreign power attacking our democracy because it might cause political  damage to the President. It is a shocking and shameful abdication of  duty.   In my judgment, Chairman Nunes, you and your committee have made a  shocking and shameful abdication of duty to America. A congressional  party that is wholly subservient to the political interests of the  President is failing fundamentally to fulfill its constitutional  obligation. Congress is supposed to be a separate, equal branch of  government. Read the Constitution. Read the Federalist Papers. One of  the main purposes of Congress was to check the power of the executive  branch. Our Founding Fathers feared an overreaching executive branch,  as I know my friend from Nebraska knows, because he cites these things.  That responsibility doesn't fall only on one party. It falls on all of  us.   That is why there has been a history of bipartisanship and  cooperation on the Intelligence Committees, where the vital interests  of the Nation are at stake. That has been the case through the years.  Until Chairman Nunes seemed to get ahold of this, that tradition was a  grand one and a good one. Now that tradition has been discarded by  House Republicans on the Intelligence Committee through this  embarrassing episode that will historically go down as one of the  lowest moments of any committee's actions in Congress.   Let me say pointedly to my colleagues that the Senate Intelligence  Committee has been quite different than the House Intelligence  Committee. I salute both Chairman Burr and Ranking Member Warner for  trying to run things in a different way. Let us hope that the Senate  Intelligence Committee does not go the way of the House and continues  its bipartisan cooperation to get to the bottom of this mess. That is  because we have a responsibility to get to the bottom of what happened  in 2016 and to report those findings in an unbiased way. If the House  isn't going to do it, the Senate must.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, first, let me thank my good friend from  Florida. His State may be more affected by climate change than just  about any other. We hear about water lapping up on the shores of  Southern Florida already and the constant flooding. We have seen these  amazing pictures that equal 1,000 words about the coral reefs--and he  even talked about a word we rarely use in Brooklyn, ``critters.'' We  want to save the critters too.   So he has been eloquent--not just today but constantly--on the issue  of climate and does it in such a practical perspective that just about  every American of every ideology, part of the country, and thought  process can understand. So I thank him.   Of course, I thank our great leader on this issue, the Senator from  Rhode Island, Sheldon Whitehouse. He is passionate, and his passion  carries over into effective action. There has been no voice more  clarion, more constant, more effective in remembering that we cannot  ignore this issue, constantly reminding us how important it is. I thank  Senator Whitehouse not only for pulling us all together tonight but for  his great strength and constancy on this issue.  [[Page S1669]]    I join my colleagues to shed light on the subject of climate change,  which has received scant attention, unfortunately, from President Trump  and this Republican Senate. Despite decades of incontrovertible  evidence that climate change is harming our planet, President Trump and  the Republicans have done nothing about it. In fact, worse than doing  nothing, they have actively weakened our environmental laws, decrying  the very science that has helped us progress, has helped men and women  progress through the centuries.    Republicans in Congress have undone the environmental protections  that held corporations accountable for polluting our streams. They have  undone the rule that increased transparency in the management of public  lands. Through an unrelated tax bill, congressional Republicans opened  up the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling.   In the executive branch, EPA Administrator Pruitt has implemented an  extreme deregulatory agenda, unwinding the rules that keep our air  clear, our water clean, and limit carbon emissions that poison our  atmosphere and our planet.   Worst of all, President Trump announced that he will pull the United  States out of the Paris climate accord, which would make America the  only country in the world that isn't a part of the agreement. While the  world comes together to negotiate sensible climate change policies,  while other nations and other foreign businesses grab the mantle of  leadership on green energy, the United States, which used to be such a  leader on so many issues, can only sit and watch from the sidelines-- all because President Trump decided to pull out of the Paris accord.  What a remarkable mistake. It will go down in history as one of the  worst days in American history, as the world gets hotter and climate  change takes its toll on our country and the world.   Climate change is real, human activity is driving it, and it is  happening right now. These are facts. This is not speculation. This is  not someone spinning a tale. These are facts not in dispute. Scientists  know it. Businesses know it. The world knows it. The American people  know it too.   We in New York learned about the devastating impact of Hurricane  Sandy. It took so long to rebuild our coastal communities. All of Long  Island understood that climate change is real and devastating when you  do nothing about it.   The storms are getting more powerful--storms like Sandy--more  frequent, and there is no doubt that climate change is playing a role.  We watched three recordbreaking hurricanes buffet our cities and our  coastlines, devastating parts of Louisiana, Florida, Puerto Rico, and  the U.S. Virgin Islands. Stronger wildfires have ripped through our  Western States. According to NOAA, 2017 was the most expensive year on  record for disasters in the United States, costing hundreds of billions  of dollars. We are running out of time to do something about this  issue.   Together with my colleagues this evening, led by Senator Whitehouse,  who will be giving his 200th ``Time to Wake Up'' speech--what a great  accomplishment; I admire it--I urge all Americans--particularly younger  Americans, who understand that this planet will decline if we don't do  something, and it is their planet--I urge everyone--younger Americans,  older Americans, everybody--to contact Republican Senators and  Congressmen and tell them to wake up on climate change.   I yield the floor.
