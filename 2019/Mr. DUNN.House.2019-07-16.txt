 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of the late  Harry K. Weaver of Live Oak, Florida. From a very young age, Mr. Weaver  had an unwavering desire to serve others and make the world a better  place.   Mr. Weaver was born in 1929 in Bristol, Florida. Shortly after  earning his degree at Florida State University, he enlisted in the  United States Army.   Following years of service to our country, he returned to Florida,  where he would dedicate more than 33 years of his life first as the  administrator, then the president of the Florida Sheriffs Youth  Ranches, a program that has served over 150,000 children.   Harry was also a founding member of the National Association of Homes  for Children, where he served as its first president. His legacy will  live on in Suwannee County, and the impact that he has made on the  youth has left a lasting impression.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing the life and legacy of Mr.  Harry Weaver.                            ____________________
