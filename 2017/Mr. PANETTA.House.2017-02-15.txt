 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak against restricting  the family planning services that are provided by title X.   Just prior to signing title X into law, back in 1970, President  Richard Nixon recognized how essential family planning was to public  health. He actually sent a message to Congress telling them, ``no  American woman should be denied access to family planning assistance  because of her economic condition.'' Last year, Mr. Speaker, President  Obama reaffirmed that sentiment by making family planning services a  part of basic health care, regardless of where one lives. Although  Presidents Nixon and Obama couldn't be more divided in their politics,  even they were united behind title X. I believe this is understandable,  considering how title X ensures basic preventive health care and family  planning services for 4 million low-income people every year.   In my district, title X family planning services saves an average of  $7 on Medicaid-related costs for every dollar of Federal investment.  That means that clinics in my district, like Mar Monte, are able to  help more women and men receive a full range of healthcare services.   Rather than restricting family planning clinics, we should be  promoting, we should be protecting, and we should be preserving access  to those vital services, especially for those families that value and  need it most.
