 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 2105, the  National Institute of Standards and Technology Small Business  Cybersecurity Act. This bipartisan legislation instructs the Director  of NIST, in consultation with other Federal agencies, to disseminate  guidance to help small businesses identify, assess, manage, and reduce  their cybersecurity risks. As a small-business owner, I am honored to  be a cosponsor of this bill.   We know the importance of keeping all records safe and secure from  outside threats. With the recent hacking of Equifax and many others,  there is clearly a growing risk of online hacking and cyber warfare in  the world today. It is imperative that we ensure that the backbone of  our economy, our small- and medium-size businesses, have the resources  they need to stay safe.   I strongly believe that the businesses in Florida's Second District  would benefit from this vital information, which will help them keep  their data safe and secure. By increasing cybersecurity efforts, we are  protecting both small businesses and their millions of customers across  the country.   This bill doesn't cost the taxpayers anything, but it could  potentially save small-business owners and consumers both their privacy  and livelihoods.
