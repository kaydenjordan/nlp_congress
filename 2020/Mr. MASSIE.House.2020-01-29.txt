 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the marathon  impeachment sham trial currently underway and occupying the Senate's  valuable time.  [[Page H641]]    Frankly, the American people tuned out a long time ago. They find the  proceeding simply boring, and rightly so. In fact, a recent focus group  of Democrats said they don't even care about this impeachment trial.  They are not interested, and they are ready to move on.   The truth is that, despite all of the repetitive accusations of  coverup, quid pro quo, he said, she said, et cetera, et cetera, this is  nothing more than an attempt at a soft coup against President Trump by  the people who still can't get over the fact that he beat Hillary  Clinton fair and square at the ballot box.   Just listen to some of the recent rants made by the impeachment  managers. As one manager says: ``The President's misconduct cannot be  decided at the ballot box, for we cannot be assured that the vote will  be fairly won.''   What an insult to American voters. If we can't trust the American  voters, who can we trust? Does he think they are gullible? Does he  think he is better than them?   Or take the comments of another impeachment manager, a Democrat. He  said, referring to President Trump: ``He is a dictator. This must not  stand, and that is another reason he must be removed from office.''   These are insulting to the American public who chose this President  over Hillary Clinton.   But these are the types of comments you would expect in a Third World  country in which military coups are a common occurrence, not in the  United States of America where we honor the votes and choices of the  American people.   President Zelensky and President Trump both said there was no  pressure or coercion, and the call transcripts have been released to  the public to prove this.   But even if there had been pressure, if withholding foreign aid is an  impeachable offense, why did Joe Biden threaten to do it?   As I have stated repeatedly, if the bar of high crimes and  misdemeanors has been brought down so low to include President Donald  Trump's so-called abuse of power, then Joe Biden should be charged for  his actions in Ukraine. Instead, he gets a pass.   This impeachment trial is simply a farce. But it is an expensive and  time wasting one foisted on the American people by those who do not  have our country's best interests at heart.   Even the Speaker of the House, who is a Democrat, said, if there is  going to be an impeachment trial, if there is going to be impeachment  proceedings, it should be bipartisan, it would have to be bipartisan.   Mr. Speaker, the only thing bipartisan about this sham is the  opposition to it. Democrats joined every Republican to vote against it  in the House. I expect we are going to see similar results in the  Senate, a bipartisan opposition to this partisan sham.   I look forward to the Senate bringing this farce to a speedy  conclusion.                            ____________________
