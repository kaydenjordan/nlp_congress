 Mr. President, our Nation has experienced a series of  recent natural disasters: the tragic Maui wildfires, flooding in  Vermont and California, and the damage caused by Hurricane Idalia.  Communities in my home State of New Mexico have been impacted by  destructive floods and mudslides following last year's historic  wildfire season.   We must get these Americans the help they need during these difficult  times, and we must do it as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, this  bill would do the opposite.   On Friday, the Biden administration announced that producers impacted  by disasters last year are now eligible to apply for critical emergency  assistance. H.R. 662 would delay that funding, essentially stopping the  application process that the U.S. Department of Agriculture just got  underway. In addition, the administration already has the authority  under law to provide  [[Page S5285]]  funding to States through block grants. So this bill is both  counterproductive and unnecessary.   For these reasons, I would urge my colleagues to vote no.
