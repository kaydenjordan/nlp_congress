 Madam Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the  attack on families in rural America by the Biden administration in  their reallocation of Emergency Rental Assistance funds.   As of March 31, unspent ERA funds from rural States, like my home  State of Arkansas, are being taken and given to a handful of blue  States, like New York, California, and New Jersey, who have already  received and spent their own share of Emergency Rental Assistance  funds.   As the Treasury claws back this money, this reallocation of funds  will disproportionately affect rural America. The reallocation of ERA  money is unfair and turns a blind eye to the needs of renters who have  not received rental assistance simply because they live in rural areas  of our country.   To stand up for rural Arkansans and Americans across the country, I  have introduced the Protecting Rural Renters Act, which will prohibit  the ERA funds originally promised to our rural areas from being  reallocated elsewhere.   This act would simply remove the State allocations from the statutory  claw-backs and effectively prevent these funds from being taken away  from our rural citizens. This is in the best interests of our Nation.                            ____________________
