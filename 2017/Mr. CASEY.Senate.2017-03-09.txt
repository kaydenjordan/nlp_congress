 Mr. President, I thank Senator Cantwell for raising the  issue about the impact of this decision that the Congress will make  with regard to a particular healthcare bill and then also,  particularly, the Medicaid consequences.   I was just looking at what is a 2-page report that was just produced  today and that I was just handed from the Center on Budget and Policy  Priorities. It is State specific.   In this case, looking at the data from Pennsylvania--I will not go  through all of the data on Medicaid--just imagine that three different  groups of Americans have benefited tremendously from the Medicaid  Program every day. That is why what is happening in the House is of  great concern to us.   We have in Pennsylvania, for example--just in the number of  Pennsylvanians who have a disability--722,000 Pennsylvanians with  disabilities who rely upon Medical Assistance for their medical care.  Medical Assistance is our State program that is in partnership with  Medicaid. There are 261,000 Pennsylvania seniors who get their  healthcare through Medicaid. Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of  people who happen to be over the age of 65 or who happen to have a  disability of one kind or another are totally reliant, on most days, on  Medicaid. The third group, of course, is the children, and 33 percent  of all of the births in Pennsylvania are births that are paid for  through Medicaid.   When we talk about this bill that is being considered in the House or  when we talk about the confirmation vote for the Administrator for the  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, this is real life. What  happens to this legislation and what happens on this nomination is  about real life for people who have very little in the way of a bright  future if we allow some here to do what they would like to do,  apparently, to Medicaid.   It sounds very benign to say that you want to cap something or that  you want to block-grant. They are fairly benign terms. They are  devastating in their impact, and we cannot allow it to happen. That is  why this debate is so critical.   I have more to say, but I do commend and salute the work by Senator  Cantwell, Senator Stabenow, and Senator Wyden in fighting these  battles.   I will read just portions of a letter that I received from a mom in  Coatesville, in Southeast Pennsylvania, about her son, Rowan. The mom's  name is Pam. She wrote to us about her son, who is on the autism  spectrum. In this case, she is talking about the benefits of Medicaid-- Medical Assistance we call it in Pennsylvania.   Here is what she wrote in talking about the benefits that he  receives. After he was enrolled in the program, she said that Rowan had  the benefit of having a behavioral specialist consultant. That is one  expert who was helping Rowan, who was really struggling at one point. A  second professional they had helping him was a therapeutic staff  support worker. So there was real expertise to help a 5-year-old child  get through life with autism.   Here is what his mom Pam wrote in talking about, since he was  enrolled, how much he has benefited and how much he has grown and  progressed:         He benefited immensely from the CREATE program by the Child       Guidance Resource Centers, [which is a local program in       Coatesville]. Thankfully, it is covered in full by Medicaid.    She goes on to write the following, and I will conclude with this:         Without Medicaid, I am confident I could not work full time       to support our family. We would be bankrupt, and my son would       go without the therapies he sincerely needs.    Here is how Pam concludes the letter. She asks me, as her  representative--as her Senator--to think about her and her family when  we are deliberating about a nomination like this and about healthcare  legislation.   She writes:         Please think of us when you are making these decisions.       Please think about my 9-month-old daughter, Luna, who smiles       and laughs at her brother, Rowan, daily. She will have to       care for Rowan later in life after we are gone. Overall, we       are desperately in need of Rowan's Medical Assistance and       would be devastated if we lost these benefits.    This is real life for people. Sometimes it is far too easy here in  Washington for people to debate as if these things are theoretical-- that if you just cut a program or cap a program or block-grant a  program, you are just kind of moving numbers around and moving policy  around. This is of great consequence to these families, and we have to  remember that when we are making decisions around here.   Everyone who works in this building as an employee of the Federal  Government gets healthcare. We do not have someone else around the  country who is debating whether or not we are going to have healthcare,  like those families on Medicaid are having to endure.   I thank the Senator from Washington. I know that Senator Stabenow  from Michigan may have more to add on this. We have a big battle ahead,  but this is a battle that is not only worth fighting, but it is  absolutely essential that we win the battle to protect and support  Medicaid.
