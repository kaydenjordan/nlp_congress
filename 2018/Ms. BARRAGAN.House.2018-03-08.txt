 Mr. Speaker, on this International Women's Day, I rise  to honor the life of the Honorable Doris A. Davis, who passed away last  month, after providing decades of public service to the city of  Compton.   After serving as Compton's first African-American city clerk, Ms.  Davis then went on to become the first African-American mayor of a  major metropolitan city in the country.   During her time in office, Mayor Davis worked tirelessly to increase  tax revenues and job opportunities in Compton.   Upon leaving office, she founded the Daisy Child Development Centers,  a nonprofit organization that provided assistance to single parents and  families in and around Compton.   Mayor Davis was always an active participant in our community-- belonging to over two dozen organizations, including the NAACP, the  Urban League, and the League of Women Voters--and her legacy of public  service will live on.                            ____________________
