 Madam Speaker, I rise today in celebration of the 10th  anniversary of DACA, the program that has protected nearly 1 million  inspiring young people and given them the opportunity to contribute to  our great economy.   Dreamers are our family, friends, and neighbors. They are teachers,  doctors and nurses, small business owners, servicemembers, and so much  more.   They work hard and contribute to our great economy. They make America  a better place for everyone. Yet, they face unspeakable hardships and  witness the ugliness of anti-immigrant sentiments in our great country.  But their resilience has shined through all of that.   Let me be clear. Today is an incredible milestone, but another 10  years without permanent protections and a pathway to citizenship is  simply unjust. That is why I will continue to fight to give every  single Dreamer that continues to live in our country permanency,  because in America, we believe that when given that shot at the  American Dream, anything is possible.                            ____________________
