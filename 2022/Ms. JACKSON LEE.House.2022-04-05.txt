 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey  for his consistent leadership as he serves as chair and ranking member  of a number of subcommittees of the Homeland Security Committee. He has  been not only an effective manager here on the floor, but he has been a  very effective Member and effective leader on so many issues.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 4209 from my colleague and friend  from Texas (Mr. Pfluger).   After years of service on the Homeland Security Committee and any  number of times going to the border, I would like to first describe and  acknowledge that the southern border is many things.  [[Page H4167]]    It is a lifeline to desperate people who are fleeing horrible,  violent situations that include the decapitating of their sons and  daughters or their husbands and even wives. With the violence of some  of the oppressive states in Central and South America, where young boys  are recruited right out of their homes for gangs, gang warfare, those  families are intimidated and frightened if they do not give their boys  to these major gangs and cartels.   We have had any number of a series of the flow of massive influx of  migrants from the region. Many may come out of desperation for economic  reasons, but many come with credible fear. We expect that that may even  occur as early as the next couple of months. I implore my colleagues to  respond to that desperation in a unified, committed, and dedicated way  of Democrats and Republicans reminding themselves that the Statue of  Liberty may be along the New York shore, but people view this place as  a refuge.   As a resident of Houston, I can attest to the fact that Ukrainians,  Afghans, Africans, Haitians, and, yes, those from South and Central  America, and as far away as Southeast Asia, are now congregating at the  southern border. I, too, was in Del Rio when the massive movement of  human beings flowed for desperate reasons.   This DHS Illicit Cross-Border Tunnel Defense Act is what we need as  it relates to the known cartels and persons who are desperate to do  evil and to bring the goods that will destroy our young and others who  are addicted into the United States.   This is the way. They have proudly said that we build tunnels with  lights, air-conditioning, in whatever manner to make them palatable to  be able to block, if you will, our law enforcement from achieving their  goals.   As the first Member of Congress to bring a human trafficking hearing  to Houston, which is known as the epicenter of human trafficking, this  is vital legislation to stop the scourge of human trafficking, of  bringing young children and young women.   We already know that at the Ukrainian borders in different countries,  there is trafficking of young kids who are not killed by Putin; that  they are trafficking children and women in that crisis situation. They  have no moral compass.   This bill, which strengthens DHS' efforts to identify and remediate  illicit cross-border tunnels built and utilized by transnational  criminal organizations and smugglers on the southwest border, is  crucial.   Mr. Speaker, I particularly support the Secretary's direction to  issue a strategic plan that addresses resource needs, including  technology and staffing needs. What is needed is a million dollars in  funding for fiscal years 2023 and 2024 to acquire material to remediate  illicit cross-border tunnels.   I have said that they have regular, good living conditions in these  tunnels because they are so extensive. This material includes  specialized concrete with enough viscosity to efficiently fill tunnels  with fewer insertion points.   We need to combine our efforts as we deal with the scourge of the  violent cartels: bloody, guns, intimidating people, and, of course,  bringing in illegal entities, some that are human life, into the United  States.                                time  1300    The southern border is quite different from the northern border, and  we must provide the technology for those who are there.   But as I make that point, Mr. Speaker, I do believe as well that we  are never going to get anywhere as Americans, we are never going to win  the fight on immigration, on migration, or refugees if we continue to  stand in our individual corners. We have to face it. People view this  as a beacon of light. You can try to snuff that out, you can try to  turn the light off, and you can try to tell them to go back, but they  are entrenched with legacy history passed down that this is the place  to seek opportunity and refuge.   So I support the legislation. I thank the gentleman from Texas for  his hard work. I believe this is an important element to bipartisan  commitment to securing our borders in the right way, and I thank him  for his leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey, the chairman, and  the ranking member of the full committee.
