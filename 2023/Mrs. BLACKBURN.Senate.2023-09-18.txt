 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, before I begin my remarks today, I  want to mention that it is the 76th anniversary of the U.S. Air Force.   On behalf of all Tennesseans, I want to recognize the brave men and  women who are serving at Arnold Air Force Base, our Air National Guard  members, and the Air Force veterans who call Tennessee home. We thank  them for their service.                        Artificial Intelligence Forum    Madam President, last week, the majority leader hosted a forum on  artificial intelligence. That meeting really complemented the hearings  that we have been having on this issue and, indeed, two hearings--one  in the Commerce Committee and one in the Judiciary Committee--that we  held last week. It is vital that we develop an understanding of what it  is going to take to put the guardrails in place for AI. We are going to  need to continue regular discussions between policymakers and the  industry.   We have seen this model work in our favor. In 2019 and 2020, I led  the Judiciary Committee's Tech Task Force. This brought experts to the  table so that we on the Judiciary Committee could sit down with them,  talk with them, learn more about how their technology worked and the  dangers that it may pose. We did this with several of our emerging  technology sectors. These discussions really yielded great results, and  the body became more engaged on technology issues.   But we must stay focused and remember that AI raises the same  concerns that plague other technological innovations. I was  disappointed with how little the executives who participated in last  week's forum had to say about data privacy because, in our committee  hearings and with those witnesses, they have engaged on that issue.  They have talked about how we need to have that Federal privacy law  before we move forward with quantum computing, before we have more  utilization of blockchain, and, of course, before we move forward with  AI.   We have to remember, when you are online, when you are on an open- source platform--you and your data--you are the product. It is  virtually impossible to talk about new technology without also talking  about how to protect a customer's data. I like to call that the  ``virtual you.'' How do you protect yourself and your information  online?   For an entire decade, I have called for comprehensive data privacy  legislation. I brought it up again in last week's Commerce hearing.  Many of my colleagues agreed: This is something we cannot continue to  ignore. So I would ask them to stay focused on that.   We heard the same thing from our witnesses. You cannot ignore online  privacy. You are going to have to deal with this issue.   Artificial intelligence is the most powerful technological innovation  we have seen since the inception of the internet, and it is already  taking over many of the digital systems that we use every single day.  Those systems depend on enormous amounts of data to function. If we  don't protect our data online and reinject control over how these  systems exploit our data, we are going to lose the ability to do so.   Think about this because AI systems have to be trained. They are  trained on your data.   Let's take, for instance, what happens with an entertainer. Let's say  you are a singer-songwriter out of Tennessee. Let's say that you have  written  [[Page S4550]]  a hit. Let's say that an AI system, such as Jukebox, which is there on  GPT--let's say you are going to train that system to sound like one of  our Nashville hit makers. Then that means you are going to use their  name, their image, their likeness, and their voice. It is a concept  called voice cloning, and it is something we should be paying attention  to.   Is there good that can come through artificial intelligence? Of  course, there is. Think about what can happen as you are using it for  predictive diagnoses in medicine, as you are using it for predictive  disease analysis in medicine. Think about how you can use it for remote  surgeries. There are good uses--the same thing for logistics, the same  thing for manufacturing--all of which we see in our State. But there is  also harm that can come for entertainers, for singers, for songwriters,  for authors, for publishers. We need to realize that there can be good,  but there also can be harm.   We also know that regimes that are hostile to the United States are  doing everything that they can right this minute to exploit that  technology, another of the adverse uses of artificial intelligence.   Here is an example. China has long used social media platforms like  TikTok to push propaganda in the United States. Now, the Chinese  Communist Party--the dear old CCP--they are at it again, using  generative models to make these campaigns even more convincing. And it  is not just those of us in Congress who see this. Microsoft recently  released a report showing us exactly how the Chinese Communist Party is  doing it.   We also know that authoritarian regimes will use AI to enhance their  surveillance capabilities. The CCP, again, is already doing this. They  are using it to surveil the Uighurs, tracking them. They are doing the  same with the Tibetans and the Mongolians.   Then you look at Iran. They are using this to track and follow and  use facial recognition to identify women, making certain that they are  properly dressed and wearing that hijab in public. If they are willing  to weaponize it against their own people--think about it. They have  weaponized this technology. They are tracking and following and  monitoring and surveilling individuals in their daily lives. If they  are doing it to them, of course, they are going to do it to us.   Before we lead on AI, the United States must be technologically  superior, but even the tech execs who came to Capitol Hill last week  admit that there is a role for Congress to play in addressing privacy,  national security, and other concerns. U.S. regulations must not hurt  the ability of U.S. companies to dominate, but the lack of any  governing standards can be just as damaging.   For example, because the United States doesn't have a data privacy  law, we have fallen behind our counterparts in the European Union on AI  regulation. Back in February, Commissioner Vestager described for me,  in a meeting that we had, how the GDPR has allowed the EU to move  forward on AI.   The difficulty of installing guardrails while still encouraging  freedom and innovation is not unique to AI. We have done this in the  past, and we are going to need to do it again so that we retain that  superiority in artificial intelligence and quantum computing.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  following interns from my office be granted floor privileges for the  rest of this Congress: Haylee Acton, Sedrie Orantes, and Madeleine  Katz.
