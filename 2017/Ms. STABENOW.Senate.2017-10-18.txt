 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for two minutes  to speak, please.    Mr. President, first, let me say that the people of  Michigan and our country deserve a better deal than what is in this  budget. There are a number of concerns I have, but I want to mention  three big ones, and I am proud to join with colleagues on amendments  that would address them in votes that will be coming up.   The first is the fact that this budget would take $473 billion out of  Medicare. I offered an amendment in committee to make sure that would  include privatizing Medicare, but that was voted down. That is  certainly something that could happen.   There is $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts as well. In Michigan, three out  of five seniors in nursing homes are there with the help of Medicaid  health insurance. This is children, families, and senior citizens.  There will be an amendment offered that Senator Nelson, Senator  Sanders, and I offered to take out this cut from Medicare. There will  be one offered for Medicaid, with Senator Sanders, Senator Casey, and  me, to strike that.   Second, 80 percent of the tax cuts built into the assumptions of the  budget go to the top 1 percent. What does that mean? Well, it is $1.5  trillion that goes to folks making $700,000 or more. That is at least a  $200,000 tax cut per person. We commonly call this trickle-down  economics. So far it has never worked. People in my State are still  waiting for it to trickle down.   We have an amendment, as well, to remove this provision and to put  the tax cuts into the pockets of middle-class taxpayers.   Finally, this plan overall increases the deficit. Even though it cuts  Medicare and Medicaid, it also increases and explodes the deficit by  $2.4 trillion. We also will be addressing that as well.   Overall, unfortunately, in terms of the big tax cuts, this budget  proposal is paid for by our senior citizens and single parents who are  affected and middle-class families. I urge a ``no'' vote.    Mr. President, I know we are in the middle of a  discussion and certainly a debate right now about a budget resolution,  and, obviously, I participated in discussions of how concerned I am  about the priorities in the budget resolution. I think the people of  Michigan and the country deserve a better deal.   But while we are doing that, the clock is ticking on some very, very  important programs where we actually have bipartisan support in  committee. I want to thank Chairman Hatch and the Finance Committee,  working with me and working with our ranking member, Senator Wyden, for  moving forward last week on a 5-year reauthorization of the Children's  Health Insurance Program, or what we call CHIP. The problem is this.  Even though we passed it with only one negative vote and we had a  strong bipartisan vote coming to the floor, my concern is that we have  gone on to tax cuts. We are going on to a bill that includes Medicaid  cuts and Medicare cuts and other debates. Yet we have this bipartisan  effort that needs to get done because the funding ended September 30.  It has been 18 days and counting. We will be counting these days  because it has been 18 days since the Children's Health Insurance  Program was stopped being funded.   I am very concerned about this. I assumed that once we had agreement,  we would be able to move something very quickly. It is deeply  concerning to me that we are now in a situation where it is 18 days.  Tomorrow it will be 19 days, and then we go into the weekend, and yet  we are not seeing the Children's Health Insurance Program funded.   There are 9 million children in our country. These are low-income  working families who are not able to have the confidence of knowing  that health insurance will be there for them. CHIP has been an  extremely successful program. In Michigan we call it MIChild, and we  have about 100,000 children who are able to get health services because  of MIChild. This means moms and dads go to bed at night and don't have  to say a little prayer--please, God, don't let the kids get sick-- because they know they are going to be able to take them to the doctor.    This has traditionally been a bipartisan bill. As I have said, we  have had great support on both sides of the aisle, but it is now out of  committee, and we need to move it, and we need to make space on the  calendar to be able to get this done.   We also have something else that ended on September 30, and that is  funding for our community health centers. This is something else that  has bipartisan support. I want to thank my friend Senator Roy Blunt. He  and I joined together. We have 70 Members of this body who have signed  a letter to continue the funding for community health centers. The  problem is, the funding ran out on September 30. The Federal funding  ended on September 30. We are talking about 25 million families,  children, 300,000 veterans, 7.5 million children all across the  country. In many parts of rural Michigan, that is the primary way  people are getting their healthcare, as well as in urban settings.   Again, we have an agreement. We have talked about, now that the  children's health insurance bill is out of committee, having it on the  floor and then having an amendment for health centers, moving that  together, which is something we have done in the past. We have strong  bipartisan support to do it, but it has been put to the side in favor  of what is a very divisive process on a budget resolution and tax cuts  and other issues.   So I am imploring the leadership in the Senate to focus on something  on which we all agree--at least the majority of us agree, the  overwhelming majority of us agree--and that is making sure the  Children's Health Insurance Program and community health centers get  funded as quickly as possible. This is something done through the  States, this is locally driven, it meets all the tests that people talk  about, and both of these programs are extremely effective.   In 2016 alone, Michigan's community health centers diagnosed coronary  heart disease in more than 21,000 people. There were 21,000 people who,  if they hadn't gotten that diagnosis, probably would have ended up in  the emergency room--if they had been able to get to an emergency room  before something fatal happened. Because we have community health  centers from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to our urban areas, people  were able to get the diagnosis and the help they needed. Nearly 34,000  Michigan residents learned that they had asthma and could treat that  asthma, and children could get the treatment they need. Nearly 140,000  people were diagnosed with diabetes and could begin to manage that so  it didn't become something incredibly serious and life-threatening.   Health centers play a very important role. If we aren't treating  these kinds of things, they can be deadly if undiagnosed or untreated,  so it is very important.   I am worried that there is not the sense of urgency there needs to be  here to continue the Children's Health Insurance Program and the  community health centers. I know that my Democratic colleagues feel  that we are ready and willing to, at any moment, stop the debate on a  divisive budget resolution, focus on something that has bipartisan  leadership and bipartisan support, and let's get that done.   In Michigan, our 100,000 children who are able to see the doctor  through MIChild get the medical care and dental and vision care that  they need to be successful--to be successful in school, to be able to  see the blackboard, to be able to read, to be able to hear, because  they are getting the basic healthcare they need.   Children shouldn't have to strain to see the blackboard and get bad  grades because they can't get a simple eye exam, and that is what  MIChild helps make happen. Children shouldn't have to struggle to  ignore a painful tooth because the family can't afford to see a  dentist. We have heard of horrible situations where, because of  abscesses, children have actually lost their lives. It is not  necessary. This is something that is preventible, and we have a  bipartisan program, the Children's Health Insurance Program, created  with bipartisan leadership years ago, that can be continued and needs  to be continued.   Mr. President, I understand the debate on the floor about the budget.  I understand the debate on tax reform. I want to see tax reform that  simplifies the code and puts money in the pockets of hard-working  families and small businesses and creates jobs. I mean, that is what I  want to see happen. I also want to make sure, as we are debating right  now how to do that and the differences in doing that--I would argue  that what is in this budget bill does not do that, and I want to work  on something that does.   We have the clock ticking on 9 million children and their families  whose health insurance funding stopped 18 days ago and community health  centers from small towns in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to the city  of Detroit whose health center funding stopped 18 days ago.   So I am going to keep counting. I hope I don't have to count too high  before we can get this done because I know there is support here. I  know there is support to do it, but it has to be a priority. There has  to be a sense of urgency. Just like a parent who is up at 3 o'clock in  the morning with a sick child has a sense of urgency about what they  need to care for their child, we need to have that same sense of  urgency here and do what I know we can do if we would just take the  time, just take a few minutes to get it done.   Mr. President, I hope that will happen very soon. Thank you very  much.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the  University of Michigan, one of the world's premier universities, which  is celebrating its bicentennial this year.   Whether it is leading-edge manufacturing, lifesaving advances in  medical science, or groundbreaking leaps in technology, the University  of Michigan is a world leader in innovation and creativity. I can tell  you that there is no group of students or alumni in America that is  more passionate and committed than our Michigan fans.   Founded on August 26, 1817, in Detroit, the University of Michigan  was the first public university in the Northwest Territory, moving to  Ann Arbor in 1837. With 63,000 students on three campuses and more than  572,000 living graduates, including my son, the university has one of  the largest alumni bodies in the world. They include artists,  astronauts, athletes, entrepreneurs, humanitarians, business and  government leaders, and Nobel Laureates in economics, medicine, and  science.   The university is known for many firsts that make it among, as its  fight song states, the ``leaders and best.'' Michigan was the Nation's  first university to build a chemical laboratory, open and operate its  own hospital, and teach science-based medicine. In 1879, the university  created the chair of the science and the art of teaching, the first  permanent professorial chair at an American college or university  devoted to teacher preparation. Michigan offered the Nation's first  collegiate aeronautics classes in 1914. In 1949, it established the  Institute of Social Research, now one of the oldest and largest  academic survey organizations.   Michigan is one of the world's leading research universities,  spending $1.39 billion on research in 2016. It produces, on average,  400 new inventions each year and launches a new startup every 4 weeks.  Faculty and graduates have played a leadership role in developing the  polio vaccine, identifying the gene for cystic fibrosis, creating the  worldwide computing backbone that led to the internet, protecting the  Great Lakes, and exploring space. The groundbreaking research continues  today as the university works on autonomous vehicles and is home to M- City, a one-of-a-kind urban test facility for vehicle deployment.   The university is known for the beauty of its natural surroundings  and architecture, including some 16,000 trees and such landmarks as  Angell Hall, Burton Memorial Tower, and Hill Auditorium, all designed  by Albert Kahn. It is home to more than 20 libraries, several museums,  art galleries and collections, and performing arts venues, including  the Arthur Miller Theatre, named in honor of the playwright and U-M  alumnus.   Michigan also is renowned for its athletic tradition, dating back to  1865. It boasts 56 national championships in 12 sports and two Heisman  Trophy winners.   I am extremely proud to congratulate the University of Michigan for  its 200 years of leadership in higher education and outstanding  contributions to the State of Michigan, the Nation, and the world. ``Go  Blue!''                            ____________________
