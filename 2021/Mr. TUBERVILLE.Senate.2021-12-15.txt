 Mr. President, today I rise to highlight the 100th  anniversary of the 117th Air Refueling Wing based in Birmingham, AL,  and to honor the patriotic men and women, past and present, of this  storied National Guard unit. For a century, the 117th has defended our  freedoms by providing worldwide air refueling, airlift, logistics,  intelligence, and medical services. It is a profound honor to represent  these great Americans in their nation's capital.   The United States hosts the world's most powerful Air Force, which  gives our country the ability to project strength and defend freedom  around the globe. This capability is made possible by a heavy reliance  on our air refueling tankers that create bridges across the sky for our  fighters and bombers. Since October 1994, the 117th Air Refueling Wing  has proudly and effectively performed this critical air refueling  mission with the KC-135 Stratotanker, a mainstay of our tanker fleet.   The 117th Air Refueling Wing is heavily utilized and often deployed.  Their reliability and dedication has led them to take part in some of  the most consequential military actions of our time.   During the Kosovo conflict of 1999, the wing flew operational  missions over the Balkans following its deployment of six KC-135  aircraft to Brize-Norton Royal Air Force Base, England, in support of  Operation Allied Force.   After the horrific terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the 117th  deployed to MacDill Air Force Base, FL, as part of Operation Noble  Eagle to refuel F-15 and F-16 aircraft that were flying around-the- clock protective combat air patrol missions over major cities in the  United States.   The wing deployed KC-135 aircraft to Incirlik Air Base, Turkey, to  fly operational missions in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and  later played a key role in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Each of these  deployments supported and directly contributed to the success of our  air operations, keeping Americans in the air and on the ground safer  while imposing our will on the enemy.   But, even decades before taking on the air refueling mission, the  wing had a storied beginning and a long history of service to our  country.   In 1918, Major James A. Meissner, a World War I flying ace, returned  home to Birmingham to lead the formation of a flying unit based at  Roberts Field. As a result of his efforts, on January 21, 1922, the  U.S. Department of War identified the Birmingham Aero Club as the first  Air National Guard Unit in Alabama.   The unit was originally designated as the 135th Observation Squadron,  Alabama National Guard, and received Federal recognition as a Corps  Aviation unit. The flying squadron was nicknamed the ``Birmingham  Escadrille's,'' and Major Meissner served as the first commander.   On January 30, 1944, the unit, by then redesignated to the 106th  Reconnaissance Squadron, flew its first combat sorties in B-25 Mitchell  aircraft against the Japanese from Sterling Island in the South  Pacific.   In 1961, the unit was federalized in support of the Berlin Crisis.  For 10 months, 20 RF-84F Thunderstreak aircraft flew missions from  Dreux Air Base, France.   Also in 1961, roughly 80 members of the Alabama Air National Guard  secretly took part in the operation to support the Bay of Pigs invasion  of Cuba. These individuals bravely defended the U.S. and Cuban people  against the communist regime and were sworn to secrecy until the  declassification of the mission in 1998.   In November 1971, the unit was selected to be the first Air National  Guard unit to receive the RF-4C Phantom II aircraft, redesignated as  the 117th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, and assigned to the U.S. Air  Force's Tactical Air Command.   Following Saddam Hussein's August 1990 invasion of Kuwait and the  subsequent U.S. military buildup in the Middle East, six Alabama  National Guard RF-4C aircraft equipped with special long-range cameras  deployed on August 24, 1990, to Al Dhafra Air Base, United Arab  Emirates. Their mission was to obtain high-resolution images of  [[Page S9209]]  objects 100 miles away to aid prewar surveillance and photo- reconnaissance mapping of Iraqi forces in occupied Kuwait and along the  Saudi Arabia-Iraq border.   Though the missions and the aircraft have changed over the 100-year  history of the flying squadron, one thing has remained constant: The  men and women of the 117th have always answered the call to service.  That tradition has been proudly carried on by the nearly 1,000 men and  women who comprise the 117th Air Refueling Wing.   Today, we honor the airmen and women, maintainers, medical crews, and  support staff of the 117th Air Refueling Wing on this important  anniversary and remember those that have given their lives as part of  the wing's operations. I salute them for their sacrifice and service to  the great State of Alabama and the United States of America.                            ____________________
