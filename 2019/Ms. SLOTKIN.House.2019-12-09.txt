(b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents in section       1(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended by       inserting after the item relating to section 890A the       following new item:  ``Sec. 890B. Mentor-protege program.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4727, the  Department of Homeland Security Mentor-Protege Program Act of 2019.   Since the very earliest days of the Department of Homeland Security,  it has operated a mentor-protege program to encourage large businesses  to help small businesses build their capacity to compete for government  contracts. However, this important program was never codified into law.  H.R. 4727 not only authorizes the existing program but improves it.   Small businesses, including women-, veteran-, and minority-owned  firms, are the backbone of our economy, but far too often, complex  Federal contracting requirements shut them out of the Federal  marketplace.   Building and sustaining a reliable pool of small business vendors is  critical to ensuring that DHS and its ever-evolving contracting needs  are met and that America's security is enhanced. H.R. 4727 seeks to  build and sustain this pool by incentivizing large businesses to  provide technical, managerial, financial assistance, and subcontracting  opportunities to small businesses. This bill requires participating  businesses to commit to a mentor-protege relationship for 3 years to  help establish long-term relationships between large and small  contractors.   Additionally, to ensure that Congress can monitor the effectiveness  of the program in an ongoing way, it requires DHS to annually report on  program participation and the benefits conferred upon small businesses.   Enactment of H.R. 4727 will ensure the continued and lasting success  of the mentor-protege program, a vital small business program.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass this commonsense  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, formally authorizing the Department of  Homeland Security's mentor-protege program will ensure the continued  success of this important small business program.   DHS is to be commended in its earliest days for setting this program  up.   I thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. McEachin) for introducing  this bill to help grow partnerships between small businesses and DHS.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4727, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3318) to require the Transportation Security Administration  to establish a task force to conduct an analysis of emerging and  potential future threats to transportation security, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3318         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Emerging Transportation       Security Threats Act of 2019''.  [[Page H9372]]            SEC. 2. EMERGING AND FUTURE THREATS TASK FORCE.

(a) In General.--Not later than one year after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the       United States shall conduct a review of the feasibility,       risks, costs, and potential threat mitigation benefits of the       Transportation Security Administration deploying the agency's       passenger and property screening assets to conduct screening       in areas or facilities prior to passenger arrival at airport       terminals.        (b) Stakeholder Engagement.--In conducting the review       required under subsection (a), the Comptroller General of the       United States shall consult with the Transportation Security       Administration, airport operators, air carriers, businesses       that operate in airports, labor groups representing the       Transportation Security Administration and transportation       sector personnel, and other stakeholders.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 3318, the Emerging  Transportation Security Threats Act of 2019.   Millions of people travel every day and rely on a secure  transportation system to get them to their destination safely.  Terrorists and other nefarious actors are constantly looking for new  ways to attack and disrupt our Nation's transportation systems. All it  takes is one successful attack for the public to lose confidence in the  system as a whole.   We must ensure that our security systems remain one step ahead of  nefarious actors and that all entities responsible for transportation  security are collaborating and sharing information in an effective  manner to help prevent an attack. This bill is a good step in this  direction.   Importantly, it requires the TSA, in consultation with the  intelligence community and other relevant Federal agencies, to  establish a task force to analyze emerging and future threats to  transportation security. Having individuals from across the Federal  Government work together to assess emerging threats will help promote  collaboration and efficiency across the agencies.   After the analysis is complete, H.R. 3318 requires TSA to develop a  threat mitigation strategy for each threat the task force identifies.  These mitigation strategies will be important tools for TSA as they  consider how best to prevent potential threats from occurring.   Finally, the bill requires the Government Accountability Office to  conduct a review to determine the costs and benefits of conducting  screening prior to passenger arrival at an airport terminal.   Mr. Speaker, we must do all that we can to prevent an attack on our  transportation systems. This bill promotes collaboration to put our  security agencies in a better position to identify and mitigate  threats.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I am prepared  to close after the gentleman from Louisiana closes.    Mr. Speaker, securing our Nation's transportation  systems from successful attack requires the collaboration of all  stakeholders responsible for transportation security.   I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce) for bringing this  legislation forward, and I urge passage of H.R. 3318.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4713) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to make  certain improvements in the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties  of the Department of Homeland Security, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4713         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(b) Clerical Amendment.--The item relating to section 705       in section 1(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 is       amended to read as follows:       ``SEC. 705. OFFICER FOR CIVIL RIGHTS AND CIVIL LIBERTIES.''.       SEC. 3. COMPTROLLER GENERAL REVIEW.         Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall       submit to Congress a report on subsection (b)(11) of section       705 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 345), as       amended by section 2.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4713, the  Department of Homeland Security Office of Civil Rights and Civil  Liberties Authorization Act.   The Department of Homeland Security Office of Civil Rights and Civil  Liberties, which I will call CRCL, is the primary office responsible  for integrating civil rights and civil liberties protections into DHS  policies, programs, and procedures.   Every day, DHS personnel interact with millions of people from across  the country and around the world. For this reason, it is imperative  that the Department's CRCL officer has the authority to ensure that DHS  pursues policies and programs that are in line with constitutionally  protected civil rights and civil liberties.   Under current law, the CRCL officer is authorized to assist the  leaders throughout the Department in appropriately incorporating civil  rights and civil liberties in DHS policies and procedures. However,  there have been instances where CRCL was not afforded the opportunity  to weigh in on DHS programs and policies that clearly impact  individuals' and communities' civil rights and civil liberties.   For example, it has been reported that CRCL was not consulted when  the Trump administration instituted the family separation policy at the  southern border. It has also been reported that the Office was not  consulted prior to the January 2017 travel ban that barred individuals  from Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.   The bill before us today seeks to ensure that CRCL has a seat at the  table  [[Page H9375]]  when new programs and policies are being considered within DHS.   H.R. 4713, which was introduced by the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Green), promotes the involvement of CRCL early in the policymaking  process and ensures the Office is empowered, when necessary, to prevent  DHS from pursuing policies that violate individuals' civil rights and  civil liberties.   To strengthen the integration of civil rights and civil liberties  across the Department, H.R. 4713 requires the designation of CRCL  officers within each DHS component.   Additionally, H.R. 4713 would confer the CRCL officer the same  authorities that currently rest with the DHS privacy officer to carry  out its responsibilities.   For instance, today, DHS components are not required to provide  information to the CRCL officer that may be needed for a civil  liberties investigation. Under H.R. 4713, the CRCL officer would have  the authority to access all Department records necessary to carry out  its work, including investigations.   The CRCL officer would also have the authority, with the support of  the DHS Secretary, to subpoena non-Federal entities to acquire  information, documents, reports, and other materials necessary to carry  out CRCL investigations.   Lastly, the bill would increase transparency and accountability  within the Department. Specifically, H.R. 4713 makes CRCL more  responsive and accessible to members of the public who file complaints  by requiring the Office to provide individuals with notices of receipt  within 30 days of a complaint.   The bill also requires CRCL to make publicly available its reports  and reviews of Department programs and submit those reports to  Congress.   We know that the CRCL does important work and that caseload is  growing. This year alone, the Office reviewed DHS policies relating to  the humanitarian crisis at the border, disaster assistance, and a  Departmentwide antiharassment policy, just to name a few items.   Given Congress' strong interest in the work of the Department's CRCL  officer, it is troubling that the last annual report that we have  received here in Congress was for fiscal year 2017. Increased public  reporting will allow us to work together to improve accountability of  the Department.   I appreciate that the Committee on Homeland Security came together on  a bipartisan basis to support this measure, and I urge my colleagues to  do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1645     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Green).    Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I am prepared  to close.    Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I did not also take  just a half a second to urge the Department of Homeland Security, in  crafting their budget request for next cycle, to provide adequate  resources for the CRCL to ensure that the office can do its work.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the rest of my colleagues to join by passing H.R.  4713, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4402) to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to  conduct an inland waters threat analysis, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4402         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Inland Waters Security       Review Act''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.

(2) Inland waters.--The term ``inland waters'' has the       meaning given such term in section 83.03 of title 33, Code of       Federal Regulations.       SEC. 3. INLAND WATERS THREAT ANALYSIS.         (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security       shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees an       inland waters threat analysis that includes an identification       and description of the following:        (1) Current and potential terrorism and criminal threats       posed by individuals and groups seeking to--        (A) enter the United States through inland waters; or        (B) exploit security vulnerabilities on inland waters.        (2) Security challenges at United States inland waters       ports regarding--        (A) terrorism and instruments of terror entering the United       States; and        (B) criminal activity, as measured by the total flow of       illegal goods and illicit drugs, related to the inland       waters.        (3) Security mitigation efforts with respect to the inland       waters to--        (A) prevent terrorists and instruments of terror from       entering the United States; and        (B) reduce criminal activity related to the inland waters.        (4) Vulnerabilities related to cooperation between State,       local, Tribal, and territorial law enforcement, or       international agreements, that hinder effective security,       counterterrorism, anti-trafficking efforts, and the flow of       legitimate trade with respect to inland waters.        (5) Metrics and performance measures used by the Department       of Homeland Security to evaluate inland waters security, as       appropriate.        (b) Analysis Requirements.--In preparing the threat       analysis required under subsection (a), the Secretary of       Homeland Security shall consider and examine the following:        (1) Technology needs and challenges.        (2) Personnel needs and challenges.        (3) The roles of State, local, Tribal, and territorial law       enforcement, as well as private sector partners and the       public, relating to inland waters security.        (4) The need for cooperation among Federal, State, local,       Tribal, territorial, and international partner law       enforcement, as well as private sector partners and the       public, relating to inland waters security.        (5) The challenges posed by geography with respect to       inland waters security.        (c) Classified Threat Analysis.--To the extent possible,       the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit the threat       analysis required under subsection (a) in unclassified form.       The Secretary may submit a portion of the threat analysis in       classified form if the Secretary determines that such is       appropriate.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4402, the Inland Waters  Security Review Act. This one is very close to my heart.   Maritime security is an integral part of our homeland security;  however, most terrorism assessments related to maritime security have  focused on the risks of terrorism on the high seas or on coastal areas.   In the United States, we have massive inland water systems that  present unique security challenges. In Michigan, for instance, from  where I hail, we have 3,288 miles of coastline, second only to Alaska-- take that, California and Florida--so inland waters are a big deal to  us. Maritime security is not just for our oceans but also for our Great  Lakes, which represent a huge part of our U.S.-Canada border.   As a Michiganian who came to Congress to protect the Great Lakes, I  am pleased to support this legislation, which requires the Department  of Homeland Security to take a good, hard look at security threats to  these vital waterways.   Specifically, H.R. 4402 would require DHS to submit an analysis of  the current and potential terrorism and criminal threats, as well as  security challenges, with respect to our Nation's inland waters.   In producing this assessment, DHS must consider technology,  personnel, law enforcement cooperation, public-private partnerships,  and challenges posed by geography. This assessment will provide  Congress and the public with vital information regarding the threats  facing our inland waters.   I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 4402, a bipartisan  bill that was reported out of committee by unanimous consent. I thank  my colleague on the Homeland Security committee, Mrs. Lesko, for her  leadership on this bill.   With that, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, America is home to over 3 million miles of  lakes, rivers, and streams, including more than 25,000 miles of  navigable waters.   It is critically important that we have a complete picture of the  security and criminal threats that inland waters face. H.R. 4402 would  do just that.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Arizona for introducing  this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3669) to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to  conduct a collective response to a terrorism exercise that includes the  management of cascading effects on critical infrastructure during times  of extreme cold weather, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3669         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Weatherizing Infrastructure       in the North and Terrorism Emergency Readiness Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. EXERCISE ON TERRORIST ATTACK DURING EXTREME COLD.         (a) In General.--In addition to, or as part of exercise       programs currently carried out by the Department of Homeland       Security, to enhance domestic preparedness for terrorism,       promote the dissemination of homeland security information,       and test the homeland security posture of the United States,       the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through       appropriate offices and components of the Department, shall       develop and conduct a collective response to terrorism       exercise that includes management of cascading effects on       critical infrastructure (as such term is defined in section       1016(e) of Public Law 107-56 (42 U.S.C. 5195c(e))), such as       an extreme cold weather event caused by a polar vortex.        (b) Exercise Requirements.--The exercise required under       subsection (a) shall include a scenario involving the       following:        (1) An extreme cold weather event, such as an event caused       by a polar vortex, with respect to access to critical       services.        (2) Any cascading effects on critical infrastructure.        (3) How the effects of a successful terrorist attack       against critical infrastructure could be mitigated by       emergency managers, State officials, and appropriate private       sector and community stakeholders.        (4) How the resilience of communities that could be       impacted by such an attack could be bolstered.        (5) Coordination with appropriate Federal departments and       agencies, and State, local, Tribal, and territorial agencies.        (6) Coordination with appropriate private sector and       community stakeholders.        (c) Report.--Not later than 60 days after the completion of       the exercise required under subsection (a), the Secretary of       Homeland Security shall, consistent with the protection of       classified information, submit to the Committee on Homeland       Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on       Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate an       after-action report presenting the initial findings of such       exercise, any immediate and longer-term plans for       incorporating lessons learned into future operations of the       Department of Homeland Security, and any proposed legislative       changes informed by such exercise.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of my own bill, H.R. 3669, the  Weatherizing Infrastructure in the North and Terrorism Emergency  Readiness Act of 2019 or, as we like to call it, the WINTER Act.   Terrorism is a persistent threat to the United States. We need to be  prepared to confront terrorism in all situations, even during extreme  weather events. As climate change continues to change weather patterns,  extreme winter storms will become more common.   The effects of climate change produce more snowfall during winter  storms as a warmer planet evaporates more water into the atmosphere,  and that moisture means heavier snowfall and worse storms.   Given what we know, we must make sure we are prepared to act if a  terrorist attack were to take place during an extreme cold event. This  is why I introduced H.R. 3669, the WINTER Act.   In recent years, the Nation has experienced several extreme cold  weather events, such as the polar vortex during the winter of 2019.  This one was very specific and personal to the State of Michigan.   Last winter, in my State, temperatures reached as low as negative 43  degrees Fahrenheit during the polar vortex. During that time we had a  fire, an accidental fire at one of our gas facilities, causing it to  shut down, and resulting in a gas shortage in our State. As a result,  our Governor had to go on television and ask all Michiganians to turn  down their thermostats below 65 degrees to ensure that we didn't lose  power across the State and were able to keep our warming stations, our  hospitals, our homeless shelters open.   The dangers that result from cold weather aren't unique to Michigan.  Across the U.S., over 6,000 people died from hypothermia or exposure to  cold between 2006 and 2010, equating to over 1,000 deaths per year.   During these extreme cold weather events, infrastructure and  emergency services are critical, and any disruption poses a serious  threat to the health and safety of Americans in the affected area.   Last winter's events made me realize that if we had a critical  infrastructure attack in the middle of winter, particularly in places  in the northern half of the country, we would be extremely vulnerable.  If terrorists choose to take advantage of any of these circumstances to  amplify the deadly impacts of an attack, our elderly, our families, and  our first responders could be put in the most danger.   This bipartisan bill directs the Department of Homeland Security to  develop and conduct a terrorism training exercise that addresses the  effects of a successful terrorist attack on critical infrastructure  during extreme cold weather.   This exercise will help determine the best way for emergency  managers, State and local officials, and community stakeholders to  mitigate the impacts of such an attack and help keep people safe.   Mr. Speaker, this is an important bill. I urge my colleagues to  support it, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I am prepared  to close after the gentleman from Louisiana closes.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   The passage of the WINTER Act would ensure that the Department of  Homeland Security is doing its part to improve preparedness and  response to terrorism in the event of extreme cold.   I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 3669; winter is coming; and I  yield back the balance of my time.
