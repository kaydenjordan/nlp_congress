 Madam President, I rise today in support of the joint  resolution of disapproval, which would reinstate critical regulations  on methane emissions from the oil and gas industry.   Last summer, the Trump administration finalized a midnight rule that  weakened and in some cases altogether eliminated requirements that oil  and natural gas companies limit methane and volatile organic compound  emissions from their operations. This action was taken despite  methane's proven harmful impacts on air quality, health, and climate  change.   Methane leaks from oil and gas wells are often accompanied by leaks  of harmful carcinogens like benzene, resulting in health effects for  the most vulnerable, including children and seniors. My home State of  California is still dealing with the fallout of the Aliso Canyon gas  leak--the worst gas leak in U.S. history-during which more than 100,000  metric tons of methane was emitted into the air. Many nearby residents  reported having headaches, bloody noses, nausea, and rashes.   Methane also has more than 80 times the global warming potential of  carbon dioxide and accounts for 10 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas  emissions. According to one study, the Trump aministration action will  result in methane leaks equivalent to up to 592 million metric tons of  carbon dioxide. This will have irreversible effects on our climate.   In California, we are already experiencing the destructive effects of  climate change. California has seen recordbreaking and devastating  droughts, floods, and wildfires. These disasters cannot be separated  from global warming and the emissions of greenhouse gasses that cause  it.   I am glad to see Congress taking action to reinstate necessary  regulations on methane emissions, and I look forward to taking  additional action, along with my conngressional colleagues, to combat  climate change and ensure clean air for all Americans.   I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of this resolution.
