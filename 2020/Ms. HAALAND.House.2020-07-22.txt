 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Great  American Outdoors Act.   From the day I became the chairwoman of the National Parks, Forests,  and Public Lands Subcommittee, I have heard from constituents,  colleagues, and advocates about fixing the maintenance backlog and  fully funding LWCF and making it permanent.   LWCF has helped provide recreational opportunities for underserved  and low-income communities in nearly every Congressional district, and  last year, we passed an historic permanent authorization.   In my district, LWCF has supported the Valle del Oro National  Wildlife Refuge, Petroglyph National Monument, Tingley Beach recreation  area, the Elena Gallegos Open Space picnic area, and Martineztown Park.   The great American Outdoors Act will ensure LWCF's full $900 million  is used every year for conservation and environmental protection, to  boost local outdoor economies, and to protect intact ecosystems  essential for adapting to climate change.   The bill also establishes the National Park Service and Public Land  Legacy Restoration Fund to provide five Federal land management  agencies with up to $9.5 billion over 5 years to address the deferred  maintenance backlog on our public lands.   These agencies will now be able to aggressively address deferred  maintenance, improve visitor services, and support Tribal communities  in places like Carlsbad Caverns, White Sands National Parks, Chaco  Culture National Historical Park, and El Malpais National Monument.   Repairing the crumbling infrastructure on our public lands today is  critical so that future generations can enjoy them. I am proud of the  work we did to get this bill to this point, and I urge my colleagues to  invest in our National Parks and public lands, and vote ``yes'' on the  Great American Outdoors Act.
