 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this measure. Let me, first  of all, thank my good friend and fellow New Yorker, Mr. Crowley; and  our former chair of the Asia and the Pacific Subcommittee, Mr. Chabot,  for authoring this important resolution. I also want to thank Ed Royce,  chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, for his sustained focus on  this tragedy and his leadership in quickly bringing this measure to the  floor.   Mr. Speaker, we continue to see reports of Rohingya refugees fleeing  to Bangladesh and widespread hunger and malnutrition for those left  behind.   The Burmese military and security forces are waging a brutal campaign  of violence against unarmed civilians, including women and children,  killing, raping, and destroying lives and livelihoods.   The Rohingya people have been marginalized for decades, but the  unthinkable violence and human suffering since August is ethnic  cleansing, pure and simple--a description the Trump administration now  agrees with, although they were far too slow to say so--and possibly  even genocide.                                time  1415    Over the past 4 months, more than 600,000 men, women, and children  have fled to neighboring Bangladesh to find refuge in a country with  tremendous needs of its own. This is more than 10 times the number of  refugees the administration will allow into the United States this  year, the same administration that ended America's participation in the  U.N. effort to develop a global compact on migration, all this right in  the middle of the world's most serious refugee crisis in history. I say  shame on us. We should be doing more.   Bangladesh deserves our deep gratitude for opening its doors to the  Rohingya at a time when our government slams the door shut. The  Governments of Burma and Bangladesh have struck a deal to begin  repatriating Rohingya next month, but it is not clear that anyone is  interested in returning right now. In fact, there are reports of more  arrivals in Bangladesh each day on fishing boats for those who can  afford passage and on makeshift rafts for those who cannot.   People are leaving Burma out of fear; they are leaving because they  are hungry; and they are leaving because they know, if they stay, they  will die. The Burmese Government has not yet set appropriate conditions  for the voluntary, dignified, and safe return, including allowing an  independent United Nations fact-finding mission and addressing  citizenship issues.   The United States Congress has long defended the rights and freedoms  of the Burmese people, championing Burma's new leader, Aung San Suu  Kyi, during her many years under house arrest, supporting Burma's  historic 2015 decision, and remaining a committed partner in Burma's  ongoing democratic transition. With the measure before us today, this  body will continue to speak out on this issue. We support freedom and  respect for human rights in Burma.   This measure condemns the horrific actions of the military and  security forces, calls for an immediate cessation of its violence, and  urges the restoration of humanitarian access. It also calls for Aung  San Suu Kyi to exercise moral leadership, something that is needed now  more than ever.   We reject the army's claims that what is taking place in Burma is a  so-called counterterrorism measure. That is nonsense. It is textbook  ethnic cleansing; that is what it is.   We should also encourage other governments to stay engaged and  continue to address the pressing needs of these refugees, needs that  will only grow as long as this situation remains unresolved.   Lastly, we must also urge our own administration to hold members of  the Burmese military and security forces accountable for these  atrocities, and I have introduced sanctions legislation to do just  that.   Mr. Speaker, I support this measure, and I urge my colleagues to do  the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Crowley), the author of this resolution, a longtime advocate  for the people of Bangladesh and Burma, the Democratic Caucus chair,  and my fellow New Yorker.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Levin), my good friend, the senior member of the Ways and  Means Committee and a senior member of Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), my good friend and the chief deputy whip of  our House Democratic leadership.    Mr. Speaker, it is now my great pleasure to yield 2  minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), a champion  for human rights, especially for the rights of women and girls.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the plight of the Rohingya is not and will not be  forgotten. I think we heard it from both sides of the aisle with the  impassioned speeches today. Nor will we dismiss the suffering of  Burma's many other ethnic groups who have been abused by the Burmese  Armed Forces throughout decades of conflict.   Since August, we have seen over 600,000 Rohingya in Burma flee to  Bangladesh seeking refuge from Burma's murderous security forces. This  ethnic cleansing, and perhaps even genocide, is a direct result of the  failure of Burma's Government to protect the rights of all people  within their borders.   This resolution calls for the reimposition of targeted sanctions  against those responsible for this violence. It is the least we can do.  History is watching, so I again urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Royce for, once again, working with him  in a bipartisan fashion.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, in strong support of  this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I would first like to thank Ed Royce, the chairman of  the Foreign Affairs Committee. I agree with everything he said in his  remarks. I want to thank him for his hard work on this legislation. We  worked closely together to make this bipartisan bill as strong as  possible, while also taking care to limit any unintended consequences.  That is what we have been doing on the Foreign Affairs Committee, and  that is why we have been so successful in passing legislation. We do it  in a bipartisan way.   Let me begin by saying that the Palestinian system of so-called  martyr payments is downright disgusting. We are talking about a system  that involves paying people on a sliding scale based on the death and  destruction that they cause. It is simply sickening.   These payments clearly incentivize terrorist attacks, and they  further threaten prospects for peace, pushing the chance for a  Palestinian state further and further out of reach.   This legislation was named for Taylor Force, an American victim of  Palestinian terrorism. He was a West Point graduate and a veteran of  the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He was stabbed to death in Jaffa in  2016.   The question we face is: How do we compel the PA, the Palestinian  Authority, to end the martyr payment system?   In 2015, appropriations bills began to include language cutting off  funds for the Palestinian Authority by the amount that they spent on  so-called martyr payments, but that didn't curb the practice.                                time  1500    We stopped giving the Palestinian Authority direct assistance, but  the Palestinian Authority hasn't budged.   We are now considering this legislation, which cuts all funds that  directly benefit the Palestinian Authority if the Palestinian Authority  continues to make these payments. This will make it crystal clear to  the Palestinian Authority that so-called martyr payments are  unacceptable, period.   At the same time, the bill allows the United States to continue  humanitarian and democracy assistance, which is in our interest and the  interest of our ally Israel. It also includes a thoughtful exemption  proposed by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly) which exempts  childhood vaccinations from the cuts required under this bill.   Overall, I believe that this version of the Taylor Force Act strikes  the right balance. Chairman Royce and I worked very hard to come up  with a piece of legislation that both sides would support. The Foreign  Affairs Committee unanimously passed this legislation. The message  should be clear: this is not a partisan issue.   We must send a message to the Palestinian Authority that these so- called martyr payments, which are ``killing'' payments, must stop.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation that  ensures no unintended consequences, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Deutch), the ranking member of the Middle East and North  Africa Subcommittee, and a valued member of the Foreign Affairs  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Florida.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I think that points have been made on both sides of the  aisle with which we all agree. If the Palestinian Authority is serious  about peace and is serious about a two-state solution and is serious  about living in peace with Israel, then I think they have to be serious  about not paying people who murder, not paying people who are  terrorists, not paying people who randomly go over and stab somebody.   Taylor Force happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. No  other reason. That should not be left to stand. I think our colleagues  have all talked about what a wonderful young man he was, an exemplary  American, someone who played by the rules, kept his country safe, did  the right things, respected his own faith. We should respect him and  all the other people as well.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Gottheimer), my friend on the Financial Services Committee, a rising  star in Congress.    Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield 2 minutes to  the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Frankel), my good friend and valued  member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, if there are no other speakers on this side,  I am prepared to close. I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me close by saying that this bipartisan legislation  seeks to compel the Palestinian Authority to stop incentivizing acts of  terrorism against innocent victims, including American Taylor Force.   Now, the encouragement of hooligans and thugs to just randomly try to  kill people for no other reason than just to try to perpetrate violence  needs to be stopped. While the Palestinian Authority seems to be  encouraging knife attacks and terror attacks against Jewish Israelis,  it is important to say that being in the wrong place at the wrong time  leaves everybody vulnerable. That is what happened to Taylor Force. He  wasn't Jewish. He happened to be American, and he happened to be a  soldier in a war area and a very good, nice, decent human being. He  didn't deserve it.   Nobody deserves to be a victim of terror. But certainly, the victims  of terror, if we are going to cry out to help them, we have got to put  a stop to this disgusting practice of calling these murderers martyrs.  They are not martyrs. They are murderers. They have no regard for human  beings. They have no regard for anything. It is time for us to say:  Enough is enough.   In this current bill, it allows the United States to avoid any  unintended consequences such as the cessation of humanitarian  assistance, the right thing to do. I hope that the Palestinian  Authority will use this opportunity to stop these martyr payments, move  away from incitement, and move toward a two-state solution. Again, this  bipartisan legislation seeks to compel the Palestinian Authority to  stop acts of terrorism, to stop aiding and abetting acts of terrorism  against innocent victims, including American Taylor Force.   The gentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch) said that if someone drives  their car and hits somebody, nothing happens. But if someone drives  their car and kills somebody, they get a martyr payment. There is  something perverse about that. There is something just wrong about  that. And it is something that the United States needs to put its foot  down and say, once and for all: We will not tolerate violence.   Finally, let me say that this bill, aptly named as a tribute to  Taylor Force, to his parents whom I had the pleasure of meeting, and to  all of the people who knew him--he really was the driving force behind  this legislation. Because when we heard what had happened, it was so  abhorrent, it was so disgusting, that we felt we needed to get together  and do something.   So I want to thank the Force family. I want to thank my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle, especially Chairman Royce. This is  something that every Member of Congress and both sides of the aisle  should vote for.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1530     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I rise in support of this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I authored this bill, the Venezuela Humanitarian  Assistance and Defense of Democratic Governance Act, in the House with  our chair emeritus of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Ileana Ros- Lehtinen. I want to say that there is no Member of this body who has  done more to champion democracy and human rights in Venezuela than the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen).   I also want to thank her longtime staff director, Eddy Acevedo, who  is in his last week on Capitol Hill. Eddy has been such a positive  force on Venezuela and the entire Latin American region in support of  Ileana's work. He has been a consistent collaborator with my staff, and  his work here will be sorely missed.   I also want to say that I appreciate Chairman Royce's steadfast  commitment to the Venezuelan people and his support for this  legislation.   I also want to thank Senator Cardin for authorizing this measure in  the other body. I hope we will be able to work with the Senate, the  other body, to get this bill on the President's desk.  [[Page H9657]]    Mr. Speaker, with its massive energy resources, Venezuela should be  one of the wealthiest countries in the world. Unfortunately,  irresponsible policies put in place by President Maduro and his  predecessor, Hugo Chavez, brought the country to near economic collapse  and created a dangerous humanitarian crisis.   The statistics tell a tragic story. Maternal deaths in the country  increased by 66 percent from 2015 to 2016, while infant deaths  increased by 30 percent. There were 240,000 confirmed malaria cases in  Venezuela in 2016, which is a 76 percent increase over 2015.   A survey carried out by three reputable Venezuelan universities found  that nearly three-quarters of Venezuelans lost an average of at least  19 pounds in 2016 as a result of lack of proper nutrition.   Despite massive shortages of food and medicine, President Maduro  continues to reject efforts to bring humanitarian assistance into the  country. Last summer, Mr. Maduro handed control of the country's food  supply over to the Venezuelan military, and while many Venezuelans  starve, some of the military brass are making money hand over fist by  selling the country's scarce food supplies on the black market. That is  like letting the fox into the chicken coop.   In short, President Maduro is running Venezuela into the ground. It  is horrific for that country's people, and it is a concern for our own  security as this country in our neighborhood becomes less and less  stable. So I support targeted sanctions that hold corrupt and abusive  Venezuelan officials accountable.   But that must be only a part of our policy. We also must be focused  on getting food and medicine to those in most need in the country. This  bill calls on the USAID and the State Department to develop a strategy  to provide humanitarian assistance to Venezuela while at the same time  instructing our Ambassador of the United Nations to work with partners  at the U.N. Security Council and throughout the U.N. system to  multilaterally address the country's crisis.   This is urgent business, Mr. Speaker. We need to put U.S. aid, the  USAID, and the United Nations on a path toward providing much-needed  humanitarian assistance to the Venezuelan people. We want to choke off  the government. The government is a cancer on the Venezuelan people,  but we don't want to hurt the Venezuelan people. That is what the  legislation is all about. That is why I wrote it, that is why I  authored it, and that is why we agree on a bipartisan basis.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen  and myself. It is important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Sires), my good friend and a valued member of the Foreign  Affairs Committee and the ranking member of the Western Hemisphere  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), my good friend and a member of the  Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Florida an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   In closing, I emphasize again that Venezuela is in crisis and we  cannot wait any longer to take action. By passing the Venezuela  Humanitarian Assistance and Defense of Democratic Governance Act, we  can begin to provide the Venezuelan people with the resources they so  desperately need.   But the United States, obviously, cannot do this alone. Sustained  leadership is needed to address the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela  from the U.N. Secretary General, members of the Security Council, and  other international partners.   It is easy to talk about another country in the abstract, but these  are human beings who are dying and sick. They are human beings just  like us, and it behooves us to make sure that, while we condemn the  brutality of the regime that has a stranglehold on that country, we  feel only sympathy for the people. That is what this bill tries to  address.   So I again urge my colleagues to support this legislation.   I want to again commend my partner from Florida, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen,  who has done so much work with me through the years, and our chairman,  Ed Royce, whom it has been a real pleasure to work with.   This is another example of important bipartisan legislation that  comes out of the Foreign Affairs Committee. I think that we set a  dialogue and a blueprint for people coming together and working  together. I think that is what the American people want to see.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1600     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure.   Let me start by thanking the chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Committee, Ed Royce of California, for his leadership and for moving a  second measure forward today on the crisis in Venezuela.   I also thank Mr. DeSantis for authorizing this resolution, which  expresses deep concern about the political, economic, social, and  humanitarian crisis in Venezuela.   I again thank Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the gentlewoman from Florida, who  is really our leader when it comes to things in the Western Hemisphere.   Let me just say that, when the Venezuelan President, Nicolas Maduro,  chose to move forward with a sham constituent assembly election in  July, as far as I am concerned, he took the final step in making his  country a full-blown dictatorship. The majority of Venezuelans stayed  clear of polling stations and chose not to participate in what was yet  another effort from that government to distract from the country's real  problem, which, as we have been saying, is a humanitarian crisis  created by President Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chavez, an  increasingly dangerous human rights climate.   Just last week, the Venezuelan human rights group, Foro Penal, joined  Human Rights Watch in releasing a report documenting abuses in the  country that have taken place over the past year. I would like to  mention a few statistics from this report that shows you just how  repressive the Venezuelan Government has become.   Fifty-four hundred people have been detained in relation to  antigovernment protests in early April; 3,900 of them are still subject  to arbitrary criminal prosecutions and measures that limit their  freedoms. And 757 civilians were prosecuted by military courts in  violation of both Venezuelan and international law. Even more  alarmingly, 124 Venezuelans were killed and 2,000 injured this year  while taking part in antigovernment protests.   The Human Rights Watch report states:         In 53 cases involving at least 232 people, detainees were       subjected to physical and psychological abuse, with the       apparent purpose of either punishing them or forcing them to       incriminate themselves or others. In some of these cases, the       abuses suffered by the detainees clearly constituted torture.       These include electric shocks, severe beatings, being hung in       stress positions, sleep deprivation, asphyxiation, and sexual       abuse, including, in some cases, rape.    In an August report, the Office of the United Nations High  Commissioner for Human Rights expressed a similar sentiment pointing to  ``the existence of a policy to repress political dissent and instill  fear in the population to curb demonstrations.''   I think it is important to point out that, year after year, Democrats  and Republicans have come to the House floor to call attention to the  erosion of democracy in Venezuela. As my colleagues have said,  Venezuela should be the leader in South America, the most prosperous  country in South America, with huge oil reserves. Instead, it is a  basket case because of Maduro and because of Chavez.    For many years, it seemed that the United States was an outlier in  raising our voices, while many in the hemisphere remained silent.  Fortunately, that has changed. Leaders throughout the Americas have  been increasingly willing to stand with the people of Venezuela.   It is hard to find a silver lining for Venezuela in such a dark time,  but I do hope, from the strong resolve of our friends in Latin America  and around the world in rejecting Venezuela's sham constituent assembly  and calling out human rights abuses in the country, they will realize  that we care about them, that we know what is going on, and that we are  not going to let their repressive government sweep things under the  rug.   In November, the European Union put in place a wide range of  sanctions on Venezuela, including an arms embargo, visa bans, and asset  freezes. Our friends in Canada imposed sanctions on human rights  violators in the Maduro government, and, on October 26, Canadian  Foreign Minister Freeland hosted the Lima Group of Foreign Ministers in  Toronto to seek a hemispheric solution to the crisis in Venezuela.   The OAS, the Organization of American States, has also played a  critical role in increasing pressure on the Maduro regime, particularly  under the leadership of OAS Secretary General Luis Almagro.   But we cannot rely on the OAS alone. The United Nations, both with  the Security Council and through the Office of the Secretary-General,  must do much more to bring attention to Venezuela on the world stage  and hold its leaders accountable.   And today, the House of Representatives, here in Washington, goes on  record again underscoring our commitment to the people of Venezuela and  condemning the destructive policies of the Maduro regime. With this  measure, we are saying enough is enough.   Mr. Speaker, I again thank Mr. DeSantis for authoring this  resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, let me say that we have spent a lot of time  talking about Venezuela on the House floor today. I think that is a  good thing. I think it is good that people know what is happening in  Venezuela, and I think it is good to know that the tyrants in Venezuela  know that we know what is happening in Venezuela.                                time  1615    The eyes of the world are watching Venezuela and its government.  President Maduro must make a real commitment to free and fair elections  and release all political prisoners.   In particular, I would like to note the detention of American citizen  Joshua Holt and to urge his immediate release on humanitarian grounds.   I think it is important for us to raise these issues on the House  floor, so I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 259.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
