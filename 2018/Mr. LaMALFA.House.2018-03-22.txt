 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to salute the caregivers who  support those living with Alzheimer's disease or a related dementia in  our community.   Over 5 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease, including 5,000 in  my home county of Butte in northern California. It is also the most  expensive disease in America. Medicare and Medicaid pay two-thirds of  all the costs. This is unacceptable and unsustainable.   This is a tremendous burden to our country. From my perspective, if  we are going to have a shot at reducing government spending, we have to  advance the movement to cure Alzheimer's and do something to lower the  cost of care and also reduce the burden on families who suffer as they  watch their loved ones dealing with this disease.   This is why I joined 32 of my House colleagues in cosponsoring the  BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act. This would create a public  health response to Alzheimer's and would help educate community members  and doctors on dementia detection, diagnosis, symptom management, even  brain health and prevention of dementia.   I will continue to fight for quality, affordable healthcare for  seniors nationwide. We must do everything in our  [[Page H2032]]  power to preserve Medicare and Medicaid for future generations.                            ____________________
