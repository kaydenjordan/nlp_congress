 Mr. President, I was absent due to an urgent  family matter requiring my attention when the Senate voted on vote No.  200 on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to  Calendar No. 551, S. 4653. On vote No. 200, had I been present, I would  have voted yea.                            ____________________
