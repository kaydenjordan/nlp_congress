 Mr. President, this vote had to be held open in order to  allow time for Vice President Pence to come down and break a tie.   My colleagues and I came to the floor weeks ago to make clear that  this harmful legislation should not come to the floor. Republicans  didn't listen to us, and they didn't listen to women across the country  who made it clear that restricting women's access to the full range of  reproductive care is unacceptable. We are not going to give up. We are  going to keep holding them accountable, and we are going to keep making  sure that women's voices are heard.   I want to thank all of my colleagues who have already come and will  continue to come to the floor today to stand against this shameful,  dangerous resolution.   The march that was held after President Trump was inaugurated was one  of the most inspiring events I have ever had the opportunity to be a  part of. Millions of people--men and women--marched in Seattle in my  home State, here in Washington, DC, and in cities and towns in between  and all across the world. They carried signs, they chanted, and they  made it absolutely clear that when it comes to women's rights and  healthcare, people across the country do not want to go backward. Since  then, millions of people have continued to speak up and stand up. And  last Friday, by the way, was no different.   Republicans have been threatening for years now to dismantle the  Affordable Care Act, but it took just a few weeks for families  nationwide to stand up and fight back and shut down a deeply harmful  plan that would have taken healthcare away from tens of millions of  people, spiked our premiums, targeted seniors for higher costs, and cut  off access to critical services at Planned Parenthood.   I was so inspired by the countless people who bravely shared their  personal stories about their health and their loved ones in order to  make clear just how damaging--and even deadly--TrumpCare would have  been. I am proud to say that women led the way and made it known, in no  uncertain terms, that Republicans would be held fully accountable for  the disastrous TrumpCare legislation.   And try as they might, last week, Republicans couldn't ignore them.  This was an absolute, undeniable victory for women and families in this  country.   But while TrumpCare was dealt a significant blow last week, it is  clear the terrible ideas that underpin it live on now, today, in this  Republican Congress. It is unprecedented that we are here, with the  Vice President breaking a tie vote on an attack on women's health  across this country.   We are here today, once again, because President Trump and  Republicans in Congress are not getting the message. Today, continuing  on their extreme, anti-women agenda, Senate Republicans are rushing now  to roll back a rule that protects family planning providers from being  discriminated against and denied Federal funding.   Let me explain a little bit about what family planning providers mean  to our communities. Those providers that are part of the title X  program--which has, by the way, bipartisan history--deliver critical  healthcare services nationwide, and they are especially needed in our  rural and our frontier areas.   In 2015 alone, title X provided basic primary and preventive  healthcare services--services like Pap tests and breast exams and birth  control and HIV testing--to more than 4 million low-income women and  men at nearly 4,000 health centers. In my home State of Washington,  tens of thousands of patients are able to receive care at these centers  each year, and they often have nowhere else to turn for their  healthcare. In fact, 40 percent of women who receive care at health  centers funded by title X consider it to be their only source of  healthcare.  [[Page S2123]]    So taking resources away from these providers, which this resolution  would do, would be cruel, and it would have the greatest impact on  women and families who need it the most. It would undo a valuable  effort by the Obama administration to ensure that healthcare providers  are evaluated for Federal funding based on their ability to provide the  services in question, not on ideology. In doing so, this resolution  would make it even easier for States led by extreme politicians to deny  family planning providers Federal dollars, not because of the quality  of care that they get or provide or their value to the communities they  serve, but based on whether the politicians in charge--the politicians  in charge--agree that women should be able to exercise their  constitutionally protected right to reproductive healthcare.   This is wrong. It is dangerous, and we cannot let this stand.   If Republicans think that millions of people who stood up last week  have suddenly stopped paying attention, they are sorely mistaken. And  if they think that Senate Democrats are not going to fight back, they  have another thing coming. They can expect every single Democrat in the  Senate--and I hope some Republicans who are concerned about losing  healthcare providers in their States--to fight back against this  resolution with everything they have.   This vote won by a tie vote, and the Vice President was the tie vote.  It will take one Republican this afternoon on the final vote to say yes  for the women in their State and States' rights to say no. That is all  we are asking for the women of this country.   While I have the floor, I want to say we should all be aware there is  more headed our way. In a matter of weeks, we all know that government  funding is going to run out. Everybody understands this. I know that  since they didn't get their way last week and they are pushing this  resolution so hard today to the point where they bring the Vice  President to break a tie, it is a safe bet that extreme Republicans are  going to try to attach riders that try to take away Planned Parenthood  funding in the spending bill for the rest of this year.   So I want to be very clear from the outset: That is a complete  nonstarter. We have been here before. We have shown that we can win,  and we are going to fight these efforts every step of the way.   So I urge people across the country to let their Senators know that  this is not acceptable. Stand up for women and families and for their  rights to take care of their own reproductive healthcare at the  facility that provides for them in their own communities.   I urge my colleagues: Don't make the same mistake again. End the  damaging political attacks on women, and stand with millions of women  and men and families. They need us.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I want to thank my colleagues who are  here speaking out against this shameful resolution that is before us  today that goes after women's rights and their opportunity to make  their own healthcare decisions with their own provider.   I, too, want to echo the comments that were just made. I find it  amazing that the Republicans have yielded back all of their time. They  are not going to come out here and defend their vote; they are just  going to take the vote.   In fact, it seems clear to me that President Trump is clearly focused  on attacking women's healthcare--so much so that he sent his women's  health adviser, Vice President Pence, here just moments ago to break a  tie on this latest disgusting attack on women's healthcare. It is truly  appalling.  [[Page S2126]]    Women and men across the country are watching what is happening here  today, watching what Republicans are trying to do, and they are paying  attention.                          Nomination of Neil Gorsuch    Madam President, I wish today's resolution was the only shameful  attack on women's health to talk about, but sadly that is not the case.  So I do want to take a few minutes at this time to talk about another  one that is very critical to women and families--not just today, but  actually for years and years to come it will be happening, and that is  the Supreme Court.   Last week I announced I would be voting against Judge Neil Gorsuch's  nomination to the Supreme Court, and I will oppose a cloture motion  ending debate. I did not reach that conclusion lightly. I consider my  decisions about whether to support a lifetime appointment to the  Supreme Court to be among the most important and consequential choices  I make as a Senator. But I made it in part because this is not a normal  nomination.   This process really began about 12 months ago when Senate Republicans  refused to even consider President Obama's nominee to the Supreme  Court, Judge Merrick Garland. And because since President Trump entered  office, he has shown complete disregard for the law, for our  Constitution, for the well-being of families across the country,  leaving me unable to trust that he is acting in our Nation's best  interest, I am unable to support his choice for the Supreme Court.   In addition to my deep concerns about this process and this  administration, I also have strong concerns about this nominee  specifically. Today, as Republicans appear to be rushing Judge  Gorsuch's nomination through the Judiciary Committee as fast as they  can, I want to lay out why putting Judge Gorsuch on the Supreme Court  would be an attack on women's health, rights, and opportunity, one that  has the potential to undo decades of progress we have made toward  making sure women are equally able to participate in and contribute to  our country.   The Trump administration has broken almost every one of its promises,  but one it has certainly kept is its promise to do everything in its  power to turn back the clock on women's health and women's rights.  Extreme Republicans in Congress are doing the same and have more,  apparently, in store. Right now, we are debating whether to undo a rule  that prevents discrimination against family planning providers based on  the kinds of services they provide to women. Congressional Republicans  are already gearing up to attach riders to the coming budget bills in  order to cut off access to critical services at Planned Parenthood for  millions of patients in this country. There are similar attempts to  undermine women's access to healthcare in cities and States nationwide.   More often than we would like, the Supreme Court is going to be the  place of last resort for protecting women's hard-fought gains. The buck  has to stop with the Supreme Court on women's health and rights.   I do not want Judge Neil Gorsuch anywhere near the bench. Time and  again, Judge Gorsuch has sided with the extreme rightwing and against  the tens of millions of women and men who believe that in this 21st  century, women should be able to make their own choices about their own  bodies.   Let me give a few examples. When the Tenth Circuit ruled in the case  of Hobby Lobby v. Burwell that a women's boss--a woman's boss--could  decide whether her insurance would include birth control, Judge Gorsuch  didn't just agree, he thought the ruling should have gone further. That  alone would be enough for me to oppose this nomination, but  unfortunately there is more.   Judge Gorsuch has argued that birth control coverage included in the  ACA as an essential part of a woman's healthcare--one that has now  benefited 55 million women--is what he calls a ``clear burden'' on  employers that would not long survive.   When it comes to Planned Parenthood, he has already weighed in on the  side of defunding our Nation's largest provider of women's healthcare.  What was his reasoning? Well, Judge Gorsuch thought that in light of  completely discredited sting videos taken by extreme conservatives,  women in the State of Utah should have a harder time accessing the care  they need. Just this week, the makers of those false videos, by the  way, got 15 felony charges. Women deserve independence and objectivity  in a Supreme Court Justice, and that is clearly not it.   Attempts to control women's bodies aren't always about reproductive  rights. Sure enough, Judge Gorsuch is on the wrong side here as well.  He concurred in a ruling against a transgender woman who was denied  regular access to hormone therapy while she was in prison. This ruling  rejected the idea that under our Constitution, denying healthcare  services is cruel and unusual punishment. Think about that. That is not  the kind of judgment I want to see on the bench, and I think most  families would agree.   I also want to be clear as well about what Judge Gorsuch's nomination  could mean for a woman's constitutionally protected right to safe,  legal abortion services under the historic ruling in Roe v. Wade, which  was, by the way, reaffirmed just last summer by the Court. In his  nomination hearings, Judge Gorsuch wouldn't give a clear answer on  whether he would uphold this ruling which has meant so much to so many  women and families over the last four decades.   Judge Gorsuch has donated repeatedly to politicians who are dead-set  on interfering with women's constitutionally protected healthcare  decisions, and he has even made deeply inaccurate comparisons between  abortion and assisted suicide.   I remember the days before Roe v. Wade very clearly. I heard and saw  firsthand the stories of women faced with truly impossible choices  during those times. Women from all across the country have shared  deeply personal experiences because they know what it would mean to go  backward. I know that millions of women who have already done so much  to lead the resistance against this administration and its damaging,  divisive agenda are going to fight this nomination as hard as they can.  They know the Trump Presidency will be damaging enough for 4 years, but  Judge Gorsuch's nomination could roll back progress for women over a  lifetime. I am proud to stand with them and do everything I can to make  sure they are heard loud and clear here in the Senate, and I oppose  Judge Gorsuch's nomination in light of everything it would mean for  women now and for generations to come. Next week is when we will vote  on that.   Today here in the Senate, we just saw a historic moment. The Senate  Republicans put forth a resolution that would allow States to deny  funding to providers in their States who provide healthcare services  for women--funding that is desperately needed. They got only 50 votes,  and those in opposition got 50 votes, so they brought over the Vice  President of the United States, and he broke that tie in order for us  to be here to debate this resolution now. This vote will now occur,  under the order, later this afternoon, and he will be brought back once  again to deny women the healthcare choices they deserve to have. It is  a sad day for the Senate.   I want my friends, colleagues, and the women who have stood up and  have spoken out since the day after the election, marched here in  Washington, DC, and across the country, to know that I stand with them.  My voice will not be silenced. I will continue to fight back.   I will say one more time that it will take one more Republican on the  other side this afternoon--one--to stand up and let their voice be  heard and say that women should get access equally in their States for  the healthcare they deserve.   Madam President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I have to say that this is a sad day for  the Senate. I know many of us here today--certainly my Democratic  colleagues--are truly appalled. Once  [[Page S2132]]  again, instead of working on the many pressing issues at hand,  Republicans are continuing their tired, dangerous obsession with  attacking women's health.   Once again, women's health is being used as a political football,  with Republicans attempting to cut off access to vital healthcare  services. Once again, millions of families across the country are  watching Congress, wondering why there isn't just one more Republican  who will stand up for them.   The Republicans just held a vote open for nearly an hour to force a  vote that would allow politicians to discriminate against family  planning providers. Of course, whenever they can't make a vote, when  women's health is being attacked, whom do Senate Republicans call to  break that tie in the Senate? Vice President Mike Pence.   We have actually seen this before. We all remember what happened in  the nomination of Secretary DeVos, and we all know that enough is  enough. This is shameful. This is wrong. It cannot stand.   Families have spoken time and again, and they have made it absolutely  career that when it comes to women's rights and healthcare, they do not  want to go backward. But today, thanks to my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle, thanks to Vice President Pence, the Senate will hold  a vote on whether critical healthcare services should be taken away  from millions of women across the country.   Let's not forget, it hasn't even been a week since people nationwide  completely rejected TrumpCare, that disastrous bill that would have  undermined women's rights and healthcare in so many ways.   Now, here in the Senate today, we are about to vote on whether a  young woman should be able to go to the provider that she trusts to get  birth control; whether it is Pap tests, breast exams, birth control, or  HIV testing, which should be more or less available to women across the  country; whether healthcare providers are evaluated for Federal funding  based on their ability to provide services or ideology; whether women  are able to exercise their constitutionally protected rights to  reproductive healthcare; and whether the Senate is going to turn back  the clock today on women's health.   For me and for Democrats, and I know even for some Republicans, it is  disappointing, deeply disappointing, that we are even having this vote  today--a vote that was jammed through, with 48 Democrats and 2  Republicans voting no and Vice President Pence coming down to break the  tie.   Put simply, rolling back this rule today will put at risk women's  lives, like a constituent of mine from Tacoma, WA. She wrote me a  letter recently to tell me the many reasons this is so important to  her.   When she was 20, she was uninsured. She had no other options. A  family planning center was there for her. During a routine Pap test,  her doctor discovered a precancerous condition in her cervix. That led  to surgery, which saved her life and saved her fertility.   Without access to that provider, she would not have been able to get  a regular Pap smear and checkup and most likely would have developed  cervical cancer. She would not have been able to get pregnant, go on to  have a daughter, become a community college counselor, and today, at  the age of 65, be cancer-free.   I hope that some of my Republican colleagues are listening and that  they think of women just like this, whose lives are healthier and have  been saved because of the services of so many family planning centers.  That is who I will be thinking about. That is what has always kept me  going.   I urge people across the country right now to let Senators know that  this vote today, this rule is not OK. It is not acceptable. Make phone  calls. Go on Facebook. Tweet about it. Everything helps. Tell your  Senator today that in about an hour, with their vote, to stand up for  you, for your family, and for women across the country.   We need only one more Republican--one more--to join us. This vote  that we are about to have in about an hour is dead even, on the razor's  edge. Fifty Senators--48 Democrats and 2 Republicans--will vote to  reject this harmful, disgusting resolution. We just need one more  Republican to join us, to stand on the side of women and men and  families, and put an end to this damaging political attack on women.   I am sure people will hear about this. I am going to be here on the  floor. Many of my colleagues are going to be out here talking about it.  People nationwide will have the opportunity to know exactly where every  Republican stands on this.   I urge our Republican colleagues: Stop to think about what you are  doing, taking away the ability of women in communities across our  country to go to the provider they trust for the care that is most  important to them, their families, and our country's future. I urge  them to make the right choice.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I see my colleague from Illinois is here.  While she is setting up, I just want everybody to realize what is  happening here. We are debating a rule that, should the Republicans-- with the Vice President voting to break the tie this afternoon--put it  in place, will allow the discrimination of healthcare providers for  women across the country.   I have many Democratic colleagues here making the case for those  women, mostly low income, who have no other access, particularly in our  rural and urban regions. I just want to note that there are no  Republicans out here saying why this rule needs to be passed. They just  want it done, over with; the Vice President to break the tie, and it is  out of here. We are noticing. Women are noticing. People are noticing.   I thank all of my Democratic colleagues and a few brave Republicans  who are with us for their support to get this done. We need one more  Republican to be able to defeat this.   I yield to my colleague.    Mr. President I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I want Senate Republicans who are about  to take this vote--and Vice President Pence--to be very clear on what  they are about to do. As a direct result of their choices today,  extreme politicians in States across the country will have greater  power to take away women's choices.   I think it speaks volumes that the vote to uphold this rule--which  simply says family planning centers, where women can exercise their  constitutionally protected rights, should not be  [[Page S2138]]  discriminated against--is bipartisan. But do you know what I think is  most striking about this vote? The deafening silence from the group of  almost entirely male Republican Senators who are voting today to make  it harder for women to get the healthcare they need. Not one spoke  today to justify this vote. Where are those Republican Senators? Why  did they feel so entitled not just to interfere with women's healthcare  decisions but to do so without explaining themselves? If they are  ashamed of their votes, which they should be, they had ample  opportunity to reconsider.   I came to the floor with my Democratic colleagues weeks ago to urge  Republicans not to bring this damaging legislation to the floor. We  asked for just one Republican vote today to prevent this attack on  women's health. And women across the country, in Republican and  Democratic States, called, emailed, tweeted, and organized to say that  these restrictions on women's access to healthcare have no place in our  country or in the 21st century. But what have these 50 Senate  Republicans done? They refused to listen, and they refused to answer  for their actions.   Frankly, women deserve better. The thing is, women know it. So today,  as a woman, I am angry. As a mother and a grandmother, I am furious  about what attacks like this mean for our daughters and our  granddaughters, especially those who are struggling and  disproportionately rely on family planning centers. But as a Senator, I  am more confident than ever that Republicans who fail to listen to the  women of this country do so at their own peril. I have had the chance  to see how much impact women have when they call and march and organize  and make their voices heard.   The fact that Vice President Pence had to come and break this tie  today, that Senate Republican leaders could not twist enough arms to  pass this bill on their own, is clear evidence. So is the failure of  House Republicans' abysmal TrumpCare bill, which would have cut off  access to critical services at Planned Parenthood.   I know without a doubt that Republican Senators who vote against  women and with their extreme base today and who rely on this anti-women  administration to jam this resolution through will be held accountable  both by women across the country and women right here in the Senate. We  will keep making our voices heard. We will fight back against these  attacks on our rights and our own self-determination, and ultimately,  you can be sure, we will win.   I yield the floor.   I yield back the time on this side.   The joint resolution was ordered to a third reading and was read the  third time.
