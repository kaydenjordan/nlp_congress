 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the North  Carolina Sweet Potato Commission's 60th anniversary.   In 1961, six sweet potato producers chartered the commission to  support growers and to maintain North Carolina's standing as a leading  sweet potato producing State. They are now more than 400 sweet potato  growers strong as well as packers, processors, and business associates  who remain dedicated to supporting our State's prosperous sweet potato  industry.   Since 1971, North Carolina has ranked as the number one sweet potato  producing State in the U.S. with 65 percent of the Nation's sweet  potato production. North Carolina sweet potato producers are family  farmers who have been cultivating their land for generations growing  many different crops. They work day and night, year after year to ship  delectable, high quality, nutritious North Carolina sweet potatoes all  across the country and the world.   Agriculture is the backbone of North Carolina's economy, and the  sweet potato industry is absolutely critical to our food supply in  North Carolina and in the country. It is not an understatement to say  that the North Carolina Sweet Potato Commission has more than fulfilled  its founding mission to strengthen our State's sweet potato production,  and I congratulate them on their 60th anniversary.   May they have many more years of providing every American with one of  our Nation's safest, nutritious, and might I add, delicious vegetables  grown.             Congress Must Aggressively Address the National Debt     Mr. Speaker, our national debt exceeds $28.1 trillion.  Congress year after year continues spending money with seemingly no  regard for the debts we are pushing onto future generations. While it  was necessary to spend a significant amount of money to get us through  the COVID-19 crisis, we must now move aggressively to address the  national debt, in my opinion, the most significant domestic threat that  our country faces. And the sooner we take action the better.                                time  1030    Unfortunately, the current administration doesn't seem to feel the  need to pursue fiscal restraint. President Biden's spending agenda is  hurting families and small businesses across the country. Meanwhile, he  has sent Congress a $6 trillion budget request.   This additional spending will lead to even more inflation. The  excessive spending Congress recently approved has already resulted in  inflation. We  [[Page H3247]]  see it every day in the skyrocketing prices of goods. And if the  President and Democrats in Congress get their way on major tax hikes,  the economy and working families will be hurt even more.   Today, the American dollar is still king, which is how we can print  and borrow money with seemingly little consequence. But huge debt-to- GDP ratios threaten that standing and could easily cause a significant  decline in our standard of living.   Rampant inflation, which is really just a hidden tax, and a  significantly devalued dollar could cripple our economy and easily lead  future generations right back to the days of centuries before us.   Now, in contrast, the budget proposed by the Republican Study  Committee for fiscal year 2022 balances the annual budget in 5 years by  reducing spending and maintaining pro-growth policies. It is the most  pro-life budget ever written, with 17 pro-life provisions included. It  protects Second Amendment rights, secures our border, and offers real  solutions to return our country to fiscal responsibility.   Mr. Speaker, the Republican Study Committee budget combats  Washington's out-of-control spending and puts American taxpayers first.  We should all be able to agree it is long past time to bring fiscal  sanity to Washington.                            ____________________
