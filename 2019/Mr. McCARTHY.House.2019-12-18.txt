A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I must warn you, I am about to say  something my Democratic colleagues hate to hear: Donald J. Trump is  President of the United States. He is President today. He will be  President tomorrow. And he will be President when this impeachment is  over.   Madam Speaker, when they accept that, maybe this House can get back  to work for the American people.   But, tonight, I rise not as the leader of the opposition to this  impeachment or as the elected Representative from the Central Valley of  California. I rise as Kevin McCarthy, citizen, no better, no worse than  the 435 Representatives who are in this Chamber or the 330 million  Americans watching this institution make what I believe to be one of  the worst decisions we have ever made.   It doesn't matter whether you are Democrat or Republican, whether you  are liberal or you are conservative, whether you are the first  generation or the tenth, at our core, we are all American, all of us.  We choose our future. We choose what kind of Nation we want to be.   Here is our choice tonight: Will we let impeachment become an  exercise of raw political power, regardless if it damages our country?  Or will we protect the proper grounds and process for impeachment now  and in the future?   For months, Democrats and many in the media have attempted to  normalize the impeachment process that would remove a duly elected  President from office. After 3 years of breathless and baseless  outrage, this is their last attempt to stop the Trump Presidency.   Madam Speaker, Speaker Pelosi even recently admitted that Democrats  have been working on this impeachment for 2\1/2\ years. Those were her  words; they were not mine. Because they lost to him in 2016, they will  do anything or say anything to stop him in 2020.   That is not America. That is not how democratic republics behave.  Elections matter. Voters matter. And in 11 months, the people's voice  will be heard again.   Impeachment is the most consequential decision Congress can make  other than sending our men and women into war. Yet, 85 days ago,  Speaker Pelosi chose to impeach the President of the United States. She  wrote the script and created an artificial timeline to make the details  fit. Why else are we doing this just hours before Christmas?   If that is all it was, a rush to judgment, she could be forgiven. But  before the Speaker saw one word, one shred of evidence, she moved to  impeach.   In the past, in this body, such a step demanded a vote from all of us  from the start, but not only did she move to impeach before she gave  this House and the hundreds of millions of people we represent a say in  whether to pursue an impeachment inquiry, she threw out the bipartisan  standards this House gave Presidents Nixon and Clinton.   That is why I immediately sent Speaker Pelosi a letter asking her to  follow the rules of history, of tradition, to follow those standards  that have served America well. What did she say? She rejected it. She  rejected it because Democrats knew a fair process would crumble their  case.   A fair process would have exposed to the American public what many  already knew: Democrats have wanted to impeach President Trump since  the day he was elected, and nothing was going to get in their way,  certainly not the truth.   Madam Speaker, Chairman Schiff said he had evidence, more than  circumstantial, of collusion. That was false.   In January, when we all stood in this body, we stood up, we raised  our hands, and we swore that we would uphold the Constitution. A few  mere hours after that, Congresswoman Tlaib said she was going to  impeach the mothereffer. Those are not my words.   A year before taking the majority, Chairman Nadler campaigned to the  Democrats that he wanted to be chairman of the Judiciary Committee,  where impeachment is, The New York Times writes, Madam Speaker, because  he is the ``strongest Member to lead a potential impeachment.''   Congressman Raskin, a leading Democrat on the Judiciary Committee,  one who the Democrats had represent them in the Rules Committee for  these articles just yesterday, told a crowd he would impeach President  Trump 2 days before he was even sworn into office.   What we have seen is a rigged process that has led to the most  partisan and least credible impeachment in the history of America. That  is this legacy. Any prosecutor in this country would be disbarred for  such blatant bias, especially if that prosecutor was the fact witness,  the judge, and the jury.   Madam Speaker, Democrats haven't just failed on process. They have  also failed on evidence. I have heard a lot of debate on this floor  today, but I haven't heard one Member of this body dispute this simple  fact: President Trump provided lethal aid to Ukraine. It came before  the call; it came after the call; and it continues to this day.   President Trump provided Ukraine tank-busting bombs. The previous  administration, they gave blankets. This is the truth.   Meanwhile, the Democrat's case is based on secondhand opinions and  hearsay. Simply put, there are no grounds for impeachment.   As constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley--and I would challenge to  say he is probably the most respected, and we all know it--a Democrat  who did not vote for the President said, under oath: There was no  bribery. There was no extortion, no obstruction of justice, and no  abuse of power.   Based on the facts, based on the truth, based on the lack of  evidence, Turley called this the fastest, thinnest, and weakest  impeachment in U.S. history.   Such a definitive answer should be the end of all of this. But  Speaker Pelosi is still moving forward with this impeachment, without  evidence or facts or truth or public support. The Speaker says it is  out of allegiance to our Founders.    On this, I agree. I agree with the Speaker that we should listen to  the Founders. If one does, it is very clear that this impeachment is  unfounded and improper.   In the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton wrote there would always  be the greatest danger that impeachment would be driven by partisan  animosity instead of ``real demonstrations of innocence or guilt''-- that impeachment would be driven by partisan animosity instead of  ``real demonstrations of innocence or guilt.''   James Madison, another author of the Federalist Papers, wrote the  danger of legislative abuse ``must lead to the same tyranny as is  threatened'' by executive abuse.   The Founders did not want impeachment to be used for political or  partisan battles. If my colleagues do not want to follow the  constitutional high standards for undoing a national election, perhaps  they could have followed Speaker Pelosi's standard, at least the one  she promised to follow back in March. It was a very sensible standard.  She said that ``impeachment is so divisive,'' the evidence must be  ``overwhelming,'' ``compelling,'' and ``bipartisan.''   Not one of those criteria has been met today. Based on the facts,  based on the evidence, based on the truth, this impeachment fails even  that Pelosi test.   Those who now say removing President Trump would protect the  integrity of our democracy have it backward. By removing a duly elected  President on empty Articles of Impeachment, Congress will erode public  trust in our system of government.   I understand they dislike the President, his beliefs, the way he  governs, and even the people who voted for him. How do I know this?  Because they say so, day in and day out.  [[Page H12193]]    In 2016, they even dismissed his supporters, calling us  ``deplorables.'' Now, they are trying to disqualify our voice before  the 2020 election. They want to undo the results of the last election  to influence the next one.   As I said, President Trump will still be President when this is all  over. But Congress will have wasted months of time and taxpayer dollars  on impeachment rather than doing what the American people want us to  do. It didn't have to be this way.   Is this why we came here to serve, to trample on due process rights,  to issue more subpoenas than laws, to appease the new Democrat- socialist base? That is not leadership. That is raw partisan politics,  and they know it.   By refusing to acknowledge the truth or follow the facts by  substituting partisan animosity for real demonstrations of innocence or  guilt, and by continuing a 3-year effort to undermine the President,  this impeachment has divided this Nation without any concern for the  repercussions. Moreover, politicizing this process has discredited the  United States House of Representatives and could forever weaken the  remedy of impeachment.   To again quote Professor Turley, it is the Democrats' rush to  impeachment on these grounds, with unfair procedures, that is an  ``abuse of power.'' History will right that.   Madam Speaker, as I said at the beginning, we face a choice. Do you  trust the wisdom of the people, or do you deny them a say in their  government? Fortunately, the people will have the opportunity to speak  up and render their verdict in 11 months.                                time  2000    To my fellow Americans, if you approve of the way this House has  conducted their business, if you want to see your tax dollars go  forward to endless investigations, support this impeachment.   But if you want to restore a working Congress like the previous  Congress that listened to you and worked to bring the best economy this  country has ever seen and one that, once again, will work with the  President to get things done for you and your family, then join with us  in rejecting this baseless impeachment.   That is what is wonderful about this system of ours. We are a  government of, by, and for the people. Always remember, we work for  you, not the other way around.   Now, I will say this stronger and with more conviction than I have  ever said it before: In this time of great trial and tribulation, may  God bless America.
