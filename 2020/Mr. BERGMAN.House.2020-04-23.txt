 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Paycheck  Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act.   Less than a month ago, I stood on this floor and urged my colleagues  to support our small businesses by passing the CARES Act. Today, I am  here again asking the House to pass this bill and get it to the  President's desk so we can give our small businesses and healthcare  providers the additional assistance they need.   This bill provides an extra $75 billion to our hospitals and $25  billion for expanded testing capacity, with resources specifically set  aside for community health centers and rural health clinics. These  additional funds will have a dramatic impact in rural areas like  Michigan's First District, where access to testing has lagged and our  rural healthcare facilities are struggling to keep their doors open.   This legislation also refills the Paycheck Protection Program,  critical for the Upper Peninsula and northern Michigan's small  businesses. This temporary, targeted relief is our opportunity to send  a strong message to our Main Street businesses that we want them to be  able to open their doors when it is time to open our economy back up.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.                                time  1300
