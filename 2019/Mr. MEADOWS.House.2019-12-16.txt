 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of H.R. 2548, the Hazard  Eligibility and Local Projects Act.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Texas (Mrs.  Fletcher) for her fine work on this.   And I would like to give her a compliment. It is always interesting  to see how we can name these bills in the most creative ways to  actually let them resonate with the voters back home. So my  congratulations on calling this the HELP Act, and congratulations to  Mrs. Fletcher's staff as well, as they always, as you know, Mr.  Speaker, get very creative on how we can figure out acronyms to make  these bills have more pizzazz.   So this bill is a commonsense approach. It is certainly critical to  communities that have been impacted by disasters, where they can start  recovery in a much more efficient, smarter, and faster way.   Buyouts and relocation projects, in particular, are critical tools  for getting people and property out of harm's way, yet these projects  take time to plan and carry out.   This bill would allow communities to be eligible for mitigation  assistance for those projects commenced prior to their request for  assistance.   The bill ensures such projects must comply with all other eligibility  requirements.   Mr. Speaker, I would encourage the gentlewoman opposite, perhaps we  can even look at going a little bit further. She made mention of the  current NEPA standards and all of those that apply.   As we know, in the gentlewoman's home State of Texas, in my home  State of North Carolina, some of those Federal regulations actually are  part of the impediment of getting some of this disaster relief to the  people that are most affected.   I know that we have billions of dollars--that is billions with a B-- waiting to be deployed in my State of North Carolina, as in the  gentlewoman's State of Texas, so it is critically important that we  come together in a bipartisan fashion.   It doesn't help us to appropriate billions of dollars here on this  floor if it never reaches the ultimate destination, which is our  constituents who have been tragically, and many times horrifically, put  out of their homes and their communities.   This will allow communities to select early on the best mitigation  approach and begin these projects earlier to ensure a faster recovery.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this  legislation.   If the gentlewoman is prepared to close without any further speakers,  I would ask her to just give me a nod one way or another.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to go ahead and close right here and just  say, I encourage my colleagues to go ahead and vote for this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership, and I yield  back the balance of my time.                                time  1545
