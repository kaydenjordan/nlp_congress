 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my  friend, William Dalluge, Jr., a lifetime resident of Blue Mound,  Illinois, who retired as Pleasant View Township clerk in April.   William, who is known to everyone as ``Whompie,'' is a staple in the  Blue Mound community. Born and raised there, Whompie has always called  Blue Mound home. Even from a young age, he knew the importance of  giving back to his community. In 1961, he started a small business by  leasing and operating the Standard Gas station in town for 9 years. The  following 16 years, he was co-owner of the Blue Mound Furniture Store.  [[Page H5759]]    What is most remarkable about Whompie is that he has spent nearly all  his life in the service of others. Not only is he a U.S. Army veteran,  but Whompie sat on the Blue Mound Town Board for 4 years, serving as  the village president another 4.   He volunteered his time as a Boy Scout troop leader and has been  actively involved in the Interchurch Food Pantry since 1984. For the  past 29 years, the citizens of Blue Mound have known Whompie as their  Pleasant View Township clerk until his retirement this spring.   However, if you ask him, Whompie's greatest accomplishment has been  his nearly 69-year marriage to his wife, Nelda. Together, they have  three children, six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.   Whompie, congratulations on a well-earned retirement. Best wishes to  you and your family.                            ____________________
