 Mr. Speaker, the tired, the poor, the huddled masses  yearning to breathe free are still welcome in America, no thanks to  President Trump. Today, for the second time, President Trump lost a  ruling on his Muslim ban in the Federal courts of appeal.   The purpose of the President's ban is clear. The then Presidential  candidate Trump explicitly called for a total and complete shutdown of  Muslims entering the United States. Just last week, President Trump  criticized his revised ban as politically correct and called for a much  tougher version.   The President's executive order is a Muslim ban, plain and simple.  Any argument to the contrary is undercut by the President's own tweets.   President Trump, by his own words and by his own actions, is  abdicating America's moral leadership. The greatness of America is not  built on isolation and discrimination. It is built on the rule of law  and the ideals of equality and inclusion and on the rich history of  immigration.                            ____________________     Well, first, I thank the gentlewoman from the Virgin  Islands, Congresswoman Plaskett, and the gentleman from Texas, Marc  Veasey, for hosting tonight's Special Order hour on such an important  topic: racism and discrimination.   Before I begin, I want to take a moment to mark the 1-year  anniversary of the Pulse Nightclub shooting and to remember the 49  lives that were cut short in the deadliest mass shooting in our  Nation's history.   As we grieve for the victims and their families, we must continue to  stand in solidarity with the survivors and with the LGBTQ community  against hate, intolerance, for love, in support of our Nation's values  of equality and dignity for all.  [[Page H4840]]    The kind of intolerance, hate, and violence on display that day in  Orlando has become an alarming trend in this country, a trend that has  disturbingly been fueled by President Trump. According to the Southern  Poverty Law Center, 37 percent of the 1,094 bias-related incidents in  just the first month after the election referenced the President, his  campaign slogans, or his remarks about sexual assault.    As he did throughout his campaign, President Trump continues to speak  the language of racial and cultural grievance, pitting Americans  against one another and perpetuating the viciousness he pretends to  despise. The result is what you would expect: a spike in hate crimes  and hate speech.   I have seen in my district in New Jersey where anti-Semitic graffiti  was plastered on a pedestrian bridge. We have seen it at American  University and just down the road at the National Museum of African  American History and Culture, where nooses were found last month.  Communities of color know this pain all too well.   Mr. Speaker, I am really fortunate to be able to discuss an issue of  such importance to this Nation. This is one nation, under God,  indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.   You know, I have been very fortunate in my life to have been born  into a situation where a great American prior to me held this seat for  23 years in the 10th Congressional District of the State of New Jersey.  His name was Donald Payne. He was my father and he afforded me a  lifestyle, one of which I did not know of his suffering and pain  growing up as a young African American in this country. But even in  that situation, I have found myself--irrespective of being in that  position, I found myself in situations that have been dangerous and  uncomfortable.   As a young, 20-year-old--you know, when we are 20, we do things that  we probably shouldn't be doing at times. I was on my lunchtime going  downtown to pay a bill at a department store where I had my first  credit card, and I was running late. So what I decided to do was make a  U-turn on the main street, Broad Street, in Newark, New Jersey, which  is the largest street in the town. And I made a U-turn to come in front  of the store.   Naturally, you know, with my luck, a motorcycle police officer was  coming down the street at the same time. So he pulled me over, as he  should, and I was wrong. But I was using my cousin's car. So when he  asked me for my license and registration, I could not find the papers  that I needed and I was fumbling and nervous.   The officer leaned into the car and used the N-word and said: If you  don't find those documents in a minute, I will throw you so far under  the jail that they will never find you.   So this is very frightening for any citizen to go through. So I was  able to get my license, and I handed it to him. Just before that, they  would throw me so far under the jail that they would never find me  again. Once I handed him my license and it said that I was Donald  Payne, Jr., whose father was a sitting councilman in the city of  Newark, his whole attitude changed.   ``Don't you know that you could get hurt, or you could hurt someone,  or you have to be careful.'' A minute ago I was nothing. I would be so  far under the jail, they would never find me. But now that I am  connected to something or someone, all of a sudden we have become  paternal.   Mr. Speaker, there are millions of people in this country that aren't  connected to someone, and these are the types of things that they go  through. So I am just here to say that we must be vigilant. I believe  in this country; I believe in its greatness. I believe in the words in  the Pledge of Allegiance. I believe in the Constitution. We must make  it work for all Americans.
