 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. McClintock for yielding his time.   I had my speech all prepared, but I am not sure whether it is a San  Bernardino lovefest or a beat up on Paul Cook because he is leaving  this institution.   This is an example. Everybody knows that you can work together; you  can put your differences aside and get things done. I pride myself on  that. I am very, very passionate about certain things.   This bill sounds simple, the pollution going up and down that hill;  but, more so, anyone who has lived in a mountain community knows how  dangerous it is, particularly in the winter, and more so with a truck  with timber on it, the number of accidents that we have on those roads  up there--just the deaths--every year. We have always had problems, and  it is something I am very, very concerned about.    I do want to commend working with the Pacific Crest Trail  Association, working together so we could iron out some of these  things.   The relocation, as I think was already mentioned, will include  environmental review and will take care before the exchange takes  place.   And we have got a lot of people on this: the city of Big Bear Lake,  the Friends of Big Bear Valley, Big Bear Fire Department.   By the way, there are big bears up there. If you haven't met one  there, stay off the highways.   Anyway, the Big Bear City Community Services Department, the water  district, the community healthcare, the chamber of commerce, and the  local Big Bear chapter of the Sierra Club--and they have been great on  this.   It passed out of the House Natural Resources Committee on a  unanimous, bipartisan vote. Last December, nearly identical language  passed out of the House as H.R. 5513 with overwhelming bipartisan  support.   I appreciate the comments--even the sarcastic comments--of my  colleagues, and I truly am going to miss this institution.
