 Madam Speaker, last Saturday, we remembered the murder of  49 people at the Pulse massacre 5 years ago. Tomorrow, we will mourn 6  years since nine people were killed in their place of worship at Mother  Emanuel AME Church.   It sits with me every single day that in this country we lose friends  and family to the tragic and avoidable scourge of gun violence.   As of this weekend, we have reached 272 mass shootings in this  country. It is madness. These acts of violence, sometimes motivated by  hate, continue.   Yet, we--and the Senate in particular--have failed to enact  commonsense gun violence prevention legislation that would stem  bloodshed and end this loss. I implore the Senate to hear the cries of  those in their communities, our constituents, and pass the two  universal background check bills that the House sent over to the Senate  in March.   Families should no longer have to bury their loved ones when we have  the ability and the responsibility to close deadly loopholes in our  system.   Gun ownership is an important part of our American culture and our  Constitution, and now is our chance to come together in a way that  preserves this part of our heritage while protecting our constituents  and saving lives.                            ____________________
