 Madam President, earlier this month, the Chinese  Communist Party's relentless propaganda efforts rose to the forefront  of international discussion yet again. China's authoritarian government  squashes opposition at home without hesitation, but its censorship and  propaganda spreads far beyond China's borders.   The CCP uses an array of insidious means to push its messages across  national boundaries. Concerns that the CCP's influence is seeping into  Hollywood continues to grow. This issue flared up once again this  month. Why? Well, in a word, ``Barbie.'' You heard me right. A movie  about a plastic doll is the last place you would expect national  security questions to arise, but it has.   One trailer for the ``Barbie'' movie depicted a cartoon map of the  title character's world travels. On the map is a roughly drawn  continent of Asia, but it might be more than just a cartoon character's  doodle. The map includes a dotted line extending out from the east  shore of China.   Well, that line is curiously similar to what is known as the nine- dash line. Everyone in the defense space is familiar with this line. It  is a Chinese-drawn boundary in the South China Sea. China uses this  boundary to claim ownership of maritime territory, even  [[Page S3572]]  though the United Nations International Court of Justice rejected its  claims on that territory in 2016.   The country's neighbors, including Vietnam and the Philippines, they  certainly contest these claims as well. China appeals to this false  boundary when its naval presence creeps into new areas of the South  China Sea, and it intimidates boats, fishermen, and others from  neighboring countries who cross that invisible line.   Now, ``Barbie,'' the movie, it is a great movie. Americans loved it  this past weekend, but the ``Barbie'' movie, well, it treads a little  too closely to depicting what looks like the nine-dash line. Hollywood  needs to become aware of the ways that the CCP tends to push its  propaganda. Use of the line is a trigger for geopolitical  sensitivities, including its likeness on a map, even as part of a  child-like drawing, that has real global ramifications.   Now, you may say: Oh, come on, it is just a movie. But Vietnam's  authorities banned ``Barbie'' from playing in theaters because of its  offensive, alleged depiction of the nine-dash line. And members of the  Philippines Government, they raised concerns as well, eventually  deciding to blur the map line in showings across their country.   Despite the ``Barbie'' movie's content, allegations of Chinese  propaganda in Hollywood are not child's play. China continues to take  advantage of our unprecedented global media network to do real damage.  It is no accident that China is financing some of the biggest films,  and China runs the second largest box office in the world, second only  to North America.   When a movie doesn't play in China, Hollywood loses literally  billions of dollars. Remember the controversy around ``Top Gun's''  sequel last year? The Department of Defense, they worked with Paramount  Pictures to make that movie happen, but when ``Top Gun: Maverick's''  first trailer was released in 2019, viewers noticed that the Japanese  and Taiwanese flags that were on Tom Cruise's bomber jacket, well, they  had been replaced in an attempt to appease China.   The studio wisely reversed course on that decision after a public  outcry, but that is not where the CCP's influence ended. The film made  no mentions or even implications of the United States' primary  adversary, and that is China. Any movie related to our national defense  that doesn't bring up China, well, it must be set in an alternative  universe because that is the biggest defense challenge facing our  country. This isn't a conspiracy theory.   The Presiding Officer is on the Senate Armed Services Committee, and  we know well China's strategy. The defense world is well aware that  China maintains a well-oiled propaganda machine that is enmeshed in our  modern media.   So you may say: Oh, come on, it is just a movie. No, this is a  serious problem, so serious that it is one our government should  address. We can't allow our Federal Agencies to help elevate messages  that support the CCP's goals, and we certainly cannot involve our own  Defense Department and taxpayer dollars in entertainment projects that  are beholden to Chinese propaganda.   As a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I have  successfully secured language in the last two National Defense  Authorization Acts to prevent our government's Department of Defense  from participating in entertainment projects with ties to the CCP.   Thanks to our persistent efforts, the Department of Defense recently  released new regulations around how the Department of Defense can  provide assistance to entertainment projects. Pursuant to these NDAA  provisions, the Department is now prohibited from assisting with  entertainment projects that censor the content of the project in a  material manner to advance the national interest of the People's  Republic of China.   It is my hope that this new policy will ensure that taxpayer dollars  are never involved in anti-American messaging efforts as well as send a  clear signal to the CCP that we will no longer turn a blind eye to its  propaganda efforts. This is just one example of the many provisions in  this year's NDAA that stand up to China and advance our national  security.   I encourage my Senate colleagues to vote yes on the NDAA so that we  can deliver a strong package that keeps China in line.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
