 Madam Speaker, on Saturday, we lost Congressman John  Cooksey, a former Member of this body and an outstanding American who  dedicated his life to serving his country and improving the lives of  others.   John Cooksey was born in Alexandria, Louisiana in 1941, and grew up  near his father's sawmill in rural LaSalle Parish. He attended LSU and  LSU Medical School and became an ophthalmologist. His love for  practicing medicine ran so deep that he continued to treat patients for  nearly 50 years.   Madam Speaker, just yesterday, I heard the story of a World War II  veteran whose vision had become distorted because of his combat  injuries. Dr. Cooksey treated him, restored the man's vision, and  performed the entire surgery free of charge.   Dr. Cooksey also served as a medical missionary to Africa,  volunteering his time and skills to treat those desperately in need of  medical care. He was so moved by his experiences there that he returned  home and personally led the fundraising drive to build a modern eye  clinic in Kenya.   Dr. Cooksey had a dedication to serving others and a deep commitment  to serving our country. He was a pilot in the Air Force and flew  missions during the Vietnam War.   In 1996, Dr. Cooksey was elected to serve the people of Louisiana's  Fifth Congressional District here in the House of Representatives.  Throughout his three terms, he was known for delivering results that  were transformational for our region and always going above and beyond  to help his constituents.   On a personal level, I will always be grateful to John Cooksey for  giving my late husband, Luke, his start in politics, instilling a love  for the work of this Congress in an eager young boy from Start,  Louisiana. For me, he was more than a predecessor, he was a trusted  mentor, a confidant, and a friend.  [[Page H5324]]    Madam Speaker, we have lost a dedicated public servant who was an  outstanding Member of this body. In his memory, I ask all Members in  the Chamber to join me in observing a moment of silence as we honor the  incredible life and remarkable accomplishments of Congressman John  Cooksey.                            ____________________
