 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise to oppose this legislation. Of course, infants  born alive deserve healthcare. As Dr. Bera just explained, doctors are  already obligated to provide that. But this bill threatens to send  healthcare providers to jail and women to back alleys.   Instead of debating this bill, we should be working to reduce the  rate of unintended pregnancies which, of course, reduces the number of  abortions. History shows that when abortions are restricted or banned,  they do not go away. They become dangerous and unsafe. Look at  countries that restrict abortion. Every year, thousands of women die  from unsafe procedures.   Yet here we are debating a bill that will make criminals out of  doctors and will drive more women to hazardous self-help methods.   There are effective ways to reduce unintended pregnancies and improve  maternal health, which is what we should be doing. Instead, this bill  disregards the professional judgment of trained medical professionals.  It imposes extreme new standards of care. That is why providers like  the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists strongly oppose  this legislation.   Madam Speaker, women in this country will continue rejecting archaic  and counterproductive policies like this, just as my colleagues should  reject this bill.
