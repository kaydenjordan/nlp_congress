 Mr. Speaker, under the leadership of President Biden,  the world is in chaos.   Failures in Afghanistan, the escalation in Russia, embrace of Iran,  and kowtowing to the Chinese are all examples of his foreign policy  legacy on this world.   When President Biden's leadership leads to disaster, demands for U.S.  aid and support dramatically increase.   I stand firm in support of Israel as they fight the onslaught of  terrorism on their borders.   Speaking of borders, Mr. Speaker, why is it that we throw billions of  dollars at other foreign borders when we won't protect our own? Last  month, we broke the all-time record for illegal entries into our  country, a record this administration should be ashamed of.   With domestic terror threats at an all-time high, we must reorient  our focus to our southern border to stop potential terror attacks  caused by bad policy.   We must secure the border first. Then, we can discuss immigration  reform. We can't have reform without border security.                            ____________________
