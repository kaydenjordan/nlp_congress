 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chair, and I  thank my good friend,   David Cicilline, for his extraordinary  leadership on this incredibly important legislation.   The words, ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men  are created equal,'' were eloquent in their articulation but incomplete  in their application.   As the legendary Barbara Jordan once observed, those words did not  originally apply to African Americans; they did not apply to people of  color; they did not apply to Native Americans; they did not apply to  women; they did not apply to members of the LGBT community.  [[Page H3941]]    We have come a long way here in the United States of America, but we  still have work to do.   If you truly believe in liberty and justice for all, support the  Equality Act.   If you truly believe in equal protection under the law, support the  Equality Act.   If you truly believe that everybody is created equal and that we are  all God's children, then support the Equality Act.   Love does not discriminate, and neither should the law, regardless of  sexual orientation and regardless of gender identity. It is time to  support the Equality Act, and let's continue our Nation's long,  necessary, and majestic march toward a more perfect Union.
