 Mr. Speaker, in life there are names that once spoken  give rise to great emotion. The name ``Randy Potter'' is one of those  names in our community.   Today, I recognize the life of one of Upstate New York's most  colorful and original characters, Randy Potter. Simply mentioning  Randy's name puts smiles on the faces of all who knew him. Seeing his  crazy hair and fun attire always covered in campaign slogans and  buttons put a smile on the faces of people who didn't know him.   Randy was a music aficionado and a diehard Grateful Dead fan who  attended hundreds of concerts, and he will always be fondly remembered  for his love of music. He also enjoyed sports, and it didn't matter  which team was playing; as long as it was a New York team, Randy was  always their biggest fan.   Perhaps most importantly to Randy, he was someone who cared a lot  about our community and about politics and the importance of  government, and our community depended on him to get the message out.   Sadly, Mr. Potter passed away quietly on the evening of December 23.  A treasure trove of stories, jokes, and the smiles of many, many  residents across  [[Page H19]]  Upstate and Central New York will be remembered by our loss of Randy  Potter. Today, we remember his life and the many moments of joy he  shared throughout our community. May we all learn a lesson from his  life and zest for sparking joy and laughter in those around him.                    Recognizing the Life of Joe Fusco, Jr.     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the tragic passing  of one of my district's great public servants, the Honorable Joseph  Fusco, Jr., the former mayor of Rome, New York.   Mayor Fusco was a dedicated public servant, who led an incredible  life. He first served as Rome City councilman and then as the 42nd  mayor of Rome from 2011 to 2015, a job he performed with integrity,  passion, and determination.   Joe led by example. He was always a smiling face and a helping hand.  He oversaw the completion of the Mohawk River Trail, and in what little  spare time he had, would participate in volunteer work across the  community. He also hosted a terrific charity motorcycle ride across our  beautiful region, an event I always looked forward to participating in  each year. His dedication to public service carries on through his son,  Joseph, III, who became a Rome firefighter in 2007.   I have no doubt that Rome, New York, is a better place because of the  legacy of Mayor Fusco and the legacy that he leaves behind. I also  extend my deepest condolences to Mayor Fusco's family, as they are  grieving deeply at this time. This includes his beloved wife and dear  friend, Laurie, his son, Joe, and many grandchildren. He will be  greatly missed by many. Again, his legacy will not be forgotten.    Recognizing Priscilla ``Peep'' Williams for her Athletic and Academic                                Achievements     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Priscilla,  also known as Peep, Williams, a standout athlete and student from New  York's 22nd District.   As an 8th grader in 2017, Peep was named to the Fellowship of  Christian Athletes Lacrosse Girls National Middle School Team. From  there, the honors just keep pouring in.   As a freshman in the spring of 2019, Peep stormed into the Seton  Academy lacrosse scene, breaking the school's individual scoring record  that was previously held by Seton's first Naval Academy appointee, who  also happened to be her big sister, Maddie, who I had the distinguished  honor of recommending an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy.   Peep is a 2021 USA Lacrosse Academic All-American and a member of the  U-18 National Team. In this year's off season, Peep also won the New  York State Sectional Tennis Championship. Ms. Williams recently signed  her letter of intent to travel nearly 3,000 miles from home where she  will play for an institution with a standard of excellence in both  athletics and academics, the Stanford Cardinals.   Please join me in congratulating Peep and wishing her all the best in  her future endeavors and know she will continue to represent our  community with grace and determination. I wish the best to her parents,  wonderful members of our community as well.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  submit extraneous materials.    Madam Speaker, today is a very special day. I want to  thank my good friend and colleague, Congressman Burgess Owens. Burgess  Owens and I are leading the charge here in Congress to tell the  courageous stories of America's abolitionist heroes, particularly those  from upstate New York.   It was an honor for me to welcome Burgess recently, in October, to  upstate New York to tour our region's sacred abolitionist sites,  including the Gerrit Smith Estate National Historic Landmark and the  National Abolition Hall of Fame in Peterboro, as well as the home of  abolitionist, suffragette, and true American heroine Harriet Tubman.   Opposite me, there is a photo here of Gerrit Smith. This is a picture  of Gerrit Smith from Peterboro. Peterboro is named after his father, a  guy named Peter Smith, and I just wanted to tell a little bit about how  this all happened in Peterboro, New York. I am sure a lot of people  don't know the history.   It all kind of started with an abolitionist named Reverend Henry  Highland, who told his good friend Frederick Douglass, when describing  Peterboro, New York--which, by the way, I am honored to represent here  in Congress. Many people don't even realize this little hamlet of  Peterboro, up in bucolic Madison County, which happens to be my  mother's home county, played a vitally important role during the  abolitionist movement.   This was in large part due to one of its most famous residents,  Gerrit Smith. As I said, the little hamlet of Peterboro was named in  honor of his father.   Mr. Smith was a successful businessman and a committed  philanthropist. He previously served this body, actually, as a  Representative from New York's 22nd Congressional District, the same  district that I currently represent. He was also a three-time  Presidential candidate.   Gerrit Smith always opposed slavery, but he firmly joined the  political cause of abolitionism in 1835. He was at a meeting of about  600 abolitionists in a church in the nearby city of Utica, which is in  Oneida County. Upon learning of the meeting, a violent mob stormed the  church and disrupted the proceedings, forcing the abolitionists to  flee.   Smith realized then that he could put his wealth and property to use.  He invited the abolitionists to his home in Peterboro. A year later, he  was elected president of the New York State Anti-Slavery Society. The  rest, as they say, is history. We are going to tell you a little bit  about that today with Congressman Owens.   In Smith's view, slavery was completely incompatible not only with  our founding documents but also with the natural laws of God. We were  born free, and no law or institution could take away another man or  woman's innate right to freedom.   From 1835 until his death in 1874, Gerrit Smith dedicated his whole  heart to the abolitionist cause, and Peterboro was his base of  operation. Giants like Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass, William  Lloyd Garrison, Elizabeth Cady--eventually Stanton, whose husband,  Henry Stanton, was actually a cousin of Smith's--spent considerable  time there, strategizing and mobilizing support.   Gerrit Smith played a key role in funding abolitionist causes across  our country. Smith maintained a lifelong friendship with Frederick  Douglass and provided funding and other support to The North Star,  which was Douglass' abolitionist newspaper. In today's terms, Gerrit  Smith would be considered a billionaire, and he gave what then was $100  a month to Frederick Douglass' cause to pay for his newspaper, which in  today's dollars, with inflation, would be about $7,000 per month to  make sure that this newspaper was able to continue to thrive and  flourish and inform people.   In a letter from Douglass following Smith's death in 1874, Douglas  credited Smith's generous support as the financial engine that kept his  abolitionist movement going.   Smith's estate in Peterboro was also a stop along the Underground  Railroad. As enslaved people made their way north to Canada, Smith  would offer them shelter, food, and support. Exact numbers are hard to  come by, but it is safe to say Smith bought and helped secure the  freedom of hundreds of enslaved people from around the country.    This is why Reverend Henry Highland said: ``There are yet two places  where slaveholders cannot come, Heaven and Peterboro.'' Peterboro was  synonymous with freedom.   Just a short drive from Gerrit Smith's estate in upstate New York is  the home of another titan of the abolitionist movement, the great  Harriet Tubman. Like Congressman Owens, this was my first visit to  Harriet Tubman's home in Auburn. I want to show you a little picture of  mighty Harriet Tubman, who is an amazing figure. I may have to go back  to some of these. This is a great photo of Congressman Owens and me at  Harriet Tubman's  [[Page H40]]  home in Auburn, New York, where we were able to tour and see where she  lived and where she operated her Underground Railroad, right in our own  communities.   This was an amazing experience. I was in awe of Harriet Tubman, her  accomplishments, and her tenacity. She had every reason to be in  despair. She was strong; she was compassionate; she was generous; and  she was only 4'11``, which is amazing.   The home we visited was where Harriet spent her later years, after  she escaped slavery in Maryland, served as a conductor of the  Underground Railroad, and then a scout, spy, and nurse for the Union  Army during the Civil War.   Harriet lived for almost a century. She was 91, almost 92 years old.  She was an indomitable force. She was the first Black woman to lead a  combat assault, organizing about 150 Black Union troops on a raid in  South Carolina. She later freed 750 enslaved people as part of that  operation.   She suffered from narcolepsy her adult life after being hit by a  metal weight when she was a teenager. Despite this, she persevered. She  brought at least 70 slaves to freedom on the Underground Railroad and  never lost a single passenger.                                time  1600    At her core, Harriet was a woman of compassion. In her later years  she helped so many who came through her home in Auburn providing them  shelter, medical attention, and love.   Despite the obstacles she faced, Harriet Tubman never gave up, nor  was she ever consumed by anger or cynicism. She led with integrity and  was incredibly resilient, and she is certainly an amazing role model  for all of us.   It was important to tell Gerrit Smith's story and Harriet Tubman's  stories, and now more than ever we must understand our shared history  and learn from those who came before us.   Our great Nation was founded on the promise that all men are created  equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable  rights, among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. No  other republic before ours guaranteed such rights to its citizens. In  fact, before America, there were no citizens at all, only subjects.   Yet in the earliest days of our Nation's founding, it is clear we  failed to live up to our ideals. We failed to end the slave trade or to  free those who were tied down in bondage. While this grave mistake will  forever be part of our history, so, too, will be the courageous stories  of Gerrit Smith, Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass, and so many more  Americans of different races, creeds, and religions who fought for a  better America.   Gerrit Smith and Harriet Tubman personify the spirit of America, and  their stories should be a lesson to all of us. Their tenacity, their  relentlessness, and their pursuit of ideals are everything that we  strive to be as Americans.   As Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas recently said, While we as  Americans have failed to live up to the ideals of the Declaration of  Independence time and again, there is no time in our history when those  ideals themselves have actually failed us. The Declaration and its  principles endure because they articulate a fundamental truth that all  people are born free and equal.   Like Gerrit and Harriet did as citizens of this country we must  commit ourselves to the great American project of making sure we live  up to our ideals. These ideals are sacred, and the abolitionists who  gathered in Peterboro changed the world and they were the authors of  our future, and we must thank God that we have the freedom to fight  every day to strengthen our institutions and make this a much more  perfect Union.   Madam Speaker, I want to end by thanking those who made our recent  visit possible and welcomed Congressman Owens and I on that cold day in  October before I yield to him, but I just want to recognize these great  people who spend and devote their life to this history.   First is Norman Dann. He was one of our tour guides at Peterboro and  the author of ``Practical Dreamer, Gerrit Smith and the Crusade for  Social Reform.''   Alden Max Smith, another one of our guides, as well as the cabinet  member of the National Abolition Hall of Fame and Museum, which is also  in Peterboro.   Dorothy Willsey, another fantastic tour guide and president of the  National Abolition Hall of Fame.   John Becker, chairman of the Madison County Board of Supervisors for  meeting us there and also for making this all possible.   Cliff Moses, vice-chairman of the Madison County Board of  Supervisors.   Mary Cavanaugh, city of Oneida, wards 1, 2, 3 supervisor, who also  greeted us there and toured with us.   Yvonne Nirelli, the former supervisor of the Town of Lincoln, who  also greeted us and toured with us.   Matt Roberts, city of Oneida supervisor for wards 1, 2, and 3,  another person who came to tour with us and was fascinated again by  this amazing little hamlet in upstate New York.   Matthew Urtz, our Madison County historian, who was completely  intrigued and so excited to welcome the great Burgess Owens, who is  going to be talking a little more on this today.   Karol Kucinski, trustee at the National Abolition Hall of Fame and  Museum.   And Nell Ziegler, the President of the Smithfield Community  Association and owner and manager of the Gerrit Smith Estate National  Historic Landmark.   For more information about the Gerrit Smith Estate and the beautiful  hamlet of Peterboro, I encourage you to visit www.gerritsmith.org.  I also want to thank Karen V. Hill, president and CEO of the Harriet  Tubman Home, as well as our fantastic tour guides who shared their  knowledge and passion with us again on this beautiful cold day.   There it is again, this photo of our tour of Peterboro. It was  wonderful to have Burgess Owens there, a really special moment for all  of us.   Madam Speaker, it is with great honor that I yield to the gentleman  from Utah (Mr. Owens), who I think this was a great experience for him.  I think he never realized what existed up in upstate New York. And that  is why we want everyone in the world to know just how important it is  that we learn our history and we celebrate everyone who had a path and  who had courage and who had the tenacity and the boldness to stand up  for what was right against the grain at a very difficult time in our  country. I have one little thing for you, too. I have a special Harriet  Tubman pad for you I grabbed.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for those great  words and for bringing up so many people. And, again, our community was  so honored to have you there.                                time  1615    To have you at Peterboro and to have more people discover and have  this audience around our country and the world watching know that there  are great people out there that did care about the cause of freedom.  You brought up Martin Luther King, and I always remember studying him  when I was a college student, and just discovering his great  relationship with Gandhi and talking about peace and peaceful protests  and how important it was. And how that is a founding principle of our  country.   Just to have you there in Peterboro meant so much. Everyone in  Peterboro was so excited to have you there. People are recognizing that  there are people that are not on everyone's radar, on the national  radar, but there are people that have done great things, that are doing  it quietly but they are doing it for a great cause.   And those little acts, like you just mentioned, the administrator  that let your dad into Ohio State, you will never know who it was, but  that person enabled us to have the great Burgess Owens here today.    I agree. I think we have to focus on the people who are  helping us, not the people who aren't. And I think that this is what we  wanted to do today, and we are grateful to you to be able to focus on  people who actually help, not the people tearing us down, the people  trying to bring our country to its knees, but people trying to make us  rise up and be better, and be a better America than we are today. And  that is our striving for our future. That is what we want our children  to be. We want America to be better for our children and our  grandchildren.   And I think by recognizing that there were great people in our past  who have done amazing things who never got the recognition, but often  those people go unnoticed. And I think that is why it meant so much for  us to have you there.   Madam Speaker, I urge anyone if you want to come up on a beautiful  fall day, or you can come in the warm summer days, it is a little  warmer--it is a little snowy right now--to come to visit Peterboro and  meet with some our great docents, who I mentioned in my remarks, who  are studying and uncovering documents and trying to show the true  history so we understand it and so we can learn from it.   Even though I had been to Peterboro when I was younger--I knew about  it when I was a kid because it was my mom's home county--I never knew  the depth of it, or I learned so much more just by that experience. And  I am sure if I go again to the Abolitionist Hall of Fame, I think I  would learn even more there. But just learning about Harriet Tubman and  going to her house and being in the same room where you know that she  was providing so much aid and comfort and love to people she didn't  know but people she believed in and knew needed to understand and feel  that taste of freedom, just standing there with you and the people that  worked there and how much it meant to them, they conveyed that sort of,  you know, that wonderful feeling to us as well.   So I feel like I just would love to have everyone come and have that  experience. And anywhere else in the country, we would love to  encourage our colleagues to come out and tell us about great  experiences and great Americans that are out there that might not get  the recognition. They might not be getting the clicks on twitter or  Facebook or social media, but there are people out there doing great  works and uncovering great heroism.    We can't wait to have you back.   And also, I just think about that last moment when we were in Gerrit  Smith Estate, in the barn. We went back in the barn and we saw these  conditions where horses and mules were put, and that they actually had  to hide people in there.    We came out of the barn, and there was this gleaming sunlight on us  on that cold day. And I looked above, and there was a sign that said  ``Heaven in Peterboro,'' the two places where the slaves were safe and  symbolized freedom.   So it was just an honor for me to represent the community. And then  to have you standing there with that gleaming sunlight on us and  knowing that so many people in our past, that was their gateway to  freedom and gateway to finding a new life, I think it was a tremendous  experience. We hope maybe you can come again and we can invite our  colleagues and others to come and experience Peterboro.    And Harriet Tubman's home, of course.    Yes, thank you. And what a great discovery it was, just  sitting on the floor of the House Chamber, Burgess and I. And I said,  you have never been to Peterboro? How about this?   Who would think that I would be hosting a famous person like Burgess  Owens, a hero in our communities, in my own little community, and that  we would have that common bond with Harriet Tubman.   But we are grateful. We are just grateful for you and your service  and everyone here. And I just hope that my colleagues and anyone who  wants to join Peterboro--again, I hate to do too much of a pitch--but  go to www.gerritsmith.org. It is an amazing place. It is humble, but it  is just majestic and the accomplishments that were made in that  wonderful place.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. Burgess, for joining us, and  thank him for everything he has done, for standing courageously and  boldly for our communities and for our country, and standing up for our  Constitution and freedom. Because that is really what is going to unite  us.   Let's talk about what unites us, not what divides us. We have a lot  of great history that can really bring us together in the future. And  so I thank you.    Thank you so much. The honor is all mine.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
