 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2030, the Colorado River  Drought Contingency Plan Authorization Act. The Colorado River is a  critical source of water for approximately 19 million people in the  southern California region. After 19 years of drought on the Colorado,  Lake Mead is near critical levels. If no action is taken, it is  estimated that by 2021, Lake Mead could reach critically low elevations  where basic reservoir operations and water deliveries become  impossible.   We are here today because of the tremendous leadership of the seven  Colorado River Basin States, the water users throughout the basin.  Traditionally, the shared water resources of the Colorado River have  been managed through consensus and collaboration, and the drought  contingency plan, or DCP, is no exception.   Water users throughout the basin agree to voluntary conservation  measures that protect existing water rights in order to protect the  water supplies of Lake Powell and Lake Mead for the foreseeable future.   I want to commend the bill's sponsor for working to ensure that the  Salton Sea is protected under this legislation. DCP was developed with  input from stakeholders throughout the basin, including water users,  Tribal leaders, and environmental groups. California holds the senior  water rights in the lower basin. In the short term, though, California  may have the most water security during this historic drought, but  water leaders in my region recognize the importance of protecting Lake  Mead now to preserve southern California's long-term water supply  reliability.   Mr. Speaker, I want to extend a special thanks to Jeff Kightlinger  for his tireless efforts on behalf of the Metropolitan Water District  of Southern California to get this historic deal across the finish  line. If not for his work over the last several years, we would not be  here today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                                time  1745
