 Madam Speaker, over the last 2 years, the price of lumber  rose at an astronomical rate. This followed prolonged shutdowns of  lumber mills and production plants, despite the maintained demand for  lumber for construction projects that continued as an essential  activity during the pandemic. The resulting supply and demand inversion  caused a nationwide lumber shortage.   Our economy struggles when businesses feel uncertainty in the market,  which is why it is the government's job, in times of crisis like the  COVID pandemic, to ensure stability.   In May of last year, I sent a letter to U.S. Trade Representative  Katherine Tai urging action to prevent further disruption in the price  of lumber. At the time I sent the letter, lumber prices had skyrocketed  more than 300 percent over the previous year. With the support of  nearly 100 bipartisan Members of Congress, Congressman Brian Higgins  and I asked Ambassador Tai to resolve the crisis by resuming trade  negotiations with Canada to reduce the price of softwood lumber.   While lumber prices temporarily declined following that letter, it  took months for a meaningful portion of those decreases to reach the  construction industry and its customers. Prices began rising again in  September and have continued to increase in the months since, once  again putting strain on the hardworking Americans who build our homes  and communities.   In December, I once again joined Congressman Higgins and nearly 100  bipartisan Members of Congress to send a second letter to the Biden  administration, this time to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, voicing  concerns over the Department of Commerce's decision to increase  antidumping and countervailing duties on softwood lumber products from  Canada. We are concerned that this will further exacerbate the lumber  crisis.   The housing sector remains an integral piece of the U.S. economy. As  we continue to recover from the COVID pandemic, sharp increases in the  price of lumber will further harm our recovery and the costs faced by  hardworking Americans.   It is our understanding that the U.S. and Canada discussed this very  issue last year and expressed mutual interest in resolving the problem,  but it is unclear if any action has yet been taken by either country.   We want to see stability and normalcy restored to the housing market.  It is imperative that we do so. We want to see definitive action from  the Biden administration to solve this problem.   Madam Speaker, we in Congress stand ready to help in any way we can.                            ____________________
