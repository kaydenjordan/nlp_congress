 Madam President, today the Supreme Court heard arguments  in one of the most consequential immigration cases in modern American  history. The future of more than 700,000 DACA recipients--our Nation's  Dreamers--hangs in the balance and their fate is inherently intertwined  with the fate of the American Dream itself.   Dreamers, by definition, are law-abiding immigrants brought to the  United States as children--through no choice of their own--now simply  seeking the chance to contribute to the only country they have ever  known as home. Dreamers, by definition, do not pose any kind of public  safety or national security threat. They are our neighbors, our first  responders, our defenders, and our teachers. Nearly a thousand Dreamers  serve in our Armed Forces, risking their lives to preserve the freedoms  of millions of American citizens. Dreamers are Americans in every way,  except on paper. Americans know this, and have roundly rejected the  baseless, un-American vitriol spread by President Trump--yet again this  morning, just hours before the argument--that some Dreamers are  ``hardened criminals.''   So it is no wonder that the overwhelming majority of Americans  support providing legal protections to our Nation's Dreamers. And it is  no surprise that leaders of industry in every major sector of our  economy have called for providing legal status and a path to  citizenship for Dreamers, recognizing their enormous contributions to  our economy.   The depth of opposition to President Trump's decision to heartlessly  terminate DACA is matched only by the breadth of agreement among courts  that the Trump administration is just plain wrong on the law. Five out  of six Federal courts that considered the Trump administration's effort  to end DACA blocked President Trump from actually doing so and they  have rejected the Trump administration's laughable argument that its  decision to end DACA is simply unreviewable by the courts.   I am hopeful that the Supreme Court sides with the near unanimous  consensus among lower courts. I am hopeful that it joins the united  chorus of Americans who envision a legally protected place in our  society for this group of immigrants that embodies the American dream.   Regardless of how the Supreme Court rules, Congress is by no means a  bystander. Congress still has the authority and the responsibility to  do what is right. Just a few months ago, the House passed a bipartisan  bill, the American Dream and Promise Act, which would enact critical  protections for Dreamers and provide temporary safe haven to targeted  groups of immigrants whose home countries have been crippled by natural  disasters or civil conflict. The Senate could easily take up this bill  today or it could take up the bipartisan Senate bill, the Dream Act of  2019, authored by Senators Graham and Durbin, which would provide  [[Page S6505]]  meaningful safeguards to our Dreamers. Either way, Senate inaction is  simply not acceptable to the millions of Americans in both parties who  see the prospect of mass deportations of Dreamers as antithetical to  who we are as the United States of America.   As we wait for our Nation's highest Court to rule on this case, it is  essential for Americans to express their views about the future of  Dreamers to their elected representatives. This case, after all, is not  just about the specific Dreamers who would benefit from DACA's  continued existence, and it not just about the Trump administration's  anti-immigrant impulses and policies. This is about whether our proud  past as a nation of immigrants and refugees--a country that became one  out of many--has a bright future. That future should not be left solely  to the courts nor should it be left to languish in Majority Leader  McConnell's legislative graveyard. This future will be shaped, in part,  by what we choose to do now, in the present and it is beyond time for  the Senate to come together and do what is right.   (At the request of Mr. Schumer following statement was ordered to be  printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
