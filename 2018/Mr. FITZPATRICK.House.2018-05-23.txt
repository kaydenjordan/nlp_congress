 Mr. Speaker, we recently concluded Teacher  Appreciation Week, and I am proud to stand with the teachers throughout  our community in Bucks and Montgomery Counties. It is of utmost  importance that we recognize their service and sacrifice for all of our  young people.   Recently, this has culminated in our district having several schools  that ranked in the top 100 in the State of Pennsylvania for both  standardized test scores and graduation rates.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the following schools now on  the floor of the House: The New Hope-Solebury High School, Council Rock  High School North, Central Bucks High School East, Abington Senior High  School, Council Rock High School South, Central Bucks High School  South, and the Quakertown Community High School.   I am proud to represent a community that produces such high-achieving  young adults, and I would like to thank our educators for the work they  do in molding our future generation.                   Recognizing Military Appreciation Month     Mr. Speaker, May is Military Appreciation Month, and  I am proud to stand here today to recognize the brave men and women in  uniform who have served our Nation valiantly.   As a member of the House Homeland Security Committee, I am in awe of  the sacrifices made and risks taken by our Armed Forces every single  day to keep our country safe.   And I speak for all of my constituents in Bucks and Montgomery  Counties when we truly say that we value the troops' service and  sacrifice, and we owe them a tremendous debt of gratitude.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the 75 graduating high school seniors who  were honored this month at Spring Mill Manor in Northampton by Our  Community Salutes to recognize their enlistment in our Armed Forces.   These exemplary young men and women received a certificate from  Montgomery County State Representative Tom Murt, a veteran of the Iraq  war, and received their first military coin.   Mr. Speaker, as elected officials, we must continue to enact policies  that ensure the well-being of all of our men and women in the military.  There is no more important responsibility than serving those who have  so bravely stepped up in times of crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I will continue to stand up for our military this month  and every month. And to all those who serve, we say: Thank you.                        New Hope Hosts a Pride Parade     Mr. Speaker, last weekend in Bucks County,  Pennsylvania, was the 15th Annual New Hope Pride Parade.   This parade served as the culmination of a week-long celebration of  LGBT culture and achievements, and I am proud to recognize this event  and our LGBT community in Bucks County and throughout our district.   Currently, the New Hope Pride Parade stands as the only recognized  event of its kind that crosses State lines between New Jersey and  Pennsylvania.   I would like to recognize board member Jennifer Wohl, under whose  guidance the attendance at this event grew from 1,000 in 2003 to 15,000  last year.   I would also like thank the president of New Hope Celebrates, Matthew  Hanson, for his work in advancing equality in Pennsylvania and across  our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, as Members of Congress, it is critical that we advocate  for measures that will support equality for all American citizens. I  will continue to do so as a Member of this House, and I urge my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the same with every single  action we bring to this floor. We value them, Mr. Speaker.                            ____________________
