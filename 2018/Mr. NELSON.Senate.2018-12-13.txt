 Madam President, I just wanted to address the Senator  from Missouri to tell her that she has been a wonderful colleague for  this Senator.   As someone of more moderation in her politics who comes from a  Republican-dominated State, she has negotiated the political winds so  well and has always kept her eye on representing her State. This  Senator from Florida particularly appreciates that, because being a  Democrat in a Republican State is not an easy task, and she has done it  with such dignity, looking out for her people, looking out for the  people who are voiceless. I just want her to know she has the  appreciation of this Senator from Florida.   I yield the floor.
