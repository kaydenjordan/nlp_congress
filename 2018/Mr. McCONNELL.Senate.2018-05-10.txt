 Madam President, let me begin this morning with  gratitude to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Overnight, he completed a  sensitive diplomatic mission and returned home from North Korea with  three freed American prisoners. The families of these three men, and  the entire country, are so grateful.   This episode offers just one more example of the complex, relentless  foreign policy challenges that confront our country. Clearly, America  was fortunate that our new Secretary of State was prepared to execute  his responsibilities from day one. Leadership and expertise matter.   Yesterday, our colleagues on the Intelligence Committee heard from  another well-prepared leader, Gina Haspel--President Trump's selection  to head the Central Intelligence Agency. Ms. Haspel's testimony  showcased the judgment and poise that have defined her 33-year career  of selfless service with the Agency. Her testimony confirmed what her  gold standard resume and her bipartisan support from seasoned national  security leaders had actually already told us: Gina Haspel has the  experience, the talent, and the unique skill set to excel in this  important job at this important moment.   Since 1985, she served the Nation in clandestine operations around  the globe and rose to the highest levels of Agency leadership. True to  the best traditions of intelligence professionals, numerous former  Directors have lauded her qualifications, notwithstanding whether their  service was for Democratic or Republican administrations. Her  nomination carries the full-throated endorsement of 53 of our Nation's  most respected national security leaders.   Today, more than ever, the value of Ms. Haspel's insights and  experiences cannot be understated. Her career has encompassed both the  Cold War and the ongoing Global War on Terror. In a moment when our  national security demands excellence in each of these areas--great  power competition and counterterrorism alike--Ms. Haspel stands  uniquely ready to assume the responsibilities of CIA Director as  perhaps its most qualified candidate in the Agency's history. As the  Intelligence Committee continues its consideration, I strongly urge my  colleagues to support this fine nominee. We will all sleep better at  night knowing Gina Haspel is on the job.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, today the Senate  continues our work to confirm President Trump's well-qualified judicial  nominees. Yesterday, we confirmed Kurt Engelhardt to the Fifth Circuit  by a significant bipartisan margin.   The nominee now before us, Michael Brennan, is similarly qualified.  His nomination carries bipartisan support from the people who know him  best, including the endorsement of more than 30 current and former  peers in Wisconsin. In the words of one such colleague, Mr. Brennan  possesses ``the mind, heart, and soul of a great jurist.'' It is not  too surprising, then, that the American Bar Association has awarded Mr.  Brennan its highest rating, unanimously--unanimously--``well- qualified.''   I look forward to voting to confirm Mr. Brennan later today. Later,  we will be voting to advance two more circuit court nominees: Joel  Carson and John Nalbandian. Each possesses their own set of sterling  qualifications, each comes recommended widely by those who have worked  closely with them, and each deserves to be confirmed by this body and  take their place on the Federal bench.   Our friends across the aisle aren't making it easy, but despite the  historic obstruction, this Senate will continue to do what it takes to  process and confirm the President's fine nominees for these important  posts.                            ____________________     Madam President, on one final matter, later today,  President Trump is visiting the great State  [[Page S2600]]  of Indiana. He is joining Hoosiers to celebrate the new jobs and  prosperity our Republican agenda is delivering to communities in  Indiana and all over the country. After years of Democratic policies  that made life harder for job creators, the United States of America is  officially open for business once again.   Surveys show that since President Trump and this Republican Congress  were elected, the percentage of small and independent employers feeling  confident about expanding their businesses has nearly tripled. The  amount that employers spend on wages, salaries, and benefits for  American workers grew more in 2017 than in any calendar year of the  Obama administration. The number of Americans receiving unemployment  benefits is the lowest--the lowest--since 1973. Let me say that again.  The number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits is the lowest  it has been since 1973. Richard Nixon was in the White House back then.  Republicans have focused like a laser on getting Washington out of the  way. More job opportunities, higher pay, and greater prosperity are  already reaching middle-class Americans.   My colleague Senator Young has been sharing some of the great news  that awaits the President when he gets to Indiana. He has heard from  constituents like Donald from Noblesville. Donald said:         I don't consider myself rich, but applying next year's tax       changes to this year's income, I'll pay over $1,000 less in       taxes next year. Everyone benefits with the new tax cuts.    A Bloomington resident named Cathy said this about her husband's tax  reform bonus:         We have never had this happen. It was much appreciated.    First Farmers Bank & Trust is raising wages, writing employee bonus  checks, and investing more in development for the communities it  serves, with 34 branches all across Indiana.   There are stories like these being written all over the country-- largely because Republicans rolled back job-killing regulations and cut  taxes significantly for working families and for small businesses.   Oddly, our Democratic colleagues can't bring themselves to admit this  is a good thing. Even when the facts show our growing economy is making  life better for middle-class Americans, they try to shrug off the facts  and fall back on the same old class warfare rhetoric. Even when people  like Donald and Cathy explain how tax reform is helping them, Democrats  scoff at their household finances, saying multi-thousand-dollar tax  cuts are just ``crumbs.''   Crumbs? Maybe in New York or San Francisco, but in Kentucky, where I  come from, working families don't see their tax cuts, bonuses, and pay  raises as crumbs. I have a hunch it is the same in Indiana.   It is curious that only one of Indiana's Senators voted to give  Hoosiers these tax cuts and these new job opportunities. Indiana's  senior Senator voted in lockstep with Democratic leaders to block tax  reform from ever taking effect. Instead of working with Republicans and  the President to keep the new prosperity coming, he and his colleagues  have chosen to obstruct and resist on nearly every subject.   Just the other day, the Democratic leader in the House declared she  plans to campaign on repealing the tax reform--that is, the Democratic  leader in the U.S. House--campaign on repealing the tax reform. Tax  cuts versus tax hikes, that is about as clear a contrast as you can  imagine. Fortunately, for Hoosiers, Kentuckians, and all the other  communities that are finally growing again after years of atrophy,  Republicans will defend the American people's tax cuts and defend their  new jobs.                            ____________________     Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  cloture motions with respect to the Scudder and St. Eve nominations be  withdrawn and that the Senate vote on the nominations in the order  listed at 5:30 p.m. on Monday, May 14. I further ask that, if  confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action. I further ask that notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII,  the Senate vote on confirmation of the Carson nomination at 12 noon on  Tuesday, May 15; that if cloture is invoked on the Nalbandian  nomination, that confirmation vote occur immediately following the  disposition of the Carson nomination; and that if either are confirmed,  the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table,  and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.
