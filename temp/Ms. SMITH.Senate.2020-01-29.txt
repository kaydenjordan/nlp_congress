 Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the  desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senator Smith is to the House managers:         The President has stated multiple times in public that his       actions were perfect--yet he refuses to allow Bolton,       Mulvaney, and others to testify under oath. If the       President's actions are so perfect, why wouldn't he allow       fact witnesses to testify under oath about what he has said       publicly?    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Well, the short answer is, if the President were  so confident that this was a perfect call and that those around him  would agree that there was nothing nefarious going on, he would want  witnesses to come and testify. But, of course, he doesn't. He doesn't  want his former National Security Advisor to testify. He doesn't want  his current Chief of Staff to testify. He doesn't want those that were  heading OMB to testify. He doesn't want you to hear from any of them.   Now, I think that is pretty indicative that he knows what they have  to say  [[Page S680]]  and he doesn't want you to hear what they have to say. He doesn't want  you to see any of the myriad of documents that he has been withholding  from this body as he did from the House.   But I also want to address the last question, if I could. Is the  Chief Justice empowered under the Senate rules to adjudicate questions  of witnesses and privilege? And the answer is yes.   Can the Chief Justice make those determinations quickly? The answer  is yes.   Is the Senate empowered to overturn the Chief Justice? Under certain  circumstances.   Is the vote 50 or is the vote two-thirds? That would be something  that we would have to discuss with the Parliamentarian and with the  Chief Justice.   But the Chief Justice has the power to do it, and, what is more,  under the Senate rules, you want expedited process? We are here to tell  you: We will agree with the Chief Justice's ruling on witnesses, on  their materiality, on the application or nonapplication of privilege.  We agree to be bound by the Chief Justice. We will not seek to litigate  an adverse ruling, and we will not seek to appeal an adverse ruling.   Will the President's counsel do the same? And, if not, just as the  President doesn't trust what these witnesses have to say, the  President's lawyers don't want to rely on what the Chief Justice's  rulings might be.   Now, why is that? They, as we, understand the Chief Justice will be  fair. I am not for a moment suggesting they don't think the Chief  Justice is fair--quite the contrary. They are afraid he will be fair.  They are afraid he will make a fair ruling. That should tell you  something about the weakness of their position.   They don't want a fair trial with witnesses. They don't want a fair  Justice to adjudicate these questions. They just want to suggest to you  that they will delay and delay and delay.   I think it was Thomas Paine who said: Those who would enjoy the  blessings of liberty must undergo the rigors of defending it--the  fatigues of defending it.   Is it too much fatigue for us to hear from a witness? Is that how  little effort we are willing to put into the blessings of freedom and  liberty? Is that how little fatigue we are willing to incur?   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from Nebraska.
