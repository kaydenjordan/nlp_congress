 Mr. President, it is my honor to pay tribute to  Stephanie Barna, who is retiring October 15 after more than 30 years of  Federal service. A dedicated public servant, a fierce advocate for our  Nation's men and women in uniform, and an astute legal mind, the Senate  Committee on Armed Services has been extremely fortunate to have Ms.  Barna as Republican General Counsel for the past 3 years.   Ms. Barna joined the Committee on Armed Services in November 2018,  after decades of working within the Department of Defense both as a  uniformed officer and as a civilian. As a career Senior Executive at  the Pentagon, Ms. Barna held critical positions that focused on Total  Force management, personnel matters, and improving the lives of our  servicemembers and their families. Most recently, she performed the  duties of the Under Secretary of Defense for Secretary of Defense Jim  Mattis. Before that, she served as senior policy adviser to then-Under  Secretary of Defense Robert Wilkie; Principal Deputy Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Manpower and Reserve Affairs; performed the  duties of Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and  Readiness; and Deputy General Counsel for Operations and Personnel in  the Office of the Army General Counsel.   Ms. Barna began her public service career in 1989 as a lieutenant in  the U.S. Army Judge Advocate General's Corps. Ultimately, she retired  from the U.S. Army Reserve in 2011 in the grade of colonel. She is also  qualified as an Army Jumpmaster, and if she is willing to jump out of a  perfectly safe plane, she is definitely able to work in Congress.   As a member of my staff on the Senate Committee on Armed Services,  Ms. Barna played a critical role in the drafting and enactment of the  fiscal year 2020 and 2021 National Defense Authorization Acts, NDAA.  Because of her work and commitment to bipartisan solutions, we  successfully enacted the 59th and 60th consecutive NDAAs when many  speculated it couldn't be done. I am grateful for her work this year to  help usher the fiscal year 2022 NDAA toward the finish line as well.  With creativity and tenacity, Ms. Barna shepherded important policy  reforms that strengthened national security, improved the management of  the Pentagon, and bettered the lives of our servicemembers.   Over her career, Ms. Barna received numerous, well-deserved  accolades, including the Legion of Merit, the Meritorious Executive  Presidential Rank Award, the Department of Defense Medal for  Distinguished Civilian Service, and the Department of the Army  Exceptional Civilian Service Award--twice.   Most telling to her leadership, Ms. Barna has never asked for  recognition. She is a tireless worker, wholly dedicated to serving her  Nation. If you were to look up the definitions of ``competent,''  ``capable,'' and ``grace under fire'' in the dictionary, I am sure you  would see her picture.   Ms. Barna leaves behind a legacy of getting things done, of doing  what is good and right, and fulfilling the law to the best of her  understanding. Because of her, the Department of Defense operates  better, our troops are better cared for, and long-standing institution  of the U.S. Senate live on. While she will leave big shoes to fill on  the Senate Committee on Armed Services, I wish her very well in her  well-earned retirement. For her service, she has my thanks and the  thanks of a grateful nation.                            ____________________
