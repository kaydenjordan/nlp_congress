 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Young). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  nomination of Mr. Joseph Otting to be Comptroller of the Currency. The  OCC's mission is to ensure that the financial institutions it oversees  operate in a safe and sound manner, provide fair access to financial  services, treat customers fairly, and comply with the applicable laws  and regulations.   The OCC is responsible for overseeing the supervision of all national  banks and Federal savings associations as well as Federal branches and  agencies of foreign banks. The OCC also plays an important role in  identifying and responding to emerging threats in our financial system.   Mr. Otting is exceptionally qualified to lead the OCC as its  comptroller. His unique expertise and understanding of the banking  sector has been shaped by over three decades of firsthand industry  experience. Mr. Otting has held positions at large regional and  community financial institutions, including key leadership positions.  In fact, he has touched virtually every segment of the industry,  working in consumer services, business services, human resources,  compliance, audit, and many others.   His understanding of how banks work and knowledge of the laws and  regulations governing the financial sector was evident throughout his  nomination hearings. I was also encouraged by Mr. Otting's statements  about the importance of ensuring that all Americans have access to  banking products and services. Mr. Otting also reaffirmed his  commitment to honor the OCC's mission and cooperating with the work of  Congress.   I am confident Mr. Otting will bring strong leadership to the OCC,  given his extensive experience in the financial industry. I urge my  colleagues to support Mr. Otting's nomination today and vote for his  confirmation in the future.   Thank you.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                              Order of Procedure    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that,  notwithstanding rule XXII, at 1:30 p.m. today, the Senate proceed to  legislative session and the Chair lay before the Senate the conference  report to accompany H.R. 2810, as under the previous order, and that  there be 15 minutes of debate equally divided between the managers or  their designees prior to the vote on the adoption of the conference  report; further, that following disposition of the conference report,  the Senate resume executive session and all postcloture time on the  Coggins and Friedrich nominations be yielded back and the Senate vote  on confirmation of the Coggins nomination immediately, and that the  confirmation vote on the Friedrich nomination occur at 5:30 p.m. on  Monday, November 27; finally, that if the nominations are confirmed,  the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table  and the Senate be immediately notified of the Senate's action.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the votes  following the first vote in this series be 10 minutes in length.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield back the time on the Otting  nomination, and I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the Otting  nomination?   The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk called the roll.    Mr. President, today I wish to honor PO2 Terence  Parsons of Genesee, ID, whom the United Service Organization, USO has  recognized as the USO's Sailor of the Year for 2017.   Terence Parsons took action to assist two motorists involved in car  accidents and marines involved in a mass casualty situation. The USO  explained, ``Displaying unselfish devotion and great heroism, Terence  Parsons, a Navy corpsman, put himself in harm's way to assist members  of the community. While off duty on two separate occasions, he  witnessed car accidents that caused potentially life-threatening  injuries to the victims involved. With little thought of his own  safety, Parsons responded by providing lifesaving treatment.'' The USO  further commended Terence Parsons for his response to a mass casualty  event of 18 marines suffering multiple injuries sustained during U.S.S.  Oak Hill U.S.S. Kearsarge amphibious warfare qualifications. Terence  Parsons' quick action was pivotal in preventing further injury and  saved numerous lives.   Terence joined the U.S. Navy in 2011 and credits the values,  including a respect for hard work and teamwork, he obtained growing up  in Genesee and the support of his family, command and friends with  enabling his military success. Terence Parsons has also received many  other recognitions for his  [[Page S7294]]  distinguished service. These honors include the Navy and Marine Corps  Commendation Medal and the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal.  Congratulations, PO2 Terrence Parsons, on receiving this recognition,  and thank you for your exceptional service on behalf of our Nation. You  and the outstanding servicemembers you serve alongside are true assets  to our communities, State, and Nation. I commend you on your  achievements and wish you continued success.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have 6 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
