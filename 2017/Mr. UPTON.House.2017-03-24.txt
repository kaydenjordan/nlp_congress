 Mr. Speaker, you know, there is an old Upton family quote  that my grandfather would always say: Was you always perfect? No, none  of us are.   And you know what? This is not a perfect bill. That is for sure. But  ObamaCare is broken. One out of three counties has only one provider,  and it looks like it is going to get worse as other major insurance  companies are on the verge of pulling the plug.   Nearly two dozen of the nonprofit CO-OPS have already gone belly up.  In my home State, folks saw their premiums increase by nearly 17  percent. Some States have had premium increases of more than 100  percent. Most had double-digit increases, many over 20 percent, and  some forecast 40 to 50 percent increases come fall if nothing happens.   The calls on both sides of the aisle have often used the R word--on  this side, ``replace''; on your side, the Democratic side, ``repair.''  Let's both agree. The status quo is not acceptable. But this, this  bill, is the only train leaving the station. Is it going to improve if  it gets to the Senate? Of course it will. We should all work for that  goal.   For me, I worked with Medicaid expansion States like Michigan  providing a reasonable transition until 2020 and then grandfathering  all those folks until they are off. Some of my colleagues called to end  Medicaid expansion even this year. They want total repeal.                                time  1245    What would total repeal mean? Total repeal would mean taking away the  ability of HHS to provide flexibility to the States to administer this  critical program. It would mean taking away insurance for young kids on  their parents' policies. It would reinstall a cap on insurance. And,  yes, it would allow insurance companies to discriminate against those  with preexisting illnesses.   This bill still allows all of those important protections to stay in  place. A number of us will continue to work with HHS to provide even  more flexibility to States like Michigan. This has to be a key  component of moving forward.   At the end of the day, I would like to think that we could work  together on a bipartisan basis. High premiums and a lack of access  impact us all. Let's work together. You can't get to second base unless  you get to first.  [[Page H2417]]
