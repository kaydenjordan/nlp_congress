 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Tyrone  ``Hollywood'' Brown, who was recently inducted into the American  Basketball Hall of Fame.   Tyrone Brown was born in Savannah, Georgia, where he went to Alfred  E. Beach High School.   After years of hard work at Savannah State University, Tyrone joined  the Harlem Globetrotters in 1985.   He was a member of the Harlem Globetrotters for over 10 years. During  his time with the Globetrotters, Tyrone put an emphasis on children's  education and development.   He remained passionate about inspiring children to set goals and work  hard, leading him to create the Ambassadors of Responsibility  Foundation to enable former teammates to better serve elementary and  middle school students across the country.   Tyrone also wrote a book ``A Piece of Paper'' that tells his own  story of how he worked to become a Harlem Globetrotter.   Tyrone was inducted into the Hall of Fame this past June alongside  many other basketball legends.                            ____________________
