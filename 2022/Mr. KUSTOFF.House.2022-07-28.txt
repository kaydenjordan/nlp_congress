 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 75th  anniversary of The Mighty 990 radio station in Memphis. Its call  letters, KWAM, stand for We Are Memphis.   Over the years, legendary musicians, including Elvis Presley, have  been associated with The Mighty 990.   Today, the radio station is owned by Memphis native, Todd Starnes who  transformed KWAM into a news talk radio station with an emphasis on  developing local talent.   KWAM is a strong voice for people across west Tennessee and the  entire country broadcasting from the banks of the mighty Mississippi.   KWAM's roster of talent includes Todd Starnes' nationally syndicated  show, Tim Van Horn, and Earle Farrell, along with Chett and Dr. Sherrie  Hopper.   Congratulations to KWAM The Mighty 990 on this historic milestone.                            ____________________
