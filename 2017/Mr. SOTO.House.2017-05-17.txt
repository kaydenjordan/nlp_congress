 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   We are here today, more than 400 years after the first English  settlers landed in what became Jamestown, Virginia, to finally  establish a government-to-government relationship with the Indian  tribes who greeted those settlers.   The Virginia tribes that are recognized in this bill have treaties  with the King of England that date back to the early 1600s. Their  ancestors were there at Jamestown and facilitated the very founding and  early development of our Nation.   These tribes have been unable to claim their rightful Indian identity  in relation to the Federal Government, due in great part to the  machinations  [[Page H4258]]  of one man, Walter Ashby Plecker, the State registrar for the  Commonwealth in the early 20th century. Plecker, an avowed White  supremacist, ran Virginia's Bureau of Vital Statistics for over 34  years. From 1912 to 1947, Plecker set out to rid the Commonwealth of  any documents that recorded the existence of Indians or Indian tribes  living therein.   He was instrumental in ensuring passage of the Racial Integrity Act  in 1924, making it illegal for individuals to classify themselves or  their newborn children as Indian. But he went even further and spent  decades removing the category of Indian from birth and marriage  records. Although this paper genocide, as it has been termed, attempted  to erase the Virginia Indians from history, the tribal members held  firm to their culture and to their identity.   In 1997, State legislation was passed to help correct the records of  the Virginia Indians. Soon after, the Virginia Indians began their  quest for Federal recognition. Passage of this legislation will finally  put to end their 20-year struggle.   I commend and thank our colleague from Virginia (Mr. Wittman) for  bringing forth this bill. I also want to give special thanks to former  Congressman Jim Moran, who spent several years in this body championing  this legislation and tirelessly working toward its goals.   Mr. Speaker, it is time to finally put this issue to rest and correct  a historical injustice by extending Federal recognition to these six  Virginia tribes. I urge all of my colleagues to join me and support  this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. McEachin).    Mr. Speaker, it is time to right this wrong injustice and  bring truth back into our history.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
