 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my bipartisan  amendment, which would commit additional resources towards USAID's  efforts to combat illegal, underreported, and unregulated fishing  internationally.  [[Page H4679]]    This is particularly important to the Lowcountry, which has a vibrant  fishing industry that goes out of its way to safeguard our marine  resources. I want to make sure that they can compete in a fair market,  and that their work for the environment is not undermined by bad  actors.   American fisheries are some of the best managed in the world. But our  fishermen who work hard and play by the rules are constantly undercut  by low-cost imports caught by unscrupulous means. In fact, by some  estimates, commercial fishermen in the United States could see up to a  20 percent raise were it not for illegally-caught, imported fish. This  is not only due to the volume of illegal imports, it is also because  these illegal products come to market without meeting the safety,  labor, and environmental standards that American fishermen abide by.   It goes without saying that allowing this practice to continue  unchecked will have a disastrous effect on marine ecosystems and  encourage further crimes on the high seas. As a Member of the House  Natural Resources Committee, I am committed to protecting both the  environment and our fishermen.   My amendment would contribute to efforts to tackle this problem  before it reaches our shores. By helping partner nations build the  capacity to police their own waters, we will stop illegal fishing at  its source. My amendment supports an American foreign policy that is  both good for the environment and good for our fishermen. I urge all of  my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, to vote to support the  environment and the American fishing industry.
