 Mr. Chairman, at the outset, I, too, want to thank  Chairwoman Granger, Mr. Frelinghuysen, and Mr. Visclosky for the  coordinated, collegial approach in producing this very outstanding  bill. Of course, the entire staff on both sides of the aisle, I thank  them for their important work. We couldn't do it without them, for  sure.   The bill does reflect the collegial and bipartisan tradition of the  Defense Subcommittee, providing ample funding for the needs of our  armed services and intelligence community.   There are a number of provisions I would like to highlight:   Servicemembers receive a 2.6 percent pay raise, although I am  concerned their civilian counterparts who work side-by-side with  uniformed personnel will not see any increase;   $752 million is dedicated to congressionally directed medical  research programs that are so critical and lead to breakthroughs on  cancer, PTSD, Parkinson's, and more;   $8.4 is directed to bolster cybersecurity initiatives, $100 million  above the enacted level; and,   $500 million, the full amount in the MOU, is invested in the Israeli  Missile Defense Cooperative program.   The committee has taken its oversight responsibilities seriously to  encourage greater efficiency, improve transparency, strengthen  communication, and ensure the Department of Defense adheres to  congressional direction.   Unlike other spending measures considered this year, this bill is the  product of an inclusive process that invests in bipartisan priorities  and is free of poison pill riders. It was written within the funding  levels agreed upon in the most recent budget agreement, skipping OCO- to-base gimmicks previously employed to skirt the capped funding  levels.   Mr. Chairman, I urge its support.
