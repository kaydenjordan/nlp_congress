 Madam Speaker, almost 100,000 Americans have died from  COVID-19. Nearly 40 million unemployment claims have been filed. Our  economy is in shambles.   Two weeks ago, the House took action. We passed the HEROES Act, $3  trillion in new relief funds, to protect the lives and livelihoods of  the American people. Two weeks later, the Senate is on vacation. They  were in session last week, but all they did was move forward on  approving right-wing judges.   This is outrageous. The Senate is sitting on a bill that provides $1  trillion to pay first responders, healthcare workers, teachers who are  in danger of losing their jobs; $200 billion for hazard pay; $75  billion for testing, contact tracing, and isolation; and cash for  families, up to $6,000 per household.   The American people deserve better. They deserve a Senate that is  committed to protecting their health and safety. They deserve an up or  down vote on the HEROES Act in the Senate, not next week, not the week  after, but right now. The virus isn't taking a break, the United States  Senate shouldn't take a break either.                            ____________________
