 Madam Speaker, we have heard my Democratic colleagues  say that passing the equal rights amendment is necessary to secure  basic rights under the law for women. Not only is this untrue, it  obscures a fundamental fact. This ERA actually denies the most basic  human right: the right to life. This ERA uses gender equality as a  smokescreen to create an unlimited constitutional right to abortion.   Instead of working to craft legislation that protects women's rights  without trampling on the right to life, Democrats have put forward,  today, an unconstitutional, partisan measure.   Not only would this result in on-demand abortions across all 50  States, but it would also clear the way to provide taxpayer-funded  abortions throughout all 9 months of pregnancy, costing millions of  dollars every year.   This measure is not about advancing women's rights, especially as  women across the country, Republicans and Democrats alike, are  increasingly horrified by the practice of late-term abortion and by  recent comments made in New York and Virginia that lifesaving treatment  should be denied to some newborns.   Allowing women to discard their unborn children at taxpayer expense  is not ensuring gender equality. It is not protecting women. It is not  empowering women. It is not providing women equal pay for equal work.  It is simply another step down the path of devaluing all human life and  dignity.   Madam Speaker, I oppose this amendment and urge my colleagues to vote  ``no'' on this measure.
