 Madam President, in a few moments, the Senate will vote  on S. 1, the Strengthening America's Security in the Middle East Act.   This legislation contains several important bills to enhance defense  cooperation with our partners who share the goal of fighting terrorism  and promoting peace and prosperity.   For example, the bill includes the U.S.-Jordan Defense Cooperation  Extension Act, which extends an existing defense cooperation program  with Jordan that is set to expire later this year.   In the Senate Armed Services Committee this morning, we heard from  the Commander of U.S. Central Command responsible for the Middle East,  GEN Joseph Votel. He testified:         Jordan is one of our most committed partners in the Middle       East and one of the most critical voices of modern Islam in       the region. We must be careful to not take this vital       partnership for granted.    Jordan hosts over 750,000 refugees and contributes to the fight  against ISIS. This bill will enhance our cooperation, while enhancing  security and supporting vital humanitarian efforts being conducted by  this very important American ally.   The legislation also includes the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection  Act. This bill is named after a Syrian Army defector who exposed  photographs of torture and execution by the Syrian regime. His photos  are evidence of the war crimes and extensive human rights abuses  committed by Bashar al-Assad.   The Caesar bill will impose sanctions on individuals who support  Assad. These sanctions will limit the ability of the Assad government  to attack innocent civilians.   However, the bill before us is not perfect. I am concerned by title  IV of this package. Title IV should have had a full debate in the  Banking Committee before it ever reached the floor.  [[Page S851]]    I believe there are serious questions about how this bill will impact  the First Amendment rights of individuals who contract with State or  local governments in a professional capacity but choose to boycott  Israel in their personal capacity. These questions are even more  complicated when the individual in question is a sole proprietor, a  member of a small firm, or is receiving a small State contract.   Many of these questions are the result of the manner in which State  and local governments have designed and implemented disclosure  requirements. That is why I have introduced an amendment, Peters No.  103, which would limit application of State and local government laws  related to contracting.   This amendment would not allow a State or local government to enforce  measures to restrict contracting with firms of 10 or fewer employees,  contracts with a value of $100,000 or less, or any contract with a sole  proprietor.   This amendment would clarify that it is not the intention of the bill  to restrict the First Amendment right of any individual to protest-- including through boycott--in their personal capacity.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending  amendment, that amendment No. 103 be reported by number, and that the  amendment be agreed to without intervening action or debate.    Madam President, I am incredibly disappointed that we  could not include my amendment today.   I believe this is an important issue and that it must be clarified.  Ultimately, because of the many other critical provisions included in  this bill related to foreign policy in the Middle East, I will support  this bill today, but I also understand it is unlikely that the House of  Representatives will address this bill in its current form.   I am sending a letter to the House of Representatives explaining my  concerns with title IV, and I encourage them to adopt the provisions of  my amendment that I attempted to put forward today.   With that, I would also like to yield some time to my colleague from  Michigan.    Madam President, I yield the floor.
