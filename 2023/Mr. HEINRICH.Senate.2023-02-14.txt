 Mr. President, on February 13, 2023, I was unavoidably  absent for rollcall vote No. 9. My absence was due to official duties  in New Mexico that presented an unavoidable conflict. Had I been  present, I would have voted yea on vote No. 9.   On February 13, 2023, I was unavoidably absent for rollcall vote No.  10. My absence was due to official duties in New Mexico that presented  an unavoidable conflict. Had I been present, I would have voted yea on  vote No. 10.                            ____________________     Mr. President, we must never forget the ``first to  fire'' troops from the United States and the Philippines who bravely  defended Bataan, Corregidor, and other critical locations throughout  the Pacific theater in the early months of World War II before enduring  some of the most harrowing prisoners of war experiences in history.   Their combat experiences began hours after the attack on Pearl  Harbor, Hawaii Territory, on December 7, 1941. Imperial Japanese forces  launched coordinated attacks throughout Asia, striking Malaya,  Thailand, Singapore, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and the American Territories  of Guam, Midway, Wake Island, Howland Island, and the Commonwealth of  the Philippines.   By December 22, 1941, the American Territories of Guam and Wake  Island were surrendered to Imperial Japan. The Commonwealth of the  Philippines was under a full-scale invasion.   By March 10, 1942, the U.S. Asiatic Fleet was destroyed, and U.S.  Army Forces on Java in the Dutch East Indies were surrendered, and  General Douglas MacArthur was evacuated from Corregidor to Australia.   By June 9, 1942, all of the Philippines was surrendered. The Japanese  occupied the Alaskan islands of Kiska and Attu. Japanese forces threw  three captured American aviators from the Battle of Midway into the  sea.   Only in the Philippine Islands did U.S. Armed Forces under the  command of the United States Army Forces Far East--USAFFE--wage a  prolonged, 6-month resistance to Imperial Japan's invasion in contrast  to other Allied encounters with Japan throughout Southeast Asia.   In the Philippines, the ``first to fire'' at the Japanese invaders on  December 8, 1941, were the New Mexico National Guardsmen from the 200th  and 515th Coast Artillery (AA) regiments, who were stationed at Fort  Stotsenburg north of Manila with the mission of protecting Clark Field.   With the activation of War Plan Orange (WPO-3) on December 24, 1941,  USAFFE forces on the island of Luzon in the Philippines withdrew into  the Bataan Peninsula to defend Manila Bay and await for reinforcements,  which were never to come.   The withdrawal was covered by 26th Cavalry Regiment (Philippine  Scouts) and the Provisional Tank Group commanded by Brigadier General  James R. N. Weaver that was composed of the 192nd GHQ Light Tank  Battalion made up of Company A from Janesville, WI, Company B from  Maywood, IL, Company C from Port Clinton, OH, and Company D from  Harrodsburg, KY, and the GHQ 194th Light Tank Battalion made up of  Company A from Brainerd, MN, Company B from Saint Joseph, MO, and  Company C from Salinas, CA, and the 17th Ordnance Company (Armored).   On January 16, 1942, when Troop G of the 26th Cavalry encountered  Japanese forces at an escape route to Bataan, Lieutenant Edwin P.  Ramsey ordered the last cavalry charge in American history.   For the next 4 months, an estimated 12,000 American troops, 76,000  Filipino troops, and 20,000 Filipino civilians endured siege conditions  marked by hunger, disease, and confusion with dwindling and antiquated  war materiel.   The Japan's successful command of the air and sea in Southeast Asia  and the Southwest Pacific combined with Washington and London's  ``Europe First'' strategy foreclosed sending reinforcements and  supplies to the besieged islands in the Pacific.   Despite the combat prowess, dedication, and pure heroism of the  American and Filipino troops on Bataan, Commanding General Edward B.  King understood his seriously degraded force could not continue. He  surrendered the Bataan Peninsula on April 9, 1942.   With surrender, thousands of troops and civilians were assembled at  the Port of Mariveles at the tip of Bataan for a 65-mile merciless  march in the tropical sun up the peninsula to a train station at San  Fernando where they were packed standing into small unventilated  boxcars for the 24 miles to Capas. From there, the survivors were  forced to march 6 miles to Camp O'Donnell, a makeshift POW camp with  only one source of water.   This forced trek came to be known as the Bataan Death March as it was  marked by the Japanese capturers' conscious cruelty of withholding  food, water, and medicine, for looting and murder, and for inflicting  capricious abuse and torture upon defenseless prisoners.   For the next month, the Japanese under the command of General  Masaharu Homma unleashed a continual air and artillery assault on the  fortress islands of Corregidor (Ft. Mills), Ft. Frank, Ft. Hughes, and  Ft. Drum in Manila Bay.   After Japanese forces breached beach defenses on Corregidor,  Commanding General Jonathan Wainwright surrendered Corregidor and its  associated islands on May 6, 1942.   General Homma refused to accept the surrender and kept the men and  women held on the islands in Manila Bay as hostages until he received  assurance on June 9, 1942, that all the USAFFE troops throughout the  Philippines had surrendered.   On June 7, 1942, the Imperial Japanese Army occupied the Aleutian  Island of Attu, capturing the population of 42 Unangax (Aleut) and two  American citizens, one of whom was executed and the other taken to  Japan with the Alaska Natives as prisoners of war.   Included in the surrenders in the Philippines were female nurses of  U.S. Army, Navy, Philippine Army, and civilian volunteers who became  the first large group of American women in combat and, alongside the  five Navy nurses surrendered on Guam in December 1941, comprised the  first group of American military women taken captive and imprisoned by  an enemy.  [[Page S396]]    Between January of 1942 and December of 1944, thousands of prisoners  of war from the United States who had survived the surrenders  throughout the Pacific were shipped in unmarked transports, known as  ``hellships'' for forced labor, often with private companies,  throughout the Japanese Empire.   By the war's end, more than 12,000 Americans had died in squalid POW  camps, in the fetid holds of the ``hellships,'' or in forced labor  camps owned by Japanese companies where they were denied food, water,  sanitation, clothing, and medical care. As a result, the death rate for  American POWs of Japan was 40 percent. Less than half of the men of New  Mexico Coast Artillery and the members of the 192nd and 194th  Provisional Tank Battalions returned home after the war.   Surviving as a POW of Japan and returning home was the beginning of  new battles: finding acceptance in society and living with serious  mental and physical ailments that the Veterans Administration was  unprepared to address, resulting in death rates that were more than  twice those of the comparably aged White male population of the time.   The veterans of the early defensive battles in the Pacific  represented all States, Tribes, and Territories of the United States, a  diversity of ethnicities and religions embodying the American spirit of  perseverance, faith, and optimism.   President Ronald Reagan first proclaimed National Former Prisoner of  War Recognition Day in 1988, which was established to coincide with  April 9, the anniversary of the surrender of Bataan and the start of  the Bataan Death March.   The U.S. Navy has honored the service and heroism of the veterans of  early battles in the Pacific by naming several ships after the 1942  fighting in the Philippines and other places in the Pacific, including  one still in service, the USS Bataan (LHD-5), homeported in Norfolk,  VA; as well as the now decommissioned USS Corregidor (CVE-58); USS  Antrim (FFG-20); USS Bangust (DE-739), USS Baron (DE-739), USS Elrod  (FFG-55), and USS Rooks (DD-804).   It is time to recognize the Defenders of Bataan and Corregidor:  ordinary men and women who found uncommon courage in extraordinary  circumstances to fight the impossible and endure the unimaginable for  freedom from tyranny and oppression.                            ____________________
