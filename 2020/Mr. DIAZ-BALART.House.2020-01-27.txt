 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, today we stand in support of the international day of  commemoration in the memory of those victims of the Holocaust. January  27 is also the day, again, 75 years ago, when Auschwitz was liberated,  a day to remember the atrocities of the Holocaust so we may never allow  such a horror to happen again anywhere on this planet. We must  rededicate ourselves to ensuring that we confront evil and oppose all  forms of anti-Semitism.   Mr. Speaker, inconceivably, some have the audacity to deny that the  Holocaust happened. Others advocate for boycott, divestment, and  sanctions in regard to our democratic ally, the State of Israel.   We have seen shocking anti-Semitic attacks waged against Jewish  communities all over the world and even here in the United States. That  is why I am so proud to join with my colleagues here in the House from  both sides of the aisle in remembering our responsibility to confront  indifference to evil whenever evil raises its head.   Last week, I met with friends from the American Jewish Committee back  home in the district, and I learned that 25 percent of Jews are afraid  to visit their place of worship or to proudly display their deeply held  beliefs in public because they are concerned or potentially afraid for  their safety.   Seventy-five years ago, the world saw this horrific revelation of the  depths of human depravity. That is why, today, on the House floor, we  stand united, together. Despite our potential differences, our  religious traditions, our backgrounds, we stand united, together, to  reiterate that anti-Semitism will not be tolerated, Mr. Speaker, and  that Israel will always have the support of the United States of  America.
