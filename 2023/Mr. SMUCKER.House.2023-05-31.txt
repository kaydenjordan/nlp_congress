 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Fiscal Responsibility  Act. How could I not support a bill that claws back billions in unspent  COVID funds, a bill that cuts trillions in Biden's out-of-control  spending, a bill that caps spending levels for years to come, and a  bill that enacts work requirements to bring more Americans back into  the workforce, lift households out of poverty by connecting them with  the best antipoverty program--a good job. Most importantly, this bill  is the beginning. It is a start to put our Nation on a better fiscal  trajectory.   Our debt-to-GDP today is at the highest level ever since the end of  World War II. If we do nothing to curb spending, our Federal debt will  be double our GDP by 2050. This is a start to change our trajectory.   Now, I wish I could be voting for more than this. I liked our  original bill a heck of a lot better, but the fact is, the President  and the Democrats who  [[Page H2701]]  control the Senate fought hard to maintain their spending addiction.   Given that we only control the House, I am very pleased with all that  is in this bill. It is most definitely an improvement over existing  law, and I am disappointed that some of my colleagues don't see that.   This bill will give our creditors the confidence that we can govern  by putting us on a better path.   It is a step in the right direction, and I am proud to support it.
