 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the America  COMPETES Act. This legislation will transport our Nation into the  future, it will strengthen supply chains, advance manufacturing, and  create millions of jobs. Ways and Means members assertively made their  contributions to this package, including a strong provision for Trade  Adjustment Assistance.   To the previous speaker, I know he was sincere in what he said. There  will be a final package, it will be bicameral in nature, bipartisan in  nature, it is just too important to get done. The rhythms of  legislative life will dictate that outcome. This is a full effort of  the House, and to say that there are no provisions in here that  Republicans will favor is simply untrue.   The Trade Subcommittee chairman, Earl Blumenauer, has been a very  important leader in developing this legislation, along with our  colleague, Tim Ryan, who has not stopped telling me of just how  important this is to Ohio to fund the Nation's newest semiconductor  factory. This is a good, bold proposal.   I am going to remain standing Madam Speaker, so that I might yield  the balance of my time to the Trade Subcommittee chair, Mr. Blumenauer.    I yield to the gentleman from Oregon.
