 Mr. Speaker, Bret Baier of Fox News has a  new book called, ``Three Days in January.'' It is primarily about  President Eisenhower's warnings against the excesses of the military- industrial complex.   Today, we have a military-industrial security complex that is more  about money than it is about any realistic threat.   I think President Eisenhower would be shocked at how far we have  traveled down the road against which he warned us. Our new President  has spoken out against the excessive, exorbitant cost of some of our  newest military equipment and weapons systems.   The only way we will ever bring these costs under control is if we  stop the revolving door at the Pentagon, where the defense contractors  hire all of the retired admirals and generals.   President Eisenhower once said: Heaven help us if we ever have a  President who doesn't know as much about the military as he did.   We need more leaders who have the guts to say ``no'' to the excessive  spending by the military-industrial complex.                            ____________________
