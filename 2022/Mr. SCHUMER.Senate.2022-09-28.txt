 Mr. President, before I begin my remarks, I was just  watching the ``TODAY'' show. That is why I was late.   They have a surprise neighbor of the month, and when they come in and  surprise him, all his neighbors are there because he is such a great  neighbor.   Well, Ernie Mann--who is the father of Steve Mann, who has been my  deputy State director since I have been Senator for over 20 years--a  teacher in the community, a volunteer firefighter for 60 years, and  just a great guy and a wonderful Yankee fan. They had Nestor Cortes get  on the phone and speak to him. He was just made the neighbor of--I  think it is of the month, but maybe it is of the year. Anyway, he  deserves it. It was wonderful. It was beautiful to see.   So, Ernie--and to all the Mann family, including the great Steve, who  has done such a great job for me--congratulations. Good luck. It was  beautiful. It was beautiful.                            Continuing Resolution    Mr. President, now let's get to the substance of the day.   Last night, by a vote of 72 to 23, the Senate agreed to advance a  shell for a continuing resolution to keep the government open until  December 16 and avoid a needless government shutdown.   As my colleagues know, government funding runs out Friday at  midnight, whereupon a partial shutdown would begin if we do not act. We  must work fast to finish the process here on the floor, send a CR to  the House, and then send it to the President's desk before the clock  runs out. With cooperation from our Republican colleagues, the Senate  can finish its work with keeping the government open as soon as  tomorrow. There is every reason in the world to get to yes, and I look  forward to working with Leader McConnell to make sure we can do that  and not bump up into the Friday midnight deadline.   I urge my colleagues on both sides to work with us together to speed  this process as quickly as we can through  [[Page S5116]]  the floor, especially since the CR contains many things both parties  support.   I am talking about billions in disaster aid to help communities in  Kentucky, Louisiana, Alabama, Texas, Alaska, and Puerto Rico, battered  by floods and disasters over the past year; as well as help for New  Mexico to recover from its worst wildfire in the State's history.   We must also renew the FDA user fees for the next 5 years to prevent  the slowdown of innovative drugs and medical devices so needed by our  people and to prevent thousands of workers--good, hard-working  workers--who help approve these drugs and make sure they are safe from  being furloughed.   And, crucially, we must also approve critical emergency aid for the  people of Ukraine. Over the past few weeks, it has become clear that  U.S. assistance has made an enormous difference in helping Ukraine  defend itself.   I want to salute President Biden. He has done a masterful job in  helping the Ukrainians and leading us. But the Congress in a bipartisan  way has gone along in the past. We have not only got along, but we  enthusiastically supported our help for Ukraine. I certainly  enthusiastically support it, and we have to continue. The conflict in  Ukraine is far from over and our obligation remains to help them,  however we can, to beat the brutal, nasty, vicious Putin.   I want to also thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who  worked day and night to put this CR together, especially my friend  Senator Leahy, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and  Ranking Member Shelby for his good work. They are both retiring. Let's  hope this is the last CR they do so we get an omnibus done in December.   I also want to recognize all of my other colleagues on the  Appropriations Committee and in the Senate and all their great staffs,  who have worked hard to make sure we don't have a needless shutdown.   Twenty months into the Democratic majority, I want to take a moment  to highlight the many, many accomplishments we have secured in this  Chamber, the most in recent memory. This is one of the most productive  Congresses we have had in a very long time, and we have worked hard  every step of the way to improve the lives of the American people, to  help those in the middle class stay in the middle class, and to help  those struggling to get into the middle class, making it a little  easier for them to get there.   A few months ago, for instance, after the tragedies in Uvalde,  Buffalo, and so many others, the Senate came together on a bipartisan  basis to break the grip of the NRA and pass the first gun safety bill  in three decades. It was the first gun safety bill since the Brady Act,  which I was proud to author as a Member of Congress, 30 years ago. It  took 30 years to get some real progress made, but we did, and we have  to continue.   A few weeks later, we passed the largest expansion of veterans'  benefits in a generation to help veterans suffering from cancers, lung  diseases, and other ailments stemming from toxic exposure. Again, it  was a bipartisan bill. Senators Tester and Moran led the way. It was a  really good bill, and thousands and thousands and thousands of veterans  who risked their lives for us are now getting the help they always  needed and deserved.   And, as Ukraine fights for survival, we strengthened NATO--again,  bipartisan--by adding Finland and Sweden to its ranks, sending Putin a  clear message that he can't intimidate America or Europe.   And, as the Chinese Communist Party continues its drive to outcompete  the United States, we passed the CHIPS and Science Act, the largest  manufacturing, science, and jobs bill we have seen in decades, bringing  jobs back to America in high-end manufacturing and in research, to keep  us No. 1 on into the 21st century as the leading economy, free and  democratic, in the world.   Our efforts, of course, culminated in the crowning jewel of them all,  the Inflation Reduction Act--a groundbreaking bill that will lower  prescription drug costs, lower the price of insulin for seniors on  Medicare, and help Americans save on energy costs with the largest  clean energy investments in American history.   I am so proud that my caucus stuck together in getting this important  bill done. We needed every vote, and we got it--and that is only what  we have done since June.   Over the past year, we have enacted the first infrastructure law in  decades--the largest, biggest infrastructure law in decades. We  revamped our post office, finally, and put it on a good track. We  reinstated VAWA, the Violence Against Women Act, after years of trying.  We finally declared lynching a Federal hate crime after a century of  delay, and we unanimously ended forced arbitration for sexual  harassment and assault in the workplace.   Then, of course, we have confirmed over 80 qualified nominees to the  Federal bench, including Ketanji Brown Jackson as the first Black woman  ever to sit on the Supreme Court. Roughly three-quarters of the  President's nominees have been women and two-thirds people of color.  With one nominee at a time, we are making our Federal bench a better  reflection of our great country.   All of these accomplishments will echo for years in the lives of the  American people. They were hard to get done, especially in a 50-50  Senate. While we have gotten so much done, there is a lot, certainly  more, we have to do.   I have always said, from my first days as majority leader, that  Democrats would be willing to work in a bipartisan way to get things  done whenever we could, but of course, on such important issues like  climate, when we are unable to find common ground, Democrats will hold  firm in the defense of our values and show the American people the  choice before them in the coming election, as we did in the IRA. Sadly,  since the overturning of Roe, that contrast has come into sharper focus  than we have seen in years.   One example is in Arizona. For decades, overturning Roe and  eliminating the right to choose had been the North Star for many in the  Republican Party--for most, it seems--in orienting much of their  legislation, their candidates, and their nominees they elevate to the  judiciary. All too often, Republican Senators and legislators--even  when they might not agree with the extreme MAGA position on abortion-- go along because they are afraid of the consequences in a primary.   Well, we saw another horrifying consequence of this late last week  when a judge in Arizona upheld a radical abortion ban that dates back  to the time of the Civil War--even before Arizona became a State. In  the blink of an eye, the right to choose has been practically  eliminated in Arizona, a devastating blow to the freedoms of millions  of Arizonan women.   The law held in Arizona is as cruel and radical as it comes. It dates  all the way back to the 1860s--the 1860s, not the 1960s--and provides  no exceptions for rape and incest. It tells young women who are raped  or who are subject to incest: You have to carry the baby all the way to  term. You have to carry the fetus all the way to term.   That is terrible. That is terrible.   It allows for the prosecution of doctors and, even worse, of those  who assist women in accessing abortion.   In response, the MAGA state attorney general released a statement,  saying: We applaud the court for upholding the will of the legislature.   The 1860s. The 1860s.   MAGA Republicans are making it clear as day exactly where they stand  on the right to choose. They want to make freedom of choice extinct  across the country--period.   The Arizona ruling is hardly the only example of Republican State  legislatures, as we see in places like Indiana, South Carolina, and  many others, that have already introduced or enacted restrictions with  few exceptions for rape and incest.   Look, at the end of the day, this isn't about States' rights despite  what Republicans have claimed. This is about getting rid of the right  to choose in its entirety. If anyone has any doubts, look no further  than the national ban that was introduced right here in the Senate not  3 weeks ago.   And while Republicans will try to deflect, distort, or mainly  distract from their record--they don't like talking about this because  they know the American people are not on their side, but their hard- right, MAGA core is--they are stuck. The fact is that every  [[Page S5117]]  Senate Republican--every Senate Republican--is already on record as  voting in favor of a national ban--sometimes more than once--here on  the floor.   So the contrast has become clear--clear, clear as could be: While  Democrats want to protect a woman's freedom to choose, MAGA Republicans  want to take away that right with proposals to ban freedom of choice in  its entirety and to punish women and doctors for carrying out  abortions, even past bans, with no exceptions for rape or incest. We  are seeing it play out across the country, and it is chilling to the  bone.   Democrats will keep fighting these MAGA abortion bans--these radical  MAGA abortion bans--and make clear to all that we are the party  fighting to protect people's freedoms over their own bodies.
