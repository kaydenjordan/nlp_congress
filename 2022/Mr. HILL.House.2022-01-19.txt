 Madam Speaker, if the Biden administration were a new TV  show streaming on Netflix or HBO, it clearly would have been canceled  after the end of the first season.   On this anniversary of Mr. Biden's failed first year, I call  attention to the crisis at the Southwest border, a crisis which  President Biden and the Democrats have continuously chosen to turn a  blind eye to. In just 1 year, over 1.7 million illegal immigrants have  been apprehended at the border--an all-time high.   President Trump spent 4 years fighting to secure our border by  enacting policies to keep Americans--especially in our communities  along the border--safe. After less than a month in office, President  Biden revoked the Trump-era border policies and replaced them, Madam  Speaker, with what?   Absolutely nothing.   In April, 3 months after Joe Biden took office and 2 months after  these policies were rescinded, I made my seventh trip to the Southwest  border. During that visit, I witnessed the most unstable conditions  that I have seen since coming to Congress. I immediately called on  President Biden then to reinstate the Trump-era policies that were  working along our border.   Finally, just a few weeks ago in December, it was announced that  President Biden planned to re-implement President Trump's Remain in  Mexico policy. But, Madam Speaker, we need action, not talk. President  Biden should visit the border and talk to the communities there.  President Biden should fire his Homeland Security Secretary who is not  getting the job done.   So in this first failed year, President Biden has neglected our  Southwest border. That neglect is evident with deteriorating  conditions, apprehensions at an all-time high, and record amounts of  illegal drugs pouring across our open border and poisoning  our families.    Americans deserve better. Americans deserve a secure border, and  Americans deserve leadership.
