 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 800,000 Federal  employees impacted by the partial government shutdown and express my  sincere agreement that banks and Federal regulators should do the  compassionate and the sensible thing, to support customers in need of  assistance.   Mr. Speaker, whether it was a missed credit card payment or an  unexpected medical expense, many furloughed Federal employees have  faced economic hardships over the last 35 days, through no fault of  their own. A string of dead-end and dead-on-arrival bills and  nonstarter negotiations thrust hardworking Federal employees into the  middle of a political fight, all over commonsense border security  measures that I support, and that many Democrats have supported  previously.   Our only course of action at that time and now is to try and provide  some relief to those who are in need, and most importantly, find a  solution to ensure that the government doesn't shut down again on  February 15. But those are larger political issues, and we are trying  to be of substance as to what we can do to be of assistance to those  who were affected by the government shutdown within our committee of  jurisdiction, the Financial Services Committee.   I appreciate Chairwoman Waters' efforts to provide support for  hardworking Federal employees by introducing this resolution and  encouraging banks to assist their customers in need.   Thankfully, many financial institutions are already doing exactly  what is suggested in this resolution, and that, as Chairwoman Waters  said in her statement, is at the urging of Members of Congress, but  also their understanding of the needs in their communities, like  waiving late fees for furloughed employees, or the other over 100 banks  that took it upon themselves for loan modifications and payment  deadline extension, payroll advances, low-rate and zero-rate loans, as  well as other accommodations, and those are wonderful things, positive  things.   Unfortunately, we now find ourselves in a situation where the  financial regulatory regime has left banks trying their best under a  cloud of uncertainty on how regulators will react to their efforts  during the government shutdown.   While I agree with my colleague across the aisle that we should  encourage banks to work more proactively with customers affected in the  shutdown, we must also encourage our financial regulators to provide  clarity to our financial institutions that they are permitted to  provide that type of relief.    I have no doubt this issue will be a part of a larger conversation I  hope that we can have on the Financial Services Committee about what  regulators are doing to help individual taxpayers and also what they  are doing that hurts the American people as well.   Mr. Speaker, I think this is a good bill that I encourage my  colleagues to support.    I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Reclaiming my time, I did not write the legislation. The  intention here is the encouragement of Federal regulators to take a new  look. I think that is the broad understanding of what this resolution  gets to. I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H1266]]                                     time  1400     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from West  Virginia (Mr. Mooney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from West Virginia.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this House resolution. I  think this resolution truly expresses the sense of Congress that we  should provide relief that, voluntarily, over 100 financial  institutions have already committed to do publicly over the course of  the shutdown. But I think it shows that we are a compassionate group of  folks here in the House of Representatives and that we want to be  sensible in every way possible, even in the midst of these major  political fights that do occur from time to time, perhaps, here on this  House floor.   Those disagreements notwithstanding, what we want to do is work in a  proactive way and in a bipartisan way to convey to the public that  there are sensible things that we are about, and that Republicans and  Democrats still can get things done here on the House floor, here doing  the people's business and the people's work.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support Chairwoman Waters'  resolution here today, and I yield back the balance of my time.
