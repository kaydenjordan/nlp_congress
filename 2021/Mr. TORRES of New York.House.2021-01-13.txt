 Madam Speaker, the dangerous mob that Donald  Trump unleashed on the United States Capitol represents a violent  assault on the separation of powers and on the peaceful transfer of  power that we have long taken for granted.   The impeachment of Donald Trump is not politics but law, not passion  but reason, not vengeance but justice. And we, as the people's  Representatives, must rise to the challenge of defending democracy in  the face of its gravest threat, and we will.
