 Mr. Speaker, I always say that Vermont is held together  with duct tape, twine, and hundreds of hours of volunteer service.   The other thing that we know about Vermonters: They pay their bills.  They also stay when you are in the midst of an emergency, which is  where we are right now.   Mr. Speaker, I led my senate chamber. When you are facing a budgetary  crisis, you don't leave. You stay. You engage. It doesn't matter if it  is 1 o'clock in the morning, 2 o'clock in the morning, or overnight,  you stay.   We are public servants.   I can't believe that not five so-called moderate Republicans--because  we hear about them all the time, that there is a group of reasonable  Republicans. Where are they? We need just  [[Page H2614]]  five to sign the discharge petition and be done with this.   Pay our bills, that is what we are talking about--pay our bills and  not be held hostage and make dramatic cuts that are going to affect  veterans, going to affect students, going to affect working families.  That is what we are talking about.   Where are they? Where are the five moderate Republicans that we  always hear about?   They are not here. They left.                            ____________________
