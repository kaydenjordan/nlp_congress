 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 274, which  was introduced by my colleague, Ms. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen.   This legislation condemns the government of Iran's state-sponsored  persecution of its Baha'i minority and its continued violation of  international covenants on human rights.   Following the Islamic revolution of Iran in 1979, members of the  Baha'i Faith, the largest non-Muslim religious minority in the country,  have been subjected to relentless persecution. In Iran, no rights or  protections are accorded to those who are adherents of religions not  recognized under the Iranian constitution.   The Iranian government refuses to recognize the Baha'i Faith as a  religion and justifies persecution of the Baha'i under this pretext.   Iran has criminalized ordinary Baha'i religious practices of worship,  religious training, and fellowship. It has also denied Baha'i people  government pension  [[Page H8251]]  benefits, higher education, business licenses in about 2 dozen fields,  and even the right of self-defense.   Mr. Speaker, I call on the House to pass H.R. 274 to show that this  chamber and our Nation support the Baha'i people and stand with them in  the face of Iran's tyranny.                            ____________________
