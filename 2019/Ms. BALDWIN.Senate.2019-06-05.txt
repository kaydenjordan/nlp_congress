 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    I rise today to once again speak about the ongoing  threat in the Trump administration to the healthcare and guaranteed  protections that millions of American families depend upon. President  Trump has tried to pass through the Congress repeal plans that would  take people's healthcare away and allow insurance companies to  discriminate against people with preexisting health conditions or  refuse to serve them at all.   When that legislative repeal effort failed in 2017, instead of  working in a bipartisan way to lower healthcare costs and improve  access to care for all Americans, President Trump turned to another  tactic--sabotaging our healthcare system--and there are more Americans  uninsured today than there were when he took office.   The Trump administration has even gone to court. They have gone to  court to support a lawsuit that would overturn the Affordable Care Act,  including its provisions that protect people with preexisting health  conditions from discrimination. Just think about that. He is asking a  court to strike down healthcare protections for Americans. If he  succeeds, insurance companies will once again be able to deny coverage  or charge much higher premiums  [[Page S3243]]  for the more than 130 million Americans who have some sort of  preexisting health condition, including more than 2 million who live in  the State of Wisconsin.   What is the President's plan to protect people with preexisting  conditions? He doesn't have one. He never has. And I have to say that I  doubt he ever will. In fact, this administration has expanded what I  call junk insurance plans. These are insurance plans that can deny  coverage to people with preexisting health conditions, and they don't  have to cover basic and essential health services, like prescription  drugs or emergency room visits or maternity care. Most of these junk  plans don't cover those things.   When I spoke about this expansion of what I call junk insurance on  the Senate floor 2 weeks ago, one of my Republican colleagues responded  and claimed that these plans preserve preexisting conditions  protections and essential health benefits. So today I wanted to clarify  the record, and let's look at the fine print together.   One of the junk plans currently available in my home State of  Wisconsin reads, ``This plan has a preexisting limitation provision  that may prevent coverage from applying to medical conditions that  existed prior to this plan's effective date.''   Another junk plan that is sold in Wisconsin states that the plan does  not comply with the guaranteed essential benefits provided by the  Affordable Care Act. To quote directly, the description reads: ``This  coverage is not required to comply with certain federal market  requirements for health insurance, principally those contained in the  Affordable Care Act.'' The tiny fine print on this particular junk plan  instructs individuals to check their coverage carefully to make sure  they are ``aware of any exclusions or limitation regarding coverage of  pre-existing conditions or health benefits (such as hospitalization,  emergency services, maternity care, preventive care, prescription  drugs, and mental health and substance use disorder services). Your  certificate might also have lifetime and/or annual dollar limits on  health benefits.''   The Affordable Care Act protects people against these insurance  company abuses. Yet the expansion of these junk plans puts the power  back in the hands of big insurance companies.   Let me be clear. American families do not want to go back to the days  when health insurers could discriminate against people with preexisting  health conditions, women, and seniors by denying them coverage or  charging them higher premiums simply because they get sick.   As I have said in this Chamber many times, the people of Wisconsin  want both parties in Congress to work together to make things better by  making healthcare more affordable.   I have heard from several Wisconsinites who want to know why the  President is working to repeal the Affordable Care Act and take away  their protections by expanding these junk plans. They are frightened  that if this sabotage of our health system continues, insurance  companies will again be able to deny coverage or charge higher premiums  for the more than 130 million Americans who have preexisting health  conditions, again, including more than 2 million in my home State of  Wisconsin.   I heard from Keri from Baraboo. Keri is a three-time cancer  survivor--two breast cancer diagnoses and one melanoma. She experienced  her first diagnosis at age 29. Now at age 61, Keri is able to get the  healthcare she needs without being punished financially for having a  preexisting condition. Keri is worried that if the Affordable Care Act  is repealed, she could lose her health coverage or could be charged  more because of her preexisting condition.   Another Wisconsinite, Keith in Brookfield, recently wrote in to my  office about what healthcare means to him and his family. Keith and his  son both have type 1 diabetes. Both of them have health insurance  through the Affordable Care marketplace that allows them to afford the  insulin, glucose test strips, and other medications they need. If the  Affordable Care Act is repealed, Keith and his son likely would not  even be eligible to purchase one of these junk insurance plans. They  could be denied coverage entirely due to their preexisting condition.   We really need to act to stop this sabotage now. I want to protect  the guaranteed healthcare protections that millions of Americans depend  on. That is why I have introduced legislation, with my colleague,  Senator Doug Jones of Alabama, to overturn the Trump administration's  expansion of junk insurance plans, because we should be increasing  access to affordable, high-quality healthcare options.   The entire Senate Democratic caucus supports this legislation, along  with the two Independents who caucus with us. The Nation's top  healthcare organizations, representing tens of thousands of the  Nation's physicians, patients, medical students, and other health  experts, support this legislation.   Anyone who says they support healthcare coverage for people with  preexisting conditions should support this bill.   Mr. President, as in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the HELP Committee be discharged from further consideration of S.  1556; that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; that the  bill be considered read a third time and passed; and that the motions  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I am disappointed that my Republican  colleagues have once again chosen to object to protecting people with  preexisting conditions.    Senator, I would be happy to yield.    I would concur and say that the reason they have earned  the nickname ``junk plans'' is because, frankly, some of them are  hardly worth the paper they are written on.   First of all, they do not have to comply with some of the very  important protections we included as part of the Affordable Care Act-- otherwise known as ObamaCare--especially to protect people who have  been ill once before or have been injured once before, people who have  a preexisting health condition, maybe a chronic condition that will  require medical care throughout their lives.   In the old days, which apparently the Republican Senator wants to  return to, there were all sorts of abuses, I would argue, that  insurance companies could employ in order to limit their exposure, if  you will. They had annual limits. They had lifetime limits. They had  the capacity to drop somebody from coverage after an illness developed.  They had the capacity to say: No, we are not going to offer you  insurance. They certainly had the capacity to charge discriminatory  premiums based on the preexisting condition. That causes great concern.   I just recently saw a report about how much a typical--put it this  way: a woman with a breast cancer diagnosis who requires chemotherapy  and radiation treatment and medication--how much she would be  anticipated to spend out-of-pocket if she had a junk plan at the time  that diagnosis was made. It was, on average, $40,000.   We also need to talk about another impact these junk plans have, and  that is, if you think you have a really good chance of being healthy  for the next year, and you decide ``This is a risk I can take,'' you  are then fundamentally changing the structure of the marketplace for  everyone else. You can anticipate that this is a choice healthier,  maybe younger people will make, and it has a distorting impact on  premiums in the marketplace. In fact, that is why these plans were  curtailed under the previous administration. Now, this administration  is greatly expanding these. They are no longer short term. They are  long term, and a lot of harm will come.   I want to conclude and say that when we have an administration that  first fought legislatively to repeal the Affordable Care Act and then  acted administratively to undermine and sabotage the Affordable Care  Act through all sorts of administrative Executive actions, including  defunding the State navigators who helped people make wise selections  for their insurance and also limiting the open enrollment period, and  when we have an administration that has decided to go to court and  asked the court to strike down a U.S. law in its entirety, we know  there is sabotage going on.   I think the choice for the American people couldn't be clearer. We  want to make things better, and the administration--enabled by some of  my Senate Republican colleagues--is walking down a path that has led to  2 million people losing their health insurance and others at grave risk  of losing it in the future.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I am proud to rise today to celebrate the  100th anniversary of the day my home State of Wisconsin became the  first State in the Nation to ratify the 19th Amendment to the U.S.  Constitution, giving women the right to vote.   Although the outcome was a historic victory, women did not gain the  right to vote without a struggle. The road to Wisconsin's ratification  of the 19th Amendment was paved with more than 70 years of advocacy and  speeches, marches and rallies, legislation and lawsuits by strong  Wisconsin suffragists. Many of the battles were lost before they were  won.   When Wisconsin became a State in 1848, only White male landowners  over 21 years of age could vote. In 1869, women won the right to run  for local school boards in Wisconsin but ironically could not vote for  themselves. In 1886, Wisconsin voters approved a statewide referendum  allowing women to vote in school elections. When women tried to  exercise their new rights for the first time in 1887, however, many  women's ballots were discarded because there was no way to verify that  women voted only in school elections. Racine suffragist Olympia Brown  sued to have her ballot accepted, but the State supreme court said the  law was vague and needed to be rewritten. Fourteen years later, the  Wisconsin Legislature approved the creation of separate ballots for  women that only included school elections.   In 1911, Wisconsin suffragists persuaded the legislature to authorize  a statewide referendum on voting rights for women, but it was soundly  defeated by an electorate that didn't include women. Two years later,  the legislature again called for a referendum on women's suffrage, but  it was vetoed by the Governor. In 1915, another attempt at a referendum  was rejected by lawmakers.   Women's suffrage fared much better when the debate over voting rights  shifted from individual States to the national stage. Congress passed  the 19th Amendment on June 4, 1919. Less than a week later, on June  10th, the Wisconsin Legislature ratified the amendment, narrowly  beating out its neighbor to the south. Illinois had actually ratified  the amendment an hour before Wisconsin, but a paperwork error delayed  the filing of the Illinois documents. By August 26, 1920, the necessary  36 States had ratified the 19th Amendment, and women were granted full  voting rights.   As we celebrate the centennial of this historic moment, it is  important to acknowledge that ratification of the 19th Amendment did  not extend voting rights to all women. Advocacy for suffrage for Black  women was often abandoned in an attempt to gain support for  ratification in the South. African-American women faced  disenfranchisement tactics that ranged from separate long lines and  civics tests to poll taxes and even beatings. Many of these tactics  continued until passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.   Wisconsin owes its unique position in history to the voices of  powerful Wisconsin women who not only spoke truth to power but who also  shattered the glass ceiling in their professional lives. Belle Case  LaFollette, originally from Summit, was the first woman to graduate  from law school in Wisconsin. Laura Ross Wolcott from Milwaukee was  Wisconsin's first woman physician. Olympia Brown of Racine was the  first woman to be ordained a minister in the entire country. Nationally  renowned suffragist Carrie Chapman Catt from Ripon was indispensable to  passage of the amendment. As the first woman to represent Wisconsin in  the U.S. House of Representatives and now the U.S. Senate, I am humbled  to walk the path these strong women helped forge for their successors.   One hundred years ago, after decades of struggle by brave women and  men, our Nation finally extended to women the most fundamental right in  our democracy--the right to vote. As we celebrate this historic  milestone in our Nation's history, let us vow to continue to fight for  full equality for women, including access to health care, in workplace  salaries, and in representation the Halls of Congress.                            ____________________
