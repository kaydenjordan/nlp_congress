 Mr. Speaker, I rise to underline the partnership  between the United States and the Republic of India.   I recently met with India's consul general, Dr. Swati Kulkarni, and  an entrepreneur, Mohit Mankad, in my Knoxville office. We talked about  India's developmental journey, its leadership over the G20, and the  growing partnership between our countries.   I believe it is important to the United States to align itself with  countries that share its values, and our Nation clearly has a lot in  common with India. They are, apparently, the oldest democracy in the  world. We all value democracy, the free market, and international  trade.   I see these values in my Indian constituents who came to this country  to live out the American Dream. They work very hard to earn an honest  living. They love their families, and they contribute to the  communities around them.   I fully support expanding our diplomatic relationship with India. As  we work toward that goal, I will encourage the Indian Government to  make it safer for Christians and people of all religions and faiths to  safely practice their faith in public as they do in a truly free  society.   I think we would all benefit from a closer relationship and growing  our shared values.                            ____________________
