 Mr. Chair, in rising to support my colleague, Mr.  Denham, on this amendment, I note that the California State Water Board  is contemplating their next water grab, and how disconnected from  reality these regulators are.   In the latest plan, they want to take 40 percent of the flows from  San Joaquin. Concurrently, they have a pending proposal to also  increase the volume of flows from the Sacramento River, in my region,  that washes out to the ocean, all under the guise, the failing guise of  protecting fish. They are contemplating 45 to 65 percent of unimpeded  flow.   We already know that when it comes to protectin people or fish,  Sacramento always decides to choose the latter. This plan defies even  basic common sense or fairness.    Instead, it relies on questionable science to impose arbitrary  restrictions, with no solutions to address the loss of habitat for  native species, or even the predators in the delta, which we already  know to be a major threat to the fish population. Up to 90 percent of  the affected species are devoured by these predator fish.   It offers no recourse for the devastating impact it will have on jobs  and local economies.   I would like to remind the regulators, California voters  overwhelmingly supported the effort to direct $2.7 billion for water  storage projects, recognizing the need to invest in infrastructure such  as Sites Reservoir.   If that project already existed, the reservoir would be nearly full  right now, providing enough water to serve 3.6 million Californians for  an entire year, and relieve the stress on the Sacramento and Central  Valley water systems.   Mr. Chair, we need some common sense. I urge my colleagues to support  Mr. Denham's amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend and note Nevada  County Farm Bureau in my district in northern California that is  celebrating this weekend their 100th anniversary of existence in Nevada  County, helping farmers and ranchers with the very diverse types of  crops they have, not like in the flatlands, but nestled in the  foothills and the mountains of Nevada County.   They have different crops: hay crops, tree crops, even a level of  forestry that they are all involved with there. The Farm Bureau has  been a leader a long time in helping those folks to navigate  regulations, ideas for better propagation of their crops, and just a  better way to do things in the community.   We appreciate their leadership and all of their memberships to help  make farming strong.   Congratulations to the Nevada County Farm Bureau on 100 years of  helping their members in Nevada County.                            ____________________
