 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I want to begin by recognizing two  members of my team who will be leaving at the end of this week--Tricia  Peebles and Adrian Deveny--who are on to new adventures and new  opportunities to make the world a better place.   Tricia has been with me on my Senate team for over 10 years--since I  came to the Senate just over 10 years ago. Before that, she was with me  on my team when I was speaker in Oregon for 2 years. So it has now been  a dozen years of working together. From the very beginning of this wild  ride, she has been with me as my State scheduler. I don't know how I  could have done any of it without her.   When you are inventing a State Senate office from the ground up and  you need someone with imagination, creativity, and commitment, well,  Tricia has all of those in spades. Out in Oregon, she is not only the  gatekeeper and defender of my schedule, she is a real advocate, making  sure I connect with and hear from and work with Oregonians from all  walks of life, Oregonians from every corner of our beautiful State. She  has used her uncanny knowledge of the map of Oregon and small cities to  get me to townhalls in each of Oregon's 36 counties year after year for  10 years straight. She has done so with military precision. Seriously,  it is amazing. Name any two cities in the State, and Tricia can tell  you how long it takes to drive between them, any potential road  hazards, and most importantly, the nearest Subway sandwich shop so the  team can stop and get a bite to eat.   It is always tough to lose an original member of a team, and I  honestly don't know how we are going to fill the very large space that  will be left in her absence, but I am very excited for her as she takes  on her next adventure and wish her nothing but the best.   Adrian Deveny joined my office back in March of 2011. Here we are,  almost 8 years later, and he has been an indispensable member of my  team. In his 8 years, he has been leading our efforts to tackle the  greatest challenge facing humankind on this planet--the challenge of  carbon pollution and climate chaos.   He has taken us through initiatives, such as the Keep It in the  Ground Act, which said that we as citizens of the United States must no  longer profit from leasing out the fossil fuels that we own for  extraction and combustion because it contributes to the problem, and  the 100 by `50 Act, which said that we need to get to 100 percent  renewable energy and that we need to do so by the  [[Page S880]]  year 2050 or earlier and laid out a detailed roadmap on how to do so in  each section of the energy economy.   He tirelessly advocated for programs that had real, direct impacts on  people's daily lives, whether it was the Rural Energy Savings Program,  which created the opportunity throughout rural America for families to  upgrade the insulation in their homes and businesses to save energy and  have it paid for in large part by those savings in energy, or reforming  our Nation's outdated chemical laws with the significant reform of  TSCA, where he played a central negotiating role to try to get us from  the starting line to the finish line, or helping make electric cars  more affordable.   He did all of this and so much more and always with the type of  steady disposition, cheerful attitude, nothing but kind words, and  support for his teammates that really helped him to be a key  facilitator with staff throughout the Senate. He has been the calm in a  chaotic storm of a Senate office. It will be tough to see him go, but  he won't be going too far away--just moving over from our office in the  Hart Office Building to the minority leader's office, Chuck Schumer's  office, here in the Capitol to help lead the Democratic caucus's  collective efforts on issues related to energy and the environment. So  our loss on Team Merkley is the Senate's gain.   A big thank-you to Adrian for all of his hard work on behalf of the  people of Oregon and on behalf of a better world, a better energy  policy, a better environmental policy, a policy that points at taking  on the biggest challenge facing human civilization on this planet.   Thank you, Adrian, for all of your work to save our beautiful blue- green planet.                                Climate Change    Mr. President, the most important words in our Constitution are the  first three, ``We the people,'' written in supersized font so we won't  forget about the core mission of our Constitution--a nation that, in  President Lincoln's words, is designed to be ``of the people, by the  people, for the people.'' Well, in a ``we the people'' nation, it is  the responsibility of government and its leaders to put the interests  and well-being of its citizens first.   In July of 1932, while accepting his party's nomination for the  Presidency in the height of the Great Depression; after the stock  market had crashed, losing almost 90 percent of its value; after 11,000  American banks went bust; after nearly a quarter of the United States  was unemployed, Franklin Roosevelt called for ``a new deal for the  American people.'' He said that they were living in ``unprecedented and  unusual times'' in which we must ``highly resolve to resume the  country's uninterrupted march along the path of real progress, of real  justice, [and] of real equality.''   Well, in our ``we the people'' Nation, we are once again finding  ourselves in unprecedented and unusual times, and a big factor is the  ravages of climate chaos, carbon pollution and the chaos that ensues  from that wreaking havoc not only on the environment but on the lives  of Americans all across our Nation. We see it in the wildfires that are  burning longer and hotter than ever before, not just affecting our  forests and the jobs in our forests and our forest economies but at  times incinerating entire communities, such as Paradise, CA. Even when  such a dramatic event doesn't occur, there is significant damage to our  cities, their economies, and their people's health from the smoke.   We have seen over time that the average number of large wildfires has  grown. Back in the decade of the 1980s, there were about 140 per year.  Now here we are after the turn of the century looking at nearly twice  that--250 major wildfires per year on average. And the fire season has  gone from roughly 5 months in the early 1970s to 7 months. This is just  characterizing the impact of longer, hotter summers--one impact of  climate chaos.   We also see climate chaos in the oceans. They are growing hotter year  by year. They are growing more acidic year by year as carbon dioxide  becomes carbonic acid, actually changing the chemistry of the ocean. We  have found that the oceans are about 30 percent more acidic than they  were before the Industrial Revolution, affecting our coral reefs and  our shellfish.   A recent study found that the planet's oceans are heating up even  faster than we anticipated--40 percent faster than we thought just 5  years ago. Now, 2018 broke the record for the warmest ocean  temperatures. It beat out the previous record holder of 2017, and that  2017 record broke the previous record holder of 2016. Rising  temperatures don't just harm our sea life; they are impacting citizens  through impacts on the fishing industry, impacting the coastal  communities for which coastal activities are their lifeblood.   I was down on the gulf coast of Florida where they had a red tide  that has been in place for 10 of the last 12 months. A red tide  essentially is toxic algae that produces toxins that float inland and  irritate the lungs and aggravate the asthma of those living near the  seashore, and it kills sea life. In addition to the toxins from the red  tide, they have dead manatees, dolphins, fish, and turtles washing up  on the shores and decomposing, adding to the stench. People on the gulf  coast of Florida take inland vacations that at times extend to months  to escape the consequence of the red tide, and it causes a huge impact  on the economy of those coastal cities.   We see chaos in extreme weather events, massive storms like Harvey  and Irma and Maria, which in that year cost our country $265 billion in  damages, took the lives of thousands--thousands in just Puerto Rico-- and destroyed hundreds of thousands of homes in the gulf and the  Caribbean. We also see it in wild temperature swings in communities  like Chicago. Last summer, Chicago experienced recordbreaking heat and  then was hit with a recordbreaking polar vortex. This is climate chaos.   We the people, we the farmers, we the foresters, we the fishermen,  and, of course, we the frontline communities of America, minority and  low-income communities, whose health is being impacted, feel the  impact, a devastating impact, and bear the brunt of climate chaos.   So it is now another time for a new deal for the American people to  take on this massive, immediate threat to our people and our planet--a  threat we cannot delay responding to.   This time, it must be a Green New Deal--a Green New Deal that not  only transitions America to an energy economy that is powered by 100- percent noncarbon, clean, renewable energy, but a Green New Deal that  creates millions of good, living-wage jobs in the process and continues  our Nation's march along the path of real progress, real justice, and  real equality.   Let's think, for a moment, of what the core principles are when we  say the words ``Green New Deal.'' Here are some of the core issues.   The first is an energy shift that utilizes today's technology and  utilizes and improves our electric grid and our transportation system  from ones powered by fossil fuels to ones powered by renewable energy.  A key principle of the Green New Deal is that of an energy shift to  solar and offshore wind, wave energy, tidal energy, and geothermal  energy--all potentially contributing to the noncarbon electricity to  power our Nation.   Here is the good news. The cost of noncarbon, nonfossil fuel energy  has dropped. It has fallen about 90 percent over the last decade. It  has gone from 35 cents per kilowatt hour with solar energy to about 3  to 5 cents per kilowatt hour. That is a massive change. Wind has fallen  about 70 percent, and now it is down to 2 to 4 cents per kilowatt hour.  What does this mean? This means that a decade ago, the costs were above  the costs of burning fossil fuels. Now they are below or are even with  the costs of burning fossil fuels because it is about 10 cents per  kilowatt hour to create electrons from coal, and it is about 5 cents  from natural gas. When you have wind at 2 to 4 cents and solar at 3 to  5 cents, you are competitive, and that means we can choose not only the  energy that is best for the planet and best for our health but that is  also the smartest investment for our economy.   This is where we are now. We can pursue the smartest investment. If  you don't have any understanding of the impact of the climate chaos  that is devastating our resources and our cities and our people, you  can still choose green power, because it is the smartest economic  decision.   The second core principle of the Green New Deal is to create millions  of  [[Page S881]]  jobs. Our President likes to talk about jobs, and we need his help in  actually creating jobs by renovating our energy economy, by investing  in these technologies, and by advancing these technologies. It is so we  are selling them to the world rather than buying them from the world.  It is so they are employing people in the United States of America  rather than employing people in China. We want this revolution to be  here, driven by the United States of America--by red, white, and blue  ingenuity and innovation. It is not for us to be on the receiving end  of technologies that are developed elsewhere, and it is not for us to  be on the receiving end of products made elsewhere.   In creating these jobs, we need strong protections for American  workers. We want these jobs to be living-wage jobs. We want to see  workers able to organize and able to unionize so as to make sure these  are family-wage jobs, because a good-paying job is better than any  government program for a family's foundation to thrive.   Right now, renewable industries are booming. Jobs in solar and wind  are growing 12 times faster than is the rest of the economy. Over 3  million Americans now work in renewable energy and energy efficiency,  outnumbering fossil fuels 3 to 1. This is the future of jobs in the  United States of America. This is the future of good-paying jobs in the  United States of America. Just think of how many more jobs we can  create down the road if the United States is leading the world, not  following. Let's be the leaders in this green technology revolution.  Like Roosevelt's New Deal with the Works Progress Administration, which  created jobs that paved a path for the economy to recover, the Green  New Deal will drive tens of millions of good-paying jobs for Americans  in the decades ahead.   The third big principle is that no one gets left behind in this  revolution. It ensures that all Americans have the benefits of the new  green economy and that the hard-working Americans who are in the fossil  fuel industry and have provided the power that has taken our Nation so  far forward have the respect for what they have accomplished and have  the opportunity for jobs in the future. It is a just transition into  good-paying careers and for communities that have been stumbling in  their efforts toward economic progress but have been bypassed in the  economy of the past.   They will not be bypassed in the green economy of the future because  the point is to design that economy so that those communities can  benefit from the clean energy and can benefit from the jobs that the  Green New Deal creates. That includes there being access to clean  public transportation, community development investments, and the  ability of low-income families to not only receive clean energy but to  get the clean energy jobs and job training and apprenticeship programs  and healthcare and housing that everyone in America should have access  to.   Those are the three core principles of this vision. They are the  three core principles that will take us forward quickly and  productively and will put us in the economic lead of the world. It is a  lead we are losing as we stumble--trapped by fossil fuel special  interest money and its control of Congress. There are those who say  this vision is too bold, that this vision is too far-reaching, but let  us think of what Robert Kennedy once said: ``Only those who dare to  fail greatly can ever achieve greatly.''   For the sake of our planet and our Nation and our families and the  ``we the people'' vision of our government, let us dare, and let us  dare greatly.   I thank the Presiding Officer.
