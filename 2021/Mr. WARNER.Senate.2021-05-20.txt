 Madam President, I rise today in strong support of the  Endless Frontier Act--a long overdue, bipartisan effort to invest in  our country's innovation and competitiveness.   I am pleased to see that Congress is finally taking action to shore  up U.S. investment in the research, development, and manufacturing of  critical technologies because, without this kind of intervention, China  in particular will continue to outpace and outperform us in the global  technology race, impacting our country's economic well-being, our  global influence, and our national security.  [[Page S3188]]    Let me note, when I reference China, I think it is important that any  policymaker or business leader draw this distinction. I want to make  clear that my beef is with the Communist Party of China and the  policies of President Xi Jinping, which persecutes its own people in  terms of Uighurs, restricts the freedom of the people of Hong Kong, and  creates a surveillance state that would make George Orwell blush. My  beef is with those policies and that party, not with the Chinese people  and obviously not with the Chinese diaspora, particularly Chinese  Americans and Asian Americans.   In recent years, China has rapidly been executing on a plan. It has  been working, particularly, to ramp up its domestic industries around  technology that confer potentially to its long-term strategic dominance  in a whole host of industries that traditionally the United States or  the West has dominated.   One of the topics I am going to come back to in a moment is that of  semiconductors. China consistently increases its investment in the  semiconductor industry, with a commitment to invest $150 billion and a  goal to produce at least 70 percent of the semiconductors it consumes-- it is one of the world's fastest growing economies--by 2030.   Frankly, on this issue of semiconductors, it is not just China. Look  around at South Korea, which has pledged to invest over $130 billion  over the next 9 years, while training 36,000 new microelectronics  engineers and technicians. Even our allies in Europe--Germany and 18  other EU members--recently announced investments of up to $60 billion  in key hardware like semiconductors over the next few years.   We look back and see how we are doing in America. By contrast, over  the past 10 years, only 17 major semiconductor fabs, or foundries-- these are basically the manufacturing facilities--have been built in  the United States, while we have seen over 122 built elsewhere. As a  matter of fact, right now, there is not a single new fabrication  facility being constructed in America. The total number of facilities-- fabs, foundries--that are in production has gone from 81 down to 76,  which are some of our older fabrication facilities.   Frankly, the technology has leapt forward, and if you don't continue  to make the investment, you end up with a large, empty facility. We  even have one right outside of Richmond, in Henrico County.   As a country, our share of semiconductor and microelectronic  production has gone from 37 percent to just 12 percent today. If you  look at China, it is almost the exact inverse, going from single digits  to north of 30 percent.   The truth is, in the United States, the cost of a new fab is about 25  to 50 percent higher, partially because of the lower financial  incentives we provide and the appropriate environmental standards. It  does mean that, without incentives, we are not going to be in the game  right now, partially because of decisions made right at the beginning  of COVID and partially just because of a semiconductor shortage. We  have auto factories sitting idle in the United States, not because they  don't have workers, not because they don't have demand for those  automobiles, but because these plants can't obtain the semiconductors  that are integral to automobiles and, for that matter, every device we  operate.   At the same time, if we look back again at China, it has no plans to  take the foot off the pedal anytime soon. As a matter of fact, last  year, President Xi Jinping announced a $1.4 trillion commitment to  develop new technologies just through 2025--$1.4 trillion. We think  about the numbers we are talking about here today, which are big based  upon traditional American standards, but they pale in comparison to  what China is investing. You don't need to look very far; you only need  to look at the Chinese documents themselves--the Made in China 2025  plan and the China 2035 plan in terms of standards and procedures and  protocols.   Beyond semiconductors, 5G, and some of the things I have talked about  in the past, there is a host of other areas in which, if we don't  invest, we are not going to be able to stand.   Now, it is not all bleak. U.S. semiconductor firms in areas like  lithography, packaging, and metrology still lead the world. In  machining, we still lead. However, many of the key ingredients to our  success, including Federal support for R&D, investment in basic  research, and support for advanced manufacturing, have actually  declined over the last 20 years.   Simply put, we are just not keeping up. Between 1995 and 2018,  Chinese R&D investment increased by over 15 percent per year compared  to the U.S. increases averaging about 3-percent growth per year. Now,  we started with a higher base--I acknowledge that--but on relative and,  shortly, on actual real terms, China will soon pass. As a matter of  fact, after World War II, the United States funded 69 percent of the  annual global R&D. Today, we fund less than 28 percent, with only 7  percent going to nondefense technologies--again, like wireless, which  is something I know a little bit about and will speak to again in a  moment.   To get back to where we once were and reassert U.S. technology  leadership, we need to reprioritize foundational technologies to  maintain not just our country's economic leadership but to also make  sure that our values are built into these increasing technology areas.   The truth is, for so many years, not only did we invent many of these  breakthrough technologies here, but even if we didn't invent them in  the United States, we would then set the rules, the procedures, the  protocols, and the standards around these new technology developments.  We have seen that in semiconductors for a long time. We saw it in  computing. We saw it with the internet. We saw it in wireless. We saw  it in satellites.   Time and again now, we are suddenly seeing China flood the zone with  these standard-setting bodies, and when you set the standards, you also  reflect your values. So values that we bring to the table, like  transparency and respect for human rights, go out the window when China  sets the rules around 5G that basically allow traffic to always pass  through Beijing. Even if you are making a phone call between St. Louis  and San Francisco, why does that traffic have to be routed through  Beijing unless there is a malicious interest at stake? If you set the  rules, you drive not only the technology but so many other things.   As chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I have  long been banging the drum about the way the PRC has taken advantage of  what makes our country's economic system so great--our openness, our  transparency, our free markets.   The Chinese Government, unfortunately, plays by a different set of  rules. The Chinese Government starts with the willingness to use all  the tools of its intelligence services, sometimes its student  population, which has added so much value to our country, and enormous  thefts of intellectual property. Some public estimates are north of  $500 billion a year.   The Chinese Government, as well, is using all aspects of its society  to increase China's dominance, from the intellectual property theft  that I talked about to opaque subsidies in financing that always favor  a Chinese vendor.   And, unfortunately, for many of our trading partners, the deal that  is offered by the Chinese firm is often either too good or linked to  another development--``I am going to build you a road; I am going to  build you a port, but you have to buy at Huawei, as the price of  that,'' or because we in America or, for that matter, even in the West  have not kept up on a financing basis.   That is why in the Endless Frontier bill that we are debating right  now, a bill that will make substantial investments in the National  Science Foundation and the Department of Energy, our National Labs-- both great national assets--in this bill, as well, we are actually  doing more than authorizing new ideas and new advancements. We are  actually finally--finally--putting our money where our mouth is.   It is why included in the Endless Frontier bill is the Utilizing  Strategic Allied Telecommunications Act, which, at the end of the day,  is basically $2 billion to invest in making sure that in America we  have, and in the West we have, a competitor against Huawei.   I have come to this floor and talked a lot about the national  security threat Huawei presents in America and, for that matter, to our  allies.  [[Page S3189]]    But if you don't have a competitor priced on a fair basis, what do  you expect to do? What do you expect of an ally country to do? Or for  that matter, what do you expect of many of the rural telecos' decision,  which was to buy Huawei equipment, until this vulnerability got  exposed.   On this bill I was proud to work with two of my great partners on the  Intelligence Committee, Senator Richard Burr and Senator Marco Rubio.   What we do with this $2 billion is put up a public wireless supply  chain innovation fund to spur investments toward open architecture,  innovative, leap-ahead technologies in our domestic mobile market.   And what we are really talking about doing--and I know I have talked  to the Presiding Officer about this and others--is, in 5G, we are  almost so far behind at this point that we have to leapfrog ahead. But  one way we can leapfrog ahead is by developing what is called open RAN,  or open radio access network. What does that mean in English? Well, it  means let's move away from the traditional hardware-based stack of the  telephone wireless system and move to a more software-based system.   When we do that, we get away from the inherent advantages that the  Chinese and Huawei have, and we move to an area where there are a host  of American and other enterprises that are software-based, where we are  already far ahead.   Now, what we also have to do, as well, is combine this investment-- and we have close to $500 million on this--to also invest in a  multilateral fund.   The truth is, no single American company on its own can take on this  enormous challenge that the whole Chinese state, backing their Chinese  champion--there is no way we can take that on, on our own. So how do we  think, with our other democratic allies around the world, the G7, but  also countries like South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and India, Israel,  and others, that we can collaborate on this technology development?  Think about how we compete on an economic basis and at the same time  make sure that we install those values around transparency, respect for  human rights, the notion of open and competitive system, that those are  built into technology development.   The second item is crucially that this bill also addresses the  essential need for us to invest in semiconductors. We are finally  putting our money where our mouth is. This bill will appropriate on an  emergency basis $52 billion for investment in chips in our country and  along with our allies.   This basically builds upon legislation that we added to the Defense  authorization bill last year. It is bipartisan. Senator Cornyn, Senator  Schumer, Senator Cotton, Senator Kelly are all working together on this  with a host of others because the semiconductor industry, while we have  seen some sliding, still represents one of the shining lights of our  country's innovation economy.   And as a wider array of products and services depend on internet  connectivity and software processing, the demand for semiconductors has  only grown.   But as I outlined at the top unfortunately, that leadership position  we have had for so long is at stake. So the CHIPS Act, which is built  in now--baked into the Endless Frontier Act--directs and empowers key  Agencies, like the Department of Commerce, in consultation with others  like our intelligence community, to make investments in  microelectronics R&D a priority. It emphasizes the need for  multilateral efforts with our allies and close trading partners to  bring greater transparency and accountability to subsidies. It aligns  policies toward non-transparent, non-market competitors like the  Chinese, and it makes sure that we have concerted and coordinated  action, both domestically and, again, with our allies, on supply chain  security and integrity.    It invests billions in basic research related to advanced  semiconductors via DOD and a newly created National Semiconductor  Technology Center, and it makes an unprecedented investment in trying  to build new foundries, fabs, or basic manufacturing facilities, here  in the United States so that we have that supply security chain--a  secure supply chain for the future.   That $39 billion in that fund I believe will help us build 7 to 10  new fabs right here in the United States. And whether they are in the  Presiding Officer's State or Virginia or elsewhere, our States will  have to invest as well. Many of these facilities cost anywhere from $12  to $15 billion by the time you build them and keep them operating until  they have some level of profitability. So some level of American  national investment in each of these is needed to make sure that they-- at least some of these--will be built in the United States. And, again,  the $39 billion should generate 7 to 10 new fabs over the next 5 to 7  years.   And whether it is chips for automotive, aerospace, biomedical, or  cell phones--you name it--or the billions of ``internet of things''  devices, almost all rely upon semiconductors. Let's make sure those  chips are built, designed, and produced here, and that those elsewhere  in the world are often done in countries that are allies.   So the Endless Frontier Act, which includes both the investment in 5G  and ORAN and, obviously, the semiconductors, serves as a once-in-a- generation opportunity to solidify U.S. leadership in science and tech  innovation. It will strengthen our national security and reinvigorate  American ingenuity.   The truth is, colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I know we are  supportive of these efforts. I hope next week that we pass this bill  with a massive majority, and that then it will be quickly acted upon by  the House, because I know our domestic industries are watching us. I  know our adversaries are, as well, and it will be wonderful if we can  finally move beyond simply talking about the challenges that China  presents and actually make the kind of tangible investments that  American generations in the past have made.
