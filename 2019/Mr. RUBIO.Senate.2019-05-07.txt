 Madam President, today I recognize Paul Vincent  Cloud of Niceville, FL, who served his nation in the U.S. Army during  World War II and will turn 100 years old on June 8, 2019.   Paul enlisted with the U.S. Army on March 1, 1941, in Huntington, WV.  He was assigned as a supply clerk in Company D, 7th Infantry Regiment,  3rd Infantry Division, and trained at Fort Lewis, WA.   On October 24, 1942, Paul was deployed as part of Task Force 34 for  Operation Torch, landing at Fedala in French Morocco as part of the  Battle of Casablanca. After its surrender, Paul's unit was temporally  assigned in Rabat, French Morocco's capital city before moving to  Algiers, Algeria. As a part of the 3rd Infantry Division, he was sent  to reinforce the 1st Infantry Division at the Kasserine Pass, Tunisia.   In July 1943, Paul left Bizerte, Tunisia, and landed in Sicily near  Gela, moving to Palermo and Messina as his division was ordered to  Salerno and then Naples, Italy. In late spring 1944, Paul landed at  Anzio and advanced with his unit to Rome to seize control of the city  after the German retreat. He was later selected to return to the United  States due to his service points, leaving Naples on July 16, 1944. Paul  was honorably discharged at Fort Meade, MD, and received the Good  Conduct Medal, American Defense Service Medal, and European African  Middle Eastern Service Ribbon.   After he was discharged, Paul married Dorothy Anderson in 1947 and  graduated from Ben Franklin University in 1951. He worked for the  Veterans Administration and the Internal Revenue Service, retiring in  January 1976. Together they have two daughters and five grandchildren.   I extend my best wishes to Paul in celebration of his upcoming 100th  birthday and for his service to our Nation. I hope the coming year  brings him much happiness, joy, and good health.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I recognize Samuel Lombardo  of Fort Walton Beach, FL, who served his nation in the U.S. Army during  World War II and the Korean war.

Small businesses drive our Nation's economic  expansion, generate lasting job growth, and encourage community  development. It is important that we recognize the vital contributions  of small businesses. In celebration of National Small Business Week, it  is my honor name Rising Tide Car Wash of Parkland and Margate, FL, as  the Senate Small Business of the Week.   Founded in November 2012 by John D'Eri and his son, Tom, Rising Tide  is a full-service car wash with the mission of employing adults with  autism. Andrew D'Eri, John's other son, is autistic. As Andrew neared  the end of his academic career, John brainstormed ways to help him find  a dignified job. Noting his son's embrace of structure, process, and  attention to detail, John landed on the idea of buying a car wash.  Since purchasing the struggling car wash 9 years ago, John and Tom have  grown the business to include a second location, going from washing  35,000 cars per year to more than 150,000 annually.   Today, Rising Tide is one of the largest employers of individuals  with autism in the United States. In fact, Rising Tide views autism as  their competitive advantage, giving dignified work, structure, and hope  to 90 individuals with autism. Their work has not stopped there. Rising  Tide is also a leading advocate for autism awareness. In an effort to  aid other entrepreneurs looking to build an autism social enterprise,  Tom and John created Rising Tide U, an online course offered in  partnership with the University of Miami-Nova Southeastern University  Center for Autism and Related Disabilities. Tom and John's innovative  approach to advocacy has not only allowed for their business to grow,  but has also allowed more small firms to hire individuals with autism.   Rising Tide's mission has sparked national attention. Tom has  appeared before the United Nations on World Autism Awareness day, was  selected to serve on the Young Entrepreneur Council, and was included  in Forbes 30 Under 30 for social entrepreneurship. Additionally, Rising  Tide and the D'Eri family have been featured on The Hero Effect, The  Today Show, NBC News, TED Talks, Forbes, and People Magazine. Rising  Tide has also been named Small Business of the Year by South Florida  Business Connection and Employer of the Year by the Autism Society.   Rising Tide is more than just a successful business; they are an  inspiration. John and Tom have combined the principles of  entrepreneurship and social engagement to create a revolutionary  program. Running a successful small business is difficult enough; yet  John and Tom D'Eri have found a way to simultaneously engage and  encourage truly deserving individuals. Their employees have found a  community, friends, and gained valuable experience that will serve them  for the rest of their lives.   Starting out with a simple mission of helping a family member find an  engaging job, John and Tom have grown Rising Tide into a business that  provides both a valuable community service and dignified work. I am  honored to recognize the D'Eri family and the entire team at Rising  Tide Car Wash as the Senate Small Business of the Week. You make  Florida proud, and I look forward to watching your continued growth and  success.                            ____________________
