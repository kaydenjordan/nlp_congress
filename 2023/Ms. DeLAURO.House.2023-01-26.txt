 Mr. Chairman, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote  against the so-called Strategic Production Response Act, which would  significantly weaken our critical energy security.   This bill before us would result in more oil supply shortages, higher  gas prices for hardworking, middle-class families, and jeopardize our  energy security, just so those on the other side of the aisle can do  the bidding of their friends at Big Oil.   Big Oil has already received billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded  subsidies. They enjoyed record-shattering profits, and it is all at the  expense of hardworking families.   Today, families live paycheck to paycheck; that is the reality. There  is no thought for what this will do to the prices at the pump for  families.   Big Oil has more than 26 million acres under lease, and over 50  percent are nonproducing. It is not because they are not allowed to  drill. More than 9,500 permits to extract oil were approved in 2021  alone. While the administration has paused wasteful lease sales, the  permitting process for already leased lands continues.   The greed of Big Oil just never ends. It inflicts pain, and it  inflicts financial instability on working families. It is a daily  assault.   There is an old saying: ``Know where you stand, and stand there.''  Well, it is clear where some of my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle stand, and that is protecting Big Oil, which has a monopoly, and  they can do what they want in terms of raising prices or lowering  prices--and they never lower prices.   I will continue to stand with the American people. I urge my  colleagues to vote against H.R. 21.
