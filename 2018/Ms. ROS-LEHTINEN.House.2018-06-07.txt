 Mr. Speaker, yesterday I met with Victor Cuadras  and Zayda Hernandez, two young Nicaraguan student leaders who bravely  protest the abuses and violence of the Ortega regime.   Knowing that they could face trumped-up charges upon their return to  Nicaragua, Victor and Zayda feel a unique sense of responsibility to  come here to Washington to advocate for justice and liberty for their  homeland.   They represent the voice of the Nicaraguan people, old and new  generations, who desire nothing more than a free and democratic country  where one can be prosperous and live without fear of repression. What a  concept.   And we must listen to their pleas, Mr. Speaker.   Countless Nicaraguans are on the front lines, as you can see on this  poster, confronting the brutality of the Ortega regime day after day.   Over 120 Nicaraguans and one U.S. citizen have been killed at the  hands of this murderous regime in just the past weeks. Over 1,000  Nicaraguans have been injured, hundreds continue to disappear.   Mr. Speaker, I was on the floor yesterday, and here I am again for  the fourth time since the regime's crackdown on the Nicaraguan people  began on April 18, because I believe that it is vital--now, more than  ever--for the United States to support the people of Nicaragua in its  fight to reestablish democratic order. We must let the people know that  they are not alone.   Earlier this week, I was joined by Republicans and Democrats,  Representatives and Senators, in urging the administration to sanction  two of Ortega's many thugs: Francisco Lopez, head of ALBANISA, for  money laundering and corruption; and Francisco Diaz, who leads the  National Police, for orchestrating the repression and the killings of  Nicaraguans.   But there are so many others who must be sanctioned, including  Gustavo Porras, head of the National Assembly; Sonia Castro, Minister  of Health; Roberto Lopez, president of the Social Security Institute;  and Tirso Celedon, a real estate developer profiting from the Social  Security Institute.   Each of these individuals is part of Ortega's inner circle and is  responsible for those acts of corruption and human rights violations,  all of which have been widely reported.   I urge the administration to not delay any longer and to take swift  action to freeze assets, to cancel visas and to sanction to the full  extent of our laws those who are responsible for so much corruption and  so many murders in Nicaragua.   We have a moral responsibility to lead the way and help bring to  justice those responsible for the atrocities that they see happening in  that country. We need to send a clear message that the United States is  paying attention and that those terrible acts will not go unpunished.   Mr. Speaker, this Chamber has known for a while about how troublesome  the Ortega regime is, to say the least, and we have been able to lead  on this issue, and I thank my colleagues for that.   In October 2017, this House passed my NICA Act, which seeks to  leverage America's influence by conditioning our vote at any of the  international financial institutions until Nicaragua takes significant  steps to uphold the rule of law and strengthen democratic institutions.   Unfortunately, our colleagues in the Senate have been silent--silent.  I urge them to quit stalling and to take meaningful action by finally  passing the NICA Act so that we can keep the pressure on that awful  regime until democracy, freedom, and prosperity return to beautiful  Nicaragua and these young people will be free once again.                            ____________________
