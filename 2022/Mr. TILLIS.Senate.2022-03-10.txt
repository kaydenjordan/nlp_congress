 Mr. President, speaking on behalf of Leader McConnell and  with all due respect to my friend from Michigan, this is a COVID- related provision which the Biden administration never requested. It is  not in the President's budget. It is not even in the supplemental  budget. The administration asked for everything under the Sun, but they  never asked for this.   This is another example of my colleagues trying to take an emergency  pandemic, the exemptions, and turn  [[Page S1104]]  them into permanent changes that last forever. Families don't want  schools to be permanently stuck in a pandemic posture. Families want  schools to move past COVID and get back to normal. Yet this amendment  would continue policies that were explicitly designed to help schools  close and go virtual. That is exactly what families don't want. Parents  and kids want schools open.   Finally, this amendment costs $11 billion, and it is not offset. For  the people watching this tonight, that means it is not paid for. It is  $11 billion more that we can't afford.   We had a fully-paid-for COVID package ready to go until the House  Democrats blew it up. We will not be going around the backs of our own  Senate committees of jurisdiction because House Democrats killed a  bipartisan COVID package.   So I respectfully object.
