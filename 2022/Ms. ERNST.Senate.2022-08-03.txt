 Mr. President, today, I come to the floor to urge  President Biden to turn his attention to his disastrous withdrawal from  Afghanistan 1 year ago. I want to direct the Commander in Chief to  reflect on a series of commitments he made to the American people  before and during his reckless exit.   On August 19, 2021, President Biden promised U.S. troops would remain  on the ground until every American who wanted to leave Afghanistan was  evacuated.   On August 26, 2021, President Biden promised to hunt down and avenge  the deaths of 13 servicemembers killed in action by ISIS-K in Kabul.   In a speech to the United Nations on September 21, 2021, the  President promised his administration would hold the Taliban  accountable to protect the rights of Afghan women.   The Commander in Chief failed to uphold his word on all three fronts,  and American security and prosperity have suffered as a result of his  broken promises.   Today in Afghanistan, Americans who want to come home remain left  behind, and the administration's lack of transparency concerning both  the number and desire of Americans trapped in Taliban-controlled  Afghanistan is alarming.   The President and members of his Cabinet repeatedly claimed that the  number of Americans who wanted out of Afghanistan was roughly 100. That  number was spouted from September 2021 through the beginning of this  year--the same number over and over again--even though we would hear  reports on the television that 40 more Americans were out, 200  Americans were out, and yet the number remained the same. How many  Americans remain in Afghanistan? The number they kept using was 100.   There is no way around it: President Biden broke his promise to the  Americans who remain and their families anxiously awaiting their  return.   Americans have lived and traveled abroad with assurances that the  United States would come to their aid in the event of a conflict. No  matter how far away, the United States is expected to have the backs of  its citizens. Our withdrawal from Afghanistan was a cut-and-run  approach that greatly damaged that guarantee.   If the world's greatest superpower cannot locate and extract its own  citizens from the clutches of seventh-century thugs, then far greater  tests of our sovereignty, security, and prosperity will only loom  larger.   As we approach the anniversary of the haphazard withdrawal, there is  an open wound hurting our ability to deter the actions of our  adversaries.   President Biden promised vengeance on the terrorists who killed 13  Americans--including 1 from my hometown of Red Oak, IA--at Hamid Karzai  International Airport.   He told the American people:         The United States will never rest. We will not forgive. We       will not forget. We will hunt you down to the ends of the       Earth, and we will--you will pay the ultimate price.    Again, the Commander in Chief's rhetoric does not match his actions.  The U.S. military has not targeted or conducted any counterterrorism  strikes against ISIS-K in Afghanistan since America's withdrawal on  August 31, 2021. Those who planned the cowardly act remain at large.   It is not like ISIS-K is holed up in the Hindu Kush mountains, away  from population centers. At least 26 terrorist attacks, many of which  ISIS-K has claimed responsibility for, have struck the Afghan people in  metropolitan Kabul since our withdrawal. Our enemies are not hiding,  but far too often, America is.   We are also stuck with a largely unrealized over-the-horizon  counterterrorism strategy that has not deterred the resurgence of  terrorists or avenged our lost warriors.   Our military and covert operators' recent strike was welcome and long  overdue, but the strike demonstrates a capability rarely employed and a  posture toward terrorism far too inexact.   It was President Biden, after all, who said last August that al-Qaida  was gone from Afghanistan. Folks, that is clearly not the case.  Ensuring that al-Qaida leader al-Zawahiri will never harm an American  again was a necessary action, but the strike has raised serious  questions about the security situation we have in Afghanistan. The  President's so-called and much-promised over-the-horizon  counterterrorism strategy has not been a deterrent, like it was  promised to be. Instead, we are seeing a growing threat emanating from  Afghanistan.   This is the first U.S. military strike in Afghanistan since America  left on August 31 of last year. In the meantime, ISIS-K fighters are  flowing into the country at alarming rates while al-Qaida and the  Taliban have clearly been working together for the past year. At the  very least, the Taliban and Haqqani Network gave al-Zawahiri and his  thugs safe haven, demonstrating ongoing Taliban collusion with  terrorists. A lone strike does not demonstrate a developed capacity to  prevent further coordination that threatens American security.   Not only has the U.S. capacity to protect the homeland been greatly  damaged, the President's intent to champion human rights as a  centerpiece of this administration's foreign policy is also in  shambles.   Last fall, the President repeatedly claimed Afghan women were a  linchpin of his foreign policy priorities in the region. Yet, today,  after 20 years of constitutional democracy and advancement of civil  rights, the Taliban has unraveled significant hard-won gains for the  women of Afghanistan. The Taliban enforce a fundamentalist  interpretation of Islam, prohibit women from working, from attending  secondary school, and from traveling any distance without being  accompanied by a male member of their family. Most recently, the  Taliban has required all women to cover themselves from head to toe in  the burqa. Yet it is reported that the President's team continues to  bargain with the Taliban concerning diplomatic recognition, potential  coordination with the U.S. intelligence community, and access to $3.5  billion in held currency to the Taliban, despite these actions.   Extending official diplomatic engagement and facilitating access to  funding without guaranteed and meaningful liberties for women and girls  will legitimize the Taliban rule and further  [[Page S3878]]  subject women to a brutal regime. Any further effort to surrender  leverage to the Taliban is a candid reflection of the Biden  administration's failure to remedy its own hypocrisy regarding human  rights.   The administration's abandonment of Americans, inability to serve  justice for our soldiers killed in action, impassive counterterrorism  operations, and ignorance of the human rights disaster they  precipitated in Afghanistan have substituted sound strategy for an ad  hoc response of willful negligence.   And they know it.   The Department of State and Department of Defense under President  Biden have refused to cooperate with the Special Inspector General for  Afghanistan Reconstruction.   The President's neglect is most profoundly demonstrated through his  administration's lack of controls on billions of dollars of taxpayer  and frozen funds marked for humanitarian aid that have found their way  into the Taliban's coffers.   Since the Taliban and Haqqani Network--the two groups that are ruling  Afghanistan--are Specially Designated Global Terrorists, existing law  compels the administration to disclose the risk of taxpayer money  slipping into the hands of these two terror groups.   The licenses issued by the Treasury Department over the last year  extend far beyond acute humanitarian aid for food and medicine. They  expand the authorization of funding for activities from endangered  species research to direct payments to support governing institutions  controlled by the Taliban and the Haqqani Network.   I led 15 other Senators in asking the Biden administration to detail  the total financial support provided to Afghanistan and an honest  assessment of the taxes, the fees, and the import duties syphoned off  by the Taliban. More than 6 months later, we are still waiting for a  comprehensive answer.   This is completely unacceptable in light of recent reporting that  Taliban authorities are interfering with the delivery of humanitarian  aid, despite a pledge to the United Nations last fall that they would  not. The people of Afghanistan continue to suffer from food insecurity  while the Taliban are enjoying the spoils of America's generosity.   Numerous requests for a detailed accounting have gone unanswered by  the Treasury and State Departments.   Leaving Americans behind, failing to avenge the death of 13  servicemembers, and abdicating your promises to Afghan women and girls  do not deter threats from our shores.   In testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee on October 26,  2021, the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy stated that ISIS-K and  al-Qaida have the intent to conduct operations against the United  States, and that ISIS-K could generate that capability in 6 to 12  months and al-Qaida within 1 to 2 years.   Eight months have come and passed, and we have yet to learn how Team  Biden will protect our citizens from this threat at home or abroad. In  the absence of such a framework, threats to our national security grow  every day, risking the lives of Americans at home and abroad.   Folks, we are rapidly approaching that 1-year mark--the haphazard  withdrawal from Afghanistan--and we cannot forget.   I yield the floor.
