 Mr. Speaker, when we came back from  break, starting 2017, I wanted to share some thoughts on how we can all  improve ourselves and our country here in 2017, but last week there was  such a flurry of activity, I didn't have the opportunity to do so.   I came across an editorial in the Reading Eagle, a newspaper with  circulation in my district. Harry Deitz, the editor of the Reading  Eagle, had an editorial entitled, ``17 Simple Ways to Improve the World  in 2017.'' I thought it was so absolutely excellent that I would like  to share it with the American public verbatim:   ``Imagine how much better the world could be if all of us resolved to  make the world a better place. Imagine how much better it could be if  just one of us did that.   ``It really isn't difficult. We just need to make up our minds to do  positive little things that will add up to positive big things. Often,  they are things that don't take much time or energy. They may not cost  anything. But the rewards--the paybacks--are immeasurable.   ``So, in the spirit of a new year, here are 17 simple things we can  do in 2017 to improve the world around us.   ``1. There's an old caution sign at railroad crossings: Stop, look  and listen. It also should apply to communication and understanding.  Think how much better things would be if we stopped or at least slowed  down, looked a person in the eye and really listened to what he or she  has to say. That certainly would derail some of the anger and  misunderstandings in the world.   ``2. Say something positive to someone every day. You may never know  how much a kind word or a compliment will mean to the person, but you  will feel better after you've done it.   ``3. Make a donation to charity. Money helps, but donations also come  in the form of your time.   ``4. Don't make judgments. There are people in the world who judge us  before they know us. They judge us before they know all the facts. They  disapprove when we have different opinions. Sometimes there isn't right  or wrong--there is just different. Don't just talk tolerance--practice  it.   ``5. Say hello to a stranger. How much effort does it take? What is  the real risk? Many of our best relationships began with a simple  `hello.'   ``6. Give something anonymously to someone in need. Don't look for  recognition or appreciation. Focus on what you can do for `he' or  `she,' instead of asking, `what's in it for me?'   ``7. Have a conversation with a child. Not a lesson or a lecture. You  may be surprised at how much you can learn and how much you can teach  when you talk and listen.   ``8. Make a call to someone you haven't spoken with in years. Better  yet, visit that person.   ``9. Don't wish away a single day. How often have we been anxious for  a day to be over? We only have so many days, and we don't know how  many. So even when things are going really badly, don't give up on that  day. Think positive, and make every day special. And consider tomorrow  a new opportunity to do what we weren't able to do today.   ``10. Say you are sorry. It's never too late, and it's not as painful  as it may seem.   ``11. Forgiveness isn't only one of the best things you can do for  others. It also is one of the greatest gifts you can give to yourself.  It removes burdens. It helps you see clearly. It repairs what is  broken. Time may reduce our pain but doesn't always remove it.  Forgiveness will.   ``12. Take a quiet walk. Look at the world around you. How can you  help but marvel at God's creation when you push away all of the  distractions in your life?   ``13. Happiness isn't something we are given. It's something we  choose. So choose happiness.   ``14. Cherish your memories more than your possessions. They not only  are more important, but they will last much longer.  [[Page H240]]    ``15. Smile. I can't think of an expression that can have a more  positive impact on someone else--and on yourself. It's difficult to be  angry or cranky when you're smiling.   ``16. Pray for peace. If you believe in prayer, you already  understand its power. If you don't, what do you have to lose?   ``17. Tell people you love them. It's something you can't do too  often. It's something they will never tire of hearing.''   Words well spoken, Harry Dietz.                             Maternal Health Care     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.  315, the Improving Access to Maternity Care Act.    As we look to strengthen health care, one area where we must continue  to show leadership is in the delivery of quality and timely maternal  and prenatal care. Certain areas of the country, though, suffer from a  shortage of professionals to provide this essential care.   For over 40 years, the National Health Service Corps has helped to  place primary, dental, and mental health providers in underserved  areas. This bill would use data collected from the National Health  Service Corps to designate and place maternal healthcare providers in  those areas of the country where they are most needed. This will help  to solve the shortage of maternal healthcare professionals and ensure  new and expecting mothers have access to the care they need.   Mr. Speaker, the statistics don't lie: mothers without access to  prenatal care are more likely to experience serious but avoidable  complications during birth, which makes passage of H.R. 315, the  Improving Access to Maternity Care Act, which I am proud to support,  such an important bill.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  H.R. 321, the INSPIRE Women Act, and commend the leadership of  Congresswoman Comstock and Congresswoman Esty on this bill, which I am  pleased to also cosponsor.   We should be doing all we can to encourage young women who wish to  study or follow a STEM career path, and Congresswoman Comstock has  introduced this commonsense bill to achieve that goal.   H.R. 321 would require NASA to support astronauts, scientists, and  engineers who have retired in their efforts to encourage young women  who are interested in studying or working in a STEM field.   Mr. Speaker, innovative thinkers are critical to our country's  success in the modern global workforce. But we have heard the  statistics. Women make up half of the U.S. workforce and half of the  college educated workforce. Yet, only 25 percent of women who attain  degrees in the STEM field actually end up working in STEM jobs.   That is why I support this bill and that is why I think the aims of  this bill are very laudable and could go a long way toward closing that  gap. It is an important effort to improve retention of women studying  and working in STEM fields.   I thank again Congresswomen Comstock and Esty for their leadership.
