 Mr. President, yesterday I introduced the Protecting  Young Victims from Sexual Abuse Act, a bill to protect young athletes  who participate in the U.S. amateur ranks from sexual abuse.   Before last summer's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, the  Indianapolis Star published an investigative piece that revealed that  amateur gymnasts were sexually abused in gyms all across the country.  No one knew how widespread the problem was in that sport.   But throughout the investigation, the Indianapolis Star tallied-- after reviewing police files and court cases across the country--368  gymnasts who alleged they were sexually abused over a 20-year time  period.   Kids as young as 6 were secretly photographed in the nude by coaches.  Young athletes were molested by coaches during ``therapy'' sessions.  Sexual predators spent countless hours with children one-on-one and  abused them for years before anything was done. These accounts were  devastating. And they were just the tip of the iceberg.   After reviewing this report, I, along with my colleagues Senator  Leahy, Senator Blumenthal, and Senator Donnelly, wrote to USA  Gymnastics to urge the organization to do more to protect their young  athletes.   Specifically, we urged the organization to update its policies and  require that all members--including coaches, athletes, and others-- immediately report to law enforcement when there is an incident of  sexual abuse committed against an athlete.   After we sent the letter, several sexual abuse victims from  California reached out to my staff. They revealed that they were abused  by individuals affiliated with USA Gymnastics. I told my staff that I  had to meet them.   Six brave women, who were each abused as young gymnasts at various  points in their careers, then travelled across the country to share  their testimonies with me. Two athletes from another sport who were  sexually abused also joined us. I will never forget their faces that  day. When I walked into the room, I could sense the overwhelming  devastation wrought on their lives.   One by one, they shared their hopes and dreams as young athletes. The  gymnasts talked about how, while pursuing future Olympic glory, they  put their complete faith in the USA Gymnastics infrastructure. They  fully trusted the coaches and doctors who had the USA Gymnastics seal  of approval. And it was in this environment that they were sexually  exploited by those whom they trusted.   Several of the women had been abused repeatedly--over the course of  months and years--by a USA Gymnastics team doctor named Larry Nassar.  Nassar is currently being prosecuted for a number of horrific crimes  against children. One of those brave women was Jamie Dantzscher, a  retired gymnast who won the bronze medal competing in the 2000 Olympics  in Sydney. Jamie told me how she trained as a young girl in California.  When she was 13 years old, she was thrilled to be invited to train with  the national USA Gymnastics team. It was with the national team that  Nassar gained her trust. Nassar became her ``buddy,'' in the midst of  an intense training environment. With USA Gymnastics backing him as a  famous doctor and trainer, Jamie felt that there was absolutely no  reason to believe Nassar was not trustworthy.   So when Jamie went to see Nassar for back pain, she was confused when  Nassar began to touch her in inappropriate places. She was 13 and 14  years old. As she described the abuse to me in graphic detail, the  other women around the room began to sob quietly. The tactics that  Nassar used were too familiar to them.   And for the longest time, each of the victims believed that their  horrific experiences were one-off events, that they were isolated in  their own subjective memories. But the sharing of their stories-- together in that room with me and the others--affirmed to them that  what they had experienced was wrong.   One of the other gymnasts who bravely shared her story with me was  Jeanette Antolin, who competed on the national team in the late  nineties. Hailing from southern California, Jeanette shared how she was  incredibly fearful of ever saying anything about the abuse committed  against her because she believed she was being treated by a world-class  doctor with USA Gymnastics' approval. As an aspiring Olympian, she  feared that if she complained about anything, it would affect her  career.   The same fears had overcome Jessica Howard, a rhythmic gymnast who  was 15 years old when Nassar began abusing her. She was sent to Nassar  for hip problems, and he told her that she should not wear any  underwear for her treatment. At the time, she was confused and afraid  to say anything to anyone. She believed she would be prevented from  pursuing her dreams if she said anything.   I also met Doe Yamashiro from southern California. Doe was sexually  abused by a 1984 Olympic Coach named Don Peters. In the mid-1980s,  Coach Peters began fondling Doe and then had sex with her. Doe told me  and the group of the pain and anguish she still suffers from many years  later. The same pain and devastation was felt by all of the young  victims who were in the room.   One of the common themes I heard from their stories was not just the  predatory behavior of the perpetrators, but also how the USA Gymnastics  institution failed to protect them. One of the women told me how she  heard USA Gymnastics officials say at one point that it was their top  priority to obtain ``medals and money'' and that a ``reputation of a  coach'' should not be tarnished by an allegation raised by a victim.   This shocked me, and as I dug deeper into the USA Gymnastics  institution, which is considered a ``national governing body'' under  Federal law and oversees over 3,000 gymnasiums nationwide, I saw that  their policies made it harder for victims, rather than easier, to  report incidents of abuse. Their bylaws stated, for example, that the  only way for a member athlete to ``effectively'' make a complaint about  a coach was through a signed, written complaint.   Furthermore, USA Gymnastics' policy indicated that the organization  ``may'' report sexual abuse to law enforcement authorities if a child's  safety was at risk, but it was not mandatory. It further stated that it  complied with State mandatory reporting laws, but if a State law didn't  require anything more, there was no other obligation to do anything  else.   It is my strong belief that these arcane policies left children  vulnerable to the advances of sexual predators and failed to protect  them even when incidents came to light. For example, in reviewing USA  Gymnastics' history in public accounts, there were multiple instances  where gymnastics coaches were convicted of heinous child sex crimes,  years after USA Gymnastics had received complaints about those coaches.  In other words, USA Gymnastics appears to have sat on reports of sexual  abuse for years, while predators continued to prey on children.   At the end of my meeting with the survivors, I looked at each of them  and told them that I would work on legislation to protect other kids  and amateur athletes like them from sexual predators.   The legislation we have introduced does three main things to help  child sex abuse survivors. It is a strong bipartisan bill, and I want  to extend my deepest thanks to those Members who have worked with me on  it, including Senators Collins, Grassley, Donnelly, Nelson, Blumenthal,  Flake, McCaskill, Ernst, Klobuchar, Shaheen, Warren, Harris, Cortez- Masto, Rubio, and Young.   The first thing the bill does is to mandate that any person  affiliated with USA Gymnastics or other national governing bodies  immediately report child abuse, including sexual abuse, to local or  Federal law enforcement. This requirement would apply not only to USA  Gymnastics, but to each of the other 47 national governing bodies that  oversee various Olympic sports, including USA Taekwondo, USA Speed  Skating, USA Swimming, and USA Cycling. It is absolutely imperative  that a bright line be drawn for all those working with national  governing bodies that, once there are facts giving rise to suspect  child or sex abuse, a report must be made as soon as possible to proper  authorities. This bill mandates that.  [[Page S1635]]    Second, this bill strengthens Masha's law, which was named after a 5- year-old Russian orphan who was adopted by an American man only to be  raped and sexually abused by him for 6 years until he was finally  caught by the FBI in 2003. Her adoptive father had not only abused her,  but he had also produced over 200 sexually explicit images of that  abuse. Masha's law allows civil suits by minors against sex abuse  perpetrators who violate a variety of crimes against children,  including sex trafficking, sexual exploitation, and child pornography  crimes.   This law is significant for victims to obtain justice because there  are times when criminal cases against perpetrators are declined due to  difficulties in proving a criminal case. Therefore, for many  traumatized victims, the only avenue for them to ever seek justice  against their perpetrators is through Masha's law or other civil  remedies.   The bill, therefore, updates Masha's law to help victims. It  clarifies, for example, that victims of child sex crimes are entitled  to statutory damages of $150,000 and possible punitive damages, due to  the particularly severe nature of the crimes.   The bill also extends the statute of limitations for Masha's law. The  statute of limitations extension is part of legislation that Senator  Cornyn and I have worked on over the past couple of years, called the  Extending Justice for Sex Crime Victims Act.   Finally, the bill makes reforms to the Ted Stevens Olympic and  Amateur Sports Act, which establishes ``national governing bodies''  like USA Gymnastics. The Stevens Act specifically lists the authorities  and duties of national governing bodies.   When I first wrote to USA Gymnastics about its poor handling of  sexual abuse allegations, they replied that the Stevens Act limits  their abilities to fully protect athletes from sexual abuse, so this  bill fixes that. It requires national governing bodies like USA  Gymnastics to develop for each of its members: specific policies and  procedures for the mandatory reporting of sex abuse to law enforcement,  policies and procedures to keep track of coaches who leave one gym due  to complaints and then go to another gym and repeat cycles of abuse,  policies to ensure that minors and amateur athletes are not in one-on- one situations with adults, policies to facilitate reporting of sex  abuse allegations to national governing bodies and other authorities,  and stronger oversight and enforcement policies so that the national  governing bodies take a greater role in making sure that the policies  are actually being implemented and enforced throughout the country.   These provisions give national governing bodies like USA Gymnastics  absolutely no excuse to make sure that all members are subjected to the  strongest training and procedures to prevent sexual abuse.   It further forces organizations like USA Gymnastics to impact the  culture of their sports, through various oversight mechanisms, to make  sure that all members of such organizations adhere to the strictest  standards when it comes to sexual abuse prevention.   Finally, I would like to close with this. All over the country,  victims of sexual abuse are coming forward to disclose how they were  abused and exploited at the height of their innocence when they were  children. Multiple victims from California and throughout the country  have, for example, contacted my office and described with great courage  their pain and anguish. Rather than list statistics, I want you to know  that each of these individual stories represents an untold amount of  pain and suffering that reverberates throughout generations, leaving  devastation in its path. I urge my colleagues in this body to work with  me and the sponsors of this bill to pass this important legislation to  protect victims.   I would also like to acknowledge the support for this bill from the  National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, National Children's  Alliance, Rights4Girls, University of Utah Law Professor Paul Cassell,  Child Sex Crime Victims' Lawyer James Marsh, Crime Victims Expert Steve  Twist, National Crime Victims Center, Child USA, National Association  of VOCA Administrators, National Organization for Victim Assistance,  ToPrevail, ChampionWomen, National Children's Advocacy Center, National  Alliance to End Sexual Violence, the National Association to Protect  Children, and the Rape Abuse & Incest National Network.   They are on the front lines of this work, and I greatly appreciate  their support.   Thank you very much.    Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a bill for  the private relief of Shirley Constantino Tan. Ms. Tan is a Filipina  national living in Pacifica, CA. She is the proud  [[Page S1643]]  mother of 20-year-old U.S. citizen twin boys, Joriene and Jashley, and  the spouse of Jay Mercado, a naturalized U.S. citizen.   I believe Ms. Tan merits Congress's special consideration for this  extraordinary form of relief because her removal from the United States  would cause undue hardship for her and her family. She faces  deportation to the Philippines, which would separate her from her  family and jeopardize her safety.   Ms. Tan experienced horrific violence in the Philippines before she  left to come to the United States. When she was only 14 years old, her  cousin murdered her mother and her sister and shot Shirley in the head.  While the cousin who committed the murders was eventually prosecuted,  he received a short jail sentence. Fearing for her safety, Ms. Tan fled  the Philippines just before her cousin was due to be released from  jail. She entered the United States legally on a visitor's visa in  1989.   Ms. Tan's current deportation order is the result of negligent  counsel. She applied for asylum in 1995. While her case appeal was  pending at the Board of Immigration Appeals, her attorney failed to  submit a brief to support her case. As a result, the case was  dismissed, and the Board of Immigration Appeals granted Shirley  voluntary departure from the United States.   Ms. Tan never received notice that the Board of Immigration Appeals  granted her voluntary departure. Her attorney moved offices, did not  receive the order, and ultimately never informed her of the order. As a  result, Ms. Tan did not depart the United States and the grant of  voluntary departure automatically led to a removal order. She learned  about the deportation order for the first time on January 28, 2009,  when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents took her into  immigration custody.   Because of her attorney's negligent actions, Ms. Tan was denied the  opportunity to present her case in immigration proceedings. She later  filed a complaint with the State Bar of California against her former  attorney. She is not the first person to file such a complaint against  this attorney.   On February 4, 2015, Ms. Tan's spouse, Jay, a U.S. citizen, filed an  approved spousal petition on her behalf. On August 20, 2015, U.S.  Citizenship and Immigration Services denied her application due to the  fact that she still had a final order of removal. Ms. Tan must go back  to the immigration court and ask for the court to terminate her case  and then reapply for her green card. Ms. Tan is now again facing the  threat of deportation while she seeks to close her case before an  immigration court.   In addition to the hardship that Ms. Tan would endure if she is  deported, her deportation would cause serious hardship to her two U.S.  citizen children, Joriene and Jashley.   Joriene is a junior at Stanford University and is premed, majoring in  human biology. In addition to his studies, Joriene is involved in  Stanford's Pilipino-American Student Union.   Jashley is a junior at Chapman University, majoring in business  administration. Ms. Tan no longer runs her in-home daycare and is a  homemaker.   If Ms. Tan were forced to leave the United States, her family has  expressed that they would go with her to the Philippines or try to find  a third country where the entire family could relocate. This would mean  that Joriene and Jashley would have to leave behind their education and  the only home they know in the United States.   I do not believe it is in our Nation's best interest to force this  family, with two U.S. citizen children, to make the choice between  being separated and relocating to a country where they may face safety  concerns or other serious hardships.   Ms. Tan and her family are involved in their community in Pacifica  and own their own home. The family attends Good Shepherd Catholic  Church, volunteering at the church and the Mother Teresa of Calcutta's  Daughters of Charity. Ms. Tan has the support of dozens of members of  her community who have shared with me the family's spirit of commitment  to their community.   Enactment of the legislation I am introducing on behalf of Ms. Tan  today will enable this entire family to continue their lives in  California and make positive contributions to their community.   Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support this private bill.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:   S. 556. A bill for the relief of Joseph Gabra and Sharon Kamel; to  the Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. President, today I am reintroducing private  relief legislation on behalf of Joseph Gabra and Sharon Kamel, a couple  living with their four U.S. citizen children in Camarillo, CA.   Joseph and Sharon are nationals of Egypt who fled their home country  over 19 years ago after being targeted for their religious membership  in the Christian Coptic Church in Egypt. They became involved with this  church during the 1990s, Joseph as an accountant and project  coordinator helping to build community facilities and Sharon as the  church's training director in human resources.   Unfortunately, Joseph and Sharon were also subjected to threats and  abuse. Joseph was jailed repeatedly because of his involvement with the  church. Sharon's family members were violently targeted, including her  cousin who was murdered and her brother whose business was firebombed.  When Sharon became pregnant with her first child, she was threatened by  a member of a different religious organization for raising her child in  a non-Muslim faith.   Joseph and Sharon came to the United States legally on visitor visas  in November 1998. Due to their fears of persecution in Egypt based on  their religious beliefs, they filed for asylum in the United States in  May 1999.   However, Joseph, who has a speech impediment, had difficulty  communicating why he was afraid to return to Egypt, and 1 year later  their asylum application was denied. Considering that Sharon's brother,  who also applied for asylum for similar reasons, was granted asylum in  the United States, Joseph and Sharon appealed the denial of their  asylum applications, to no avail.   While Sharon's brother, who is now a U.S. citizen, has filed a  family-based immigrant petition on Sharon's behalf, it will be at least  4 years until she will even be eligible for a visa number due to visa  backlogs.   If Sharon and Joseph are deported before then, they will not only be  separated from their family but will be forced to return to a country  where persecution of Coptic Christians continues.   Due to their fear of returning to Egypt, Joseph and Sharon have  therefore tried to build a life for themselves here in the United  States, working hard while building their beautiful family. With the  protection of past private bills I filed on their behalf, Joseph was  able to get his certified public accountant license and opened his own  accounting firm, where Sharon works by his side.   Joseph and Sharon make sure that their four U.S. citizen children-- Jessica, age 18, Rebecca, age 17, Rafael, age 16, and Veronica, age  11--all attend school in California and maintain good grades.   Joseph and Sharon carry strong support from friends, members of their  local church, and other Californians who attest to their good character  and community contributions.   I am concerned that the entire family would face serious and  unwarranted hardships if Joseph and Sharon were forced to return to  Egypt. For Jessica, Rebecca, Rafael, and Veronica, the only home they  know is in the United States. Separation of this family would be  devastating and the alternative--relocating the family to Egypt--could  be dire, as it is quite possible that these four American children  would face discrimination or worse on account of their religion, as was  the experience of many of their family members.   Joseph and Sharon have made a compelling plea to remain in the United  States. These parents emphasize their commitment to supporting their  children and creating a healthy and productive place for them to grow  up in California. I believe this family deserves that opportunity.   I respectfully ask my colleagues to support this private relief bill  on behalf of Joseph Gabra and Sharon Kamel.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:   S. 557. A bill for the relief of Jose Alberto Martinez Moreno,  Micaela  [[Page S1644]]  Lopez Martinez, and Adilene Martinez; to the Committee on the  Judiciary.    Mr. President, today I am reintroducing private  immigration relief legislation to provide lawful permanent resident  status to Jose Alberto Martinez Moreno, Micaela Lopez Martinez, and  their daughter, Adilene Martinez. This family is originally from Mexico  but has been living in California for over 20 years. I believe they  merit Congress's special consideration for this extraordinary form of  relief.   When Jose came to the United States from Mexico, he began working as  a busboy in restaurants in San Francisco, CA. In 1990, he started  working as a cook at Palio D'Asti, an award-winning Italian restaurant  in San Francisco.   Jose worked his way through the ranks, eventuall becoming Palio's  sous chef. His colleagues describe him as a reliable and cool-headed  coworker and as ``an exemplary employee'' who not only is ``good at his  job but is also a great boss to his subordinates.''   He and his wife Micaela call San Francisco home. Micaela is a  homemaker and part-time housekeeper. They have three daughters, two of  whom are U.S. citizens. Their oldest daughter, Adilene, age 28, is  undocumented. She currently works fulltime at a cinema and hopes to  continue pursuing her studies in the future.   The Martinez's second daughter, Jazmin, age 24, is a U.S. citizen.  She graduated from Leadership High School and is now studying at  California State University, San Francisco. Jazmin has been diagnosed  with asthma, which requires constant treatment. According to her  doctor, if Jazmin were to return to Mexico with her family, the high  altitude and air pollution in Mexico City could be fatal to her. The  Martinez's other U.S. citizen daughter, Karla, is 19 years old and  attends San Francisco City College.   The Martinez family attempted to legalize their status through  several channels.   In 2001, Jose's sister, who has legal status, petitioned for Jose to  get a green card. However, the current green card backlog for siblings  from Mexico is very long, and it will be many years before Jose will be  eligible to legalize his status though his sister.   In 2002, the Martinez family applied for political asylum. Their  application was denied. An immigration judge denied their subsequent  application for cancellation of removal.   Finally, Daniel Scherotter, the executive chef and owner of Palio  D'Asti, petitioned for an employment-based green card for Jose based  upon his unique skills as a chef. Jose's petition was approved by U.S.  Citizenship and Immigration Services. However, before he will be  eligible for a green card, he must apply for a hardship waiver, which  cannot be guaranteed.   The Martinez family has become an integral part of their community in  California. They are active in their faith community. They volunteer  with community-based organizations and are, in turn, supported by their  community. When I first introduced this bill, I received dozens of  letters of support from their fellow parishioners, teachers, and  members of their community.   The Martinez family truly exemplifies the American dream. Jose worked  his way through the restaurant industry to become a chef and an  indispensable employee at a renowned restaurant. With great dedication,  Micaela has worked hard to raise three daughters who are advancing  their education and look forward to continuing the pursuit of their  goals.   I believe the Martinez family's continued presence in the United  States would allow them to continue making significant contributions to  their community in California.   I ask my colleagues to support this private bill.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:   S. 558. A bill for the relief of Esidronio Arreola-Saucedo, Maria  Elena Cobian Arreola, Nayely Arreola Carlos, and Cindy Jael Arreola; to  the Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. President, today I offer private immigration  relief legislation to provide lawful permanent resident status to  Esidronio Arreola-Saucedo, Maria Elena Cobian Arreola, Nayely Arreola  Carlos, and Cindy Jael Arreola. The Arreolas are Mexican nationals  living in the Fresno area of California.   Esidronio and Maria Elena have lived in the United States for over 20  years. Two of their five children--Nayely, age 30, and Cindy, age 28-- also stand to benefit from this legislation. The other three Arreola  children--Robert, age 25, Daniel, age 22, and Saray, age 20--are U.S.  citizens. The story of the Arreola family is compelling, and I believe  they merit Congress's special consideration for such an extraordinary  form of relief as a private bill.   The Arreolas are facing deportation in part because of grievous  errors committed by their previous counsel, who has since been  disbarred. In fact, the attorney's conduct was so egregious that it  compelled an immigration judge to write to the Executive Office of  Immigration Review seeking the attorney's disbarment for his actions in  his clients' immigration cases.   Esidronio came to the United States in 1986 and was an agricultural  migrant worker in the fields of California for several years. As a  migrant worker at that time, he would have been eligible for permanent  residence through the Seasonal Agricultural Workers, SWA, Program, had  he known about it.   Maria Elena was living in the United States at the time she became  pregnant with her daughter Cindy. She returned to Mexico to give birth  because she wanted to avoid any immigration issues.   Because of the length of time that the Arreolas were in the United  States, it is likely that they would have qualified for suspension of  deportation, which would have allowed them to remain in the United  States legally. However, the poor legal representation they received  foreclosed this opportunity.   One of the most compelling reasons for my introduction of this  private bill is the devastating impact the deportation of Esidronio and  Maria Elena would have on their children--three of whom are American  citizens--and the other two who have lived in the United States since  they were toddlers. America is the only country the Arreola children  have ever known.   Nayely, the oldest, was the first in her family to graduate from high  school and the first to graduate college. She recently received her  Masters in Business Administration from Fresno Pacific University, a  regionally ranked university, and now works in the admissions office.  Nayely is married and has a young son named Elijah Ace Carlos.   At a young age, Nayely demonstrated a strong commitment to the ideals  of citizenship in her adopted country. She worked hard to achieve her  full potential both through her academic endeavors and community  service. As the Associate Dean of Enrollment Services at Fresno Pacific  University states in a letter of support, ``[T]he leaders of Fresno  Pacific University saw in Nayely, a young person who will become  exemplary of all that is good in the American dream.''   In high school, Nayely was a member of the Advancement Via Individual  Determination (AVID) college preparatory program in which students  commit to determining their own futures through attaining a college  degree. Nayely was also President of the Key Club, a community service  organization. Perhaps the greatest hardship to Nayely's U.S. citizen  husband and child, if she were forced to return to Mexico, would be her  lost opportunity to realize her dreams and contribute further to her  community and to this country.   Nayely's sister, Cindy, is also married and has a 7-year-old daughter  and a 5-year-old son. Neither Nayely nor Cindy is eligible to  automatically adjust their status based on their marriages because of  their initial unlawful entry.   The Arreolas also have other family who are U.S. citizens or lawful  permanent residents of this country. Maria Elena has three brothers who  are American citizens, and Esidronio has a sister who is an American  citizen. They have no immediate family in Mexico.   According to immigration authorities, this family has never had any  problems with law enforcement. I am told that they have filed their  taxes every year from 1990 to the present. They have always worked hard  to support themselves.  [[Page S1645]]    As I mentioned, Esidronio was previously employed as a farm worker  but now has his own business in California repairing electronics. His  business has been successful enough to enable him to purchase a home  for his family. He and his wife are active in their church community  and in their children's education.   It is clear to me that this family has embraced the American dream.  Enactment of the legislation I have reintroduced today will enable the  Arreolas to continue to make significant contributions to their  community as well as the United States.   I ask my colleagues to support this private bill.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:   S. 559. A bill for the relief of Alfredo Plascencia Lopez; to the  Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation to  provide lawful permanent residence status to Alfredo Plascencia Lopez,  a Mexican national who lives in the San Bruno area of California.   I offer legislation on his behalf because I believe that, without it,  this hard-working man, wife who is a lawful permanent resident, and  children would face extreme hardship. His children would either face  separation from their father or be forced to leave the only country  they know and give up the education they are pursuing in the United  States.   Alfredo and his wife Maria have been in the United States for over 20  years. They worked for years to adjust their status through appropriate  legal channels, but poor legal representation ruined their  opportunities.   The Plascencias' lawyer refused to return their calls or otherwise  communicate with them in any way. He also failed to forward crucial  immigration documents. Because of the poor representation they  received, Alfredo only became aware that they had been ordered to leave  the United States 15 days prior to his scheduled deportation.   Alfredo was shocked to learn of his attorney's malfeasance, but he  acted quickly to secure legitimate counsel and filed the appropriate  paperwork to delay his deportation and determine if any other legal  action could be taken.   Together, Alfredo and Maria have used their professional successes,  with the assistance of private bills, to realize many of the goals  dreamed of by all Americans. They have worked hard and saved up to buy  their home.   They have good health care benefits, and they each have begun saving  for retirement. They are sending their children Christina, Erika, and  Danny, to college and plan to send the rest of their children to  college, as well.   Their oldest child, Christina, is 26 years old, and takes classes at  Heald College to become a paralegal. Erika, age 22, graduated from high  school and is currently taking classes at Skyline College. Her teachers  have praised her abilities and have referred to her as a ``bright  spot'' in the classroom. Danny, age 20, currently attends the  University of California and volunteers at his local homeless shelter  in the soup kitchen. Daisy, age 15, and Juan Pablo, age 10, are in  school and plan on attending college.   Allowing Alfredo to remain in the United States is necessary to  enable his family to continue thriving in the United States. His  children are dedicated to pursuing their education and being productive  members of their community.   I do not believe that Alfredo should be separated from his family. I  am reintroducing this legislation to protect the best interest of  Alfredo's U.S. citizen children and his wife, who is a lawful permanent  resident. I believe that Alfredo will continue to make positive  contributions to his community in California and this country. I  respectfully ask my colleagues to support this bill.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:   S. 560. A bill for the relief of Jorge Rojas Gutierrez and Oliva  Gonzalez; to the Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a private  relief bill on behalf of Jorge Rojas Gutierrez and his wife, Oliva  Gonzalez. The Rojas family, originally from Mexico, is living in the  San Jose area of California.   The story of the Rojas family is compelling, and I believe they merit  Congress's special consideration for such an extraordinary form of  relief as a private bill.   Jorge and Oliva originally came to the United States in 1990 when  their son Jorge Rojas, Jr., was just 2 years old. In 1995, they left  the country to attend a funeral and then reentered the United States on  visitors' visas.   The family has grown to include three U.S. citizen children: Alexis,  now 24 years old, Tanya, 22 years old, and Matias, now 7 years old.  Jorge and Oliva are also the grandparents of Meena Rojas.   The Rojas family first attempted to legalize their status in the  United States when an unscrupulous immigration consultant, who was not  an attorney, advised them to apply for asylum. Unfortunately, without  proper legal guidance, the family did not realize at the time that they  lacked a valid basis for asylum. Their asylum claim was denied in 2008,  leaving the Rojas family with no further options to legalize their  status.   Since their arrival in the United States more than 20 years ago, the  Rojas family has demonstrated a robust work ethic and a strong  commitment to their community in California. They have paid their taxes  and worked hard to contribute to this country.   Jorge is a hard-working individual who has been employed by  BrightView Landscaping Services, formerly known as Valley Crest  Landscape Maintenance, in San Jose, CA, for the past 20 years.  Currently, he works on commercial landscaping projects. Jorge is well- respected by his supervisor and his peers.   In addition to supporting his family, Jorge has volunteered his time  to provide modern green landscaping and building projects at his  children's school in California. He is active in his neighborhood  association, through which he worked with his neighbors to open a  library and community center in their community.   Oliva, in addition to raising her three children, has also been very  active in the local community. She volunteers with the People Acting in  Community Together, PACT, organization, where she works to prevent  crime, gangs, and drug dealing in San Jose neighborhoods and schools.   Jorge Rojas, Jr., who entered the United States as an infant with his  parents, is now the father of 6-year-old Meena. He is 28 years old and  working at a job that allows him to support his daughter. Jorge  graduated from Del Mar High School in 2007. He has obtained temporary  protection from deportation through the 2012 Deferred Action for  Childhood Arrivals, DACA, Program.   Alexis, age 24, graduated from West Valley College in Saratoga, CA,  and is interested in continuing his linguistics studies at San Jose  State University. Tanya, age 22, is now in her second semester at San  Jose State University. Their teachers have described them as  ``fantastic, wonderful and gifted'' students.   Perhaps one of the most compelling reasons for permitting the Rojas  family to remain in the United States is the impact that their  deportation would have on their four children. Three of the Rojas  children--Alexis, Tanya, and Matias--American citizens. Additionally,  Jorge Rojas, Jr., has lived in the United States since he was a  toddler. America is the only country these children have called home.  It seems so clear to me that this family has embraced the American  dream, and their continued presence in our country would do so much to  promote the values we hold dear,   When I first introduced this bill, I received dozens of letters from  the community in Northern California in support of this family.  Enactment of the legislation I have reintroduced today will keep this  great family together and enable each of them to continue making  significant contributions to their community as well as the United  States.   I ask my colleagues to support this private bill.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:   S. 561. A bill for the relief of Alicia Aranda De Buendia; to the  Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. President, I am reintroducing a private relief  bill  [[Page S1646]]  on behalf of Alicia Buendia, a woman who has lived in the Fresno area  of California for more than 20 years. I believe her situation merits  Congress's special consideration.   She is married to Jose Buendia, and together they have raised two  outstanding children, Ana Laura, age 28, and Alex, age 26, a U.S.  citizen. Both children have excelled in school. Ana Laura graduated  from University of California, Irvine, and Alex is currently attending  the University of California, Merced.   I previously introduced bills for Alicia, her husband, and Ana Laura.  Thankfully, Jose has successfully secured lawful permanent residency  for himself through cancellation of removal. This followed 7  unfortunate years of delay in the immigration courts to determine his  eligibility under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 for  permanent residence. Ana Laura has obtained temporary protection from  deportation through the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals,  DACA, Program.   However, Alicia, who is eligible to adjust status, is still awaiting  a determination on a family-based immigration petition filed by her  U.S. citizen son. Additionally, she would be required to file a waiver  application, which could result in separation from her family   Alicia warrants private relief and a chance to start fresh in  America. She goes to work season after season in California's labor- intensive agriculture industry in Reedley, CA, where she currently  works for a fruit packing company.   In the more than 20 years of living in California, Alicia has  dedicated herself to her family and community. She and Jose have worked  hard to honestly feed their family and have raised two exceptional  children who have both pursued and excelled in higher education.   Alicia has a strong connection to her local community, serving as an  active member of her church. She and Jose pay their taxes every year,  have successfully paid off their mortgage, and remain free of debt.  They have shown that they are responsible, maintaining health  insurance, savings accounts, and retirement accounts. Without this  private bill, Alicia would be separated from her lawful permanent  resident husband, two children who rely on her for love, support, and  guidance.   I ask my colleagues to support this private bill.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:   S. 562. A bill for the relief of Ruben Mkoian, Asmik Karapetian, and  Arthur Mkoian; to the Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. President, I am reintroducing private relief  legislation in the 115th Congress on behalf of Ruben Mkoian, Asmik  Karapetian, and their son, Arthur Mkoian. The Mkoian family has been  living in Fresno, CA, for over 20 years. I continue to believe this  family deserves Congress's special consideration for such an  extraordinary form of relief as a private bill.   The Mkoian family is originally from Armenia. They decided to leave  Armenia for the United States in the early 1990s, following several  incidents in which the family experienced harassment, vandalism and  threats to their well-being.   In Armenia, Ruben worked as a police sergeant on vehicle licensing.  At one point, he was offered a bribe to register stolen vehicles, which  he refused and reported to his superior, the police chief. He later  learned that a coworker had registered the vehicles at the request of  the same chief.   After Ruben reported the bribe offer to illegally register vehicles  and said he would call the police, his family store was vandalized and  he received threatening phone calls telling him to keep quiet. A bottle  of gasoline was thrown into his family's residence, burning it to the  ground. In April 1992, several men entered the family store and  assaulted Ruben, hospitalizing him for 22 days.   Ruben, Asmik, and their son Arthur, who was 3 years old at the time,  left Armenia and entered the United States on visitor visas. They  applied for political asylum that same year on the grounds that they  would be subject to physical attacks if returned to Armenia. It took 16  years for their case to be finalized, with the Ninth Circuit Court of  Appeals denying their asylum case in January 2008.   At this time, Ruben, Asmik, and Arthur have exhausted every option to  obtain immigration relief in the United States. While Ruben and Asmik's  other son, Arsen, is a U.S. citizen, he is too young to file a green  card petition on their behalf.   It would be a terrible shame to remove this family from the United  States and to separate them from Arsen, who is 20 years old and a U.S.  citizen. The Mkoians have worked hard to build a place for their family  in California and are an integral part of their community.   The family attends St. Paul Armenian Apostolic Church in Fresno. They  do charity work to send medical equipment to Armenia.   Ruben works as a driver for Uber. He previously worked as a manager  at a car wash in Fresno and as a truckdriver for a California trucking  company that described him as ``trustworthy,'' ``knowledgeable,'' and  an asset to the company. Asmik has worked as a medical assistant the  past 6 years at the Fresno Shields Medical Center.   Arthur has proven to be a hard-working, smart young man who applies  himself. He was recognized nationally for his scholastic achievement,  having maintained a 4.0 grade point average in high school and serving  as his class valedictorian. After graduating on the Dean's Merit List  from the University of California, Davis with a major in Chemistry, he  is now a full-time analyst at a water testing company. He also teaches  Armenian School on Saturdays at the church.   Arthur's brother, Arsen currently attends Fresno State University, is  majoring in Computer Science, and maintains a 3.8 GPA. These two young  men have already accomplished so much and clearly aspire to do great  things here in the United States.   Reflecting their contributions to their community, Representatives  George Radanovich and Jim Costa strongly supported this family's  ability to remain in the United States. When I first introduced a  private bill for the Mkoian family, I received more than 200 letters of  support and dozens of calls of support from friends and community  members, attesting to the positive impact that this family has had in  Fresno, California.   I believe that this case warrants our compassion. I respectfully ask  my colleagues to support this private legislation on behalf of the  Mkoian family.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a bill for  the private relief of Shirley Constantino Tan. Ms. Tan is a Filipina  national living in Pacifica, CA. She is the proud  [[Page S1643]]  mother of 20-year-old U.S. citizen twin boys, Joriene and Jashley, and  the spouse of Jay Mercado, a naturalized U.S. citizen.   I believe Ms. Tan merits Congress's special consideration for this  extraordinary form of relief because her removal from the United States  would cause undue hardship for her and her family. She faces  deportation to the Philippines, which would separate her from her  family and jeopardize her safety.   Ms. Tan experienced horrific violence in the Philippines before she  left to come to the United States. When she was only 14 years old, her  cousin murdered her mother and her sister and shot Shirley in the head.  While the cousin who committed the murders was eventually prosecuted,  he received a short jail sentence. Fearing for her safety, Ms. Tan fled  the Philippines just before her cousin was due to be released from  jail. She entered the United States legally on a visitor's visa in  1989.   Ms. Tan's current deportation order is the result of negligent  counsel. She applied for asylum in 1995. While her case appeal was  pending at the Board of Immigration Appeals, her attorney failed to  submit a brief to support her case. As a result, the case was  dismissed, and the Board of Immigration Appeals granted Shirley  voluntary departure from the United States.   Ms. Tan never received notice that the Board of Immigration Appeals  granted her voluntary departure. Her attorney moved offices, did not  receive the order, and ultimately never informed her of the order. As a  result, Ms. Tan did not depart the United States and the grant of  voluntary departure automatically led to a removal order. She learned  about the deportation order for the first time on January 28, 2009,  when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents took her into  immigration custody.   Because of her attorney's negligent actions, Ms. Tan was denied the  opportunity to present her case in immigration proceedings. She later  filed a complaint with the State Bar of California against her former  attorney. She is not the first person to file such a complaint against  this attorney.   On February 4, 2015, Ms. Tan's spouse, Jay, a U.S. citizen, filed an  approved spousal petition on her behalf. On August 20, 2015, U.S.  Citizenship and Immigration Services denied her application due to the  fact that she still had a final order of removal. Ms. Tan must go back  to the immigration court and ask for the court to terminate her case  and then reapply for her green card. Ms. Tan is now again facing the  threat of deportation while she seeks to close her case before an  immigration court.   In addition to the hardship that Ms. Tan would endure if she is  deported, her deportation would cause serious hardship to her two U.S.  citizen children, Joriene and Jashley.   Joriene is a junior at Stanford University and is premed, majoring in  human biology. In addition to his studies, Joriene is involved in  Stanford's Pilipino-American Student Union.   Jashley is a junior at Chapman University, majoring in business  administration. Ms. Tan no longer runs her in-home daycare and is a  homemaker.   If Ms. Tan were forced to leave the United States, her family has  expressed that they would go with her to the Philippines or try to find  a third country where the entire family could relocate. This would mean  that Joriene and Jashley would have to leave behind their education and  the only home they know in the United States.   I do not believe it is in our Nation's best interest to force this  family, with two U.S. citizen children, to make the choice between  being separated and relocating to a country where they may face safety  concerns or other serious hardships.   Ms. Tan and her family are involved in their community in Pacifica  and own their own home. The family attends Good Shepherd Catholic  Church, volunteering at the church and the Mother Teresa of Calcutta's  Daughters of Charity. Ms. Tan has the support of dozens of members of  her community who have shared with me the family's spirit of commitment  to their community.   Enactment of the legislation I am introducing on behalf of Ms. Tan  today will enable this entire family to continue their lives in  California and make positive contributions to their community.   Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support this private bill.                                  ______    Mr. President, today I am reintroducing private  relief legislation on behalf of Joseph Gabra and Sharon Kamel, a couple  living with their four U.S. citizen children in Camarillo, CA.   Joseph and Sharon are nationals of Egypt who fled their home country  over 19 years ago after being targeted for their religious membership  in the Christian Coptic Church in Egypt. They became involved with this  church during the 1990s, Joseph as an accountant and project  coordinator helping to build community facilities and Sharon as the  church's training director in human resources.   Unfortunately, Joseph and Sharon were also subjected to threats and  abuse. Joseph was jailed repeatedly because of his involvement with the  church. Sharon's family members were violently targeted, including her  cousin who was murdered and her brother whose business was firebombed.  When Sharon became pregnant with her first child, she was threatened by  a member of a different religious organization for raising her child in  a non-Muslim faith.   Joseph and Sharon came to the United States legally on visitor visas  in November 1998. Due to their fears of persecution in Egypt based on  their religious beliefs, they filed for asylum in the United States in  May 1999.   However, Joseph, who has a speech impediment, had difficulty  communicating why he was afraid to return to Egypt, and 1 year later  their asylum application was denied. Considering that Sharon's brother,  who also applied for asylum for similar reasons, was granted asylum in  the United States, Joseph and Sharon appealed the denial of their  asylum applications, to no avail.   While Sharon's brother, who is now a U.S. citizen, has filed a  family-based immigrant petition on Sharon's behalf, it will be at least  4 years until she will even be eligible for a visa number due to visa  backlogs.   If Sharon and Joseph are deported before then, they will not only be  separated from their family but will be forced to return to a country  where persecution of Coptic Christians continues.   Due to their fear of returning to Egypt, Joseph and Sharon have  therefore tried to build a life for themselves here in the United  States, working hard while building their beautiful family. With the  protection of past private bills I filed on their behalf, Joseph was  able to get his certified public accountant license and opened his own  accounting firm, where Sharon works by his side.   Joseph and Sharon make sure that their four U.S. citizen children-- Jessica, age 18, Rebecca, age 17, Rafael, age 16, and Veronica, age  11--all attend school in California and maintain good grades.   Joseph and Sharon carry strong support from friends, members of their  local church, and other Californians who attest to their good character  and community contributions.   I am concerned that the entire family would face serious and  unwarranted hardships if Joseph and Sharon were forced to return to  Egypt. For Jessica, Rebecca, Rafael, and Veronica, the only home they  know is in the United States. Separation of this family would be  devastating and the alternative--relocating the family to Egypt--could  be dire, as it is quite possible that these four American children  would face discrimination or worse on account of their religion, as was  the experience of many of their family members.   Joseph and Sharon have made a compelling plea to remain in the United  States. These parents emphasize their commitment to supporting their  children and creating a healthy and productive place for them to grow  up in California. I believe this family deserves that opportunity.   I respectfully ask my colleagues to support this private relief bill  on behalf of Joseph Gabra and Sharon Kamel.                                  ______    Mr. President, today I am reintroducing private  immigration relief legislation to provide lawful permanent resident  status to Jose Alberto Martinez Moreno, Micaela Lopez Martinez, and  their daughter, Adilene Martinez. This family is originally from Mexico  but has been living in California for over 20 years. I believe they  merit Congress's special consideration for this extraordinary form of  relief.   When Jose came to the United States from Mexico, he began working as  a busboy in restaurants in San Francisco, CA. In 1990, he started  working as a cook at Palio D'Asti, an award-winning Italian restaurant  in San Francisco.   Jose worked his way through the ranks, eventuall becoming Palio's  sous chef. His colleagues describe him as a reliable and cool-headed  coworker and as ``an exemplary employee'' who not only is ``good at his  job but is also a great boss to his subordinates.''   He and his wife Micaela call San Francisco home. Micaela is a  homemaker and part-time housekeeper. They have three daughters, two of  whom are U.S. citizens. Their oldest daughter, Adilene, age 28, is  undocumented. She currently works fulltime at a cinema and hopes to  continue pursuing her studies in the future.   The Martinez's second daughter, Jazmin, age 24, is a U.S. citizen.  She graduated from Leadership High School and is now studying at  California State University, San Francisco. Jazmin has been diagnosed  with asthma, which requires constant treatment. According to her  doctor, if Jazmin were to return to Mexico with her family, the high  altitude and air pollution in Mexico City could be fatal to her. The  Martinez's other U.S. citizen daughter, Karla, is 19 years old and  attends San Francisco City College.   The Martinez family attempted to legalize their status through  several channels.   In 2001, Jose's sister, who has legal status, petitioned for Jose to  get a green card. However, the current green card backlog for siblings  from Mexico is very long, and it will be many years before Jose will be  eligible to legalize his status though his sister.   In 2002, the Martinez family applied for political asylum. Their  application was denied. An immigration judge denied their subsequent  application for cancellation of removal.   Finally, Daniel Scherotter, the executive chef and owner of Palio  D'Asti, petitioned for an employment-based green card for Jose based  upon his unique skills as a chef. Jose's petition was approved by U.S.  Citizenship and Immigration Services. However, before he will be  eligible for a green card, he must apply for a hardship waiver, which  cannot be guaranteed.   The Martinez family has become an integral part of their community in  California. They are active in their faith community. They volunteer  with community-based organizations and are, in turn, supported by their  community. When I first introduced this bill, I received dozens of  letters of support from their fellow parishioners, teachers, and  members of their community.   The Martinez family truly exemplifies the American dream. Jose worked  his way through the restaurant industry to become a chef and an  indispensable employee at a renowned restaurant. With great dedication,  Micaela has worked hard to raise three daughters who are advancing  their education and look forward to continuing the pursuit of their  goals.   I believe the Martinez family's continued presence in the United  States would allow them to continue making significant contributions to  their community in California.   I ask my colleagues to support this private bill.                                  ______    Mr. President, today I offer private immigration  relief legislation to provide lawful permanent resident status to  Esidronio Arreola-Saucedo, Maria Elena Cobian Arreola, Nayely Arreola  Carlos, and Cindy Jael Arreola. The Arreolas are Mexican nationals  living in the Fresno area of California.   Esidronio and Maria Elena have lived in the United States for over 20  years. Two of their five children--Nayely, age 30, and Cindy, age 28-- also stand to benefit from this legislation. The other three Arreola  children--Robert, age 25, Daniel, age 22, and Saray, age 20--are U.S.  citizens. The story of the Arreola family is compelling, and I believe  they merit Congress's special consideration for such an extraordinary  form of relief as a private bill.   The Arreolas are facing deportation in part because of grievous  errors committed by their previous counsel, who has since been  disbarred. In fact, the attorney's conduct was so egregious that it  compelled an immigration judge to write to the Executive Office of  Immigration Review seeking the attorney's disbarment for his actions in  his clients' immigration cases.   Esidronio came to the United States in 1986 and was an agricultural  migrant worker in the fields of California for several years. As a  migrant worker at that time, he would have been eligible for permanent  residence through the Seasonal Agricultural Workers, SWA, Program, had  he known about it.   Maria Elena was living in the United States at the time she became  pregnant with her daughter Cindy. She returned to Mexico to give birth  because she wanted to avoid any immigration issues.   Because of the length of time that the Arreolas were in the United  States, it is likely that they would have qualified for suspension of  deportation, which would have allowed them to remain in the United  States legally. However, the poor legal representation they received  foreclosed this opportunity.   One of the most compelling reasons for my introduction of this  private bill is the devastating impact the deportation of Esidronio and  Maria Elena would have on their children--three of whom are American  citizens--and the other two who have lived in the United States since  they were toddlers. America is the only country the Arreola children  have ever known.   Nayely, the oldest, was the first in her family to graduate from high  school and the first to graduate college. She recently received her  Masters in Business Administration from Fresno Pacific University, a  regionally ranked university, and now works in the admissions office.  Nayely is married and has a young son named Elijah Ace Carlos.   At a young age, Nayely demonstrated a strong commitment to the ideals  of citizenship in her adopted country. She worked hard to achieve her  full potential both through her academic endeavors and community  service. As the Associate Dean of Enrollment Services at Fresno Pacific  University states in a letter of support, ``[T]he leaders of Fresno  Pacific University saw in Nayely, a young person who will become  exemplary of all that is good in the American dream.''   In high school, Nayely was a member of the Advancement Via Individual  Determination (AVID) college preparatory program in which students  commit to determining their own futures through attaining a college  degree. Nayely was also President of the Key Club, a community service  organization. Perhaps the greatest hardship to Nayely's U.S. citizen  husband and child, if she were forced to return to Mexico, would be her  lost opportunity to realize her dreams and contribute further to her  community and to this country.   Nayely's sister, Cindy, is also married and has a 7-year-old daughter  and a 5-year-old son. Neither Nayely nor Cindy is eligible to  automatically adjust their status based on their marriages because of  their initial unlawful entry.   The Arreolas also have other family who are U.S. citizens or lawful  permanent residents of this country. Maria Elena has three brothers who  are American citizens, and Esidronio has a sister who is an American  citizen. They have no immediate family in Mexico.   According to immigration authorities, this family has never had any  problems with law enforcement. I am told that they have filed their  taxes every year from 1990 to the present. They have always worked hard  to support themselves.  [[Page S1645]]    As I mentioned, Esidronio was previously employed as a farm worker  but now has his own business in California repairing electronics. His  business has been successful enough to enable him to purchase a home  for his family. He and his wife are active in their church community  and in their children's education.   It is clear to me that this family has embraced the American dream.  Enactment of the legislation I have reintroduced today will enable the  Arreolas to continue to make significant contributions to their  community as well as the United States.   I ask my colleagues to support this private bill.                                  ______    Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation to  provide lawful permanent residence status to Alfredo Plascencia Lopez,  a Mexican national who lives in the San Bruno area of California.   I offer legislation on his behalf because I believe that, without it,  this hard-working man, wife who is a lawful permanent resident, and  children would face extreme hardship. His children would either face  separation from their father or be forced to leave the only country  they know and give up the education they are pursuing in the United  States.   Alfredo and his wife Maria have been in the United States for over 20  years. They worked for years to adjust their status through appropriate  legal channels, but poor legal representation ruined their  opportunities.   The Plascencias' lawyer refused to return their calls or otherwise  communicate with them in any way. He also failed to forward crucial  immigration documents. Because of the poor representation they  received, Alfredo only became aware that they had been ordered to leave  the United States 15 days prior to his scheduled deportation.   Alfredo was shocked to learn of his attorney's malfeasance, but he  acted quickly to secure legitimate counsel and filed the appropriate  paperwork to delay his deportation and determine if any other legal  action could be taken.   Together, Alfredo and Maria have used their professional successes,  with the assistance of private bills, to realize many of the goals  dreamed of by all Americans. They have worked hard and saved up to buy  their home.   They have good health care benefits, and they each have begun saving  for retirement. They are sending their children Christina, Erika, and  Danny, to college and plan to send the rest of their children to  college, as well.   Their oldest child, Christina, is 26 years old, and takes classes at  Heald College to become a paralegal. Erika, age 22, graduated from high  school and is currently taking classes at Skyline College. Her teachers  have praised her abilities and have referred to her as a ``bright  spot'' in the classroom. Danny, age 20, currently attends the  University of California and volunteers at his local homeless shelter  in the soup kitchen. Daisy, age 15, and Juan Pablo, age 10, are in  school and plan on attending college.   Allowing Alfredo to remain in the United States is necessary to  enable his family to continue thriving in the United States. His  children are dedicated to pursuing their education and being productive  members of their community.   I do not believe that Alfredo should be separated from his family. I  am reintroducing this legislation to protect the best interest of  Alfredo's U.S. citizen children and his wife, who is a lawful permanent  resident. I believe that Alfredo will continue to make positive  contributions to his community in California and this country. I  respectfully ask my colleagues to support this bill.                                  ______    Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a private  relief bill on behalf of Jorge Rojas Gutierrez and his wife, Oliva  Gonzalez. The Rojas family, originally from Mexico, is living in the  San Jose area of California.   The story of the Rojas family is compelling, and I believe they merit  Congress's special consideration for such an extraordinary form of  relief as a private bill.   Jorge and Oliva originally came to the United States in 1990 when  their son Jorge Rojas, Jr., was just 2 years old. In 1995, they left  the country to attend a funeral and then reentered the United States on  visitors' visas.   The family has grown to include three U.S. citizen children: Alexis,  now 24 years old, Tanya, 22 years old, and Matias, now 7 years old.  Jorge and Oliva are also the grandparents of Meena Rojas.   The Rojas family first attempted to legalize their status in the  United States when an unscrupulous immigration consultant, who was not  an attorney, advised them to apply for asylum. Unfortunately, without  proper legal guidance, the family did not realize at the time that they  lacked a valid basis for asylum. Their asylum claim was denied in 2008,  leaving the Rojas family with no further options to legalize their  status.   Since their arrival in the United States more than 20 years ago, the  Rojas family has demonstrated a robust work ethic and a strong  commitment to their community in California. They have paid their taxes  and worked hard to contribute to this country.   Jorge is a hard-working individual who has been employed by  BrightView Landscaping Services, formerly known as Valley Crest  Landscape Maintenance, in San Jose, CA, for the past 20 years.  Currently, he works on commercial landscaping projects. Jorge is well- respected by his supervisor and his peers.   In addition to supporting his family, Jorge has volunteered his time  to provide modern green landscaping and building projects at his  children's school in California. He is active in his neighborhood  association, through which he worked with his neighbors to open a  library and community center in their community.   Oliva, in addition to raising her three children, has also been very  active in the local community. She volunteers with the People Acting in  Community Together, PACT, organization, where she works to prevent  crime, gangs, and drug dealing in San Jose neighborhoods and schools.   Jorge Rojas, Jr., who entered the United States as an infant with his  parents, is now the father of 6-year-old Meena. He is 28 years old and  working at a job that allows him to support his daughter. Jorge  graduated from Del Mar High School in 2007. He has obtained temporary  protection from deportation through the 2012 Deferred Action for  Childhood Arrivals, DACA, Program.   Alexis, age 24, graduated from West Valley College in Saratoga, CA,  and is interested in continuing his linguistics studies at San Jose  State University. Tanya, age 22, is now in her second semester at San  Jose State University. Their teachers have described them as  ``fantastic, wonderful and gifted'' students.   Perhaps one of the most compelling reasons for permitting the Rojas  family to remain in the United States is the impact that their  deportation would have on their four children. Three of the Rojas  children--Alexis, Tanya, and Matias--American citizens. Additionally,  Jorge Rojas, Jr., has lived in the United States since he was a  toddler. America is the only country these children have called home.  It seems so clear to me that this family has embraced the American  dream, and their continued presence in our country would do so much to  promote the values we hold dear,   When I first introduced this bill, I received dozens of letters from  the community in Northern California in support of this family.  Enactment of the legislation I have reintroduced today will keep this  great family together and enable each of them to continue making  significant contributions to their community as well as the United  States.   I ask my colleagues to support this private bill.                                  ______    Mr. President, I am reintroducing a private relief  bill  [[Page S1646]]  on behalf of Alicia Buendia, a woman who has lived in the Fresno area  of California for more than 20 years. I believe her situation merits  Congress's special consideration.   She is married to Jose Buendia, and together they have raised two  outstanding children, Ana Laura, age 28, and Alex, age 26, a U.S.  citizen. Both children have excelled in school. Ana Laura graduated  from University of California, Irvine, and Alex is currently attending  the University of California, Merced.   I previously introduced bills for Alicia, her husband, and Ana Laura.  Thankfully, Jose has successfully secured lawful permanent residency  for himself through cancellation of removal. This followed 7  unfortunate years of delay in the immigration courts to determine his  eligibility under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 for  permanent residence. Ana Laura has obtained temporary protection from  deportation through the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals,  DACA, Program.   However, Alicia, who is eligible to adjust status, is still awaiting  a determination on a family-based immigration petition filed by her  U.S. citizen son. Additionally, she would be required to file a waiver  application, which could result in separation from her family   Alicia warrants private relief and a chance to start fresh in  America. She goes to work season after season in California's labor- intensive agriculture industry in Reedley, CA, where she currently  works for a fruit packing company.   In the more than 20 years of living in California, Alicia has  dedicated herself to her family and community. She and Jose have worked  hard to honestly feed their family and have raised two exceptional  children who have both pursued and excelled in higher education.   Alicia has a strong connection to her local community, serving as an  active member of her church. She and Jose pay their taxes every year,  have successfully paid off their mortgage, and remain free of debt.  They have shown that they are responsible, maintaining health  insurance, savings accounts, and retirement accounts. Without this  private bill, Alicia would be separated from her lawful permanent  resident husband, two children who rely on her for love, support, and  guidance.   I ask my colleagues to support this private bill.                                  ______    Mr. President, I am reintroducing private relief  legislation in the 115th Congress on behalf of Ruben Mkoian, Asmik  Karapetian, and their son, Arthur Mkoian. The Mkoian family has been  living in Fresno, CA, for over 20 years. I continue to believe this  family deserves Congress's special consideration for such an  extraordinary form of relief as a private bill.   The Mkoian family is originally from Armenia. They decided to leave  Armenia for the United States in the early 1990s, following several  incidents in which the family experienced harassment, vandalism and  threats to their well-being.   In Armenia, Ruben worked as a police sergeant on vehicle licensing.  At one point, he was offered a bribe to register stolen vehicles, which  he refused and reported to his superior, the police chief. He later  learned that a coworker had registered the vehicles at the request of  the same chief.   After Ruben reported the bribe offer to illegally register vehicles  and said he would call the police, his family store was vandalized and  he received threatening phone calls telling him to keep quiet. A bottle  of gasoline was thrown into his family's residence, burning it to the  ground. In April 1992, several men entered the family store and  assaulted Ruben, hospitalizing him for 22 days.   Ruben, Asmik, and their son Arthur, who was 3 years old at the time,  left Armenia and entered the United States on visitor visas. They  applied for political asylum that same year on the grounds that they  would be subject to physical attacks if returned to Armenia. It took 16  years for their case to be finalized, with the Ninth Circuit Court of  Appeals denying their asylum case in January 2008.   At this time, Ruben, Asmik, and Arthur have exhausted every option to  obtain immigration relief in the United States. While Ruben and Asmik's  other son, Arsen, is a U.S. citizen, he is too young to file a green  card petition on their behalf.   It would be a terrible shame to remove this family from the United  States and to separate them from Arsen, who is 20 years old and a U.S.  citizen. The Mkoians have worked hard to build a place for their family  in California and are an integral part of their community.   The family attends St. Paul Armenian Apostolic Church in Fresno. They  do charity work to send medical equipment to Armenia.   Ruben works as a driver for Uber. He previously worked as a manager  at a car wash in Fresno and as a truckdriver for a California trucking  company that described him as ``trustworthy,'' ``knowledgeable,'' and  an asset to the company. Asmik has worked as a medical assistant the  past 6 years at the Fresno Shields Medical Center.   Arthur has proven to be a hard-working, smart young man who applies  himself. He was recognized nationally for his scholastic achievement,  having maintained a 4.0 grade point average in high school and serving  as his class valedictorian. After graduating on the Dean's Merit List  from the University of California, Davis with a major in Chemistry, he  is now a full-time analyst at a water testing company. He also teaches  Armenian School on Saturdays at the church.   Arthur's brother, Arsen currently attends Fresno State University, is  majoring in Computer Science, and maintains a 3.8 GPA. These two young  men have already accomplished so much and clearly aspire to do great  things here in the United States.   Reflecting their contributions to their community, Representatives  George Radanovich and Jim Costa strongly supported this family's  ability to remain in the United States. When I first introduced a  private bill for the Mkoian family, I received more than 200 letters of  support and dozens of calls of support from friends and community  members, attesting to the positive impact that this family has had in  Fresno, California.   I believe that this case warrants our compassion. I respectfully ask  my colleagues to support this private legislation on behalf of the  Mkoian family.                            ____________________
