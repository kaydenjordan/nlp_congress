 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 21st Century AIRR  Act, a comprehensive act to reauthorize the FAA and reform air traffic  control.   Our aviation system was once the best in the world, but,  unfortunately, America is no longer first in flight. Ask anyone who  flies. They know our aviation system is plagued with inefficiencies.  These range from indirect routes that send us all over, trying to get  from one point to another; seemingly endless delays; and time wasted on  the tarmac, hoping to take off to head to your destination.   These delays and congestion cost travelers and our economy an  estimated $25 billion a year.   You may have heard that argument that there is nothing we can do; 50  percent of our air traffic delays are caused by bad weather.   Well, underlying that is 50 percent of our delays are caused by bad  weather because you have to space out aircraft further and differently  when the weather is inclement.   Why is that?   Well, in many cases, we are using World War II radar technology to  keep track of modern aviation. In fact, over 400 air traffic control  facilities were built before the invention of the internet and 9 of  them are old enough to collect Medicare if they were a live human  being. Think about that. They are that old.   Questions have been asked: Why haven't we simply fixed the problem?   After all, taxpayers and passengers have poured billions of dollars  into the FAA to modernize that system over the last 30 years, yet we  have little to show for it.   As President Clinton pointed out nearly 20 years ago, ``part of the  problem is our outdated technology . . . but a more fundamental problem  is also how the FAA operates.''   I couldn't agree more.   We recently had a hearing regarding air traffic control, and the FAA  was asked: What does it take to get to a modern air traffic control  system like is used in other parts of the developed world?   I was told: If we had 10 more years and $30 billion more, we would  hope to have the project done.   I come from private business. Hope is not a plan.   The 21st Century AIRR Act would replace a Federal entity that has  proven itself to be ineffective with an independent, not-for-profit  board tasked with modernizing our air traffic control system. They  would have one duty: providing the safest, most efficient air traffic  control service to all users.   Contrary to critics, our board would be balanced. It would be  comprised of users of the system. All are represented equally.   Quickly, let me bust a few myths here.   Critics argue that transferring air traffic control services from the  FAA to a new entity would be a free giveaway of Federal assets.   Well, first, let me state they are not Federal assets. They are our  assets. We paid for them. Everyone in this Chamber has paid for them.  Every taxpayer has paid for them. They are owned by the people.   Most of these assets are so old and outdated that, in many cases,  they are actually a liability. There are many facilities that are  actually environmental brownfields.   A number of FAA facilities no longer meet OSHA standards, yet,  somehow, some of the critics claim that these are valuable Federal  assets. In fact, users are going to pay to update this air traffic  control system. They will pay for the equipment, staff, and technology  to finally update a system that we have been trying to do for over 30  years.   Many in this Chamber talk about refocusing the Federal Government,  reducing it back to its core missions, reducing government back to what  it does best. This bill does just that.   Mr. Speaker, after billions of dollars and decades of Federal  bureaucrats' fruitless efforts to modernize our air traffic system, it  is time for change. It is time for real reform.   Mr. Speaker, this bill does exactly that. Let's bring the bill to the  floor.  [[Page H7756]]  Let's achieve real reform, rather than just talking about it.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Building a  Better America budget. That is truly what it does. For too long, our  government has spent money on a credit card with our children and  grandchildren's name on it. It shocks some here in this Chamber, but  the era of overspending is over.   Adopting this budget will allow us to deliver the key promises we  have made to Americans: getting our spending under control, balancing  the budget, and paving the way to deliver meaningful tax reform.   This resolution balances the budget within 10 years and produces a $9  billion surplus in fiscal year 2027. It achieves deficit reduction of  $6.5 trillion over 10 years. It also reduces the size of our bloated  government by giving instructions to 11 House committees to achieve at  least $203 billion in mandatory savings.   This resolution curbs our unsustainable spending while maintaining a  strong defense and protecting critical programs like Medicare.   There is much work to be done to create jobs and get our economy  moving beyond the pathetic 2 percent growth. This budget is an  important step to doing just that.   This budget allows us to deliver on our promise to the American  people to fix our broken Tax Code. Workers living paycheck to paycheck,  like my parents did, need relief and they need it now. We cannot delay  any longer.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle seek to raise taxes by  $3 trillion and simply spend more. I suggest they study how that  approach worked in Greece.   I urge my colleagues to support the Building a Better America budget.
