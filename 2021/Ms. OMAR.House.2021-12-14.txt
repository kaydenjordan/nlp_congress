 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, today, I rise because we are in the midst of a  staggering rise of anti-Muslim violence and discrimination around the  world. At its worst, it is Uyghurs in concentration camps in China and  genocide against the Rohingya in Burma. But those atrocities are part  of a deeper fabric of violence against Muslims and impunity for  violence against Muslims at a global level.   In India, Prime Minister Modi's government has moved to strip  citizenship from millions of Muslims. In Sri Lanka, anti-Muslim laws  and violence have imposed terror on the community. In Hungary, Belarus,  and Poland, politicians have stoked fear of Muslim migrants and  refugees. In New Zealand and Canada, white supremacist violence has  targeted Muslims, including at their places of worship. And, of course,  we in the United States are not immune to this hatred.   It is no secret that the previous President of the United States  explicitly vowed ``a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering  the United States.'' But Trump was simply taking advantage of a deeper  culture of Islamophobia that has existed for the past two decades, from  the PATRIOT Act to the CVE program to Abu Ghraib.                                time  1830    None of these things are happening in isolation. We must understand  that these problems are interlinked. In fact, earlier this year the  United Nations commissioned a report and concluded that Islamophobia  has reached ``epidemic proportions,'' and urged nations around the  world to take all necessary measures to combat it.   As a country that was founded on religious liberty, our leadership on  international religious freedom depends on  [[Page H7797]]  recognizing that Islamophobia is global in scope and we must lead the  global effort to address it. That is why Representative Schakowsky and  I have introduced this bill, to create a special envoy for monitoring  and combating Islamophobia at the State Department.   This bill also adds violence and incitement targeted at Muslims to  the State Department's annual human rights report and international  religious freedom report.   There are cynics who would rather see us divided on racial, ethnic,  gender, and religious lines because it suits their political agenda.  But I believe as Americans we should stand united against all forms of  bigotry.   In fact, this legislation is modeled on the special envoy to combat  anti-Semitism, and I was proud to cosponsor and vote last Congress on  legislation to elevate that envoy to a cabinet-level position.   Because it is important, Madam Speaker, that we live in a world where  everyone is free of persecution based on their religious background and  beliefs. And until everyone is free to practice their religion, no one  is.   I want to thank the colead of this bill, a partner in justice,  Representative Jan Schakowsky, along with Chairman Meeks, Speaker  Pelosi, and the leadership team for their commitment to this  legislation.   Madam Speaker, I also want to thank the Council on American-Islamic  Relations for their advocacy on this, and all the groups representing a  cross-section of human rights, civil rights, and faith coalitions, who  fight for religious rights for everyone around the world.
