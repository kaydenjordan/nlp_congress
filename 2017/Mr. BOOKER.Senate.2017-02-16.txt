 Mr. President, very good to see you. I want to again, as  I stated in the past, thank the staff. We are obviously pushing late  into the night, and there are unsung heroes who are here in the U.S.  Senate working in a nonpartisan way, keeping the Senate going. I want  to thank them all for being here tonight. Definitely, the folks who are  typing with their fingers are heroic. They have muscles in them. Thank  you very much for your work. Of course, I want to just highlight the  pages and thank them for yet another late night, when they still have  calculus homework, I am sure, to work on.   Mr. President, I am honored to be able to join my colleagues, three  of whom themselves are some of the great voices, in my opinion, in the  United States on issues of the environment, issues of protecting the  health and safety of our communities: Senators Merkley, Whitehouse, and  Schatz. I am grateful to be able to stand with them, joining them in a  chorus of conviction about our opposition to the nomination of Scott  Pruitt to serve as the Administrator of the Environmental Protection  Agency.   The EPA is a critical Federal Agency. It was established through an  Executive order by President Nixon and charged with the protection of  human health and the protection of the environment. Given the pressing  health issues, environmental challenges we face in our Nation, and  frankly the growing environmental challenges around our planet today,  we should make sure we are confirming an Administrator who has a  conviction for the protection of the health and safety of people; that  he or she prioritizes the well-being of Americans and is focused  tirelessly, exhaustively, on making sure the mission of the Agency is  made real, that other factors, conflicts, wealth of industries--that  their No. 1 concern is not all of those things but is really the health  and safety of people, of Americans, because we know what it means when  the health or safety of Americans is undermined.   This idea of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is  completely compromised if cancer rates are going up because of toxic  dumps or superfunds or asthma rates are epidemic because of toxins in  the air.   We need a person who is in charge of making sure we are not  prioritizing polluters or industries; that we are prioritizing people  first and their safety. This is not just a moral calling of this  Agency, but it is actually a practical one too. It is an economic one,  too, because the cost to society of pollution, we already know, is  extraordinarily high.   I see this in the community where I live. I am a proud resident of  Newark, NJ, but I see a polluted river, the Passaic River, that has  caused health issues, that has taken away sports and recreation,  actually taken away a source of bounty of fish and clams and other  shellfish. In addition to that, now it is costing taxpayers hundreds of  millions of dollars to clean up the waste and mess that was made by  corporations that were allowed to get away with that polluting. That is  the common sense of this.   Not only is it an issue of justice--something our country stands for,  this ideal of justice--not only is it compromising life and liberty and  the pursuit of happiness, but it also ultimately costs us so much more  not to be vigilant in the protection of our environment. It is actually  stealing, as we have seen all across this country--stealing from future  generations. As you pollute now, you are stealing from future  generations and calling it profit.   So this is what I see as a person who is in charge of this Agency,  someone who is putting health, common sense, pragmatism before the  short-term avarice that often has undermined the great bounty of this  Nation.   In this particular case, in this moment in time, with this Agency  started by a Republican, we now have a President who is not only  putting someone up who is singularly unqualified--and as a person who  worked with EPA Administrators, Republican and Democratic, we had a  great Republican Governor from New Jersey who was the head of the EPA.  Republicans and Democrats, if you compare this person, it is my  conviction that he is singularly unqualified to lead the Environmental  Protection Agency at this moment. That is Scott Pruitt.   I do not believe Scott Pruitt will lead this Agency in a way that  upholds this critical mission in our country. Again, I don't care if  you are in a so-called red State or so-called blue State, I don't care  what your background is, your religion, your race, if you are living in  an environment that is toxic--the air, the water--it is undermining  your ability to enjoy the liberty and the freedom and justice of our  country.   So if you look at this individual, Scott Pruitt, if you look at his  track record, you will see that his actual work has undermined the  mission of the Agency that he is now nominated to lead.   At his confirmation hearing, Scott Pruitt stated, as attorney general  for the State of Oklahoma, he was responsible for protecting the  welfare of Oklahoma citizens. This was his statement. Yet during his 6  years as attorney general, Scott Pruitt spent his time doing the  bidding of the polluters, and filing or joining 14 lawsuits against the  EPA's effort to clean up the air and water of a State, challenging  water and clean air rules.   On top of this, on top of his track record, not for doing things to  improve the quality of the air and water but doing things consistently  to fight the EPA--on top of this, on one of the largest issues going on  with our planet right now, Mr. Pruitt says clearly that he denies the  science and the reality of climate change.   So many in his own community who have come to this building to give  their voice and their facts believe this person being nominated has a  nonexistent record in Oklahoma when it comes to protecting the  environment and that he actually aided and abetted many of the people  who were doing some of the worst harm to the water and to the air.   Mr. Pruitt seems to say this is a philosophical thing; that he is a  Federalist. What amazed me, as I dealt with Mr. Pruitt, engaged with  him during the hearings, is it exposed the fact that he not only tried  to get the Federal Government to stop acting to clean up the air and  water and constrain the avaristic polluting of these industries, but he  actually worked to make sure the State government didn't have the power  to do it as well, as I will show momentarily.   But here is somebody who is not into philosophy. The driving force is  his picking polluters over people. Mr. Pruitt also has serious  conflicts of interest. What is amazing to me is that he has stonewalled  the Senate, claiming to us that all of the emails from his agency that  should be open--listen, we went through a whole Presidential campaign  with all of this talk about email. How ironic is it that we are now  putting someone up for EPA Administrator who suddenly is not allowing  open public record requests to view his emails.   This is hiding, as Senator Whitehouse has gone through--not allowing  the public to see what is their right to see--the emails and  communications he has had with polluting industries, as well as other  organizations plowing money into his campaign and others. Not only has  he denied us access to that, but he has used lies that this could not  be produced.   Well, we have just had a judge in Oklahoma, contrary to what he said,  force the viewing of these emails. This is really important. Here is a  judge who literally calls his failure to release the emails an abject  failure, that not releasing these emails in accordance to the public  information laws of the State--the judge called it an ``abject  failure'' to not produce this information and called it ``unreasonable  under the law''; those are the quotes--and ordered him to release these  thousands of emails, to release the first tranche on Tuesday.   These are records pertaining to communications with Devon Energy,  Peabody Coal, and other organizations. These should be released on  Tuesday. We are going to see a lot in these emails.   Then he was ordered to release another tranche to organizations like  ALEC, the American Legislative Exchange Council that supports a  tremendous amount of partisan policy, the  [[Page S1288]]  State Policy Network, and other organizations. Those will be released  in 10 days.   By the way, the requests for those go back to April 27, 2016. So one  thing I have to say that I object to--and actually I am shocked and  appalled that, suddenly, when you have a judge now forcing the release  of these emails, which are going to give us transparency, which are  going to answer the questions many of us have been asking about the  conflicts he might have and how he used or potentially abused his power  working in collusion with private industry, we can now see all of this  plainly. But suddenly, now, this vote on Mr. Pruitt has been scheduled  for tomorrow. Why not wait to let the Senators who have been asking for  these emails for months--now that we are finally getting them, why are  we now rushing a vote before we get to analyze his record?   So for these reasons--his lack of qualifications, his demonstration  of working against the mission of the Agency, his denial of something  as important and significant and planetarily consequential as climate  change, his clear demonstration of his work on behalf of polluting  industries, and the potential for serious conflicts of interest--we  should not only oppose him, but at the very least what we should be  asking is to have the vote postponed until the transparency that has  been requested by Senators is achieved.   Any of these deficiencies individually should have us move the vote  or vote against, but let me take some of these issues now. Let me look  right now at the issue of climate change and his positions. The EPA is  the most important Agency in the United States in the fight against  climate change. Through its authority under the Clean Air Act, the EPA  is tasked with regulating harmful air pollutants, including carbon  dioxide.   I do not believe that Scott Pruitt will adhere to this EPA mandate.  It is an EPA mandate that he has shown a disregard for that he will be  tasked with enforcing. He not only has no record of enforcing it, but  even believing in the harm that these pollutants can cause. He has  openly questioned the need for climate change action on numerous  occasions. He is on the record for pondering whether climate change is  even happening at all.   Less than a year ago, he told a public audience the debate about  climate change is just that, a debate. He has said that climate change  is a religious belief and a political bumper sticker. Scott Pruitt  appeared to walk back that language on climate denial during his  confirmation hearing before the committee of jurisdiction, the  Environment and Public Works Committee, last month. He claims that  science tells us that the climate is changing, and human activity in  some manner impacts climate change. The human ability to measure with  precision the extent of that impact is subject to continuous debate and  dialogue, as well it should be.   Well, I am happy to see that he is moving. But here Mr. Pruitt now is  taking a different tactic. He is acknowledging that our climate is  changing, without accepting the scientific consensus that human  activity is the primary cause. But this seemingly softer language is  actually a damaging tactic and in many ways is just as damaging as  outright climate denial.   This is a hallmark of the new strategy: Hey, let's admit the climate  is changing, but let's try to cast doubt on whether human activity is  doing it. The language may be different, but the implication is the  same: If we don't know how much human activity contributes to climate  change, hey, then we don't need to do anything about the crisis.   This reminds me of Big Tobacco. There were these big tobacco  scientists who made their living insisting that the link between  cigarettes and lung cancer was uncertain. To cast doubt on it was their  strategy--that link between lung cancer and smoking. This is a strategy  we have seen before, again and again and again. Even though there is a  consensus of science about smoking--or in the case of climate change-- cast doubt, cast doubt. That is what Scott Pruitt does; he is a  merchant of doubt when it comes to climate change.   He is attempting to sow uncertainty where there is, in fact,  considerable certainty. As a result, he is deliberately undermining and  misrepresenting the reality of the case. This is the person we want to  put--who is intended by the President to be put at the head of the  Environmental Protection Agency, someone who is a merchant of doubt.   Well, let me just go through the climate change evidence. Let's be  clear about the facts. There are extraordinary indicators to provide  strong evidence not just for climate change but for rapid, human-caused  climate change. Atmospheric carbon dioxide now is higher than at any  point in recorded history; 15 of the 16 warmest years on record have  occurred since 2001; the pace of global sea level rise has doubled in  the last decade; surface ocean acidity has increased by 30 percent  since the beginning of the industrial revolution.   Those are dramatic changes in what is happening to our oceans. The  evidence of this is global, from the bleaching of reefs to the killing  of the biomass, to the extinction of species.   Arctic sea ice is declining by over 13 percent per decade. Just  yesterday, scientists published a large research synthesis that has  detected a decline in the amount of dissolved oxygen in oceans around  the world, a long-predicted result of climate change that is expected  to have severe consequences for the marine ecosystem and fisheries.   Some 97 percent of the actively published climate scientists agree  that these climate change trends--I would say crises--are extremely  likely due to human activity. Scientists this month released an  estimate that human activity is causing the climate to change 170 times  faster than natural forces alone would cause.   I just sat with an incredible author who wrote ``The Sixth  Extinction,'' a book that documents the rapidity with which we are now  in a period of global climatic extinction, with species disappearing  from the planet Earth at a speed that she compared, in the larger  perspective of time, to the impact of a massive asteroid that was one  of the major extinction periods. This is happening rapidly, like no  period before in history, except that of massive climactic events like  the asteroid hitting Earth. This is a crisis. The crisis is already  being felt in terms of human impacts. Right now, we know that,  unabated, these climate trends will continue to have impacts, and they  will grow more devastating for our planet, especially for our children  and our grandchildren.   By 2045, some east coast cities could flood three times a week. Scott  Pruitt's home State may not have to worry about this, but New Jersey, a  coastal State--we now have everyone from people in the military to  businesses, to leaders in government, all realizing that this is going  to have a serious effect on our State and we have to start preparing  now to deal with that crisis.   Weather patterns are going to become more erratic. Hurricanes and  other major storms in the North Atlantic will become stronger and more  intense. Drought and heat waves will increase in parts of Arizona,  California, Texas, and, yes, even Oklahoma could exceed 100 degrees for  over 120 days a year. The U.S. crop yields will drop significantly.  Estimates suggest that under a business-as-usual scenario, by 2100,  wheat yields could drop 20 percent, maize by 40 percent, soybeans 40  percent, causing global spikes in food prices.   The rising seas, with more intense storms and worsening drought,  could create climate refugees. In fact, we are seeing climate refugees  already form small island states. The United States is already facing  the reality, with many of these people from around the globe, that  several communities in low-lying coastal areas in Alaska and Louisiana  are in the process of relocating to higher ground. It is happening  right now, where you are seeing evacuations from coastal areas that are  no longer habitable.   Regarding climate refugees, I would like to quote Pope Francis. He  said:         Many of the poor live in areas particularly affected by the       phenomenon related to warming, and their means of subsistence       are largely dependent on natural reserves and ecosystem       services such as agriculture, fishing and forestry. They have       no other financial activities or resources which can enable       them to adapt to climate change or to face natural disasters.       Their access to social services and protection is very       limited.   [[Page S1289]]     The Pope continues:         There has been a tragic rise in the number of migrants       seeking to flee from growing poverty caused by environmental       degradation. They are not recognized by international       conventions as refugees; they bear the loss of the lives they       have left behind, without enjoying the legal protection       whatsoever. Sadly, there is widespread indifference to their       suffering, which is even now taking place throughout our       world.    All of this--and perhaps lastly--it is this global insecurity that  will grow. Major climate events like drought and floods have clearly  been linked to violent conflicts around the globe. Climate extremes are  worsening tensions in some parts of the world. There is a widespread  international scientific agreement on the scope of this problem and  international urgency about doing something about it.   The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has unequivocally  concluded that there is a clear human influence on the climate system.  To keep global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius,  the IPCC estimates that we need to reduce emissions by 40 to 70 percent  by 2050, compared to the 2010 levels. Warming beyond this level, 2  degrees Celsius, is often cited as that threshold.   Warming beyond this level will result in surface temperatures above  anything our planet has experienced in the last 100,000 years. Given  current emissions scenarios, keeping temperature increases below this  2-degree threshold will be extremely challenging, but this only  underscores the urgent need for rapid and dramatic emissions  reductions.   Unsurprisingly, given these numbers, there is also an international  agreement on the need for action. We are seeing people come together  and make strong commitments. In 2015, 195 countries adopted the first- ever binding global climate change agreement in Paris. The national  commitments established in the Paris Agreement would put us on a  trajectory to limit warming to 2.7 degrees Celsius--not enough of a  limit, but it is a start. It is a start and a remarkable moment in  planetary cooperation.   There is no question that given planetary cooperation, there is no  question that given a consensus of scientists, there is no question  that, given the factual urgencies being created by climate change,  Scott Pruitt is on the wrong side of history in refusing to acknowledge  global scientific and political consensus on climate change and the  urgency that we need to act. We are potentially going to put someone  who stands against this global consensus in charge of the EPA.   Much of the opposition to climate action in our country is motivated  by false narratives about economic costs--people who are selling this  idea that somehow doing the responsible thing is going to hurt our  economy. The idea that addressing climate change could actually make us  less of a wealthy nation is propaganda, and it is propaganda that is  being pushed by the people who are doing significant amounts of the  polluting, the people whom Scott Pruitt has spent time advocating on  behalf of.   Last year, Mr. Pruitt parroted the argument that fighting climate  change is bad for the economy. He parroted that on an Oklahoma radio  station, arguing that climate action is ``hurting our ability to  manufacture, to grow our economy, it's hurting the fossil fuel  industry, it's an assault, and it's all done outside of the  Constitution and the law, which makes it even more egregious.''   That is a strong statement. Besides the fact that addressing climate  change is very much within the law, this economic devastation narrative  is simply patently false. Just last month, a renowned climate economist  who had long argued that emissions reductions would damage economic  growth actually changed his mind after running a more accurate analysis  of carbon dioxide's impact on temperature.   In fact, responding to climate change will help grow new parts of our  economy. Last year, nearly half a million Americans were employed in  whole or in part by the solar energy and wind energy industries. Wind  energy jobs grew by 32 percent in 2016, and solar jobs grew by 25  percent. Solar jobs, in fact, have tripled since 2010. We should be  focusing on actively expanding our promising clean energy sector.  Frankly, we should be racing, as the great Nation of innovation that we  are, to lead in these areas and not let our competitors get there  first. We should be doing the breakthroughs, making the investments,  growing the jobs.   Scott Pruitt is one of the last stand-offs. In fact, the GOP--the  Republican Party--is the only major political party in the developed  world that refuses to acknowledge that climate change poses a problem.  All of our other allies--their right parties, their left parties; you  name it--all the other major political parties on the planet Earth  recognize that this is a problem, but it is unconscionable that we,  here in America, are still pushing a narrative that is contrary to the  global consensus and the consensus of science, that denies the reality  of human-caused climate change and the urgent need for action.   Recent polling says that nearly 8 out of 10 registered voters--people  on the right and the left, especially with our millennial generation-- support regulating carbon dioxide as a pollutant. Seven out of 10  registered voters support setting strict carbon dioxide limits on coal- fired powerplants, a core aspect of the Clean Power Plan that Scott  Pruitt and the Trump administration have vowed to repeal. Seven out of  10 registered voters think the United States should participate in the  Paris Agreement, another critical moment where the planet was coming  together in cooperation. Seven out of 10 voters agree that we should be  a part of the global movement to cooperate on dealing with climate  change.   Nothing in Scott Pruitt's record as Oklahoma attorney general  suggests he will uphold Americans' desire for climate action. A public  servant who abides by the wishes of polluting industries, instead of  the wishes of the American people, instead of the real tangible health  challenges in their own State--someone who is standing with the  industries and contrary to people suffering in their own State--has not  earned the right to be our Administrator of the EPA.   Look at his record in Oklahoma. Well, let's just start with air  pollution. At his confirmation hearing, I asked Scott Pruitt if he knew  how many children in his State had asthma. He did not know. So I  informed him. According to the data published by the American Lung  Association, more than 111,000 children in Oklahoma--more than 10  percent of all the children in Oklahoma, so more than 1 out of every 10  children in Oklahoma--has asthma. This is one of the highest State  asthma rates in the Nation. This is a crisis.   As former mayor of Newark, I know the devastating impact that asthma  has on parents and children. This is the number one health-related  reason why kids miss school not only in my city, not only around my  State--it is still one of the top reasons, if not the top--but in our  Nation.   I have talked to parents and teachers about this crisis, about kids  who are struggling to breathe, children rushed to emergency rooms,  children missing school. This is literally undermining kids' ability to  succeed in school and to get the benefits of life from academic  success.   In a State where more than 1 out of every 10 kids--a State where more  than 10 percent of your children--have asthma, clean air should be an  urgency.   So what did Scott Pruitt do, as it relates to air pollution? Well, he  actually took every major possible opportunity to help the polluters,  joining with them to block the EPA from taking action to clean up the  air and protect the children in his State.   When I say ``joining with them,'' and that is not a hyperbolic  exaggeration. Scott Pruitt sent a letter to the Environmental  Protection Agency in 2011, accusing Federal regulators of grossly  overestimating the amount of air pollution that natural gas companies  were releasing from well sites in Oklahoma. The letter was sent to the  EPA on Mr. Pruitt's official attorney general letterhead. So we might  assume its contents represented the State's official stance on what was  best for the welfare of Oklahoma families and children because, as he  testified, his job was to represent what was best for the welfare of  Oklahoma's families and children.   This is what he said in his testimony here in the Senate. This is  what he said. That was his job. So he is writing a letter, challenging  the EPA, saying they grossly overestimated the amount  [[Page S1290]]  of air pollution that natural gas companies were releasing.   Well, the problem is that we would be wrong if we had thought that  this was something that his office came up with. No, what Mr. Pruitt  did was actually take a letter written by lobbyists at Devon Energy,  one of the State's largest oil and gas companies, change maybe a few  words--maybe three, maybe four--and, basically, took these words, took  off their letterhead, put the same letter on his letterhead, and passed  it along to the EPA.   Remember, Devon Energy is one of those organizations that we want the  emails from, back and forth between his office.   Now, did he go out from his position and do research on air quality?  Did he interview families with asthma? Did he test air quality? How did  he come up with his conclusions that what the EPA was doing was wrong?   Well, clearly he couldn't write his own letters. He just took the  information from Devon Energy, put it on his letterhead, and sent it  off. He was doing the bidding of one of the people, one of the  companies that was undermining the air quality for the 1 out of 10  children that have asthma.   So we, as U.S. Senators, who believe in thorough vetting--we hear a  lot about intense vetting for refugees; I am a guy who just wants a  thorough vetting for nominees--asked for his communications, using  public FOIA, or the Freedom of Information Act. What are your  communications with this company that seems to be writing your letters  for you?   What he said to us was--he stonewalled: I can't get those things to  you.   Well, thank God a judge in Oklahoma has now ordered him to release  it, calling a failure to do so an abject failure.   Well, great, we are going to see the letters to understand what kind  of cooperation or even collusion he had with these companies, but we  are going to see them too late because the vote is tomorrow. We are  going to get that information a day, 2 days, a few days too late.   So here is someone who says his job, as attorney general, was to  represent the welfare of children and families. Here we have a State  with a crisis in air quality, a crisis in asthma, and where the EPA is  working to do something about air quality in the State, and he is  coming to conclusions that we don't know if they are his or not, but we  know there are industries that do not want to change their practices at  all and want to continue to pollute the air.   Whose side is Scott Pruitt on--the side of the children in his State,  1 out of every 10 who has asthma, or of Devon Energy? And we want to  put him in charge of the EPA, without even having a thorough  understanding of what his relationship was with these companies.   Well, my colleague did his own exhaustive research about the campaign  funding he had received and more support from companies like this, and  it creates an implication. Well, let's get to the bottom of what is  happening. Let's see the emails before we vote. What do these say to  these corporations?   I asked him: He allowed polluting companies to write emails to the  EPA on his letterhead; did he let any children with asthma or their  parents write letters that he then just put on his letterhead--people  who were suffering from the poor air quality?   Later, the director of government relations at Devon Energy emailed  Mr. Pruitt's office--this, we do know--to express gratitude to the  attorney general for sending the letter.   Beyond this note of thanks, there were other clear benefits of this  type of behavior for Mr. Pruitt. Energy industry lobbyists and  executives worked tirelessly to help Mr. Pruitt raise his profile as  president of the Republican Attorneys General Association. As president  of this nationwide group, Mr. Pruitt set up something called the Rule  of Law Defense Fund, a super PAC that allowed corporations benefiting  from the actions of Mr. Pruitt and other Republican attorneys general  to make unlimited and anonymous donations. This super PAC raised $16  million in essentially untraceable fundraising in 2014 alone.   Companies were partnering with him to fight the EPA in its efforts to  fight for cleaner air in a State with children struggling from  widespread asthma challenges. This would be bad enough, but this in  many ways is only the beginning of Mr. Pruitt's collaborations with air  polluting corporations. Scott Pruitt filed two lawsuits challenging the  EPA mercury and air toxics standards.    So the EPA is working to clean up mercury. He filed lawsuits against  the EPA to stop them. These were the first Federal standards to require  powerplants to limit their emissions of such toxic air pollutants. The  EPA's final rule set standards for known hazardous air pollutants  emitted by coal- and oil-fired powerplants above a certain generating  capacity.   This rule sought to limit Americans' exposure to airborne toxics like  mercury. Mercury in the air settles on the surfaces of water and land  where rain washes it further into surface water. Once in the water,  mercury is converted to a toxic chemical called methylmercury, and this  accumulates in increasing levels up the aquatic food chain. It is one  of the reasons that doctors often will advise pregnant women not to eat  certain fish because of the high mercury content. Why is there a high  mercury content in some of those fish? This is the reason: mercury  spewing out into our air, coming down and settling on land and water,  getting into our waterways, and working its way up the aquatic chain,  ultimately getting into our food.   Humans, especially young children and pregnant women, are vulnerable  to mercury exposure from consuming contaminated fish or shellfish. This  is a tragedy. Over 400,000 newborns are affected by mercury pollution  each year in the United States--400,000 of our children, the greatest  hope for our country, 400,000 children affected by mercury pollution  each year in the United States.   What does mercury exposure do? It damages the brain, heart, kidneys,  lungs, and it damages the immune system of people of all ages but,  again, particularly vulnerable populations. It is a horrific toxin.  This is not an argument. It is scientifically clear that the largest  source of mercury air emissions are our power companies. It doesn't  mean we want to shut the powerplants down; it doesn't mean we want to  stop them. We want to take measures to remove the mercury emissions.   So what happened in the State of Oklahoma to hundreds of thousands of  our children? What happened in the State of Oklahoma? The man who was  on the job--he told the U.S. Senate that his job was protecting the  welfare of the people. What Mr. Pruitt did is attack the EPA. He said  that they lacked the legal authority to regulate powerplant mercury  emissions and other hazardous pollutants under the mercury and air  toxics standards. He did not do this once; he did it twice. When the  EPA moved under the mandate they had, he tried to stop them twice.   He went even further than that because he apparently doesn't even  believe that mercury is toxic to humans. In his challenge to the EPA's  mercury rule, this is what he wrote: ``The record does not support the  EPA's findings that mercury . . . pose[s] public health hazards.''   Reading this was astonishing to me. This was written by someone whom  we want to put in charge of the Environmental Protection Agency? I am  sure that even his family was told not to eat certain fish because of  mercury. It is astonishing to me that he would say that ``the record  does not support the EPA's findings that mercury . . . pose[s] public  health hazards.''   Mercury is a scientifically proven, well documented, deadly  neurotoxin, and the person we are about to elevate to head the  Environmental Protection Agency when he had the chance to fight to  protect people from mercury not only fought to stop efforts to restrain  mercury being put into the air and into our water, he went as far as to  say: Hey, this stuff isn't so bad.   While he was focused on attacking these mercury standards and denying  its status as a toxic metal, the number of lakes in Oklahoma with  mercury-related fish consumption advisories has doubled since 2010.  Think about this. The attorney general, in charge of protecting people,  has the Federal EPA saying: Hey, you have a problem here. Let's address  it. The mercury levels in your lakes have doubled since 2010. The  scientists and experts in your State are  [[Page S1291]]  releasing advisories to your community that state: Don't eat the fish  from Oklahoma's lakes. His response is to fight against efforts to  clean that up in support of those industries, as we are finding out,  that are pumping money into his super PAC.   If I lived in a community and I lived next to a river that had deadly  toxins in it--I have spent my entire professional career as a city  councilman, as a mayor, and now here to fight to clean the Passaic  River. I swore an oath to defend people. I am fighting for them.   What did Pruitt do when he had a shot to be there for the people who  were living by lakes that literally had a doubling of the advisories  about fish consumption? What did he do? Did he stand for the people or  the polluters? What did he do? It is clear what he did. He stood with  the polluters.   But there is more. Scott Pruitt filed a lawsuit challenging EPA's  2015 national ambient air quality standards for ozone. The Clean Air  Act required the EPA to set national ambient air quality standards for  air pollutants considered harmful to the public health and the  environment.   Under this authority in 2015, the EPA strengthened the standards for  ground-level ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion, based on  substantial scientific evidence about ozone levels on health. This  updated ozone standard improved public health protections, particularly  for children, older adults, and people who suffer from lung diseases  like asthma. The new standard will prevent hundreds of thousands of  asthma attacks. This is not rhetoric; this is scientifically based. The  reductions will save hundreds of thousands of asthma attacks.   As already stated, Oklahomans have some of the highest incidence of  asthma in our country. But like the mercury contamination in the lakes,  this excessive asthma rate did not stop Scott Pruitt from trying to  block EPA from regulating harmful air pollutants under the national  ambient air quality standards. So this is Scott Pruitt.   The list goes on and on and on, of his attacks on the environment, of  his doing the bidding of the polluting corporations, of literally  taking his letterhead and taking their letters and putting them on his  letterhead and using that, not his own research, not his own interviews  with scientists, not his work connecting to people with asthma--which,  unfortunately, in his State with one of the highest asthma rates isn't  hard to find--not talking to the people who were in his State releasing  advisories not to eat the fish because of increased mercury content.  What he did was the bidding of the polluting industries, and he sued  the EPA again and again and again and again and again.   The EPA estimated in 2015 on their regional haze rule--this is the  Agency he is about to take over--that implementing the rule would  prevent 1,600 premature deaths, 2,200 nonfatal heart attacks, 960  hospital admissions, and over 1 million lost schooldays and workdays.  That is the EPA's estimate on one rule, the regional haze rule.   Think about that. He is going to lead an Agency where the scientists  in that Agency are going to be telling him: Hey, this rule that you  fought against is going to save lives. What is his response going to  be?   Can we as Americans trust that he is going to run an Agency where he  relies on science or is he going to run an Agency where he relies on  polluting industries to give him advice on what he should do? If he  relies on them, there will be 1,600 more premature deaths, 2,200  nonfatal heart attacks, 960 more hospitalizations. We will suffer.  People will suffer.   Scott Pruitt also filed a lawsuit challenging the EPA cross-state air  pollution rule. This rule tightens limits on the amount of sulfur  dioxide and nitrogen oxide pollution that powerplants in 28 States in  the eastern United States are allowed to emit. Once in the air, this  pollution drifts across state borders, meaning that States that had no  role in contributing to the pollution suffer the repercussions. It is  this type of interstate pollution that EPA is especially well  positioned to address.   Further solidifying his stance as a staunch opponent of climate  action, he filed four lawsuits. He filed four lawsuits challenging the  EPA Clean Power Plan. He also sued the EPA to challenge the Clean Air  Act 111(b) standards for carbon dioxide emissions from new powerplants.  And in all those lawsuits except one, Scott Pruitt joined with the  polluting companies that were also suing the EPA.   So amidst all this in the confirmation hearing, I asked Scott Pruitt,  given all those lawsuits he had filed with the polluters against the  EPA to block the EPA from reducing air pollution--he had even filed one  lawsuit on behalf--he literally was advocating for polluting industries  to the point where he was even using their letter on his letterhead to  make his point. So my question was, in all this fighting against the  EPA, all of this, using their words, using their facts, not the  scientists in your community, not the scientists telling you about the  mercury in the lakes and the fish that you shouldn't eat and one of the  highest asthma rates in the Nation, I asked him: Have you ever filed at  least one lawsuit on behalf of those 111,000 children in your State  with asthma? Have you filed one lawsuit on their behalf to try to  reduce the air pollution and help those kids? Have you ever filed one  lawsuit as attorney general of the State? And his answer was no.   Had he ever tried as Oklahoma attorney general to take any action-- any action to help those children who struggle with asthma? What reason  did Mr. Pruitt give for failing to even try? Mr. Pruitt stated that he  lacked the statutory authority to file that type of legal action.   Let's think about that for a minute. Again, it doesn't take a law  degree to understand the problems with that statement. You see, Scott  Pruitt was more aggressive than any other attorney general in our  country's history in suing the EPA, often using completely novel  theories in court that lost--novel theories that lost. He was trying to  find all kinds of ways on behalf of polluting industries to stop the  EPA and thought of using creative legal approaches for doing it. Yet,  when it came to the children in his State, 111,000 children suffering  from asthma, one of the highest rates in our country, could he think of  one novel thing to do on their behalf? Did he file one lawsuit to try  to help those children? No, he claimed he lacked the legal authority.   What Scott Pruitt lacked was not legal authority. What I believe he  lacked was any interest in trying to truly help those kids, to stand up  for people against polluters. Those sick children were not powerful.  They didn't have millions of dollars for a super PAC. They couldn't  make campaign contributions. It seems, when it comes to their advocacy,  that they were not important enough for him to even try.   When Mr. Pruitt was questioned by a reporter on his practice of  letting polluting companies write letters challenging EPA regulations,  which he then copied onto his official attorney general letterhead and  he then sent, this is what Scott Pruitt said. This is his defense for  letting polluting companies write letters that he put on his letterhead  and then sent off to the EPA, advocating for them: ``That is actually  called representative government in my view of the world.''   That is, simply, not an acceptable world view for the head of the  Environmental Protection Agency. His view of representative government  isn't any one of those 111,000 children. His idea of representative  government isn't a family living next to a lake from where they are  advised not to eat the fish anymore. His idea of representative  government isn't pregnant mothers who are worried about eating fish  that are caught in the State. His idea of representative government is  giving voice to the polluters--to the powerful, money-laden interests-- and not to those of the people.   If Scott Pruitt wants to be the EPA Administrator, we as Americans  should insist that we have transparency into what he did in his work  beforehand--what he did on air quality, which I just went through. But  the truth of the matter is that it is the same story for water  pollution in the State, and it is the same story for other health and  safety issues that the EPA was doing.   I conclude by saying that it is unfortunate that, at a time when we  are finally going to get transparency into Scott Pruitt and what he has  been doing as attorney general, after his stonewalling week after week,  month after month, saying he wasn't going to release these records--by  the way, the  [[Page S1292]]  person in charge of enforcing Oklahoma's Freedom of Information Act is  the attorney general. So it is kind of ironic that the attorney general  was refusing to enforce them himself--the laws that public officials  have to abide by in the State. It finally took a judge to order him to  release that transparency. Now we are going to get these letters and  see more about his connections to polluting companies--what kind of  potential collusion went on and what conversations went on. Was he  fundraising even from his official capacity? What was happening?   Alone, that is unfortunate that we are not, at least, postponing this  vote until we get transparency in the Senate. Our role, as spelled out  by the Constitution, is to advise and consent the President on these  choices, and we are about to vote on somebody on whom we don't have  full transparency to give advice.   The final point is that here is someone who is going to be the head  of an agency that was started under the Nixon administration that is  focused on protecting the health and safety of Americans, and he has  demonstrated in no way his commitment to doing that--that he is putting  people first. More than that, he has the ability to pull back these  regulations that he himself has been fighting and that the scientists  are saying will literally save lives.   It is not just what he will do. It is what he won't do in that job  that is so threatening and so potentially devastating to families and  communities like the one he is coming from. I cannot support someone  who denies climate change, someone who clearly prioritizes polluting  companies over people, someone who has spent his career in not  protecting folks but in fighting the EPA.   I end where I began, with this Nation's ideals of life, liberty, and  the pursuit of happiness. I would hope that an EPA Administrator,  regardless of party, would understand the sanctity of those ideals and  those aspirations. This person is clearly, clearly not someone who will  support the common good but narrow interests to the detriment of, not  just of his State, not just of our United States, but to the detriment  of our children's future and of the future of the very planet.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the Law  Enforcement Officers' Equity Act. This good-government bill will  provide Federal law enforcement officers with the Federal benefits they  deserve for their service. I thank Senator Rob Portman for being an  original cosponsor of this bill.   There is perhaps no harder job in the United States than that of law  enforcement officers. Each day, brave men and women work under  tremendously stressful conditions to keep our communities safe. From  apprehending violent criminals to arresting drug kingpins, these brave  men and women in uniform put their lives on the line for a higher  cause. We owe them our sincerest gratitude for their service.   Due to the high level of training required for their job and the  ever-present danger in their profession, Congress determined that  Federal law enforcement officers should receive higher salaries and  enhanced benefits compared to other Federal employees. Unfortunately,  due to a technical error,  [[Page S1307]]  nearly 30,000 Federal law enforcement officers classified as G5-0083  police officers do not receive enhanced benefits under the United  States Code. As a result, certain officers who work for Federal  agencies--such as the Department of Defense, Department of Veterans  Affairs, Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Postal Service, U.S.  Mint, National Institute of Health and many more--receive lower  pensions as compared to other law enforcement officers with similar  responsibilities. It makes no sense that postal police officers or any  other Federal law enforcement officers receive less benefits even  though they have the similar duties and functions as other law  enforcement officers.   The Law Enforcement Officers' Equity Act would fill in this gap in  the law and expand the number of Federal law enforcement officers who  can receive benefits. The bill would expand the definition of ``law  enforcement officer'' for retirement purposes to include all Federal  law enforcement officers. The change would grant law enforcement  officer status to the following individuals: employees who are  authorized to carry a firearm and whose duties include the  investigation or apprehension of suspected criminals; employees of the  Internal Revenue Service whose duties are primarily the collection of  delinquent taxes and securing delinquent returns; employees of the U.S  Postal Inspection Service; and employees of the Department of Veterans  Affairs who are Department police offices. These officers face the same  risks and challenges as the men and women currently classified properly  under Federal law as law   The Law Enforcement Officers' Equity Act would allow incumbent law  enforcement officers' Federal service--after the enactment of the act-- to be considered service performed as a law enforcement officer for  retirement purposes.   This legislation has the support of law enforcement groups, including  the Fraternal Order of police, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers'  Association, and the Law Enforcement Action Network.   Fundamental fairness demands that we close this loophole in Federal  law and give all Federal law enforcement officers the retirement  benefits they deserve-Trask my colleagues to support the Law  Enforcement Officers' Equity Act, and I urge its speedy passage.                                  ______                                         By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mr. Paul):   S. 429.
