 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 660.    I rise in strong support, but I do not take any pleasure in the  events that have made this process necessary. I rise in strong support  of the resolution, but I do so with an understanding that the task  before us is a solemn one.   How each Member of this Chamber approaches the vote this morning, and  the days and weeks ahead, may be the most important service as Members  of Congress we will ever pay to the country and Constitution that we  all love and have pledged to defend.   For the past several weeks, the Intelligence Committee, the Oversight  and Reform Committee, and the Foreign Affairs Committee have engaged in  an intensive investigation. That work, which has been conducted with  equal opportunities for both parties to question witnesses, has added a  great deal to our understanding of the President's conduct, as evident  in the July 25 call record and the events that both preceded and  followed that call.   That work has necessarily occurred behind closed doors because we  have had the task of finding the facts ourselves, without the benefit  of the investigation that the Justice Department declined to undertake.   Despite attempts to obstruct, we have interviewed numerous witnesses  who have provided important testimony about the efforts to secure  political favors from Ukraine. We have reviewed text messages among key  players which show how securing political investigations was placed at  the forefront of our foreign policy toward Ukraine.   This resolution sets the stage for the next phase of our  investigation, one in which the American people will have the  opportunity to hear from the witnesses firsthand.   We will continue to conduct this inquiry with the seriousness of  purpose that our task deserves, because it is our duty and because no  one is above the law.   Madam Speaker, I urge passage of the resolution.
