 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  4924, the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 Reform Act.   This bill would bring much-needed reforms to the process available to  congressional employees for filing workplace complaints and ensure a  more equitable and transparent process.   Under the new process, employees who file a complaint would have the  choice to enter into mediation instead of being required to do so, as  is currently the case. Employees should not be forced into mandatory  mediation, especially with an employer against whom they have raised  allegations of sexual harassment or other types of discrimination. This  bill also eliminates the thirty-day ``cooling off'' period currently  mandated by the CAA.   Filing a workplace complaint can be harrowing for employees, and  having no choice but to face the employer or colleague against whom  they have filed the complaint may deter employees from going through  with it. That is why the protections in this bill from retaliation by  the employing office for requesting remote work or paid leave by an  employee who has a filed a complaint are so important.   Unpaid interns, fellows, and detailees in Congressional offices  should not be more vulnerable to workplace harassment and  discrimination than their congressional staff colleagues. This bill  would extend coverage of the rights and protections established under  the CAA to these groups.   The bill also requires that a climate survey be conducted of all  offices covered by the CAA, each Congress, regarding the workplace  environment, including sexual harassment. Collecting information,  anonymously, from staff will help us determine whether the reforms we  hope in this bill are serving their purpose or if modifications are  needed.   H.R. 4924 is the culmination of bipartisan work on the part of House  Administration Committee Chairman Harper and Ranking Member Brady, and  my fellow members on the Committee, as well as the leadership of my  colleague Rep. Jackie Speier, who has championed the issue of fighting  sexual harassment on the Hill. I want to thank them all for working  collaboratively on this legislation.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Harper) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4924.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
