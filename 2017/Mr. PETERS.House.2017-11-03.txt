 Mr. Speaker, my vote was not recorded on rollcall No. 606  on H.R. 3922--The Community Health and Medical Professionals Improve  Our Nation Act due to my attendance at the Vatican's Health of People,  Health of Planet and Our Responsibility: Climate Change, Air Pollution  and Health. I intended to vote ``aye.''
