 Mr. President, the Toomey amendment will withhold  critical funding from cities, counties, and States whose police  departments refuse to deploy their police officers as immigration  agents for the Federal Government.   Listen to what the two chiefs of police in Storm Lake and  Marshalltown, IA, wrote last week to the Des Moines Register:         Most significant, the proposed bill would diminish the       trust that keeps our cities safe in the first place. We       depend on residents, including immigrants, to come to us when       they see something suspicious or potentially criminal. If       they hear of a looming ``crackdown'' that could affect their       families and friends, they are less likely to come [forward]       to report and prevent actual crimes.    This is from Iowa chiefs of police in the Midwest. It is common  sense.   My superintendent in Chicago, Eddie Johnson, said:         I've said it before and I'll say it again. Undocumented       immigrants are not driving violence in Chicago. That's why I       want our officers focused on community policing and not       trying to be immigration police.    Vote for our men and women in uniform. Vote against the Toomey  amendment.
