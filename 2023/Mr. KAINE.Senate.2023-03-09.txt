 Madam President, this bill authorizes additions to two  existing wilderness areas within the George Washington National Forest  in Bath County, VA. This text represents years of negotiation and  compromise among Virginia stakeholders who rely on the GW Forest.   In many parts of America, Federal land management is controversial.  Some may view these lands as repositories for timber, energy, or  minerals. Others may enjoy using recreational trails through them.  Others may believe that they should be left undisturbed. The truth, of  course, is that all of these uses are important; the conflict lies in  deciding which lands are best suited to which purposes.   In the lead-up to the latest multiyear GW Forest Management Plan,  various forest users came together to see if they could find reasonable  compromises that would avoid years of unproductive disagreement and  litigation. This group, known as the George  [[Page S747]]  Washington National Forest Stakeholder Collaborative, ultimately  succeeded and made joint recommendations to the U.S. Forest Service for  forest management and protection. Preservation advocates consented to  timber harvesting and other active forest restoration and management in  certain areas, while forest products interests consented to wilderness  and light management in other areas. Following this fruitful  collaboration, the Forest Service convened the Lower Cowpasture  Restoration and Management Project, bringing together the collaborative  and other stakeholders to help develop management activities on this  particular part of GW Forest in Bath County. Everyone got some of what  they wanted, and everyone gave some ground.   The collaborative has now come together to support the wilderness  additions in this bill, which designates 4,600 acres to be added to the  Rich Hole Wilderness Area and 1,000 acres to be added to the Rough  Mountain Wilderness Area. I am proud to once again partner with Senator  Mark Warner and follow the path blazed by Senator John Warner and  Representative Rick Boucher, who led the original Virginia Wilderness  Act in 1984. I am also proud that this bill has passed the Senate in  previous Congresses, including by unanimous consent. I will be pushing  to include this bill as part of the 2023 farm bill, and I hope that we  can bring this effort to the finish line soon.   Taking care of our Nation's public lands is good for the environment  and good for the economy. Land disputes may often be contentious, but  these efforts in the GW Forest show they don't have to be. When  everyone comes to the table and invests the necessary time, we can find  common ground. I hope this will be a lesson for us in other tough  policy challenges, and I encourage my Senate colleagues to support this  bill.                                  ______                                         By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. King, and Mrs. Shaheen):   S. 747. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to provide  grants to States, territories, and Indian Tribes to address  contamination by perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances on  farms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture,  Nutrition, and Forestry.
