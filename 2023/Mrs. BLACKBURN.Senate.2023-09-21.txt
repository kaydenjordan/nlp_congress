 Mr. President, today I honor the life of a  truly extraordinary Tennessean.   If you ask the people of Athens, TN, to describe the life and legacy  of Burkett Witt, most of them will immediately point to his more than  three decades of public service to the town where he was born and  raised. But I like to go back even further to the true beginning of his  public service. Beginning in 1949, he began connecting to his community  through food at the helm of Bo and Pete's Southern Soda Shop at  Tennessee Wesleyan College. Those who knew him--and in some cases,  worked for him--remember his strong work ethic and credit his  mentorship as inspiration for their own personal and professional  growth. The value of that influence, of course, did not go unnoticed.  In 1971, Witt became the town's first African-American elected as a  member of the city council. It is worth noting that at the same time  Witt made history, the people of Athens did, too, and ousted three  incumbents from the council. It was time for change.   In 1983, Witt made history again when he became the first African- American mayor of Athens--and indeed, one of the first African-American  mayors in Tennessee. After 4 years in the top post, Witt stepped back  into his role on the council, where he served with dignity for 33  years. When Tennessee Wesleyan granted Witt an honorary doctorate of  public service in the spring of 2014, Witt's longtime friend Paul  Watkins described him as ``a one of a kind in our world,'' and I could  not agree more.   On behalf of all Tennesseans, I want to recognize Burkett Witt's  stunning contributions to the Volunteer State and offer my prayers and  continued support to the generations of young Tennesseans who will  benefit from the lessons his legacy will teach them.                            ____________________
