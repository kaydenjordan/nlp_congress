 Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize Staff Sergeant  Michael ``Mick'' DeHart for the selfless actions and bravery he showed  on April 10, 1969, during the Vietnam war.   While conducting a routine reconnaissance operation, Staff Sergeant  DeHart and his platoon were ambushed by a numerically superior force.  Throughout the firefight, Staff Sergeant DeHart moved through the enemy  fire to provide cover for injured soldiers, distribute supplies, and  coordinate a counterattack.   As dusk approached, Sergeant DeHart, at significant personal risk,  moved to an exposed position, fired on machine-gun positions and  approaching enemy soldiers, halting their advance. He also aided in the  successful exfiltration of his unit.   For his heroism in combat, Staff Sergeant DeHart recently had one of  his two Silver Stars upgraded to a Distinguished Service Cross.   Thank you, Sergeant DeHart, for your heroism, courage, and service to  our great country.                            ____________________
