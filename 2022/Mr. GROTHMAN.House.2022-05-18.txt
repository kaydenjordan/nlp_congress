 Madam Speaker, the good news is the COVID pandemic is  kind of under control. Nevertheless, we still have about 250 people a  day who die of COVID and over 1 million people have died in this  country.   I think one of the failures of the public health establishment and  the medical establishment is the failure to educate the public about  the benefits of vitamin D. Researchers found that if you have  inadequate vitamin D levels, defined as under 200 nanograms per  milliliter, you are 11 times as likely to die of the disease.   Can you imagine how many lives would have been saved if we tested for  vitamin D and everybody had adequate vitamin D in their blood?   The public health establishment failed us by not educating the public  enough on vitamin D, and it is time we stepped it up, even though it  looks like we are near the end of the pandemic. And the medical  establishment ought to always test for vitamin D with people who are at  risk for this disease, particularly people with darker skin, and  particularly people who are a little heavy. It is very important to  test for vitamin D.   I know the medical establishment feels that they might not get  reimbursed quite enough from the insurance companies, but I will tell  you, people in the medical establishment, and I am talking about the  administrators, in particular, who are making these judgments, ought to  put profit aside for a second and make sure that we get these tests on  people, because if they come under 20 nanograms, they are greatly at  risk for dying.                            ____________________
