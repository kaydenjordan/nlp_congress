 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas (Mr. Brady)  for yielding me the time.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the SECURE Act.   Over the last two decades, we have made progress in helping Americans  save more for their retirement. U.S. retirement savings have increased  from $11 trillion in 2001 to $28 trillion today. But we need to do  more, especially in this booming economy.   This legislation will increase the number of workers with access to  retirement plans, encourage higher savings rates, and enable older  working adults to save for a secure retirement.   The SECURE Act is a commonsense, private-sector solution enabling  Americans to save more for their retirement by expanding access for  workers who choose to participate in a workplace plan. It  simultaneously preserves employer choice and competition.   The SECURE Act has the added benefit of lowering taxes for our Gold  Star families. Providing more for the relatives and the children of  U.S. military members who gave their lives to secure our freedom and  liberty is most fitting on the eve of our Memorial Day weekend.  [[Page H4142]]    I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation today.
