 Good morning, Mr. President.   As we continue to work on the NDAA, the Democratic side is committed  to working with the Republican side in good faith to finish this very  important legislation. I am pleased that the managers have already been  able to include more than 100 amendments in the substitute. I hope we  can do another package today.   Senators McCain and Reed are managing this bill with their usual  great skill, and I very much appreciate their hard work. Particularly,  I know how important this legislation is to Senator McCain and that he  wants to see it through and see it through as soon as possible. We are  going to help in that regard, of course.                            ____________________     Mr. President, last night, Leader Pelosi and I had a  constructive meeting with President Trump and several members of his  Cabinet.   One of our most productive discussions was about the DACA Program, to  which we all agreed on a framework: to pass DACA protections and  additional border security measures, excluding the wall. We agreed that  the President would support enshrining the DACA protections into law.  In fact, it is something, he stated, that for a while has needed to be  done. The President also encouraged the House and Senate to act.   What remains to be negotiated are the details of border security with  the mutual goal of finalizing all of the details as soon as possible.  While both sides agreed that the wall would not be any part of this  agreement, the President made clear that he intends to pursue it at a  later time, and we made clear that we would continue to oppose it.   If you listened to the President's comments this morning and to  Director Mulvaney's comments this morning, it is clear that what Leader  Pelosi and I put out last night was exactly accurate and was confirmed  again this morning by our statement, by the President's statement  before he got on the helicopter to go to Florida, and by Director  Mulvaney's comments. We have reached an understanding on this issue,  but we have to work out details, and we can work together on a border  security package with the White House to get DACA on the floor quickly.   Let me talk for a minute about border security. We Democrats are for  border security. We passed a robust border security package as part of  immigration reform in 2013, as the Acting President pro tempore knows  better than anybody else. We are not for the wall, and we will never be  for the wall. It is expensive, it is ineffective, and it involves a lot  of difficult eminent domain--taking people's property--and, apparently,  it is not being paid for by Mexico. In fact, I listened to FOX News  this morning--I am starting to do that to see what is going on over  there--and they keep saying that in the campaign the President promised  a wall. Yes. He  [[Page S5711]]  also promised that Mexico would pay for it. Where is Mexico? It has  said 12 times that it is not paying for it. That is not the promise he  made.   Finally, on the wall, it sends a terrible symbol to the world about  the United States--about who we are, what kind of country we are. Since  the 1880s, a beautiful statue in the harbor of the city in which I live  has been the symbol of America to the world--that great torch that  symbolizes what a noble land we are. Can you imagine, if in future  decades, that symbol were to be replaced with a big, foreboding wall?  That is not who America is, was, or, hopefully, will be.   As I mentioned, we are for sensible border security, and there are  many more effective ways of securing the border than by building a  wall. A wall can be scaled over. I am sure that those who love the wall  have heard of ladders. A wall can be tunneled under. I am sure that  those who support the wall have heard of shovels. It is a medieval  solution for a modern problem--a ``Game of Thrones'' idea for a world  that is a lot closer to ``Star Wars.'' The thing is that we have new,  modern solutions that use our best technology. We discussed some of  them at the White House last night.   Drones. These drones can spot the difference between a deer and a  human being crossing the border. We have great sensory equipment, and  our military has specialized in this kind of stuff. A lot of it is made  in Syracuse, NY, I am proud to say. We can rebuild roads along the  border. Talk to the people in the Border Patrol, and they will say that  a lot of places do not have roads so that, if they see someone crossing  the border, they cannot get to them. Of course, there is the bipartisan  McCaul-Thompson bill in the House--McCaul, a Republican, and Thompson,  a Democrat--that has broad, bipartisan support and that sets certain  standards. Every one of these ideas would provide better, more  effective border security than would a medieval wall.   There is still much to be done. We have to put meat on the bones of  the agreement, and the details will matter, but it was a very, very  positive step for the President to commit to DACA protections without  insisting on the inclusion of or even a debate about the border wall.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on the Equifax data breach, what has  transpired over the past several months is one of the most egregious  examples of corporate malfeasance since Enron. Equifax has exposed the  most sensitive personal information of over half of the citizens of the  United States--names, addresses, Social Security numbers, driver's  licenses, and, in some cases, even their credit histories. Clearly,  there were inadequate data security standards at Equifax, which is  deeply troubling on a number of levels.   When you are a credit agency like Equifax, you have two principal  jobs: calculating and reporting accurate credit scores and protecting  the sensitive information of individuals that is funneled through that  process. Stunningly and epically, Equifax failed to perform one of its  two essential duties as a company--protecting the sensitive information  of the people in its files. That is unacceptable, and there is no other  word for it.   Even following the failure by Equifax--this huge, massive failure-- the company and its leadership failed to effectively communicate this  breach to the public and, in the aftermath of the announcement, failed  to address public concern. The company knew about the breach and did  not notify consumers that their information had been compromised for  far too long a period. Because Equifax waited so long to report the  breach, consumers were put behind the eight ball. Their information was  potentially compromised without their knowledge, and they had no  ability to protect themselves. Meanwhile, hackers could attempt to take  out loans in their names and potentially use the information for  identity fraud or they could perpetrate a number of fraudulent schemes  with the sensitive information that these horrible hackers had  obtained.   Once the breach was eventually announced, consumers found themselves  being forced to provide sensitive information to Equifax in order to  verify whether they were impacted by the breach. In order to sign up  for the company's credit monitoring services, customers were forced to  agree to terms prohibiting their ability to bring a legal claim against  Equifax. Isn't that disgusting?   Equifax creates the problem and then says: Customer, if you want to  solve it, you have to give up your rights.   That is outrageous.   Equifax is saying: We royally screwed up, but trust us. We will not  screw up again, but if we do screw up, you cannot sue us.   To make matters worse, in the weeks leading up to the announcement of  its breach, while customers were in the dark, several executives at  Equifax sold off their stock in the company. They claim that they had  no knowledge of the breach. If they did, it would be one of the most  brazen and shameful attempts of insider trading that I can recall.   We need to get to the bottom of this--the very bottom, the murky  bottom, the dirty bottom. The Senate must hold hearings on the Equifax  breach during which these executives will be called to account. There  is no question about that. Beyond that, five things need to happen in  the near future. I would like to see them in the next week.   First, Equifax must commit proactively to reach out to all impacted  individuals and notify them that their personal, identifiable  information may have been compromised and, if known, inform them of  exactly what information has been released.   Second, provide credit monitoring and ID theft protection services to  all impacted individuals for no less than 10 years. If an individual  chooses not to use the credit monitoring service offered by Equifax  because they naturally don't trust them, then Equifax should reimburse  that individual for the costs of the alternative credit monitoring  service they sign up for.   Third, offer any impacted individual the ability to freeze their  credit at any point for up to 10 years.   Fourth, remove arbitration provisions from any agreement or terms of  use for products, services, or disclosures offered by Equifax. This  means that Equifax will proactively come into compliance with the  CFPB's forced arbitration rule, and there will be no question that an  individual will not have all legal rights at their disposal.   Fifth, Equifax must agree to testify before the Senate, the FTC, and  the SEC, cooperate with any investigation, and comply with any fines,  penalties, or new standards that are recommended at the conclusion of  these investigations.   If Equifax does not agree to these five things in 1 week's time, the  CEO of the company and the entire board should step down. These five  steps are common sense. They are the baseline of decency. If Equifax  can't commit to them, their leadership is not up to the job, and the  entire leadership must be replaced.   Let me tell my colleagues, if Joe Public--if the average citizen did  anything close to what the corporate leaders of Equifax did that led to  this data breach and the awful response to it, that average citizen  would be fired immediately. To give Equifax a week to implement these  things is overly generous to people who did horrible stuff and then,  after it happened, did nothing--virtually nothing--that showed they had  remorse.   It is only right that the CEO and board step down if they can't reach  this modicum of corporate decency by next week.                            ____________________     Finally, Mr. President--a lot to say this morning--a  word on taxes. Last night at the White House, President Trump said he  didn't want his tax plan to benefit the very wealthy. That is a good  thing. We Democrats agree. Forty-five of the forty-eight of us signed a  letter that no tax breaks should go to the top 1 percent. They are  doing great. God bless them. I am glad they are doing well. They don't  need a tax break. Middle-class people do.   But the devil, when the President says that, is always in the  details, and we haven't seen any details. We haven't seen anything  resembling a  [[Page S5712]]  plan yet. We hear it is being written in a back room by the so-called  Big 6--all Republican--but I haven't seen it, Ranking Member Wyden  hasn't seen it, and no Democrat in the Senate has seen it.   I can tell you one thing: If the President's tax plan repeals or  rolls back the estate tax, it will be clear that a lot of this plan  benefits the very rich, contrary to all of his words.   I would remind everyone that only 5,200 of the over 2.7 million  estates in this country will pay any taxes this year. The estate tax  only kicks in when couples with estates of nearly $11 million transfer  their wealth. Go to North Dakota--and I know the Acting President pro  tempore has nice family farms out there--and ask how many have an  estate worth $11 million, and if they do, I am willing to exempt from  the estate tax a family farm that is over that. But almost no one does.   A study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities showed that of  the 5,200 estates--here we have 2.7 million estates. Only 5,200 qualify  for the estate tax because they are worth $11 million, and of those, 50  are small farms or businesses--50. Let's exempt those 50. Let's make  all of these other guys pay. We need the money. They are rich. God  bless them.   So when President Trump says the estate tax is a burden on the family  farmer, I honestly don't know what he is talking about. There may be a  few. They may make a lot of noise. God bless them. That is their right  as Americans. There are very, very few. That is not what the facts say.   Let me show my colleagues the next chart. Of 2.7 million taxable  estates, just 50 are farms and small businesses that would benefit from  the repeal of the estate tax--2.7 million; 50.   There was an amazing moment last night at the meeting we held at the  White House when the estate tax came up, and a few of the President's  advisers said: Oh, no one pays the estate tax. There have even been  news reports that Gary Cohn has told Members of Congress that ``only  morons pay the estate tax.'' What they mean, of course, is that rich  people--people rich enough to be levied estate taxes--can find ways  around paying them; they can afford all of those lawyers and estate  planners.   Well, first, they are wrong. Repealing the estate tax would add $269  billion to the deficit over 10 years--$269 billion. So there are a lot  of people paying the estate tax. Maybe they are morons, as Gary Cohn  once called them, maybe they are not, but there is a lot of money out  there that comes in from these very wealthy with the estate tax.   Second, Mr. Cohn and the others who say this bring up an important  point. The right thing to do is not repeal the estate tax but close the  loopholes. If you have an estate worth that much, you should be paying  the estate tax, not finding clever ways to avoid your tax obligation.  Again, if you are rich, if you have a big estate, God bless you. That  is the American way. But pay your fair share. Pay your fair share.   Democrats want to participate in reforming our Tax Code. There are  lots of good things we can agree on--closing loopholes like this one,  cutting taxes for the middle class, helping small businesses, bringing  offshore deferred income back into the United States.   We have laid out three principles: no reconciliation--that means do  it together, not how they did healthcare, which didn't end up with a  great result; second, no tax cuts for the top 1 percent, who are doing  just fine, God bless them; third, fiscal responsibility--we should not  increase the deficit as we cut taxes, particularly now that we are  going to have to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to help the  beleaguered States of Texas and Florida.   Some Republicans have characterized those three principles as lines  in the sand that show that Democrats aren't serious about tax reform.  So I would ask my Republican colleagues, which of the three do you not  agree with? Do you think we should cut taxes on the top 1 percent? Do  you think we should create deficits by cutting taxes on the wealthy? Do  you think you should just go at this alone? If you agree with those,  fine. Say so. Don't say that these are lines in the sand. We are  offering some policy guidance that has virtually unanimous support in  our caucus.   By the way, these three principles guided the 1986 tax reform, which  was the most successful tax reform we have had in decades.   It seems to me it is not Democrats who would move the goalpost on tax  reform but some Republicans who no longer want to play by the same  rules   Mr. President, I yield the floor to my dear friend, the chairman of  the Armed Services Committee, who is doing a great job getting this  bill through.                            ____________________     Absolutely.   Mr. McCAIN. Good. I hope we can do that.   I again thank the leader from New York, who has been very cooperative  to me and to the Senator from Rhode Island as we have moved forward  with this legislation. I thank him.                     Training Accident at Camp Pendleton    Mr. President, I wish to begin by offering my thoughts and prayers to  the marines who were injured yesterday when their amphibious assault  vehicle caught fire during a training exercise at Camp Pendleton in  California. With 15 marines hospitalized and 5 in critical condition, I  join all of my colleagues in hoping for a full and speedy recovery for  each of these brave young servicemembers.   Last night, unfortunately, the majority leader was required to file  cloture on the National Defense Authorization Act for 2018. We have  gotten a lot done in the short time this legislation has been on the  floor. I know I speak for many of my colleagues when I say that it is  my hope that we will be able to do more.   I thank my friend from Rhode Island. I thank Members who have been  very helpful and cooperative in this effort, as we have considered a  27-to-0 vote through the committee. It passed unanimously. We have  engaged in spirited, thoughtful debate, and we have ultimately adopted  277 amendments from both Republicans and Democrats.   I sound like a broken record, but this is the way the Senate should  conduct business. The authorizing committee reports out legislation  that has been examined with hearings and debate and amendments, and it  appears on the floor, and we have additional debates and amendments,  and people can vote yes or no, but they are informed.   It is a violation of our oath of office when we are told that one- fifth of the gross national product--i.e. healthcare--is going to be  decided by a ``skinny repeal'' that none of us had seen until an hour  or two before. That is not the way the Senate should do business.   We are not perfect. We are going to have to invoke cloture on this  bill. We are not going to have some debate and votes on some very  important--at least four--issues. But while we have been on this bill,  we have adopted 277 amendments. We had hours and hours of hearings. We  had a week of putting this bill  [[Page S5713]]  together on a bipartisan basis, and it was reported out by over one- quarter of the Senate, to zero. That is the way we should be doing  business.   I will freely admit that national security probably is at a higher  level of importance--and should be--than the average legislation, but  shouldn't we learn from this that if we sit down together, we argue, we  fight, we debate, and then we reach consensus, we come to the floor of  the Senate and to the American people with something that we are proud  of and that we can defend?   As I mentioned, there are still some issues that we are negotiating  on, back and forth--and we are negotiating--and hopefully we can get  those done before cloture is invoked. I hope the majority leader and  the Democratic leader will agree to a time certain for final passage.   Let me just say that I support beginning to move toward final  passage, which will provide our Armed Forces the resources they need.   By the way, again, I want to emphasize that on the Armed Services  Committee, we have had dozens of hearings on topics such as the global  threat environment, the effects of defense budget cuts, and military  readiness and modernization. Those hearings informed the work of the  committee as we moved toward the legislation.   I know that all of us from time to time like to take credit for  accomplishments that maybe we are not as responsible for as we would  advertise, but I want to say that I am not just proud of John McCain  and Jack Reed, I am proud of the 27 members of the Armed Services  Committee who--and the debate was spirited. It is not the Bobbsey  Twins. We fight in a spirited fashion. We defend what we believe in.  But once the committee is decided, then we move on.   So my colleagues have embraced the spirit of that process, and we  have submitted more than 500 amendments for consideration this week.  The Senator from Rhode Island and I negotiated a number of very good  amendments that have the support of both Republicans and Democrats. We  still have some hard issues that are remaining, and I will be talking  more about them. We are still negotiating to see if we can find  agreement on those, and I am guardedly optimistic we can get most of  that agreement done. We will know more later on this morning or early  this afternoon.    Let me also point out to my colleagues what we are talking about. We  have seen Navy ships, Army, and Marine Corps helicopters, Air Force  planes crashing during routine training and operations, and these  incidents have cost the lives of dozens of our men and women in  uniform. There are many reasons for these tragedies, but the one this  body cannot avoid responsibility for is that we are failing to provide  our military with the resources they need to perform the missions we  are asking of them. We are asking them to do too much with too little.  The result is an overworked, strained force with aging equipment--and  not enough of it.   We can point fingers and assign blame all we want, but at the end of  the day, the constitutional responsibility to raise moneys and maintain  Navies lies with us, with the Congress. That, of course, brings up  sequestration, which I will address later on.   I just want to point out, again, the men and women who wear the  uniform of our country are the best of our country, and they do  everything we ask of them with great courage. It is time for this body  to show a similar measure of courage and end the threat sequestration  poses to their mission and their lives.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.
