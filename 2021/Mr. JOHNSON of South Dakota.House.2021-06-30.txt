 Fifty million, Madam Speaker. The WHO  estimates that 50 million abortions are performed each year. It is a  soul-rending number.   Of course, abortion is a deeply divisive legal, political, and moral  dispute, but despite that fact, for 45 years, this body has been able  to come together to accept the powerful message of the Hyde amendment,  that taxpayer funding should never be used for abortion.   When I think about what we can do together, that is a powerful  message. It is in that spirit that I ask unanimous consent that the  relevant committees be discharged from any further consideration of  H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, and I ask for its  immediate consideration by this House.    Mr. Speaker, railroad hauls 40 percent  of America's long-haul freight, but it makes up only 2 percent of our  transportation-based emissions.   Now, unfortunately, the INVEST in America Act tells freight railroads  that they need to replace all of their older locomotives with newer,  albeit only marginally cleaner, fossil-fuel burning locomotives. And  this will be incredibly expensive. Again, only slightly cleaner. And  that cost will slow industry's progress toward the development of zero  emission locomotives.   There is a cleaner, a better, a less prescriptive, and a less  expensive way to make this transition. You think about slowing the  deployment of those locomotives will actually hinder the majority's  fight against climate change.   Mr. Speaker, I would say that this part of the INVEST in America Act  moves in the wrong direction, like so many parts of the INVEST in  America Act, and it is one more good reason to vote ``no.''
