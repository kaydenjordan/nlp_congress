 Mr. President, Indiana was settled by men and women who  left the safety of their homes, they headed westward, and they crossed  the Appalachian Mountains into the wilderness and the unknown. They  were willing to endure hardship, to risk danger in search of a better  tomorrow, to clear a path for others to follow. They were pioneers.  But, long after our State was settled and Indiana's population drifted  up from the banks of the Ohio River toward Lake Michigan, Hoosiers  never stopped looking at the frontier. Only, they cast their gaze away  from the west and toward the sky.   In the fall of 1959, 15,000 people gathered in the southern Indiana  town of Mitchell--population 3,500 at the time. Some lined the streets.  Others sat on rooftops or watched through windows. They hadn't come to  Mitchell's annual Persimmon Festival for the beauty pageant nor did  they come for the pudding contest or the classic car run. No. They were  there to see the convertible at the head of the festival's parade as it  drove down Mitchell's Main Street. Seated inside that convertible was  one of their own, a local boy. They knew him from the house on Baker  Street. Maybe they knew him from Mitchell High or from the First  Baptist Church. History knows him as the second American to travel to  space and the first man to go there twice.   So I am proud to have the privilege to deliver these remarks in front  of the Presiding Officer, who has also been to space. His name was Lt.  Col. Virgil Ivan ``Gus'' Grissom. There he is--a great Hoosier, a great  American.   I ask all who may be watching to study his portrait--that flat-top  haircut, the serious expression. That was Gus Grissom. They should look  at old photos of the White House press events. It is uncanny. He is the  odd astronaut out, the one who looks like he would rather not be there.  You see, the images don't lie. He was taciturn, tough-minded, and hard- driving.   NASA's head physician described him as ``confident but not  conceited.'' He was a ``stern competitor but a good teammate, a frank  but carefree speaker.''   He had little use for publicity or even the press. He only went to  White House events because Betty, his wife, and their boys wanted to.  Gus Grissom wasn't a celebrity; he was a pilot and an engineer. He was  more comfortable racing fellow Mercury astronaut Alan Shepard in his  souped-up Corvette around Cape Kennedy. He was a regular guy. But the  race that Gus Grissom truly cared about was the one to the stars. He  was determined--determined--to beat Russia there.   ``I think we ought to declare an out-and-out race with the Russians  to put the first man in space,'' Grissom once stated.   You see, this Hoosier didn't mince words. He saw the space race as an  important global competition between the United States and the Soviet  Union, between freedom and communism. And the prize was more than just  a flag that was planted on the Moon. It meant prestige and pride, yes,  but also technological superiority and the national security and  economic benefits that went with it. America won that race in part  because of Gus Grissom, and our Nation reaped incredible benefits  because of his sacrifice.   On July 21, 1961--almost 2 years after he was at the center of the  Persimmon Festival in Mitchell--Grissom splashed down in the Atlantic  Ocean, 260 nautical miles south of Cape Canaveral. He had just ridden  the Mercury-Redstone 4 above the Earth and back down. Appropriately,  Grissom nicknamed the ship Liberty Bell 7--a tribute, of course, to the  bell that rang after the reading of the Declaration of Independence in  1776.   Regardless of what you have read in novels or seen in movies,  Grissom's flight was flawless. The vessel sank after its hatch blew-- the result of a poor design and electrostatic discharge, not astronaut  error.   Four years later, on March 23, 1965, friends and former classmates  gathered at the First Baptist Church back in Mitchell. Nearly every  business installed a television so their customers and employees could  watch Grissom return to space. This was a different journey, though.  The Mercury ships boosted astronauts into space and retro-rocketed them  back to Earth. This new craft, Gemini, gave them a degree of control  and added maneuverability--technological leaps that anticipated manned  flights to the Moon.   Grissom, along with pilot John Young, did not only skillfully guide  Gemini 3 as it orbited the Earth three times, he virtually designed the  ship. Stung by the ``hatch crap'' on Liberty Bell 7, as he called it,  Grissom securitized and directed the assembly of the new spacecraft.  Their construction so closely followed his vision that other astronauts  nicknamed the Gemini the ``Gusmobile.'' The cockpit and seat were even  configured to his 5'7'' frame.   Grissom was next given command of the Apollo program's first mission,  with its goal of realizing President Kennedy's charge of landing a man  on the Moon before the end of the 1960s. When the Apollo Lunar Module  landed at Tranquility Base in 1969, Grissom was not aboard. He had  perished 2 years prior in a launch pad fire aboard Apollo 1 during  testing. The tragedy, though, inspired NASA to improve the construction  and, ultimately, the safety of the Apollo crafts, leading to the Moon  landing.   Grissom said:         The conquest of space is worth the risk of human life.    The race to the stars ended in America's favor because he gave his.   Now, Grissom may not have been aboard Apollo 11 when it reached the  Moon, but it never would have gotten there without him.   At the onset of that journey and the most daunting journeys Americans  have embarked on, there has been skepticism, and there have been  questions of purpose and value. It never stopped the pioneers, the  doers and dreamers, and Americans like Gus Grissom from making the  voyage and making our country better.   Back in the fall of 1959, during the Persimmon Festival, Mayor Roy  Ira handed Grissom a plaque and gave him a simple tribute:         Mitchell is proud of Grissom. I urge our youth to take note       of Virgil's example.   [[Page S2979]]     Six decades later, we are still proud of him, and we should all still  follow his example and always press on toward the next frontier,  wherever it may be.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
