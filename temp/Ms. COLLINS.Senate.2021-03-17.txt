 I yield the floor.    Mr. President, this is the time of year when people are  calculating their taxes and filing their returns. There are inequities  in our Tax Code, and the bill I am introducing today, the SALT  Deduction Fairness Act, would help remedy one of these inequities. This  bill would ensure that limits on State and local tax deductions, also  known as SALT deductions, do not disproportionately and unfairly  penalize married couples.   Currently, the amount in State and local taxes that both single and  married filers may deduct from their annual income taxes is capped at  $10,000. Single filers and married filers are treated the same, and  married people who file their taxes separately are limited to $5,000  each. In other words, people would be better off not getting married  when it comes to the SALT deduction. My bill removes this penalty by  simply doubling the deduction to $20,000 for married filers.   This is the situation we have now: Two single people can both claim  $10,000 worth of State and local income taxes as a deduction on their  Federal returns, but if they get married, they can claim only $10,000  together. This is a classic example of a marriage tax penalty.   When the Senate considered the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017, I  worked to keep the SALT deduction in the Federal Tax Code because of  the increased tax burden its elimination would have imposed on many  Mainers who pay property taxes on their seasonal cottages as well as  their homes, who remit annual excise taxes on their vehicles, and who  are subject to State income taxes.   The SALT deduction has been in the Tax Code since 1913, when the  Federal income tax was first established. It is intended to protect  families from double taxation, from essentially paying a tax on a tax.   The Senate adopted my amendment, which paralleled that of the House,  to retain the deduction for State and local taxes up to $10,000. This  deduction is especially important to families living in high-tax  States, like Maine, which has one of our Nation's highest State taxes  and where many residents own second homes, like camps on Maine's  beautiful lakes. Last year, an analysis by WalletHub found that Maine  had the fourth highest overall tax burden behind only New York, Hawaii,  and Vermont. Yet Maine's median household income ranked only 35th in  the Nation and was approximately $6,800 below the U.S. median household  income. So maintaining this deduction provides important tax relief for  those Mainers who continue to itemize their deductions. Yet we can do  better. We can make the SALT deduction fairer by eliminating the  marriage penalty that limits a married couple to just $10,000; whereas,  if they were not married, they could each claim $10,000.   According to the U.S. Census, there are more than 60 million married  couples living in our Nation. Our Tax Code should be fair to them. We  should not create a situation in which married couples would have been  better off financially, in terms of taxes, had they not married. One  way to accomplish this goal is to double their access to deductions for  the State and local taxes they pay, including from properties they  share, such as their homes. This legislation would remedy this double  taxation problem and eliminate the marriage tax penalty when it comes  to the SALT tax deduction.   It boils down to this: We simply should not be unfairly penalizing  American taxpayers for being married.   I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense bill to fix this  marriage tax penalty  [[Page S1617]]                                       ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Blumenthal, and Ms.          Klobuchar):   S. 807.
