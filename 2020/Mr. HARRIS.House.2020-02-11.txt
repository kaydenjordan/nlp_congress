 Madam Speaker, great news on the economy this week: The  economy added 225,000 jobs in January, and unemployment for Americans  is at a 50-year low.   But the booming economy has resulted in worker shortages throughout  the economy, whether it is for Aubrey Vincent of Lindy's Seafood in my  district or for Alan Jones at Manor View Farms.   Right now, there are simply more seasonable jobs open than there are  [[Page H1024]]  Americans available to fill them. And tens of thousands of full-time  American jobs rely on the availability of sufficient temporary H-2B  visa workers to meet temporary seasonal labor needs.   Today, I rise to thank the Trump administration for its past  decisions to release extra temporary H-2B visas. I realize that  Congress should have determined the number needed and included that in  legislation, but Congress failed, and that is why, Madam Speaker, I  rise to ask the administration to continue to support these seasonal  businesses and release an adequate number of additional H-2B visas.                            ____________________
