 Madam Speaker, obviously a lot is going on in America  right now, and with all the focus on what is going on in Afghanistan,  as well as the latest spending bills going through Congress, we are  perhaps losing track of the thing that I think will have the biggest  impact on America over the next few years.   I beg the American public and the American media not to lose sight of  what is going on at our southern border. In the last couple of weeks,  it has become apparent that, by an estimate, 105,000 people crossed  over the border into that country as opposed to 80,000 in June; over a  30 percent increase in 1 month, almost entirely unremarked; of that is  an estimated 15,000 unaccompanied minors, which is a human relations  tragedy.   It is going to further increase the amount of illegal drugs in this  country. Right now, 90,000 people a year are dying of illegal drugs. It  is hard to believe that this time last year only an estimated 8,000  people were coming in the country, whereas, this July, again, we are at  105,000.   It should be banner headlines in any newspaper in this country when  we go from about 10,000 people to 105,000 people per month.                            ____________________
