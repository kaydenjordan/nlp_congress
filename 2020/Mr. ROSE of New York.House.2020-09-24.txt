 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  service of Mr. Louis Antonelli, an amazing husband, father,  grandfather, and someone who served his community and his church with  love and with compassion.   Louis loved to serve, and he took pride in his work as a member of  the New York City FOP and in his service on the board of the South  Beach Civic Association.   And although he was no stranger to tragedy with the loss of his  beloved son, he never lost his joy or his passion for others. He loved  to entertain guests, and when they would come and visit, you would  never find him without a smile, a piece of candy, or some kind words to  share.   He will be missed, but he will never be forgotten. My heart goes out  to Angela, his adoring wife of over 60 years, his two daughters, and  his five grandchildren. Mr. Antonelli, we will never forget your  memory.                            ____________________
