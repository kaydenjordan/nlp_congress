 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  my colleague and friend Chairman Gregg Harper for his service to  Mississippi's Third Congressional District in the House of  Representatives.   Gregg and I were elected to Congress in the same year, 2008, and we  were friends from the start. And while he will retire at the end of  this year, his contributions will be long remembered.   At the beginning of the 115th Congress, Gregg was selected by the  Speaker of the House to serve as chairman of the House Administration  Committee. He has had vast oversight and administrative  responsibilities in the House and other institutions.   Perhaps most notably, Gregg worked to completely overhaul House  policies and implement mandatory sexual harassment training for  everyone from Members to interns. He worked to change the culture on  the Hill, and he said: ``It has to be understood that taxpayers are not  going to be responsible for someone's bad behavior.'' And that is Gregg  Harper, a man of high character, always working to do the right thing.   Gregg has also dedicated much of his congressional life to that of  advocating for those with intellectual disabilities. Mr. Speaker, 8  years ago, he founded the Congressional Internship Program for  Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities.   This program partners with George Mason University's LIFE Program to  connect students with disabilities to congressional offices for a  semester-long internship. Students get to help office staff with  administrative tasks, special projects, and they truly become part of  the team.   When Gregg started the program, just 5 congressional offices  participated. Today, there are nearly 200 House and Senate offices that  host student interns.   Gregg, whose son, Livingston, has special needs, designed this  program to not only give students exposure to Capitol Hill offices, but  also to give Members and staffers the experience of working with  individuals who are living with various types of disabilities.   My office continues to participate in this program, and we have  hosted many students from George Mason University. It has been a  wonderful experience for me and my staff, and I encourage all my  colleagues to join the program next Congress.   Mr. Speaker, it will be bittersweet for me to say good-bye to my  friend Gregg Harper, but he has left his mark on this institution, and  his contributions will be remembered for generations to come.   Gregg will return to Mississippi to spend more time with his wife,  Sidney, their children, and his first grandbaby, a little boy named  Lee. Chairman Harper is being promoted to Grandpa Harper, and I know  that that will be his greatest role yet. I wish him the best in his  next chapter of life.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  December 15 as the Bill of Rights Day.   The Bill of Rights, which is the first 10 amendments to the  Constitution, was first ratified in 1791. It protects the rights and  liberties of all Americans. The Bill of Rights guarantees our freedoms  of religion, speech, press, and to peaceably assemble and petition our  government; and it protects our right to bear arms, our private  property rights, our right to a fair trial, and our right against  unreasonable searches and seizures.   It establishes that we as a nation promote the power of individual  liberties and limit the scope of the Federal Government.   Mr. Speaker, Bill of Rights Day came into existence in 1941 on its  150th anniversary. Congress passed a joint resolution authorizing  President Franklin D. Roosevelt to make it a national holiday.  Roosevelt referred to the document as ``the great American charter of  personal liberty and human dignity.''   Mr. Speaker, it is important that we use this day to educate younger  generations of Americans on our Bill of Rights and the values it  embodies for all.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  his leadership here managing this rule debate and for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, as vice chair of the Agriculture Committee and a  conferee, I rise in strong support of this rule and the underlying  bill, the farm bill of 2018.   Over the past 3 years, the House and Senate Agriculture Committees  comprehensively reviewed the 2014 farm bill through a variety of  hearings to gain feedback from hundreds of farmers, ranchers,  landowners, and stakeholders. This conference report is the  [[Page H10119]]  final product of this process and months of bipartisan, bicameral  compromise.   While there are many important provisions within the bill to  highlight, at its core, the farm bill is about supporting American  agriculture and access to food. It is about supporting our domestic  food supply and our ability to feed, clothe, and provide energy and  fiber for all Americans.   One portion of this bill I am particularly pleased with is the dairy  reforms contained in title 1. These reforms build on the positive  changes made to the dairy margin insurance program in this year's  bipartisan budget agreement.   Our dairy farmers have continued to face difficult times over the  past decade, and I am hopeful that the 2018 farm bill will help to  provide some stability in this sector.   Also of note is a strong conservation title and support for active  land management. This includes reauthorization of the Conservation  Reserve Program, the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, and the  Regional Conservation Partnership Program.   Finally, I would like to mention the positive reforms that we made to  SNAP included in this conference report. These changes will help with  program integrity. It will encourage work for able-bodied adults  without dependents and better ensure that SNAP funding and resources  are going to our most vulnerable and those truly in need.   I would like to thank Chairman Conaway, Ranking Member Peterson, and  all the committee staff for their hard work on this conference report  and dedication to agriculture.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this rule and the underlying farm  bill and ask my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on both.
