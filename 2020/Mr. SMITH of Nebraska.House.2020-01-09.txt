 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr.  Allen Beermann, who is retiring from his  [[Page H72]]  longtime position as the executive director of the Nebraska Press  Association after having been Nebraska's secretary of state for 24  years.   Through his 48 years of public service, Allen has been an example of  dignity and a source of inspiration to countless Nebraskans. Allen is  well known across Nebraska and even around the world for his commitment  to his work and his affinity for meeting new people.                                time  1045    As a Nebraska Secretary of State, he worked tirelessly to protect the  integrity of our elections. He brought this commitment to integrity  with him into his next role as executive director of the Nebraska Press  Association as well.   He has traveled to many countries and met with people from all walks  of life, establishing relationships with everyone he meets along the  way. Allen likes to say his career took him to ``48 countries in 48  years,'' and I am sure he has no shortage of stories from these trips.   I have known Allen for many years, and I can say, in addition to his  hard work, Allen has always been a great person to be around. Allen is  always one to lighten a conversation with his quick wit and positive  attitude, and his many friends around the world are a testament to his  character. He has even been known to poke fun at himself a little bit,  stating, recently, that the Nebraska Historical Society has recognized  him as the ``official State artifact.''   Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring Mr. Allen Beermann's  commendable public service, and wish him good luck in his retirement.                            ____________________
