 Mr. Speaker, although the Republican Senate has refused  the customary FBI investigation into allegations against Judge  Kavanaugh by Dr. Ford and others, there is evidence that should be  weighed.   Dr. Ford is not only willing to offer sworn testimony at the hearing,  she has requested an FBI investigation with the required FBI  questioning under penalty of perjury.   Judge Kavanaugh is an expert on all our legal processes. Why hasn't  he asked for the standard FBI investigation?   Moreover, apparently understanding the seriousness of her  allegations, Dr. Ford has also taken the unusual step of being  polygraphed. A lie detector test is not required, although law  enforcement sometimes requests it.   It would be a fair question for Senators to ask Judge Kavanaugh why  he did not request an FBI investigation and whether he would take a  polygraph test, too.                            ____________________
