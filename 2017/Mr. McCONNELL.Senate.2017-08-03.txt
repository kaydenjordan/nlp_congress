 Mr. President, earlier this week, I set out a number  of items for the Senate to get done during this work period, both in  terms of nominees and legislation.   First on nominees, we had to confirm an FBI Director, and we have  done that. We needed to make progress on a number of other nominations  that have been held up for entirely too long. Slowly but surely, we  are. We confirmed a well-qualified judicial nominee. We confirmed  several officials who will be critical to advancing administration  policy in the Defense Department. Yesterday afternoon, we confirmed a  nominee to the National Labor Relations Board who will help to return  it--after 8 years of habitually siding with union bosses over workers-- to its intended role as an impartial judge that calls balls and strikes  in labor disputes.   All of this is progress, but we still have nominees to confirm for  positions across many agencies in both security and nonsecurity roles.  Many Cabinet members still await the No. 2 officials for their  departments. So we have more to do.   The same is true of legislation. We had to pass the Veterans Choice  legislation. We have. In fact, we passed some additional veterans  legislation, as well.   Under the last administration, we learned of a shocking scandal that  spread through Veterans Affairs facilities across the Nation. We all  agreed that our veterans deserved far better than that. Ever since,  Congress has continued to work on a number of initiatives designed to  bring more justice to veterans and more reform to the VA. Senator  Isakson, the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, has been a  tireless advocate for our Nation's veterans and a driving force on  seeing these bills through committee and through the Senate. We passed  a number of good reforms into law already. We continue to build on that  progress today.   Just a couple of months ago, we passed important VA reform  legislation that is now law. The Department of Veterans Affairs  Accountability and  [[Page S4782]]  Whistleblower Protection Act is helping to shore up accountability  measures, improve transparency, and enhance the VA's ability to remove  unsatisfactory employees, while also protecting those who speak up  about wrongdoing within the VA.   Just this week we passed through more veterans bills. One heads back  to the House for final passage. The Veterans Appeals Improvement and  Modernization Act will help address the delays that many veterans have  experienced by modernizing the VA's antiquated claims appeals process.  The other two bills now await the President's signature. The VA Choice  and Quality Employment Act we passed earlier this week will provide  additional resources to shore up the critical Veterans Choice Program  so that veterans who face long wait and travel times at VA facilities  will have the option of accessing private care instead. The Harry W.  Colmery Veterans Education Assistance Act we passed yesterday will  expand access for veterans to GI bill benefits as they transition back  to civilian life.   I want to thank the President and his administration for working with  Congress to improve healthcare for our Nation's veterans. I also want  to thank again Senator Isakson for his unwavering leadership on  veterans issues and VA reforms. He has never stopped working to  strengthen the VA system for those who rely on it and to overcome the  systemic problems that have left many veterans frustrated and hurting.  These veterans bills can make a real impact in the lives of the people  we represent.   That is also true of the FDA legislation we need to pass during this  work period as well. I am hopeful we will have the opportunity to do so  today. This legislation, which was passed by the HELP Committee on a  21-to-2 bipartisan vote, is more important than ever in light of  lifesaving developments in immunotherapy. It has never been more  relevant, given that personalized medicine is just over the horizon.  Passing this legislation will help speed up the drug approval process  for patients in need. It will help address the time and cost of  bringing lifesaving drugs to market. It will allow the important work  of ensuring our drugs and devices are safe and effective to move  forward.   I want to recognize the chairman of the HELP Committee, Senator  Alexander, for helping to make this critical legislation a top priority  and for working with colleagues to move it in a timely manner.   We are making progress this week for the future of lifesaving  medicine for our veterans and for the leadership of our country's most  critical agencies. We know we still have more to do in all of these  areas, but we are passing critical legislation. We are confirming  nominees to important positions, and we are taking steps in the right  direction.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.

Mr. President, the Senate has confirmed more executive  branch nominees this week than all of the executive branch nominees  confirmed this year--combined. This was an important step toward  filling critical roles throughout the administration, including the  Deputies of multiple Cabinet offices that had been lacking these key  positions.   Moving forward, I hope this agreement represents the way forward on  confirming nominees so our government can be fully staffed and working  for the American people.    Mr. President, Richard Glick and Kevin McIntyre have  been nominated by the President for positions on the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission. I understand they will be heard and marked up in  tandem in September and I have told the Democratic leader that they  will move as a pair across the floor.                            ____________________
