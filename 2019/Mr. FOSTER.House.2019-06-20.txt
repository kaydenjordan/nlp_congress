 Mr. Chair, I thank my colleagues for supporting en bloc  No. 2, which included two of my amendments.   The first amendment directs NASA to work toward the development of a  low-enriched uranium space power reactor. NASA has been developing a  low-enriched uranium propulsion system, but some of the funding for  this has been used on other projects, including a power reactor using  weapons-grade uranium.   The problem is that if all the spacefaring nations of the world start  using large amounts of weapons-grade material in their space reactors,  then it will be difficult to ensure that this material would not be  diverted to weapons programs in space and on Earth.   If the U.S. develops a low-enriched uranium space power reactor  design, it is likely that this type of reactor design will be adopted  as a de facto standard by other spacefaring nations, making Earth and  space a safer place.   The second amendment directs $6.5 million of the space technology  account, which is currently funded at $1.29 billion, to be used by the  NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts, or NIAC, program. That will put the  total budget for NIAC at $15.2 million.   The NIAC program nurtures visionary ideas that could transform future  NASA missions with the creation of breakthroughs that could  dramatically lower the cost of space travel while simultaneously  engaging America's innovators and entrepreneurs as partners in the  journey.   The nation that first demonstrates such technologies will own the  future of space travel.   At $15.2 million, NIAC is still less than a tenth of a percent of  NASA's overall $22 billion budget, but this is a small step in the  right direction.   Mr. Chair, I thank my colleagues for their support of these  amendments.
