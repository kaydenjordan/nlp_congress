 I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) is  necessarily absent.    Mr. President, today is the 1-year anniversary of an  election that was judged the most secure in the history of America. Let  me say that again. The election that ended November 3, 2020, 1 year  ago, was judged the most secure in American history. That is not my  opinion; that is the official conclusion, under the Trump  administration, of his Department of Homeland Security, which  coordinates with the Nation's top cyber security and voting  infrastructure experts to protect our elections. They released that  assessment 10 days after last year's election, and they did it in the  face of a dangerous and unprecedented avalanche of attacks and tweets  from the enraged President Donald Trump, who claimed falsely that the  election had been stolen from him.   Those election security experts were not alone. President Trump and  his loyalists filed more than 50 lawsuits in State and Federal courts,  repeating their false claims of voter fraud and stolen votes--50. Every  crackpot theory that Rudy Giuliani could glean or spawn on the internet  was tested in court. How did they do? Fifty lawsuits. No evidence to  back their claims in the courts; only bizarre conspiracy theories and  far-right internet gossip, which they accepted as gospel. Well, the  lawsuits were all dismissed, some even by judges President Trump had  nominated. It was not a great day for the theory of a stolen election  in the courts of America.   What happened next? What happened was documented by the Senate  Judiciary Committee, which I chair. We brought witnesses before us to  really explore stage 2 of President Trump's effort to overturn the last  election.   When he couldn't win in the courts, he decided to go to the  Department of Justice. William Barr, his honored, loyal Attorney  General, resigned after announcing he could find nothing wrong with the  election, and then President Trump took it in his own hands. With a few  of his allies, one of them Jeffrey Clark in the Department of Justice,  they tried to pressure the Acting Attorney General, Jeffrey Rosen, to  send a letter out to the attorneys general and other State authorities  across the Nation to tell them to suspend reporting the electoral  college vote count.   Well, Jeffrey Rosen and others stood up to the President even when he  threatened to dismiss him and replace him. In fact, when that happened,  a number of people in the Department of Justice, many of whom were  appointees by President Trump, said that they would resign en mass if  that happened.   So the Trump approach to take this to the Department of Justice and  to railroad his way through there failed, but the Big Lie continued. We  all know about the death and destruction of the Big Lie in this Capitol  Building, in this Senate Chamber, on January 6. In this Capitol  Building, 5 people lost their lives, and over 100 law enforcement were  attacked by the mob that descended on this building. The entire world  looked on in disbelief to think that a President would send a mob up to  overrun the Capitol and to stop the electoral college vote count.   The Big Lie is also corroding America's faith in our electoral  system. A new poll released this week disclosed that only one in three  Republican voters trusts that the 2024 elections will be fair--only one  in three.   One year ago, Americans braved a lethal pandemic to cast their  ballots. Many stood in line, some for hours. The 2020 general election  saw the highest voter turnout in more than a century, according to the  Brennan Center. And as I said, it was our most secure election ever, as  judged by President Trump's Department of Homeland Security and his  Attorney General, William Barr. We ought to be proud of that.   Sadly, however, instead of telling people the truth and defending our  elections, lawmakers in many States are using the Big Lie, propagated  by former President Trump, as a pretext to undermine America's right to  vote. We need to use examples here so you understand what we are  saying.   Remember the runoff election for two senatorial seats in the State of  Georgia? It was an important election, and there were unprecedented  numbers of voters participating in it. The law in Georgia at the time  said that people could register to vote between the official election  count on November 3 and the runoff election count in January. Then the  Georgia Legislature, after two Democratic Senators were elected,  changed that and said: No, you can't register to vote in that interim  period of time. They reduced the amount of time that people would have  to cast absentee ballots.   Since the January 6 assault on the Capitol, more than 425 bills have  been introduced in 49 States to make it harder to vote and in some  cases easier for some politicians to overturn elections if they don't  like voters' choices.   This is exactly how democracies wither. If we undermine the most  fundamental concept of democracy--the right to vote and the right for  people in that electorate to choose its leaders--we are going to weaken  this democracy that we were honored to inherit.    Three times this year on the floor of the U.S. Senate, Republican  Senators have used the filibuster, which historically has been the  favorite tool of segregationists--and I might add, many of those  segregationists were Democrats--to prevent this Senate from even  debating voting rights. Let me say that again. Republicans have used  the filibuster to prevent the Senate from even debating both the For  the People Act twice and the Freedom to Vote Act.   The other day, I looked up the cloture vote on another of our  Nation's great laws, the Civil Rights Act of 1964. On June 10, 1964,  Senators voted to end the longest filibuster in history and allowed the  Civil Rights Act to move forward. The vote tally is important. Among  Republican Senators, 27 voted for cloture to end the filibuster, and 6  voted not to, to support the continuation of the filibuster--27 to 6 on  the Republican side. The vote by Democratic Senators, as history judges  it, and I stand by that judgment, was less noble. Forty-four Democrats  voted to end the filibuster on the Civil Rights Act, and 23 voted to  sustain it.   So if the Republicans voted with such a strong majority in favor of  ending the filibuster that was propagated by Democratic Senators at the  time against the Civil Rights Act, what has happened since? What has  become of this Republican Party, this party of Abraham Lincoln? In  fact, what has become of the party of Ronald Reagan?   You see, 40 years ago this week, President Reagan proudly signed a  bill  [[Page S7693]]  extending the full protections of the 1965 Voting Rights Act for 25  years. This is what Ronald Reagan, Republican President of the United  States, said: ``For this nation to remain true to its principles, we  cannot allow any American's vote to be denied, diluted, or defiled. The  right to vote,'' he said, ``is the crown jewel of American liberties,  and we will not see its luster diminished.''   What a statement--as powerful and decisive as one might ask from a  Republican President when he extended the Voting Rights Act of 1965.   So I want to commend my friend, and she is my friend, Senator Lisa  Murkowski, the senior Senator from Alaska, for remaining true to the  values of Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan even in this hyperpartisan  age.   Later today, the Senate will vote on whether to begin debate on the  compromise version of the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. The  compromise is the result of months of good-faith negotiation involving  Senator Leahy, the lead Democratic sponsor, my office, as well as  Senator Manchin, Senator Murkowski, and others who support this  legislation. It will restore the original intention and protections of  the 1965 Voting Rights Act, before misguided rulings by the Supreme  Court gutted that magnificent law and rendered many of its critical  protections vulnerable.   When a narrow conservative majority in the Supreme Court struck down  the Voting Rights Act enforcement provision 8 years ago, it concluded  that Congress could come up with a new enforcement formula for our  times. Well, we did. This is it. The John R. Lewis Voting Rights  Advancement Act contains that new formula. It is fair, it is  bipartisan, and we need it urgently to stop the nationwide assault on  voting rights that is being justified by President Trump's Big Lie.   Years ago, in one of the most memorable experiences in my public  life, early on a foggy Sunday morning, I stood on the Edmund Pettus  Bridge in Selma, AL, with my friend John Lewis. The two of us looked  across at that piece of territory just at the bottom of the bridge  where John Lewis nearly died when he was beaten during that march.   John Lewis risked his life so poor people and Black people in the  Deep South could vote.   John Lewis had more moral courage than anyone I have known.   Many of our Republican friends say they revere him too. Well, today  is the chance to show it. John Lewis championed the Voting Rights  Advancement Act in the months before he died. He knew it would protect  the America he loved and the cause he nearly died for.   The bill we will vote to begin debating later today is based on the  same foundation as the Voting Rights Act extension that passed the  Senate unanimously in 2006. Unanimously, it passed. But that was then,  and this is now.   Do you know who voted in 2006 for the protections that we seek to  restore with the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act?   Senator Lisa Murkowski was one of those who did. But also at that  time in 2006, the Senate Republican Leader, Senator Mitch McConnell;  the Senate Republican Whip, Senator John Thune--they voted for it too.  It was a bipartisan, unanimous undertaking.   Next week, Americans will pause to honor the courage and sacrifice of  our veterans. Before we vote on whether to allow the Senate to even  begin debating voting rights, I urge my Republican friends to remember  the words spoken by another President, President Johnson.   He spoke in the Capitol Rotunda, surrounded by Republican and  Democratic Senators of the day and the Reverend Martin Luther King and  other heroes of the long struggle to secure voting rights. President  Johnson called the passage of the Voting Rights Act ``a triumph for  freedom as huge as any victory that has ever been won on any  battlefield.''   For all those--the thousands--who have risked their lives to defend  this country, they were defending not just a name, not just a piece of  geography; they were defending our rights as Americans and they were  prepared to die for it, whether on the foreign battlefield or on a  bridge in Selma.   I urge my Republican colleagues to let the Senate debate voting  rights. Vote ``yes'' for cloture.   I yield the floor.    The Senate will soon be voting on a highly qualified  nominee to the Ninth Circuit, Jennifer Sung.   She is a distinguished jurist who will bring an underrepresented  perspective to the bench. She is a graduate of Oberlin and Yale Law  School. She clerked for Judge Betty Binns Fletcher on the Ninth  Circuit. She received a prestigious Skadden Fellowship and worked on  economic legal issues at the Brennan Center. She spent more than a  decade representing American workers, often minorities from low-income  and underserved communities, in labor disputes.   In 2017, Oregon Governor Kate Brown appointed her to serve on the  Oregon Employment Relations Board, known as the ERB. It is a three- member, quasi-judicial agency charged with resolving labor disputes. As  a member of that board, she sits on a three-member panel that reviews  evidentiary records, independently evaluates the law, and works in a  collaborative manner to reach consensus on opinions and issues. If that  sounds like the same process she would follow in Federal court, it is.  In her nearly 5 years on that board, she has presided over more than  200 matters, and only 3 of the 200 have ever been overturned.   She has exhibited the kinds of qualities we expect of a circuit court  nominee. She has been criticized for one thing that she did in her  life, and some of her critics won't forget it. She signed a letter that  was opposed to Judge Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court. She  has testified under oath before our committee that some statements in  that letter were, in fact, overheated. More importantly, she testified  that she respects the authority of all members of the Supreme Court and  recognizes the importance of faithfully following law and precedent.   The best evidence of how she will serve on the circuit is her  impressive record in the State of Oregon. When you look at that record,  you see that she has the support not only of many colleagues but also  of employees, unions, and employers. Here is what they said:  ``impressive intelligence, diligent preparation, respectful courtroom  demeanor, and judicial impartiality.'' How about that for a checklist  for a judgeship?   When I hear some of my colleagues express outrage over one letter she  signed in her life, I wonder if they remember some of the nominees that  they brought before us in the last 4 years. It appears there is a  double standard.   Ms. Sung has the strong support of Senators Merkley and Wyden, and  the American Bar Association rated her as ``well qualified.'' As the  first Asian-American woman--she will be the first to hold the Oregon  seat in the Ninth Circuit, bringing diversity to that bench. Her  professional accomplishments and her commitment to fairness and  impartiality are profound and impressive.   I support her, and I hope my colleagues will as well.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
