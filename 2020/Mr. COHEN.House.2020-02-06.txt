 Madam Speaker, I am concerned about the lack of diversity,  the lack of care about diversity that this administration shows in its  appointments and its actions.   In the Federal judiciary, the President has appointed approximately  250 judges, 6 of whom are African American. That is a disturbing and  chilling number.   In a Super Bowl ad, he showed Alice Marie Johnson, whom he gave  executive clemency to, a commutation, and said he was trying to help  people who looked like her, an African American woman.   He has given two executive clemencies to African Americans. One was  Jack Johnson, posthumous, dead for 80 years. Only one living African  American has gotten a commutation, and that was when Kim Kardashian  championed her case, as Sylvester Stallone championed that of Jack  Johnson.   During his speech, he talked about the Tuskegee Airman, the woman who  he said would get a scholarship, the young girl. The fact is he just  appointed a TVA Board, Tennessee Valley Board, nine members--no African  Americans, one woman.   The lack of diversity is chilling. America is diverse. It is our  strength. We need to embrace it and not have an all White world.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I adamantly oppose Tennessee's proposal to  block grant its version of Medicaid, TennCare, and the Administration's  proposal for all states to have the opportunity to restrict Medicaid  funding. This proposal would harm Americans most in need across the  country. We should not be encouraging states to limit resources and cap  budgets. In Tennessee, one in ten people have no health insurance. When  this is the case, we should be expanding options for affordable health  care options. Instead, this Administration has relentlessly attacked  Medicaid and the people who depend on its support to stay healthy. The  fact is, the majority of non-disabled, non-elderly adults on Medicaid  are working hard and rely on Medicaid to help get the basic health care  that they need. I am proud to support H. Res. 826 and will continue to  fight for access to health care for all Americans. I urge my colleagues  to do the same.
