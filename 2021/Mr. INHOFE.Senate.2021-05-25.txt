 Mr. President, next week is a summer anniversary, 100  years since the Tulsa massacre. Before 1921, Greenwood District, also  known as Black Wall Street, was a vibrant, thriving, prosperous Black  community. But then, on the evening of May 31 into the early morning of  June 1, 1921, there was a horrific massacre where hundreds of Black  Tulsans were murdered and thousands were made homeless overnight. It  was awful.   But as terrible as it was, that is why it is important to come  together to honor the victims and their families and share their  stories today with future generations. I am honored to cosponsor  Senator Lankford's resolution today to remember this anniversary.   Together, we can all work to lift up the story of Black Wall Street  and use this anniversary to remember, reflect, and work, as we do every  day, toward reconciliation.   I yield the floor.
