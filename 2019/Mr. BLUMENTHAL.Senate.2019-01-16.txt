 Thank you, Madam President.   I join my colleagues today in calling for a simple, commonsense  solution to one of the most vexing, unnecessary, and avoidable crises  in recent history.   The present paralysis of Agencies' essential governmental functions  is intolerable and unacceptable. It is shameful and embarrassing to  every Member of this body, but it should be most shameful and  embarrassing to the Chief Executive of the United States, who is  singularly responsible for it by insisting on a wall and agreement to  it as a condition for reopening the government.   President Trump is singlehandedly blocking progress toward providing  the American people with the services and the essential public  functions they need and deserve.   The impact is on the consumers of those functions. We are all  consumers. We all fly and depend on the air traffic controllers and the  TSA. We all eat food and depend on inspections by the FDA. We all  consume drugs, and the approvals of essential pharmaceutical medicines  are vital to all of us. We all need and deserve the protection provided  by the U.S. Coast Guard, whose brave men and women are receiving no  pay--none.   Many of those 800,000 workers going without pay are also working  without pay. I have sponsored a measure that will enable them to avoid  foreclosures and repossessions of their cars and other financial crises  through measures similar to the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. I have  sponsored and supported calls for providing them with unemployment  compensation. The ones who work need the compensation and the benefits  to put food on the table and make sure they stay in their homes.   These 800,000 workers are experiencing real pain. They are real  people with real lives going through financial hardships.   On Monday, I met with many of them at Bradley International Airport  in Windsor Locks. I heard them share their personal stories about how  the shutdown is causing them real harm. I also heard about their  dedication to doing their job and how the air controllers and----    The TSA are overtired and need that help.   I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute.    Let me just finish by citing Adrian Pellot, one of  those workers whom I met on Monday. Adrian is a behavior detection  officer. He has done it for more than a decade. He is one of those  workers going without pay. I will just leave you with this thought. He  told me:         We have no income right now. We're bleeding money. Just       day-to-day things. Food. I still have to pay the bills.    So do all of those 800,000 workers.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I am honored to follow the Senator,  our neighbor from across the country. We share a common interest and  commitment to one of the great military services in this country, the  U.S. Coast Guard.   Connecticut is proud to be the home of the Coast Guard Academy and  numerous Active-Duty-serving Coast Guard men and women. Not only are we  proud of them, but we are deeply mindful of the debt we owe them. It is  a debt that is immeasurable in dollars and cents. It is a debt we owe  them for the safety and security they provide this country and the  blood they have shed in defense of the country.   Failing to pay them is a moral failure, and that is why I am proud to  be joining the Senator from Washington as well as Senator Thune in a  measure to provide payment for the Coast Guard, and I hope we will meet  this obligation as soon as possible.   We also have an obligation to other Federal workers because they are  suffering and sacrificing during this shutdown, now 26 days long.   One of them, among the workers I met just last Monday, is Adrian  Pellot. He served in the Air Force. He has worked as a behavior  detection officer for more than a decade. He is also one of the TSA  workers at Bradley not receiving pay.   He said to me:         We have no income right now. We are bleeding money. Just       day-to-day things. Food. I still have to pay the bills. The       electric company, the cell phone company--they don't care.       They are brutal. To feel like we are poker chips or leverage       is very, very infuriating. We are people--we have lives--not       just a number to throw around. I want the government to       reopen.    Nothing I say here expresses more eloquently and powerfully the  obligation we are failing to meet.   I will be proposing legislation to provide workers like Adrian  unemployment benefit compensation. States like Connecticut now must  seek approval from the Department of Labor of the United States to  provide unemployment compensation for workers who are on the job but  unpaid.   The workers who are furloughed and unpaid can receive that  compensation. The folks showing up to work, keeping us safe in the  skies, assuring that our security is met at the TSA lines, are unpaid,  and they are uncompensated out of the State workers' compensation  system, and they should be.   That is why I will propose legislation for fundamental fairness and  necessary benefits for workers like Adrian and his partner, Sarah  Small, who has been a TSA officer for over 11 years. She currently  works part time at Bradley as a TSA officer, and she is in nursing  school.   She said to me: ``It's more nerve-racking because of the fact that if  this shutdown lasts any longer, one of us is going to have to find  something.''   They are just two examples of thousands across the country. My  colleagues, every one of you has an Adrian Pellot or a Sarah Small or a  Coast Guard service man and woman or someone like them who are working  without unemployment compensation, having to pay bills, mortgages, put  food on the table. They are unable to do it because the government is  shut down.   Let us reopen the government. Let us meet our obligation. Let us do  our job, and the man down the street on Pennsylvania Avenue in the  White House ought to be doing his job too.   In the meantime, let's help them meet their bills and save them from  debts much as we do servicemembers with their relief fund; another  legislative measure I will be advocating and advancing. We owe it to  them. We owe it to the country.   I yield the floor.
