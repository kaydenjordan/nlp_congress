 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize July 20 as National Pennsylvania Day.   Pennsylvania gained the nickname the ``Keystone State'' because  Thomas Jefferson referred to the Commonwealth as a keystone of the  Federal union for our role in the establishment and the success of the  United States.   Our Commonwealth is where the Declaration of Independence was signed,  our Constitution was written, and our flag was born. It also served as  the first capital back in the early days of our union.   Pennsylvania is the site of famous battles, such as the battle of  Valley Forge during the Revolutionary War and the battle of Gettysburg  during the Civil War. In Pennsylvania, we are proud to be home to the  first hospital, superhighway, and commercial oil well, the Drake Well  in my district. We are also proud to have invented the slinky, little  league baseball, the steam engine, and bubble gum.   All throughout history from our steel and coal mines to our farms and  forests, Pennsylvania has led the way with an inspiring work ethic.   As a lifelong Pennsylvanian, I am proud of all we have done and look  forward to our future. I am proud to represent nearly one-third of the  land mass of our great Commonwealth.   Madam Speaker, to all Pennsylvanians, happy Pennsylvania day.                            ____________________
