 Colonel Vindman, if I can turn your attention       to the April 21 call that is the first call between President       Trump and President Zelensky. Did you prepare talking points       for the President's use during that call?        Colonel VINDMAN. Yes, I did.         Do those talking points include rooting out       corruption in Ukraine?        Colonel VINDMAN. Yes.         That was something the President was supposed       to raise in the conversation with President Zelensky?        Colonel VINDMAN. Those were the recommended talking points       that were cleared through NSC staff for the President, yes.    Ms. Manager LOFGREN. The materials provided for the July 25 call that  Lieutenant Colonel Vindman mentioned are highly relevant. They could  help confirm that the President's actual statements to President  Zelensky were unrelated to the foreign policy objectives of his own  administration and show that they served his own personal interest at  the expense of America's national security interest.   These documents also include handwritten notes and other documents  that White House officials generated during the calls and meetings. We  know, for example, that Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, Mr. Morrison, and  Jennifer Williams all testified to taking contemporaneous handwritten  notes during the July 25 call. Ms. Williams and Lieutenant Colonel  Vindman both testified that President Zelensky made an exclusive  reference to Burisma that was not included in the memorandum that the  White House released to the public. Here is a clip of their testimony.   [Text of Videotape presentation:]          Both of you recall President Zelensky in that       conversation raising the issue or mentioning Burisma; do you       not?         And yet the word ``Burisma'' appears nowhere in       the call record that has been released to the public; is that       right?
