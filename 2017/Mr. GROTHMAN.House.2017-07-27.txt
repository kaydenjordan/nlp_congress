 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 8, line 23, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced       by $30,000,000)''.        Page 22, line 17, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $30,000,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 478, the gentleman  from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairwoman and ranking member for their  collaborative effort to bring this bill forward.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment to H.R. 3219. Nothing  is more important than the safety of our men and women in uniform, and  I believe that we in Congress are committed to ensuring our armed  services receive the best equipment possible. This equipment includes  platforms like the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, or JLTV. This vehicle  is the centerpiece of the Army and Marine Corps' tactical wheeled  vehicle modernization strategy and closes an existing critical  capability gap for both services.   The JLTV demonstrates many significant improvements over the current  vehicle fleet, including strengthened protection for passengers against  current and future battlefield threats, more payload capacity, and  better automotive performance.   This is basically what replaces years ago what you would call your  Jeep. Anybody who talks to veterans or hears about people being injured  and all, so many of them died or were seriously injured driving in a  vehicle that hit an explosive. These vehicles are going to be a  dramatic improvement over what we have now as far as saving lives in  our troops.   As long as we have troops in Afghanistan, it is important that, as  quickly as possible, we deliver the best equipment possible. To achieve  that goal, Congress should maintain its support for the existing JLTV  acquisition plan.   Recently, we in the House passed the National Defense Authorization  Act of 2018. My amendment to this appropriations bill would simply  transfer funds from the operations and maintenance account in the bill  and then appropriate those funds to the JLTV program to bring them in  line with what we in the House authorized in the NDAA.   The JLTV program supports American jobs with more than 300 suppliers  from 30 States. Pure and simple, the JLTV platform will save lives and  improve our troops' effectiveness in the field. I encourage my  colleagues to support this amendment.    I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Chair, I would like to thank the Appropriations  Committee for the hard work they have done.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).   The amendment was agreed to.                     Amendment No. 31 Offered by Mr. Dunn    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 31  printed in part B of House Report 115-261.
