 Mr. President, while I am disappointed that we didn't  continue the tradition of alternating speakers, I am glad that I got to  hear both of the previous speakers.   I used to work with the Senators from Colorado to make sure that  there were pictures taken annually from the same spots to show the way  the trees are dying. There was an infestation that was causing this.  The only reason we don't still take those pictures is all the trees are  dead. You can't show that it is spreading when they are all dead. They  need to be cleaned up, and I am glad there is work being done on forest  management.   On healthcare, there is some effort being made between Senator  Alexander and Senator Murray to get a bipartisan bill, but what we need  to do around here is get some of the appointments finished up so that  the President can have the people in place to solve these problems. We  are having to spend 30 hours on the cloture of a district judge. I have  never heard of that. I have been here 21 years now, and I have never  heard of that. We have to get the appointments through. That is one of  our prime jobs--to provide advice and consent for the President--and it  is not happening on a timely basis.   We have had to do 44 cloture motions on different people for the  administration. At this point in President Obama's first term, that had  only happened five times. With the previous President, it hadn't  happened at all, and the previous one, it had only happened once.  Already 44 times this year, it has taken us around 30 hours to get  somebody through the process, and we have hundreds waiting to get  through the process. That is one of our primary jobs. If we can't get  those through the process, it is pretty hard for us to do the  legislation we need to do.
