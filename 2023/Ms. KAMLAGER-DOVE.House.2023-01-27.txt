 Mr. Chair, today, I rise in opposition to H.R. 21.   Once again, Republicans are selling out the American people to their  Big Oil friends. Oil companies are not even using the thousands of  permits to drill on public lands that they currently hold, and  Republicans want to add another 300 million acres to this oil carnage.   Big Oil rakes in record profits while poisoning the Earth and anyone  who lives and works near their oil fields.   The Inglewood Oil Field is in my district and has been toxifying the  predominantly Black and Brown communities near it for decades. There is  literally oil bubbling up through the sidewalks.   Back in April, more than 1,600 gallons of oil spilled from the field,  spewing toxins into the air, and Republicans want more of that  everywhere. Not caring if people literally have clean air to breathe  doesn't sound very pro-life to me.   This ``drill, baby, drill'' attitude isn't making the United States  any safer or more economically competitive. It is killing Mother Earth  and us.   H.R. 21 is derelict to the American people, and I urge my colleagues  to protect what is left of our public lands and vote against H.R. 21.
