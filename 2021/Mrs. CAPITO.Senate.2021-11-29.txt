 Madam President, I rise today to honor a good  friend of mine for the work she has done for women in recovery. Marie  Beaver is retiring after 18 years as the executive director of Rea of  Hope, a very successful recovery program and facility in my hometown of  Charleston, WV, which she built from the ground up.   Although Marie is not a native of West Virginia, she found her way to  our State as a result of her marriage to her husband, Carl Beaver.  Shortly after her arrival, Marie was hired and started working to  create Rea of Hope just before the full scope of the addiction epidemic  was recognized.   Working with little money and a lot of help from volunteers,  including the organization's board of directors, and donated labor from  a work release program, Marie transformed a deteriorating home on the  East End of Charleston into our State's first recovery home for women.   Marie's personal experience as a recovering addict shaped the  foundation of Rea of Hope as an abstinence only, no tolerance recovery  home. Residents are expected to find and hold a job, pay rent, attend  12-step meetings, and take responsibility for the mistakes of their  past and pay their debts. Personal responsibility is a tenet of the  program and Rea of Hope has a long list of successful graduates who  have completed their high school and college degrees, are employed in  both the public sector and privately owned businesses, are becoming  first-time homebuyers, and, most importantly, are being reunited with  their children, providing safe, loving homes.   The home's success is how I met Marie. The White House Drug Czar  under President George W. Bush, John P. Walters, visited Rea of Hope  with me early in my congressional career. Marie was a gracious hostess,  and the Drug Czar was very impressed with what he saw and experienced.  A rose bush was brought from the White House on that visit, which was  planted, and I believe is still in Rea of Hope's front yard.   As a next step, Marie realized that there were no affordable, safe  apartments to rent for graduates of the program in the Charleston area.  She began arranging financing and buying apartment properties and  renting them to the graduates. As a result, graduates are able to learn  about renting and the associated costs, but do not have to worry about  unruly neighbors or drugs or alcohol being on the premises. The  apartments have created a sober community where women take care of one  another and their children, as built-in baby sitters when mothers have  to work or attend a 12-step meeting. This successful model of recovery  has helped 250 women from 44 West Virginia counties learn to live  sober, responsible lives. The annual fundraiser named, ``Miracle on Lee  Street'' reflecting Rea of Hope's address is a very fitting name. If  success is measured by the difference you make, Rea of Hope's success  is immeasurable.   Marie and her husband Carl have decided to retire and return to her  home State of South Carolina to be near family, the ocean, and her  beloved Clemson Tigers. Marie made West Virginia her home over the  nearly 20 years she lived here, cultivating friendships, whether  professionally or personally throughout the State. She put such a  positive face on recovery and exemplified that long-term recovery is  possible and so rewarding.   Thank you, Marie, for the terrific work you have done and the example  you and Rea of Hope have set as a model for recovery. Marie has  established a high standard, and I am sure Rea of Hope will maintain  the quality of service that she performed.   I wish Marie the best, and like all who know her, I will miss her. I  am proud to call Marie friend and fellow West Virginian.                            ____________________
