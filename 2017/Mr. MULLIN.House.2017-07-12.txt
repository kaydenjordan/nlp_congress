 Mr. Speaker, this spring in my district in Oklahoma, the  McAlpin family of Tahlequah lost their 2-year-old son, Kai, to  pediatric cancer. Kai's parents refer to Kai as Warrior Kai because he  fought cancer every day with courage and dedication like a true  warrior. Included in H.R. 2430 today is the RACE for Children Act,  which aims to create new and better pediatric treatment options for  warriors like Kai.   Currently, there are over 900 drugs in development to treat cancer in  adults, while only a handful of drugs are being developed to fight  cancer in children. Clearly, those statistics show that the law has not  kept up with scientific innovation.    RACE can help deliver lifesaving treatments for pediatric cancer  patients by updating the Pediatric Research Act. This bill requires all  drug manufacturers to test a new drug in a pediatric population before  applying it to children during cancer treatment. RACE for Children puts  safety first and ensures that researchers use scientific evidence when  declaring effectiveness of a drug before providing it to patients.   I am glad to see the RACE for Children Act included today, and I  thank Chairman McCaul and Congressman Butterfield for their work on the  bill. The fight of Warrior Kai continues with us.
