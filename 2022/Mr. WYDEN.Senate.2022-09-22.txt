 Mr. President, we are now several weeks on from the  passage of the Inflation Reduction Act.   The IRA is transformational legislation that will improve the lives  of millions and millions of Americans: more affordable prescription  drugs, cheaper energy bills, the largest investment in the climate in  history, a serious commitment to cracking down on tax cheats who rip  off the American people for billions of dollars every year, and  ensuring that corporations pay a fair share.   I am proud to say that the vast majority of the Inflation Reduction  Act came from the Finance Committee majority.   It is no exaggeration to say that the team on the committee and in my  personal office collectively spent thousands and thousands of hours  developing these proposals, building support for them under zero margin  for error, and guaranteeing that they would pass under challenging  Senate rules.   Senate Democrats spent more than a year debating what would go into  this bill before it finally came together, but the staff of the Finance  Committee began its work long before that. Some of the components of  the IRA go back more than a decade.   So before the Senate goes out in the coming days, I wanted to come  down to the floor to thank my committee and personal office staff, as  well as the brilliant teams at the Joint Committee on Tax,  Congressional Budget Office, and legislative counsel who made this  achievement possible.   I will shout out a few specifics as I thank the staff, but understand  that legislation this significant is always a collaborative effort. And  furthermore, there are major priorities that did not make it into the  final version of the IRA, and the staff who worked on those issues  deserve credit, too.   I will start out with Tiffany Smith, who leads the best and hardest  working tax policy team there is.   Bobby Andres has honcho'd the Clean Energy for America Act for 7-plus  years. He tweaked and edited and improved that bill so many times, he  can probably recite the text in his sleep.   Chris Arneson, Jon Goldman, and Sarah Schaefer have been instrumental  in going after the tax loopholes that allow massive, profitable  corporations to get away with paying little to nothing. Their work on  those issues is going to continue to find its way into law.   Adam Carasso and Eric LoPresti helped to make sure the IRS has the  resources it needs to go after wealthy tax cheats who skip out on  paying what they owe.   And proof positive that Finance Teams support one another: Drew  Crouch contributed tax policy help to the prescription drug reforms.   Rachael Kauss has put a ton of work into developing the billionaire's  income tax, and although that proposal didn't make it in the final  bill, there is more support than ever for making sure that those at the  very top pay a fair share like everybody else.   Grace Enda assisted on the clean energy tax policies and more. Ursula  Clausing supported the tax team and also made sure that our team and  Senate Democrats were ready and organized for a tough floor debate.  Arthur Shemitz and Melanie Jonas also supported the tax team's hard  work.   One other point about the Finance Committee majority's tax team--and  this applies across the board, not just to the Inflation Reduction Act.  If anybody out there mistakenly believes it is easy to offset the  legislation passed here in the Senate, it is only because our tax team,  time and time again, makes it look effortless. The truth is, it takes a  ton of hard work, but they get it done.   Patricio Gonzalez, a member of the committee's investigations team,  has been digging into the tax practices of some of the biggest drug  companies out there. His work went a long way to convincing key  Senators that our corporate tax laws needed reform. Ryder Tobin,  another member of the investigations team, contributed to that work and  also helped us survive the grueling floor debate, as did Madison  Moskowitz, Claire Kaliban, and Bonnie Million.   Next up: healthcare. When it comes to drug prices, Big Pharma has had  a stranglehold on the U.S. Senate for a long, long time. A lot of  people have gone up against Big Pharma and lost. Shawn Bishop and the  Finance Committee health team took on Big Pharma and won.   Anna Kaltenboeck played a key role in our efforts on finally allowing  Medicare to negotiate on behalf of seniors for a better deal on  prescription drugs. She also worked with Raghav Aggarwal on crafting  the Senate version of drug price negotiation, as well as key  protections for seniors in Medicare Part D. That includes a $2,000  annual out-of-pocket cap on their medications and a  [[Page S4954]]  price-gouging penalty for drug companies that hike prices faster than  inflation.   At a time when families in Oregon and across the country are getting  hit by rising prices, Eva DuGoff worked on extending subsidies for ACA  health insurance coverage. It will save people hundreds of dollars a  year and a family of four up to $2,400 a year.   Peter Fise worked on capping the out-of-pocket cost of insulin for  seniors at $35 per month--another huge savings for many Americans. Liz  Dervan expanded Medicaid's coverage of vaccines for adults.   There is a long list of people who pitched in on the vital process of  making sure the bill was compliant with the rules of the Senate known  as the Byrd Rules. It includes Liz Dervan, whose legal acumen was  invaluable to supporting the committee's efforts to navigate the Byrd  rule, as well as major efforts by Peter Fise, Kristen Lunde, Kimberly  Lattimore, Mary Ellis and Daniel Whittam from the health team. It also  includes Sally Laing and Virginia Lenahan from our trade team, who  contributed to the clean energy provisions.   When it comes to Byrd rules, the point man on the Finance Committee  is our chief counsel, Mike Evans. For all the months of work that goes  into writing legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act, the whole  thing can come crashing down if it doesn't comply with the Byrd rules.  Nobody is more skilled or experienced than Mike at making sure  legislation is Byrd-compliant from the start and protecting it in Byrd  rule arguments before the Senate Parliamentarian. Opposing counsels  weep when they see Mike Evans and his stacks of papers enter the room.  Reconciliation under the Byrd rule is arduous work, yet Mike approaches  it with humor and grace along with great skill.   Mike is a valued member of my senior leadership team, who have  directed years of effort that made the IRA possible. I want to thank  him, Jeff Michels, Joshua Sheinkman, Sarah Bittleman, John Dickas, and  Isaiah Akin for guiding the team through setbacks and struggles to get  this bill done.   The Finance Committee's communications leads on the IRA were Ashley  Schapitl on tax and investigations; Taylor Harvey on healthcare; Ryan  Carey, speechwriter; and Emily Zahnle-Hostetler, digital director. The  IRA dealt with some incredibly complicated policy issues, and it  challenged a lot of powerful special interests. But our team got the  word out and stood up to withering attacks in the press and here in the  Senate.    The Finance Committee works with many, many skilled and dedicated  staff at the Joint Committee on Taxation on a daily basis. Suffice it  to say, we would be out in the cold without Tom Barthold and the team  of all-stars at JCT:         Rob Harvey        Chris Giosa        Tim Dowd        Cecily Rock        Natalie Tucker        Ross Margelefsky        Jeff Arbeit        Jared Hermann        Carol Wang        Kristine Roth        Harold Hirsch        Sanjay Misra        Clare Diefenbach        Rhonda Migdail        Andrew Lai        David Lenter        Vivek Chandrasekhar        Chia Chang        Lin Xu        James Elwell        Kelly Scanlon        Sally Kwak        Chris Overend        Kashi Way        Bert Lue        Deirdre James        Connor Dowd        Nick Bull        Melani Houser        Tanya Butler    The same goes for the highly skilled and dedicated team at the  nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office under Director Phil Swagel.  They do a difficult job to keep Congress informed of what proposed  changes to our Federal programs will cost and always come through under  extremely tight deadlines:         Terri Gullo        Leo Lex        Paul Masi        Chad Chirico        Lara Robillard        Asha Saavoss        Stuart Hammond        Carrie Colla        Tamara Hayford        Christopher Adams        Evan Herrnstadt        Colin Baker        Scott Laughery        and other CBO staff who analyzed drug pricing in the U.S.       over the last decade.    And finally I want to thank the talented legal team at the Senate  legislative counsel's office who help committee staff write the law--on  tax policies, Mark McGunagle, Jim Fransen, Allison Otto, and Vince  Gaiani; on health policies, John Goetcheus, Kelly Thornburg, Ruth Ernst  and Phil Lynch.   Whether you are talking about JCT, CBO or legislative counsel, the  Congress grinds to a halt without their work.   Finally, I would like to commend the work of the Senate  Parliamentarian and her assistants. A reconciliation bill turns up a  lot of highly complex procedural questions, and the Parliamentarian has  to make the calls. I was not happy with all of the decisions, but the  Parliamentarians worked tirelessly, skillfully, and with an even hand.  Also, I would like to thank the clerks and floor staff for their work  and endurance during the vote-a-rama.   The debate the American people read about and watched on TV is just a  small portion of all the work that went into the Inflation Reduction  Act. It can be awfully frustrating to spend years developing  legislation when Congress is this polarized. We dealt with a lot of  setbacks. At certain points, we thought it was over. And there is still  a lot more to get done.   But the IRA truly is an accomplishment that will improve life for the  American people: more affordable medications, more affordable health  insurance, cheaper energy, the biggest ever investment in the fight  against climate change, major progress cracking down on tax cheats and  improving tax fairness--that is progress to be proud of. I thank the  Finance Committee majority staff, my personal office staff, and all the  other teams who contributed to this effort.   I yield the floor.
