 Madam Speaker, this is an amazing story. I hope  everybody will follow it.   Madam Speaker, I recognize Wounded Warrior Week, sponsored by the  American Legion Post 469, and Sergeant First Class Richard Stayskal,  United States Army.   In 2001, Richard joined the United States Marines. In 2004, in the  Anbar province of Iraq, Richard was critically wounded by a bullet that  passed through his arm and pierced his lung. After surgeries, PTSD, and  rehab, he was honorably discharged from the United States Marine Corps.   But he was not done serving his Nation yet.   Richard reenlisted in 2006 with the U.S. Army and became an elite  Green Beret. He was both in the Marines and in the Army in his  lifetime. Richard was recently diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and  is now in the fight of his life.   Richard, you have led a life to be emulated. You make me proud to be  an American. I know you will fight this fight, give it hell, and you  are going to win. God bless you.   Thank you, Richard. And thank you American Legion Post 469 for  honoring this American hero.                            ____________________
