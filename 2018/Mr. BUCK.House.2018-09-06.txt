 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call  up House Resolution 1051 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1051         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 6691) to       amend title 18, United States Code, to clarify the definition       of ``crime of violence'', and for other purposes. All points       of order against consideration of the bill are waived. The       bill shall be considered as read. All points of order against       provisions in the bill are waived. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on any       amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion       except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled       by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       the Judiciary; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 2.  It shall be in order at any time on the       legislative day of September 13, 2018, for the Speaker to       entertain motions that the House suspend the rules as though       under clause 1 of rule XV. The Speaker or his designee shall       consult with the Minority Leader or her designee on the       designation of any matter for consideration pursuant to this       section.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the  underlying legislation. This rule makes in order one bill dealing with  a pressing legal issue.   Mr. Speaker, under the Immigration and Nationality Act, or INA, an  immigrant convicted of certain felonies is subject to deportation. In  order to qualify for this particular provision of the INA, an immigrant  must be convicted of a crime of violence.   The statute defines ``crime of violence'' as an offense that, ``by  its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the  person or property of another may be used in the course of committing  the offense.''   This has been a longstanding and roundly accepted policy of the U.S.  Government. For years, we have deported dangerous criminal immigrants.   However, earlier this year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that how the  law defined ``crime of violence'' was impermissibly vague. The result  of the ruling threw all of these kinds of deportation cases into  question.   Historically, this realm of immigration law has never been an area of  law to which the Court has applied constitutional rights. But writing  the ruling for the majority, Justice Elena Kagan applied due process  rights afforded by the Constitution to the removal process of criminal  immigrants. Because the Court applied the Constitution in this manner,  it concluded that the term ``crime of violence'' could be applied  arbitrarily and unpredictably.   Chief Justice John Roberts warned of the path down which this ruling  could lead as it pertains to other provisions of Federal criminal law.  In fact, his concerns were justifiable.   In May, the Tenth Circuit struck down a similar provision in another  portion of Federal law relating to using weapons in the commission of a  crime. That particular case resulted in the sentence of a man convicted  for firebombing a store with a Molotov cocktail being vacated.   Then again, in August, the D.C. Circuit struck down convictions of  two men who were convicted for a violent criminal act. This ruling  opened up the possibility that convictions for criminal acts involving  firearms can be overturned.   Mr. Speaker, this is the backdrop against which we consider this bill  today. This legislation, the Community Safety and Security Act, plugs  the gaps in Federal law created by these recent court rulings.   It specifies the circumstances by which a criminal offense should be  construed as a crime of violence. In particular, a crime of violence  will include crimes of murder, sexual abuse, kidnapping, robbery,  domestic violence, human trafficking, and many other types of violent  acts.   By clearly outlining Congress' intent of what constitutes a violent  crime, this bill will eliminate the Court's concerns about ambiguity  and will allow our law enforcement agencies to continue carrying out  their duties to protect the American public.   Mr. Speaker, law and order is a crucial component of a healthy  society. We are beginning to see the effects of feel-good policies in  some locales on the crime rate in those areas, particularly the violent  crime rate. When law and order breaks down in our communities, the  residents suffer.   I am confident there is no intention to erode law and order or  embolden criminals. However, the effects are just the same. That is why  this legislation is so critical.   We need to ensure that there is a clear definition of violent crime,  so that courts across this country are not boxed in by this Supreme  Court ruling and do not have to vacate sentences or release violent  criminals onto our streets.   Mr. Speaker, I have spent more than 2 decades fighting crime, both at  the Federal level and in my own community. The impact of crime, and  violent crime in particular, on victims is heartbreaking. Watching  someone suffer the worst of societal ills is bad enough when justice is  served. But watching a victim suffer not just the crime, but the lack  of justice, is infuriating.   We need to fix this loophole carved by these rulings and defend our  communities from criminals. We need to stand up for victims of violent  crime and see that the justice that we all want for them is served.   I support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would make an inquiry of my friend. I have  no Members here to speak, and I am prepared to close if my friend is.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I appreciate my friend from Florida and his views on open and closed  rules and the importance of open rules and the importance of amendments  and the importance to an open process.   The fact is the Democrats continue to focus on closed rules versus  open rules, ignoring the structured amendment process, which has  routinely been used by both majorities.   If we are going to use that metric for measuring openness, I want to  clarify a couple of points for the record. Sixteen of the closed rules  cited by the minority were rolling back regulations under the  Congressional Review Act, which does not allow for amendments, to  ensure that only a majority vote is required in the Senate.                                time  1245    Another 12 closed rules were for bills where the majority put out a  call for amendments but received no amendments.   And if my friends from the other side of the aisle believe that open  rules are the only measure of success, it is only fair that we clarify  for the American people the Democrat majority's record.   In the 111th Congress, under Speaker Pelosi, the majority had zero  open rules. However, as we have already stated in the past, comparing  open to closed rules ignores the structured amendment process. This  majority has made it a priority to make in order large numbers of  amendments for floor consideration, a majority of those with a Democrat  sponsor and/or cosponsor.   In fact, as of July 24, 2018, Republicans in the 115th Congress, in  which we serve now, have provided for the consideration of over 1,650  amendments on the House floor; over 745 Democrat amendments, or 45  percent of the total number of amendments; over 630 Republican  amendments or 38 percent of the total amendments; and over 280  bipartisan amendments, or 17 percent of the total amendments.   In the 114th Congress, the last Congress to have served, the  Republican majority allowed over 1,700 amendments to be considered on  the House floor.   In the 113th Congress the Republican majority allowed over 1,500  amendments to be considered on the House floor.   And in the entire 111th Congress, Speaker Pelosi, and the Democrats  allowed less than 1,000 amendments to be considered on the floor.   I just wanted to make sure that we put into perspective the arguments  from my friend.   Mr. Speaker, it is really fairly simple. Law and order is being  jeopardized as it relates to the term, ``crime of violence.'' This bill  plugs the gap left in our laws by the court's ruling.   Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of different viewpoints across this  country about our criminal justice and immigration system, but there  are two nearly universally held beliefs by Americans: one, criminals  should receive justice; and two, criminal immigrants should be  deported.   While we can debate many aspects of our criminal code, we must not  waiver in our commitment to protect the American people from criminals  and to bring justice to victims. There have been numerous cases lately  of immigrants committing violent crimes against Americans. Some of  these cases are too recent to even mention by name here today. We must  stand with victims and their families and remove criminal immigrants  from this country. It is unjust to do anything else.  [[Page H7885]]    Our country is great, in part, because of our commitment to law and  order. It is wrong to pursue a softening of our response to violent  crime. To do so would invite more crime and produce more victims.   We must uphold the rule of law in America. Americans want it.  Americans deserve it. That is exactly what this bill does. It defines  violent crimes so that our immigration and criminal justice systems  will have the tools necessary to remove violent immigrants from our  country.   Mr. Speaker, I call on my colleagues to support this bill. Uphold law  and order. Vote ``yes'' on the previous question. Vote ``yes'' on the  resolution. And vote ``yes'' on the underlying bill.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 1051 Offered by Mr. Hastings         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       3773) to amend the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act       of 1990 and the Head Start Act to promote child care and       early learning, and for other purposes. The first reading of       the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce. After       general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment       under the five-minute rule. All points of order against       provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of       consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall       rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as       may have been adopted. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to       final passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of       the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution       on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House       shall, immediately after the third daily order of business       under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the       Whole for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 3773.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
