 Mr. President I thank my colleague from Delaware, Senator  Tom Carper. He and I came to the House of Representatives together many  years ago. He went off on another assignment as Governor of his State,  and then came back and ran for the U.S. Senate. We are lucky to have  him. He is a great Senator, a great friend, and a great colleague. He  takes on important issues every day on behalf of his State and the  Nation, and I thank him for his support for this conversation about  DACA and Dreamers.   I would like to take a little different approach to this than I  usually do on the floor, and I have come to the floor many times to  talk about it.   I would like for everyone here who is listening to this debate to  pause and think for a minute: What is the worst job you have ever had-- the worst job? Maybe it was the worst job because it was boring, and  boring jobs are terrible. But there are some pretty bad jobs out there.   I could tell you my worst job. I was working my way through college  in what we euphemistically call a packinghouse. In the old days, they  called them slaughterhouses. What happened was that hogs came off the  truck in one door, and two days later pork chops and bacon went out the  back door. In between, there were some pretty awful jobs--hot, dirty,  smelly, and dangerous jobs.   I took it as a college student because it paid $3.65 an hour in the  1960s--pretty darned good, in fact, better than anything else I could  find. I raised enough money working there four different summers to go  to college. There was never any doubt at the end of the summer that I  was going to stay with my job and not go to college. I couldn't wait to  go to college in the hopes that I would never have to work in a  packinghouse or slaughterhouse again in my life.   Take a look today at the packinghouses, slaughterhouses, and poultry  processing places across the United States of America, and I will tell  you, almost without exception, what you will find. Take a look at the  workers who come out of those places at the end of the workday. They  are tired, they are sweaty, and they are dirty, and they are, by and  large, immigrants--people who come to this country from other places.   In Beardstown, IL, there is a processing place, near the central part  of my State, and the workers there are largely Hispanic and African.  They are immigrants who have come to this country and, like generations  of immigrants before them, were prepared to take the worst, dirtiest,  hardest jobs available just to make it in America.   Go to the restaurants in Chicago, if you want a contrast from what I  just described. We are lucky. I am lucky to represent that city, but we  are lucky to have some of the greatest restaurants, I think, in our  country. I would put them up against any city. I sat down with a person  who owned some of those restaurants and talked to him about the  immigration issue.   He said: Senator, if you took the undocumented people and the  immigrant people out of the restaurants and hotels of Chicago, we would  close our doors. We couldn't operate without them.   Oh, you don't see them in the front of the house--not your waiter and  not the maitre d' or the person who takes your reservation. But just  look at who carried the dishes off the table, and take a look through  that door when it swings open at who is working back there in that hot  kitchen. Over and over, you are going to find immigrants and  undocumented people. So they are part of America, and they are part of  our economy and, even more, they are part of our history.   We have had debates about immigration from the beginning. I say  jokingly that when the Mayflower landed and they got off the boats, a  lot of them looked over their shoulders and said: I hope no more of  these folks are coming.   But they kept coming. They came in the thousands, even in the  millions, from all over the world, anxious to be a part of the future  of the United States of America.   A ship landed in Baltimore in July of 1911, and a woman came down the  gangplank with three kids. She was coming from Lithuania. She landed in  Baltimore with those three kids--one of them a 2-year-old girl she was  holding in her arms--and tried to find her way around Baltimore, MD,  because she didn't speak English.   Somehow or another she found that train station, got on the Baltimore  and Ohio Railroad, and somehow or another she made it to East St.  Louis, IL--her idea of a land of opportunity in 1911. There she was  reunited with her husband, and there she made a life--a hard,  challenging life but one that led to good things. The 2-year-old girl  she was carrying was my mother, and my mother was an immigrant to this  country. In my office upstairs behind my desk is my mother's  naturalization certificate. I keep it there to remind myself and  everyone visiting who I am, my family's story, and America's story.   If you think that we have come to accept immigration as part of  America, then you don't understand the history. We have had our ups and  downs when it comes to immigration laws. There have been times when in  this Chamber--in this Senate Chamber--there were debates that led to  the decision to exclude people from certain parts of the world who were  no longer welcome in America. The most notorious in modern times was in  1924. The object of our immigration exclusionary law was to keep out  undesirable people from the United States of America. Who fell into  that category in 1924? Jewish people, Italians, people from Eastern  Europe--people from where my family came from. We made it clear in the  law there would be quotas, and we were not going to accept people who  were not desirable for the future of America. That was in 1924.   Let me read you this incredible statement that was made. When  President Calvin Coolidge signed the 1924 law justifying the quotas  excluding Jews, Italians, Eastern Europeans, and others, here is what  the President of the United States said in 1924:         There are racial considerations too grave to be brushed       aside. Biological laws tell us that certain people will not       mix or blend. The Nordics propagate themselves successfully.       With other races, the outcome shows deterioration on both       sides.    President Calvin Coolidge, 1924, signed that immigration law. That  was the law in the land of America for 41 years. Our attitude toward  parts of the world and whether people from those parts were welcome was  determined in  [[Page S696]]  1924 and defined by this Presidential statement.   Then, in 1965, we passed the Immigration and Nationality Act that  established our current system. Do you know what we said was the  bedrock of that system? Reuniting families, bringing people to this  country and allowing them to not only make it in America but to make a  family in America.   How many times have those of us in politics stood up and talked about  faith and family and flag? I believe those words. I think my colleagues  do too. When it came to immigration, that was the bedrock of what we  were going to do--to make sure that families could be reunited in  America.   That 1965 law replaced the strict national origin quotas of the 1924  immigration law that favored Northern Europeans and excluded Asians.  That was one of the other groups excluded under the 1924 law.   When President Lyndon Johnson signed that 1965 law, he said: ``It  corrects a cruel and enduring wrong. . . . For over four decades the  immigration policy of the United States has been twisted and distorted  by the harsh injustice of the national origins quota system.''   The Cato Institute is a research group. I don't usually quote them  because they are on the other side of the political spectrum. I am on  the left side, and they are on the right side. But I am going to quote  them tonight because what they had to say about the proposal coming  from the White House about immigration is worth hearing. The White  House is part of changing immigration laws in America. It wants to  dramatically reduce legal immigration by prohibiting American citizens  from sponsoring their parents, siblings, and adult or married children  as immigrants. We are talking literally about millions of relatives of  American citizens who have done the right thing by following our  immigration laws, and some have waited in line 20 years to be reunited  with their families in America--20 years waiting for the day when their  families could be together again. Listen to what the Cato Institute, a  conservative think tank, says about the proposal from the White House,  which has been introduced in the Senate by two of my colleagues. This  is what Cato says:         [I]n the most likely scenario, the new plan would cut the       number of legal immigrants by up to 44 percent or half a       million immigrants annually--the largest policy-driven legal       immigration cut since the 1920s.        Compared to current law, it would exclude nearly 22 million       people from the opportunity to immigrate legally to the       United States over the next five decades.    You have to go back to 1924 to find that kind of reduction in legal  immigration in America. What is it about? Is it about security? No.  Every single person we are talking about has to go through a serious  criminal national security background check before they will ever be  allowed into the United States. It isn't automatic. You have to be  thoroughly investigated. Some of them wait 20 years with all these  investigations for the chance.   Is it about jobs? Think back to those jobs these immigrants take in  the United States. How many of us would say: My son--I am so proud-- didn't know what to do with his life. I told him: Well, why don't you  consider washing dishes at a restaurant in Chicago? Why don't you  consider working in a packing house in Beardstown, IL? Why don't you  consider landscaping?   Those are not the jobs we want to see for our children, and they are  jobs that go vacant unless immigrants and people like them are willing  to pick our fruit and our vegetables, milk the cows, and do the hard  work that is required in so many different parts of America.   We have, at this point, an important decision to make, not just as a  Senate but as a nation. On September 5, President Donald Trump  announced the end of the DACA Program. March 5 is the deadline. As of  March 5, 1,000 young people every single day will lose the protection  of DACA and be subject to deportation and unable to work legally in  America. Who are they? Twenty thousand of them are teachers--teachers  in grade schools and high schools around America who will lose their  jobs on March 5 as their DACA protection expires. Nine hundred of them,  undocumented, will lose their opportunity to serve in the United States  military. That is right--undocumented. They took the oath that they  would risk and give their lives for America to serve in our military.  On March 5, as their DACA protection expires, they will be asked to  leave the military of the United States of America.    I can't tell you how many thousands of students will find it  impossible to continue school because they can no longer legally work  in America. I can tell you about 30 med students, premed students at  Loyola University in Chicago. They told me the reality. At the end of  medical school, you finish your education with a clinical experience, a  residency--not 40 hours a week, sometimes 80 hours a week, but it is a  job. You better take it, and you better learn the clinical side of  medicine if you are going to be a good doctor. When they lose their  DACA protection, they lose their legal right to work in America, and  they cannot apply for a residency. It is an end of their medical  education because President Trump had a deadline that said: On March 5,  it's over.   Here we are. What have we done in the 5 months since the President  challenged us to fix the problem he created? We have done absolutely  nothing. Nothing. Not one bill has passed in the House or Senate,  despite the President's challenge and despite the disastrous impact  this is going to have on hundreds of thousands of people across the  United States of America.   I shouldn't say that we have done nothing. Some people in this debate  have sent out a lot of tweets. Boy, that sure helps. There have been a  lot of press releases and press conferences, but not a single bill has  come to the floor. That is going to change. That is going to change  very quickly. Senator McConnell, the Republican leader--and I take him  at his word because he said it publicly, he said it privately, and I  have told him personally ``You said it, and I believe you''--is going  to call this measure for a vote in the Senate next week.   For those of you who tune in to C-SPAN or visit in the Chamber here,  please show up next week because something is going to happen on the  Senate floor that hasn't happened in a year and a half--maybe longer.  We are actually going to have a debate. This empty Chamber will have  people in it. We will be considering a bill. People will be offering  amendments. We will be debating it on the floor. For some of my Senate  colleagues, it is the first time they will ever see this happen. We  don't do that anymore, but we are going to do it on this important  issue, and we should. The reason we should is not just because the  President issued the challenge and not just because so many lives are  hanging in the balance. It is because when we get down to this issue,  it becomes extremely personal.   Today for the 108th time, I am going to tell the story of a Dreamer.  I use the word ``Dreamer'' because I am proud of it. The President said  at the Republican retreat: Don't ever use that word ``Dreamer.''   I use it because I introduced the DREAM Act in 2001. Before I  introduced that bill, if you said ``Dreamer,'' people thought you were  talking about a British rock group with a guy named Freddie. We created  the DREAM Act, and I want to tell you the story of this Dreamer. This  is Saba Nafees. She is the 108th Dreamer I have told the story of on  the floor. When she was 11 years old, they brought her to the United  States from Pakistan. She grew up in Fort Worth, TX. In high school,  she played piano, sang in the choir, and played tennis. She then  studied mathematics at Texas Tech. She was ineligible for any  government assistance to go to school. She had to work, borrow money.  That is how she went to school--a mathematics degree at Texas Tech.  There she was, a research scholar, co-vice president of the Student  Service Organization, president of the Texas chapter of the National  Mathematics Honor Society. She participated in premed and math  mentoring programs for younger students. She was awarded the Texas Tech  department of mathematics prize for excellence in mathematics by an  undergraduate woman.   In 2014, Saba graduated from Texas Tech Honors College with a  bachelor of science in mathematics, with the highest honors. Today,  Saba is a Ph.D. candidate studying mathematical biology. Please do not  ask me on the final what  [[Page S697]]  mathematical biology is, but she is majoring in it at Texas Tech. She  is focusing on a better understanding of biological data and disease.  She teaches undergraduate students as a graduate teaching assistant.  What is her dream in America? To use mathematics to advance research to  cure diseases like cancer.   Let me read you what she wrote to me. She said:         I am an aspiring scientist and hope to continue my research       in mathematical biology. Currently, there's an ever       increasing need for computational and mathematical analysis       of biological phenomena, specifically in the areas of       bioinformatics and medicine. I hope to contribute to this       field and give back to my country just as this country has       contributed to my education. . . . Without DACA, I would have       been forced to continue living a life in the shadows, a life       with constant upper bounds, and a life that is imprisoned in       the very country I call home.    Saba is what this debate is all about. There are those who say: We  are too busy to do this; we will get back to it later. There are those  who say: Well, I am sure she is a very talented person, but she is  illegal, you know.   There are those who say we are fools to let a talent like this leave  America. We are crazy to give up on such amazing young people.   We are wrong to call them lazy, for goodness' sakes. There isn't a  lazy bone in this young woman's body. I don't think so. What she has  achieved is nothing short of a miracle as an undocumented student in  America.   Some others have argued: Well, she can stay, but you have to punish  her parents. We have to make them leave the United States of America.   There has to be a better way. Yes. Was it wrong? Did it, maybe, even  violate a law for them to bring her here? What parent wouldn't do it if  it meant survival or if it meant a future for a child? We can make them  pay a price. In the comprehensive immigration bill, there is a fine and  a long waiting period. All of the things could be included in here.   For goodness' sakes, this young lady and her family can be an  important part of America's future if and when we decide in the U.S.  Senate that she is worth our effort. We will have that chance soon. We  will start the debate soon. Young people like her will listen to this  debate because they know what is at stake and whether there is any  future for them in the United States of America.   For goodness' sakes, in the name of justice, in the name of the  values that made this country what it is today, we ought to stand up on  a bipartisan basis and solve this problem in a humane and sensible way.   I yield the floor.
