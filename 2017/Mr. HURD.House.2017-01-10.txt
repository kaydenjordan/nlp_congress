 Mr. Speaker, it is way past time that our government  reconsiders the way that it views technology. Adherence to decades-old  policy regarding technology costs our taxpayers billions of dollars,  stifles creativity, and needlessly prevents our government from  utilizing private sector technologies.   This bill, the Modernizing Government Travel Act, is simple. It will  allow Federal employees to utilize the services of innovative companies  while on official travel. Last Congress, as the chairman alluded to,  this bill passed the House with overwhelming bipartisan support, 415-0.   Private sector companies have had a tremendous impact on the way that  people travel, and we should allow our government to recognize these  changes. By widening the scope of reimbursable forms of transportation,  we are encouraging the adoption of innovative technologies and  promoting competition.   The bill also requires agencies to report what type of transportation  their employees are taking while on official travel, and this data will  be publicly available, thus increasing transparency and accountability  in how taxpayer dollars are being spent.                                time  1645    H.R. 274, as amended, is a sensible piece of legislation that can  help modernize our government and ensure that the United States is  moving seamlessly into the 21st century.   I want to thank my colleague, Representative Moulton, for his  leadership on this important issue, as well as Representatives Meadows,  Bustos, and Swalwell for their support for this bill. I ask my  colleagues to join me in the support of H.R. 274.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 39) to amend title 5, United States Code, to codify the  Presidential Innovation Fellows Program, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 39         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include  any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.  [[Page H284]]     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McCarthy), the majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Today, I am urging my colleagues to support H.R. 39, the TALENT Act,  introduced by Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California. This bill  passed the House on a strong bipartisan vote in the 114th Congress, and  I am glad to be part of the team working to enact this important  legislation into law.   The TALENT Act makes permanent the Presidential Innovation Fellows  program that was created in 2012. This highly competitive program  recruits talented, private sector innovators and technologists from  across the United States.   Presidential Innovation Fellows serve in the Washington, D.C., area  for 12 months at an executive agency. These agencies include the  Department of Energy, NASA, and the Department of Veterans Affairs.   Fellows bring with them their experience in the private sector to  help government turn ideas into tangible results that ultimately  benefit the American people. Since 2012, at least 96 top innovators  have participated in the program.   Past and current fellows have come from companies large and small and  hold degrees from top universities across the country. They have won a  variety of awards, including Fulbright scholarships, Silicon Valley  Business Journal's 40 Under 40 recognition, and Truman National  Security Project fellowships. These fellows truly are the best and the  brightest the United States has to offer, and they seek to utilize  their skills for the American people.    Presidential Innovation Fellows are giving the Federal Government the  tools it needs to successfully operate in the 21st century. Previous  projects completed by fellows include Uncle Sam's List. Fellows created  a database to offer a centralized information center in which agencies  can forgo buying new commodity IT and support services in favor of  existing services provided by the Federal agencies. This program has  saved an estimated $2.5 billion, and it is helping government become  more effective and efficient.   I commend Majority Leader McCarthy for the work to bring this  innovation to the government. Again, I urge support for this bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to make the gentleman from  California aware that I have no further speakers and I am prepared to  close.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to take the opportunity to thank  for their years of service on such an important issue Mr. DeSaulnier  and Leader Hoyer and Leader McCarthy.   I would like to urge the adoption of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
