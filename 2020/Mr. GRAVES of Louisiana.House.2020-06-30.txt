 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Oregon, and I do consider him a  friend because, oftentimes, over the past few years since I have been  here, we have had the opportunity to sit down and engage on  constructive policy discussions. I know my friend does like to have  those discussions, which is why I like him.   Mr. Speaker, I don't like to devolve into partisan fighting, but to  listen to the description of this bill and to actually participate in  this process, there are a lot of things that need to be addressed, and  the Record needs to be set straight.   Mr. Speaker, this committee, the Transportation and Infrastructure  Committee, has a long history of being a bipartisan committee. As you  heard, there were nearly 390 amendments filed on this bill. Twenty-two  Republican amendments are going to be accepted or voted on, and most of  them are going to fail. They are designed to fail. Meanwhile, 148  Democrat amendments are being accepted and are going to be allowed to  move forward--148 to 22.   Mr. Speaker, each one of us represents somewhere around 750,000  people. Why should only certain people be able to be represented?   Then, because of this crazy process we have here, we are going to  take all of those amendments and combine them into about seven votes  where they can take great policy, throw in one poison pill, and the  whole thing dies.   Mr. Speaker, this is not how you build legislation. I don't think I  have to remind anybody here that we have a Republican President and a  Republican Senate. This bill has always been bipartisan, and we should  be working on this bill because everyone supports infrastructure.   Now, on climate, let's talk about climate for just a minute because  the United States has reduced emissions more than the next 12 countries  combined. The United States has. As my friend from Illinois noted, we  are the only country that is in line with our Paris accord, at this  point.   Number two, there has been this little thing called the coronavirus  that has resulted in the largest reduction in history in emissions that  is going on right now, which should cause us to reset and not impose  more costs on the poor among us, those who cannot afford it, those who  have lost their jobs.   Mr. Speaker, the committee doesn't even have jurisdiction over  climate. And you can't go out there and try and electrify all these  cars and not address the fact that you are going to take three to four  times the electricity to even power them. Where is the electricity  coming from? We are just going to make it up? This bill doesn't address  the problems.   Mr. Speaker, just today, the bipartisan climate committee that was  created by Speaker Pelosi issued their report. They were supposed to be  providing the comprehensive plan for climate change. It was a partisan  staff report. Was the committee clairvoyant, knew it was going to be in  there and just pasted the climate committee's recommendation in this  bill? No.   This is completely disjointed. It is partisan. It ignores the fact  that we had 390 amendments and tries to condense it down to seven  votes. Our constitutional Republic is being hijacked right now, and we  are not being allowed to represent the people who we were sent here to  represent.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman for  yielding time.   Mr. Speaker, I have been listening to this debate now for several  minutes, listening to all this talk, and it really is just incredible  to me to listen to some of the things that are being said.   I have heard people say that we have resiliency provisions, but that  doesn't address the cause of climate change. Well, let's be clear. You  can stop all emissions today--all of them--and we already have momentum  built up to where it is going to continue warming. You have got to make  investments in resilience.   Mr. Speaker, I heard our distinguished chairman earlier say it  doesn't make sense to invest in roads because they are going to be  underwater, which is why I offered an amendment in committee that  actually invests in predisaster mitigation for roads. And I thank the  chairman for accepting the amendment.   So, we have led efforts to try to improve the resiliency of these  infrastructure investments.   Mr. Speaker, I also remind the chairman that the DRRA legislation  that we just did last Congress, that I sat down in his office to  negotiate with him, to talk through policy solutions with him--and I  appreciate the time, and we made huge progress. I would say that as a  result of that legislation and other actions that last Congress, we  made more progress on resiliency than any other time. Mr. Speaker, this  was done under a Republican Congress, but more importantly, it was done  in a bipartisan manner.   Mr. Speaker, now, I have heard people stand here and talk about,  ``Oh, we have to reduce emissions.'' Mr. Speaker, for every ton of  emissions we have reduced in the United States, China is increasing  their emissions by tons, by multiple tons more.   Climate isn't a national or a continental issue. It is a global  issue. You can't reduce emissions by reducing them in the United States  and having other people increase theirs multiple times more than our  reduction. That doesn't make sense.   Why would we penalize--I will say it again--the poorest among us,  those who can't afford it, in the middle of a coronavirus pandemic, in  the middle of some of the highest unemployment rates we have seen in  our lifetime? People have lost their jobs, and we are going to impose  more costs on them. This bill doesn't make sense.   Mr. Speaker, there is all sorts of talk about electric vehicles,  about how we need transitional electric vehicles. Mr. Speaker, I noted  earlier that we don't have the electricity infrastructure--and this  bill doesn't address it--to power all of those cars.   I will say it again: Where is the energy going to come from? Our  current generation capacity, our current grid infrastructure, cannot  support it.   Another question: I hear my friends on the other side of the aisle  often talk about the fact that we don't have enough investment in  infrastructure. The highway program is paid for as a user fee. It is  paid for by a gasoline tax. It is a user fee.  [[Page H2934]]    Yet, this bill diverts billions of dollars out to things that don't  have anything to do with infrastructure. You are exacerbating the  insolvency.   And I remind you, electric vehicles don't pay a user fee. They are  freeloaders. So by forcing transition, you actually cause insolvency or  bankruptcy of our national highway system investments faster.   I will say it again: The bill doesn't make sense.   Mr. Speaker, just this morning, the Speaker of the House and the  Democrat members of the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis released  a 547-page climate report. Now, I saw it for the first time yesterday  afternoon, and I will admit, I haven't had a chance to get through much  of it yet. The New York Times has had more time than I have. They  actually got it last week. Maybe I can call The New York Times and  learn more about what is actually in there.   How in the world can a report that was just released be represented  in this bill? How does that happen? It doesn't happen. The bill doesn't  include the recommendations. This House passed a rule to create a  committee, and now they are being ignored.   Mr. Speaker, in the committee, I offered an amendment to expedite the  implementation of green energy projects, and I was told that the  amendment was not germane because it had to do with aviation on airport  property. Yet, in the en bloc amendments, part C, we have aviation  amendments all over the place.   We have amendments in there that force airports to give airport  infrastructure funds to private entities that run sky malls. We have  provisions in there that take the taxes, the user fee from the aviation  fuels, and give it to local and State governments, not investing it  back in aviation, therefore causing Federal taxpayers to have to put  more money into aviation. We have a ``creating cash for clunkers  program'' for airlines in this bill.    Again, I was told that a green energy provision dealing with airports  was not germane in committee. Yet, this bill now has 1,400 pages of  text that was airdropped in here, never seen the light of day in our  committee, airdropped in here, 1,400 pages of text. The bill that came  out of committee, it may be 1,100 pages. It is extraordinary. It is  absolutely extraordinary what is happening today.   Mr. Speaker, perhaps most offensive to the people that I represent is  that we offered amendments, for example, to clarify the eligibility of  the $10 billion in Corps of Engineer funds that were airdropped in this  bill, to offer language that just clarified that projects under the  Mississippi River and Tributaries Program, one of the large  construction programs the Corps of Engineers runs, each project has to  be authorized by Congress.   We just offered an amendment to clarify that, and I was told, ``Oh,  no, you can't do that because those are water-resources related  provisions.'' So, I was prevented from being able to simply make the  Morganza to the Gulf project eligible for funding.   Instead, we are going to spend billions of dollars picking up the  pieces of these flooded communities over and over again instead of  actually being proactive and protecting them.   Mr. Speaker, it was a bipartisan amendment, and I was told: You have  to do that in WRDA.   However, if you are Conor Lamb, you get your Corps of Engineers  amendments in here because those are included. If you are a vulnerable  Democrat, you get your Corps of Engineers amendments. But if you are  not, you are not allowed to get those.   Maybe I should have given my amendment to Conor Lamb. Maybe that is  what I should have done, if that is how those get in there. They have  different standards for different people.   Mr. Speaker, I am trying to represent the people that sent me here to  represent them.                                time  1530    Another amendment that is squarely within transportation jurisdiction  is a bipartisan amendment--I will say it again, Mr. Speaker, a  bipartisan amendment--that would allow us to expedite the process to  build a crossing of the Mississippi River on I-10, just to expedite it,  because we have one of the worst bottlenecks in the Nation in the Baton  Rouge area. I was told once again: No, no, no. You can't do that, can't  even offer the amendment up.   So I will give the statistics again, Mr. Speaker. Of nearly 390  amendments offered up for this bill, in addition to the over 300  amendments offered up in committee--over 100 by Democrats in committee  because they had problems with the bill--148 of these amendments are  Democrat amendments, 148. And, that, of course, compares to somewhere  around 22 Republican amendments that are being allowed to be offered.   Mr. Speaker, I urge rejection of this bill. Let's sit back down, as  we have done in this Congress, in this Chamber, for decades, watching  people on a bipartisan basis put infrastructure bills together that  advance the interests of the American citizens, and address the  incredible infrastructure needs that we have in this Nation.
