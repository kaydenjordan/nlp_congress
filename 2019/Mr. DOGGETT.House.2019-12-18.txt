 Tyranny rarely appears full borne. It arises, it  encroaches as freedom ebbs. Our Nation's great Founders sought to  protect us from tyranny with a carefully crafted system of checks and  balances.   But now along comes a President who actually says he is  constitutionally empowered to do whatever he wants, that he can neither  be prosecuted nor even investigated for any crime, and that he can  totally ignore any impeachment proceeding of which he disapproves.   These are the claims of a wannabe tyrant who has extolled the virtues  of tyrants and autocrats from Manila to Moscow.   To advance tyranny, he adopts an open-border policy inviting  foreigners to come into our country and intrude in our elections.  Foreign nations have their own agendas, especially adversaries like  Russia and China.   American citizens should be the only ones determining the fate of  America. If the President continues demanding more foreign  interference, we will never have truly free elections, and we will not  be free.   We act today, recognizing the solemn responsibility to safeguard our  security and Constitution. We pledge allegiance to the flag and the  Republic for which it stands, not to one man who would be king.
