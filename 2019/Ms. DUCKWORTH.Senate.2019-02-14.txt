 Madam President, today I wish to honor  supervisory Transportation Security Officer Milos Grubnic for going  above and beyond his duties while serving with the U.S. Department of  Homeland Security's Transportation Security Administration, TSA, at  O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, IL.   On November 26, 2018, Officer Grubnic was featured in TSA Today after  he and a fellow Transportation Security officer, John Kozcur, helped a  passenger recover his stolen cell phone. Not only did they handle the  situation in a thorough and professional manner by reviewing security  footage, tracking the individual down and returning the item, but they  were able to do so before the passenger boarded his flight. Many times,  the hard work of our Transportation Security officers goes unnoticed  and unreported, and I am thankful for all they do to keep us safe.   Officer Grubnic's actions in November displayed his steadfast  dedication and passion for public service. Throughout his time at  O'Hare International Airport, Officer Grubnic has worked to support all  aspects of TSA's mission, including assisting my family and me at  security checkpoints as we travel.   I commend Officer Grubnic's hard work, passion, and commitment to  safeguarding the public and achieving TSA's mission to protect our  Nation's transportation systems. May his continued dedication serve as  an inspiration to us all.                            ____________________
