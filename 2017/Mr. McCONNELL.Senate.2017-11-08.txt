 Mr. President, the Republican Senate is continuing its  important work on behalf of the American people. We are moving forward  on legislative priorities that will benefit hard-working families  throughout the country. We are also continuing to confirm President  Trump's nominees throughout the Federal Government.   Last week, we continued our momentum with the confirmation of well- qualified and talented individuals to serve in the Federal judiciary.  This week, the Senate is considering multiple nominations to important  agencies. Yesterday, we confirmed officials to the Department of  Defense and to the Department of Justice. Soon, they will get to work  for the American people.   Next, the Senate will vote to confirm Peter Robb as the general  counsel of the National Labor Relations Board. As I said yesterday, Mr.  Robb's experience in employment law will help return the NLRB to its  role as an impartial arbiter of labor disputes instead of a political  cudgel for union bosses and leftwing special interests, as it was under  the Obama administration.   We will then turn to another qualified individual who will help undo  some of the damage of the Obama administration. William Wehrum,  President Trump's nominee to be the Assistant Administrator for EPA's  Office of Air and Radiation, will put his experience to good use for  our Nation.   The Office of Air and Radiation is one of the most important parts of  the EPA. Unfortunately, under the previous administration, it was also  one of the offices with the most significant overreach. This one office  was responsible for 95 percent of the annual regulatory burdens that  the EPA forced onto our economy, according to one report, reportedly  costing the economy at least $41 billion--this one Agency.   So this is an office in desperate need of new leadership from an  individual who understands how to implement clean air policies in a  balanced way rather than with extreme regulatory overreach. Mr. Wehrum  is the right person for the job. With more than three decades of  experience in environmental policy, he understands the issues before  the EPA and how to address them. He even worked in this particular  office before serving as Acting Administrator from 2005 to 2007.   Mr. Wehrum has earned support from many different corners. His former  boss at the EPA, Jeff Holmstead, said that ``there is no better  person'' to fill this position. The EPA's Deputy Administrator from  2005 to 2009, Marcus Peacock, said that ``Wehrum's understanding of the  Clean Air Act may be second to none.'' Even the Natural Resources  Defense Council--not exactly a rightwing organization--had this to say  about this nominee's previous experience at the EPA, noting that he  ``achieve[d] important air pollution reductions.''   ``Wehrum, Holmstead, and the Bush EPA,'' the NRDC further wrote,  ``deserve credit for these substantial public health and air quality  achievements.''   Nominees like Mr. Wehrum will continue the work of this EPA to undo  the damage of the Obama administration's overreach in a reasonable  manner. For instance, Obama's Office of Air and Radiation was  responsible for the administration's dubious energy regulatory scheme,  which threatened to punish coal families and ship middle-class jobs  overseas.   When Administrator Scott Pruitt came to Kentucky last month, he  announced the official withdrawal of that rule. Unlike the previous  leadership of the EPA, Administrator Pruitt actually cared enough to  come to my home State and hear directly from the men and women impacted  by the Agency's regulations. He is someone who will work with us to  protect our environment and save Kentucky families from harmful  regulations. Mr. Wehrum will work with Administrator Pruitt to help  continue this trend at the EPA. I look forward to the Senate advancing  his nomination.

Yesterday, Senators, members of the  administration, and tax reform advocates met here in the Capitol to  discuss a mutual vision for relief. They shared the goals of  simplicity, fairness, and economic growth. These are the same goals I  have, they are the same goals the House wrote into its legislation,  they are the same goals the President asked us to consider, and most  importantly, they are the goals shared by many Americans across the  political spectrum. So we are working together to get this done.   This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and it will help us  create jobs and boost the economy, while closing special interest  loopholes at the same time. We can do all of this through tax reform.   Today, the House Ways and Means Committee will continue to mark up  its legislative proposal. I would like to once again commend Chairman  Brady for his good work on the House plan. The hearings this week are  building momentum to accomplish our goals for the American people.   Soon, the Senate Finance Committee, under the leadership of Senator  Hatch, will release its own plan for tax reform. Working through an  open committee process, the committee will ultimately bring tax reform  legislation to the floor. I am exceedingly grateful to Chairman Hatch  for his continued leadership of the Finance Committee.   As we continue to advance tax reform, I would urge our Democratic  colleagues to join us. In recent years, many prominent Democrats have  expressed support for tax reform. Since then, the need for tax reform  hasn't changed at all. The American people haven't stopped hurting  either. The only thing that changed was the President. So I hope our  colleagues will put partisanship aside and work with us in a serious  way to help us deliver real relief to families. I hope they will help  us take more money out of Washington's pockets and put more money in  the pockets of the middle class. That is the aim of this tax reform  effort, and we are going to keep working until we accomplish it.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.
