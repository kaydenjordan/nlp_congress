 Madam Chair, first of all, let me say how much I  appreciate the counsel, guidance, and partnership of Chairman Bishop of  the Agriculture Committee, as well as Chair Lowey and Ranking Member  Granger, as well as the entire staff for crafting what is substantially  a very important and good bill for all of America.   Agriculture is essential to America's well-being, and I want to  commend, again, Chairman Bishop not only for his earlier generous  comments, but for his willingness to work hard to find a reasonable  path forward to accommodate as many bipartisan requests as were  feasible. Chairman Bishop and I had a number of very lengthy and  considered conversations in crafting this bill, and I am grateful for  his leadership.    Before I delve into the substantial pluses and a few minuses of this  bill,  [[Page H4801]]  Madam Chair, I want to provide a little bit of additional context of  the bigger agricultural picture across America.   Where I live in Nebraska--and I am sure it is safe to say where  Chairman Bishop lives in Georgia--agriculture is essential to our way  of life and essential to our culture. It really does define who we are  as a people, and production agriculture--corn, soybeans, and  livestock--cover much of our landscape. These products are an important  driver of America's export prowess.   The efficiency, quality, and ingenuity shown by America's farmers  provide food security for hundreds of millions of people across our own  country and across the entire globe, many of whom are in very  vulnerable circumstances. A notable point, Madam Chair, Americans also  enjoy the lowest grocery prices in the world.   Agriculture, though, is more than bulk production. From the use of  advanced robotics to run dairy operations to enzyme extraction from  ethanol production, from the enhancement of critical wetlands, as well  as improving crop yields and conservation stewardship practices, our  farmers are contributing to human flourishing across our Nation. Many  of the technological investments that we see today have been made  possible by the types of investments that are very much a part of this  agriculture bill.   I want to highlight three areas in particular. First, the bill's $3.4  billion reflects a commitment to rural development in housing,  utilities, and businesses. Of particular note, as the chairman  mentioned, is broadband. Working with Chairman Bishop, we included  language to encourage the USDA to consider the broader social benefits  when the department seeks applications for the $680 million of  broadband resources in this bill. It is also important that we measure  the impact of broadband and how it affects the ecosystem of livability.   What do we mean by that?   It is not just more wires, but livability from enhanced telehealth,  telecommuting, precision agriculture, and a multitude of other  imaginative possibilities from these applications. This is what will  make broadband an effective investment in our Nation's infrastructure.   Second, I am pleased to see an increase of $185 million for the FDA,  the Food and Drug Administration, with a particular emphasis on  lowering the price of drugs in the generic drug program. Between  investments in the year 2019 and investments in this bill, the agency  will have an increase of $27 million to help expedite the approval of  safe and effective generic drugs, increased competition, and lower  prices. Chairman Bishop has also made marked investments in food safety  by lessening the burden on our State health departments, and I think  that is important.   Lastly, when I met the chairman in his office a couple of weeks ago,  we found common ground--as we often do--on how to grow the agricultural  family.   What do we mean?   Well, this is a good example. There is $5.4 million in this bill for  farmers markets and local food promotion programs which allow smaller  local producers to provide fresh products, gain a source of revenue,  and connect the rural to the urban and the farmer to the family.                                time  1615    In addition to this program, the bill includes investments for a  Tribal demonstration project, a pilot project for the Food Distribution  Program on Indian Reservations, and, importantly, we have a new urban  agricultural office.   Madam Chair, at its core, this bill is about food security. Our  diverse and plentiful food supply is made possible through the hard  work of our farmers and ranchers and the public policies that assist  them.   We support research and development to the tune of $3.3 billion. We  support oversight of commodity markets. And, for those in vulnerable  circumstances, this bill provides important funding for all USDA  nutrition programs at levels that ensure all eligible participants will  receive the assistance they need.   Unfortunately, as our ranking member has consistently mentioned at  every opportunity, we need a bipartisan, bicameral agreement on budget  caps. With a deal like that, we could quickly get into open field  running.
