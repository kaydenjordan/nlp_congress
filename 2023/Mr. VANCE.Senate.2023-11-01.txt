 Madam President, reserving the right to object, the  Senator from Illinois has made two comments that I would like to  respond to.   First of all, I think it takes a special amount of gall to be from  Joe Biden's political party and to complain about the fentanyl crisis  that is ravaging not just Ohio but the entire country, because it is  Joe Biden's border policies that have invited this fentanyl into our  country at record levels. I heard a briefing from the Department of  Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection today that  confirmed that very fact.   Second of all, the Senator said something I actually agree with: that  this whole policy that I have implemented on Department of Justice  nominees is unprecedented. He mentions that we have in the past in this  body, before I got here, approved a number of Department of Justice  nominees through unanimous consent.   What the Senator from Illinois doesn't mention is that, in that time,  when these nominations sailed through unanimous consent, the Department  of Justice was not trying to throw the political rival of the President  of the United States in prison.   I object to this because we are living in a banana republic where the  President is using his Department of Justice to go after his chief  political rival, the person he will appear on the ballot with in about  a year.   If the Department of Justice will use these nominations for law  instead of politics, I am happy to end this whole policy. But so long  as the Department of Justice uses its nominations and uses its  personnel to go after its political opponents--from the President of  the United States on down--I will object. And, because of that, Madam  President, I do object.
