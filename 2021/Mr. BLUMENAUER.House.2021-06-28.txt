 Madam Speaker, I rise today to salute David Wallace  Douglas, an author, environmental champion, social entrepreneur, and  philanthropist.   He continues his family tradition of service. His grandfather was  Vice President of the United States for Franklin Roosevelt. He was  perhaps the most impactful Secretary of Agriculture in American  history. He was an inventor and a businessperson, and the extended clan  continues that tradition today.   I became acquainted with this extraordinary individual because we  shared a passion for safe drinking water and sanitation. I worked with  him on our Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act and the subsequent Paul  Simon Water for the World Act. David was an invaluable ally and a  mentor for me.   It should be noted that David is a Renaissance man. He is the author  of three books and has written widely in publications featuring  environmental, religious, and developmental issues. He is the  conscience of the United States for preserving our natural heritage. He  was a tireless champion of respect for science and public servants like  in the EPA, the Park Service, and international development when they  were  [[Page H3160]]  under assault in the last administration.    He has created nonprofit NGO advocacy infrastructure to support his  various missions. From 1986 to 2020 he founded and led Waterlines,  which provided technical help and funding for over 1,000 water projects  in rural communities in 15 developing countries around the world.   In 2005 David founded the D.C.-based Water Advocates, the first  advocacy organization devoted to increasing American support for  affordable and sustainable drinking water and sanitation.   He has two other time-limited advocacy organizations to further  elevate national and global attention to WASH.   Most recently, David is fighting to focus attention on safe water and  sanitation for hospitals, which impacts some 2 billion of the planet's  poorest citizens. Try to imagine treating patients in a clinic where  there is no safe clean water to wash your hands. You can't.   David has a gift for creating organizations for a specific time, to  concentrate efforts and get the job done and move on. Some become  captive of organizations. Not David. He is currently wrapping up  efforts with the promise of spending more time in the great outdoors  and with his family.   However David spends his time, wherever he goes, whatever he does  next, we are deeply indebted to him for his leadership and vision. The  world is better for his service and for his example.                            ____________________
