 Mr. Speaker, President Trump wanted to cut  $1.2 billion from the National Institutes of Health and the National  Cancer Institute. Instead, Congress will exert its independence by  rejecting the President's cut and will instead increase National  Institutes of Health's funding by $2 billion.   My community of Buffalo, New York, is home to America's first cancer  center, Roswell Park Cancer Institute. Roswell Park is a national  leader in NIH-funded research for immunotherapy.   Immunotherapy uses drugs and vaccines to unleash the cancer-killing  potential of the body's own immune system. Immunotherapy has the  potential for longer remission and is an alternative to debilitating  chemotherapy.   Because of this congressional action, Roswell Park Cancer Institute's  clinical trials and immunotherapy will continue, and the potential for  tens of millions more in NIH research funding over the next 5 years is  a reality.   This is good for the good that it will do in advancing this promising  research and is good for Buffalo and the continued growth of the  Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus.                            ____________________
