 Mr. Speaker, my grandfather, Abe, fled  the Holocaust as 6 million Jews were shot and tortured and gassed and  starved. We often say, ``never again.'' Yet on October 7 it happened  again, and make no mistake: The brutal, barbaric attacks by Hamas was  not about freeing innocent people; it was about destroying Israel and  killing Jews.   Today, I am proud to stand with all those who condemn Hamas, support  Israel's right to defend itself, and reaffirm the United States'  commitment to Israel's security.
