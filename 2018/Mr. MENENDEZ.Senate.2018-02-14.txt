 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, I come to the floor out of great concern  for America's Dreamers, whose futures hinge on the ability of this body  to keep its word and get something done. I want to be clear whom we are  talking about when we talk about Dreamers. We aren't talking about  criminals. We aren't talking about terrorists. We aren't talking about  ``bad hombres.'' We are talking about kids as American as apple pie. As  I often say, the only country they call home is the United States. The  only flag they pledge allegiance to is that of the American flag. The  only national anthem they know how to sing is the ``Star-Spangled  Banner.''   We are talking about 800,000 young people who were brought to this  country as children and were able to obtain legal protection under the  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, known as DACA. These  kids put enormous faith in our government. They came out of the  shadows, they passed background checks, and they registered with our  government--all to get a 2-year renewable work permit and protection  from deportation.   Even the Cato Institute, which is a conservative think tank, says  that deporting Dreamers--91 percent of whom are gainfully employed-- would hurt America's economy. At the same time, we are also talking  about thousands of additional Dreamers who were eligible for DACA but  didn't apply. Some couldn't afford the cost and others were still  working through the lengthy application process. These are the Dreamers  the White House Chief of Staff John Kelly called lazy asses. Well, Mr.  Kelly, here is what you don't understand: The reason they didn't apply  is not because they were lazy. In fact, in many cases, they didn't  apply because they were afraid--afraid of people like you. They were  afraid that if they came out of the shadows and registered with the  government, they would end up on a short list for deportation. What is  depressing is that this administration's actions have proven them  right. Now DACA recipients and undocumented Dreamers alike fear they  have a target on their back, and that is because President Trump put an  expiration date on their dreams when he decided to end DACA.   Now, let me be clear, DACA was never perfect, and it was never a  replacement for truly comprehensive immigration reform. Make no  mistake, we still need comprehensive immigration reform, and I am  committed as ever to that cause--a cause I have spent the better part  of my congressional career trying to achieve. I was a member of the  Gang of 8 in the Senate back in 2013 when a bipartisan supermajority in  the Senate passed the most historic reforms to our immigration system  since the days of President Ronald Reagan, only to die in the House of  Representatives without even a vote, but that debate is for another  day. That debate is for what President Trump called phase 2.   This week, we are not here to debate comprehensive immigration  reform. We are not here to debate the numerous types of visas that  exist under U.S. law. We are not here to debate how mayors run their  cities or how police officers do their jobs. We are here to protect  Dreamers. We are here to address a crisis that President Trump started  last September when he ended DACA. That is what this week's debate  [[Page S935]]  is all about--it is about protecting hard-working, upstanding Dreamers  across America from being deported to countries they haven't stepped  foot in since they were in diapers.   Now, many of my colleagues have met Dreamers from their States in  recent years, and they know the lion's share of these kids can't even  remember coming here--only growing up here. For the Dreamers who do  remember arriving here, they certainly didn't arrive through any  decision of their own. They were babies, toddlers, and very young  children, and I challenge my colleagues to think of any decision of  consequence they made when they were babies, toddlers, and very young  children. I bet you didn't decide what town you lived in, where your  parents worked, or what kind of status you had.   When we talk about Dreamers, we are talking about kids who have grown  up American in every sense of the word. We are talking about 22,000 New  Jerseyans like Parthiv Patel, who came to New Jersey from India when he  was 5 years old. He gained DACA status in 2012. He graduated from  Drexel Law School in 2016, and he became the first Dreamer admitted to  the New Jersey Bar in 2018.   We are also talking about students like Christopher Rios Martine, a  constituent of mine who came here from Colombia at the age of 2. Today  he is a junior at Rutgers University with a 3.74 GPA. He is president  of the Management Information Systems Association, and he is interning  at Colgate-Palmolive. Christopher said: ``I am proud to be a DACA  recipient and I plan on contributing as much to this country as I  possibly can.''   As another Dreamer from New Jersey, Sara Mora, recently wrote:  Without DACA her life has become ``one big question mark''--the  question of whether this Congress will act. Will we protect Dreamers  who have become integral to our communities, many who are teaching in  our schools, who are treating our patients, who are serving proudly in  the military of the United States--many are wearing the uniform of the  United States, risking their lives on behalf of our country, and yet we  talk about deporting them--and many who are starting families of their  own? That is right. Nearly one-quarter of DACA recipients are the  parents of U.S.-born American children.   That is whom we are talking about this week. We are not talking about  criminals. We are not talking about terrorists. We are not talking  about gangbangers or drug dealers. We are talking about Dreamers. They  are not undocumented immigrants, from my perspective; they are  undocumented Americans who have proven themselves worthy of the  American dream. Yet the administration slapped an arbitrary expiration  date on their dream, creating a crisis that Congress needs to solve.    I took President Trump at his word when he said he wanted to treat  Dreamers with heart, just as I took Leader McConnell at his word when  he said this week would be about protecting them from deportation.   Now, as I listen to many of my Republican colleagues on the Senate  floor, I am hearing less and less about Dreamers and more and more  about spending tens of billions of taxpayer dollars on a wall President  Trump promised Mexico would pay for. Considering the Trump  administration's own report noting that illegal border crossings from  Mexico have dropped to their lowest level in nearly 50 years, you have  to question the wisdom of a multibillion-dollar wall--a wall between  the United States and a country that serves as our second largest  export market in the world for American goods and services, as Mexican  consumers and businesses buy American goods and services that support  jobs created here at home.   Likewise, I am hearing a whole lot about politically loaded terms  like ``merit-based immigration'' and ``chain migration.'' These aren't  terms you find in our laws. They are political catchphrases designed to  incite fear and push policies that forever change how legal immigration  works in the United States. The more insidious, of course, is the term  ``chain migration.'' I am appalled when I hear my colleagues talking  about chain migration, just like I am appalled that the media--even the  so-called liberal media--has adopted this phrase as if it is actually a  legitimate term, and I can't be the only one who thinks the term  ``chain migration'' is downright insulting to the millions of Americans  whose ancestors were actually brought to this country in chains.   Now, I have heard a lot about family values from my Republican  colleagues throughout my time in Congress. The Republican Party has  long claimed to be the party of so-called family values. Well, ``chain  migration'' is a term that dehumanizes families. When we want to  dehumanize something, we create an inanimate object, but this chain is  about a mother and a father and a son and a daughter. It is not an  inanimate object, but it is a dehumanizing term.   It is a term designed to make our system of legal immigration and  family reunification sound threatening and illogical, but there is  nothing threatening about uniting mothers and fathers, and there is  nothing more common sense than uniting brothers and sisters and sons  and daughters. They are not linked by chains. They are bound by blood  and held together by love.   Families are the essence of American values in our society. Families  are the glue that builds strong communities--the foundation of our  country. Yet some of my Republican colleagues act as if the nuclear  family is a concept that has an expiration date. Well, I loved my  daughter since the day she was born and the day she turned 21 and the  day she turned 30, the same as I do my son. I didn't love them less  with each passing year. I don't love them any less now that they have  gotten married; in fact, I love them more.   So Americans need to know that when Republicans speak of ending chain  migration, they are talking about ending the legal right of U.S.  citizens to legally sponsor family members in our immigration system.  It is not chain migration; it is family reunification. That is what  America is all about. That is what immigration policy for the past  century has been about--keeping families together, not tearing them  apart.   The reality is, most Americans are, in some ways, the beneficiary of  family reunification. Without it, our country would be a very different  place. End family reunification, and we would never have seen the  leadership of individuals like Colin Powell, a general and Secretary of  State. That is right. His parents wouldn't have been able to come here  without the big bad chain migration that my colleagues in the majority  decry today.   End family reunification and suddenly billion-dollar American  technology companies like Kingston Technology would have never existed.  Before John Tu was a billion-dollar businessman, he was a self- described mediocre student from China. He would have never come to  America if it were not for the sponsorship of his U.S. citizen sister.  He wasn't skilled when he got here, and yet he built a groundbreaking  company.   So let's get real. When President Trump professes his support for  merit-based immigration, he doesn't have a real plan for allowing a  million engineers and inventors from around the world to come to the  United States. He is talking about cutting legal immigration by nearly  50 percent. That is a policy with disastrous implications for the  future of this country when you consider basic economic facts.   Any credible economist will tell you that without steady immigration,  America's global competitiveness will suffer, and we will fall far  behind much larger countries like China, Pakistan, and India. According  to a Forbes magazine article, even President Donald Trump is a product  of chain migration. That is right. Friedrich Trump, Donald Trump's  grandfather, was able to come to the United States from Germany, with  no English-speaking ability and no merit-based skills. Why? Because his  sister was already in the United States and claimed him as part of  family reunification. You get to be President of the United States  because of chain migration.   If Republicans were being honest, they would call their term of  ``chain migration'' what it really is. They would call it family  reunification, but they don't want to call it family reunification  because they don't want to own up to their intention, which is to strip  U.S. citizens of the right to sponsor their brothers and sisters,  mothers  [[Page S936]]  and fathers, and adult children as immigrants.   I ask my colleagues to please give it a rest. If you want to have a  debate about the merits of our immigration system, we can have that  debate, but that debate over comprehensive immigration reform is not  the debate we should have this week. This debate is about whether we  will do right by American Dreamers, about whether we will listen to the  voices of the American people who overwhelmingly want us to solve this  crisis.   According to the latest polls out this week from Quinnipiac  University, 81 percent of Americans support giving Dreamers a path to  citizenship. Yet, week after week, month after month, Dreamers have  languished in uncertainty. Republicans didn't let us protect them in  September or October or November or December or January. Yet,  throughout all this time wasted, I hear my colleagues in the majority  say such nice things about Dreamers--how talented they are, how hopeful  they are, how important they are.   I say to them today that it is getting harder and harder to take your  commitment to Dreamers seriously when, at every opportunity you have to  do something, you do nothing. Instead, it is beginning to look like  President Trump--the person responsible for ending DACA--has enablers  in Congress who have been intent on deporting Dreamers from day one. If  that is not the case, now is the time to prove it because March 5 is  just around the corner. Come March, America's Dreamers will see their  dreams extinguished, replaced with deportation orders to nations they  have never called home. So far, there are 19,000 already out of status,  and after March 5, there will be 1,000 a day.   If my colleagues want to have a debate about comprehensive  immigration reform, we can have that debate some other time but not  today, not this week, not until we protect Dreamers living in fear of  deportation due to President Trump's reckless decisions--a President  who once said about Dreamers that ``we're going to work something out  that is going to make people happy and proud.'' Well, the polls show  deporting Dreamers will not make Americans happy and proud.   The time for talk is over. The time for kind words is over. The time  for excuses is over. So, this week, Congress needs to take action. It  is time we let America see who stands with Dreamers and who is  complicit in their potential deportation. These young men and women  have shown incredible courage and strength in the face of adversity and  uncertainty. They were handed a crisis, and they created a movement.  They shared their stories and their dreams, and, in doing so, they have  captured the hearts of the American people.   I urge my colleagues in the Senate not to break America's heart  because our hearts are bigger as a country and our future is brighter  when Dreamers in this country stay right where they belong.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The Senator from North  Carolina.                               Valentine's Day
