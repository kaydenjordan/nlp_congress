 Madam Speaker, as States like Alabama move forward  implementing medieval laws that seek to imprison doctors and punish  women for their personal healthcare decisions, I want to make one thing  absolutely clear: I will always stand up and defend a woman's  fundamental right to choose.   These near-total bans on abortion are not only unconstitutional, but  they also endanger the lives of countless women who will be forced to  turn to unsafe procedures.   In 1930, illegal abortion was listed as the official cause of death  for almost 2,700 women, nearly 20 percent of maternal deaths recorded  that year.   We have come too far in the fight for women's equality to retreat to  an era when women lacked the basic right to autonomy over their own  bodies.   My district of Rochester, New York, is the proud home of Susan B.  Anthony. Today, we commemorate the 100th anniversary of the 19th  Amendment, but the fight for women's rights is far from over.   We must remain resolute in our commitment to protecting and upholding  Roe v. Wade. We must support critical  [[Page H4023]]  healthcare programs like Planned Parenthood. We must ensure that every  single woman across America has the right to make her own decisions.                            ____________________
