 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  4, the Voting Rights Advancement Act.   Nothing is more fundamental to our democracy than the right to vote,  and nothing is more precious to my district, Alabama's Seventh  Congressional District, than the fight to protect the right to vote for  all Americans.   It was in my district, Birmingham, Montgomery, Marion, and Selma,  that ordinary Americans peacefully protested for the equal right to  vote for African Americans.   Voting is personal to me, not just because I represent Alabama's  Civil Rights District, but because it was on the streets of my hometown  of Selma that foot soldiers shed their blood on the Edmund Pettus  Bridge so that all Americans, regardless of race, could vote.   It was on that same bridge in Selma, Alabama, that our colleague, a  then 26-year-old,   John Lewis, was bludgeoned by State troopers with  billy clubs in the name of justice. Their efforts led to the passage of  the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the seminal and most effective  legislation passed in this Congress to protect the right of all  Americans to vote.   Those protections were gutted in 2013 by the Supreme Court decision  in Shelby v. Holder when the Court ruled that Section 4(b) of the VRA  was unconstitutional, stating that the coverage formula that Congress  adopted was outdated.   Well, today, 6 years after the Shelby decision, Congress is finally  answering the Supreme Court's call to action by passing H.R. 4. H.R. 4  creates a new coverage formula to determine which States will be  subject to the VRA's preclearance requirement that is based on current,  recent evidence of voter discrimination.   In addition, the bill also establishes practice-based preclearance  authority and increases transparency by requiring reasonable notice for  voter changes.   This new voter formula is narrowly tailored to cover the States and  jurisdictions where there has been a resurgence of significant and  pervasive discriminatory voting practices. It does not include those  areas where such preclearance would be considered to be an  unjustifiable burden.   In all, these changes will restore the full strength of the Voting  Rights Act by stopping discrimination before it takes place, as  Congress had intended in the pasting of the VRA.   Mr. Speaker, old battles have become new again. The fight that began  in Selma, Alabama, in 1965 still persists. Yes, Selma is now.   While literacy tests and poll taxes no longer exist, certain States  and local jurisdictions have passed laws that are modern-day barriers  to voting. So as long as voter suppression exists, the need for the  full protections of the VRA will be required, and that is why it is  critically important that we fully restore the protections of the  Voting Rights Act by passing H.R. 4.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Judiciary Committee and the House  Administration's Subcommittee on Elections for hosting the 17 hearings  and collecting the thousands and thousands of pages of documentation  supporting the report on H.R. 4.   Likewise, I include in the Record letters of support for H.R. 4 from  outside groups that detail the existence of current voter suppression.           International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace &             Agricultural Implement Workers of America--UAW,                                                  December 5, 2019.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the more than one million       active and retired members of the International Union, United       Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of       America (UAW), I am writing to strongly urge you to vote       'YES' on the Voting Rights Advancement Act (H.R. 4).        This legislation is badly needed as the disastrous Supreme       Court's Shelby v. Holder decision has led to the       proliferation of state laws that have made it more difficult       for the American people to exercise their fundamental voting       rights. In the last decade, 25 states have enacted new voting       restrictions, including strict photo ID requirements, early       voting cutbacks, and registration restrictions. Registered       voters have been intentionally purged from voter rolls and       states have closed hundreds of polling stations with a       history of racial discrimination since the court ruled that       they did not need federal approval to change their rules.       These repeated attacks have severely undermined people's       fundamental voting rights, which are the foundational       principles of our representative democracy.        H.R. 4 helps protect citizens' ability to register to vote       and provides real enforcement so that marginalized       communities will have proper access to the ballot box.       Empowering Americans to vote and ensuring that everyone has       equal access to participate in the voting process is a core       value of our democracy.        The UAW strongly urges you to vote `YES' on the Voting       Rights Advancement Act (H.R 4).            Sincerely,                                                       Josh Nassar,      Legislative Director.                                   ____                                                   National Hispanic                                               Leadership Agenda,                                                   December 4, 2019.      Re NHLA Urges Support of the Voting Rights Advancement Act,           H.R. 4.       House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: We write on behalf of the National       Hispanic Leadership Agenda (NHLA), a coalition of the       nation's leading Latino nonpartisan civil rights and advocacy       organizations, to urge you to vote ``yes'' on the Voting       Rights Advancement Act of 2019 (VRAA), H.R. 4. This       legislation restores necessary voting protections to ensure       that discriminatory voting-related changes are blocked before       they are implemented. There is no right more fundamental to       our democracy than the right to vote, and for more than 50       years the Voting Rights Act of 1965        (VRA) provided voters with one of the most effective       mechanisms for protecting that right. The VRAA would provide       Latino and other voters of color new and forward-looking       protections against voter discrimination. The Latino       community cannot wait for another federal election cycle to       go by without effective mechanisms to guard against       discriminatory voting-related changes. NHLA will closely       monitor this matter for inclusion in future NHLA scorecards       evaluating Member support for the Latino community.        The VRA is regarded as one of the most important and       effective pieces of civil rights legislation in our country's       history due to its ability to protect voters of color from       discriminatory voting practices before they occurred. In       2013, the Supreme Court, in its decision in Shelby County v.       Holder, struck down the formula that determined which states       and political subdivisions were required to seek federal pre-      approval of their voting-related changes to ensure they did       not discriminate against minority voters. The Supreme Court       put the onus on Congress to enact a new formula better       tailored to current history, and after the decision, states       or political subdivisions were no longer required to seek       preclearance unless ordered by a federal court in the course       of litigation.        H.R. 4 includes a new geographic coverage formula to       identify those jurisdictions that will have to ``preclear''       their voting-related changes, as well as new provisions       requiring practice-based preclearance, or ``known-practices       coverage.'' Known-practices coverage would focus       administrative or judicial review narrowly on suspect       practices that are most likely to be tainted by       discriminatory intent or to have discriminatory effects, as       demonstrated by a broad historical record. Any jurisdiction       in the U.S. that is home to a racially, ethnically, and/or       linguistically diverse population and that seeks to adopt a       covered practice will be required to preclear the change       before implementation. The known practices covered under the       bill include. 1) changes in method of election to change a       single-member district to an at-large seat or to add an at-      large seat to a governing body; 2) certain redistricting       plans where there is significant minority population growth       in the previous decade; 3) annexations or deannexations that       would significantly alter the composition of the       jurisdiction's electorate; 4) certain identification and       proof of citizenship requirements; 5) certain polling place       closures and realignments; and 6) the withdrawal of       multilingual materials and assistance not matched by the       reduction of those services in English.        Preclearance is an efficient and effective form of       alternative dispute resolution that prevents the       implementation of voting-related changes that would deny       voters of color a voice in our elections. Preclearance saves       taxpayers in covered jurisdictions a considerable amount of       money because the jurisdiction can obtain quick decisions       without having to pay attorneys, expert witnesses, or       prevailing plaintiff's fees and costs that are incurred in       complex and expensive litigation. In December 2018,       redistricting litigation in North Carolina had already cost       $5.6 million in taxpayer dollars. The litigation related to       Texas's redistricting scheme was also a multi-million dollar       affair, ultimately paid by taxpayers for the discriminatory       actions of government officials.        Across the U.S., racial, ethnic, and language-minority       communities are rapidly growing -- the country's total       population is projected to become majority-minority by 2044.       It is no secret that many states and local jurisdictions fear       losing political power, and the rapid growth of these       communities is often seen as a threat to existing political       establishments. Between 2007 and 2014, five of the ten U.S.       counties with the most rapid rates of Latino population       growth were in North Dakota or South Dakota, two states whose       overall Latino populations still  [[Page H9316]]       account for less than ten percent of their residents, and are       dwarfed by Latino communities in states like New Mexico,       Texas, and California. It is precisely this rapid growth of       different racial or ethnic populations that results in the       perception that emerging communities of color are a threat to       those in political power.        Last month, MALDEF, NALEO--both members of NHLA--and Asian       Americans Advancing Justice--AAJC, released a new report,       Practice-Based Preclearance: Protecting Against Tactics       Persistently Used to Silence Minority Communities' Votes,       detailing the need for forward-looking VRA legislation that       provides protections for emerging minority populations. H.R.       4 identifies different voting changes most likely to       discriminatorily affect access to the vote in diverse       jurisdictions whose minority populations are attaining       visibility and influence. The report looked at these       identified practices and found, based on two separate       analyses of voting discrimination, that these known practices       occur with great frequency in the modern era.        Congress must protect the access to the polls, and it must       include a known-practices coverage formula. H.R. 4 is a       critical piece of legislation that will restore voter       protections that were lost due to the Shelby County decision.       NHLA urges you to stand with voters and to vote ``yes'' on       H.R. 4.            Sincerely,      Thomas A. Saenz,        MALDEF, President and General Counsel, NHLA Chair, Civil       Rights Committee, Co-Chair.      Juan Cartagena,        LatinoJustice PRLDEF, President and General Counsel, Civil       Rights Committee NHLA, Co-Chair.                                   ____                                   National Education Association,                                                   October 22, 2019.      House Committee on the Judiciary,      U.S. House,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 3 million members of       the National Education Association who work in 14,000       communities across the nation, thank you for holding this       markup of the Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2019 (H.R. 4).       We urge you to VOTE YES on the Voting Rights Advancement Act,       which we believe combats voter discrimination and protects       the most fundamental right in our democracy. Votes on this       issue may be included in NEA's Report Card for the 116th       Congress.        The U.S. Supreme Court in Shelby v. Holder invalidated a       crucial provision in the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that       prevented states with a history of discriminating against       voters from changing their voting laws and practices without       preclearance by federal officials. This federal review was an       important feature of the Voting Rights Act; doing away with       it has virtually annulled the federal oversight that was--and       remains--crucial to ensuring that millions of people have       equal access to the ballot box After the 2013 Shelby       decision, several states changed their voting practices in       controversial ways that created barriers for people of color,       low-income people, transgender people, college students, the       elderly, and those with disabilities. The Voting Rights       Advancement Act takes several steps toward reversing this       harmful, undemocratic trend, including:        Modernizing the Voting Rights Act so that preclearance       covers states and localities with a pattern of       discrimination;        Requiring jurisdictions to publicly disclose, 180 days       before an election, all voting changes; and        Authorizing the Attorney General, either on Election Day or       during early voting, to send federal observers to any       jurisdiction where there is a substantial risk of       discrimination at the polls.        NEA members live, work, and vote in every precinct, county,       and congressional district in the United States. They take       their obligation to vote seriously because it is essential to       protecting the opportunities that they believe all students       should have. Furthermore, educators teach students that       voting is a responsibility of citizenship, a privilege for       which many people have fought and died. We urge you to VOTE       yes on the Voting Rights Advancement Act, and to support       legislation to expand voter registration, safeguard our       elections, and restore voting rights for people with past       criminal convictions--important steps to ensure that all have       a voice in our society.            Sincerely,                                                      Marc Egan,                                   Director of Government Relations,      National Education Association.                                   ____           In Our Own Voice: National Black Women's Reproductive             Justice Agenda,                                                  December 4, 2019.        Dear Representative: On behalf of In Our Own Voice:       National Black Women's Reproductive Justice Agenda, a       national/state partnership with eight Black Women's       Reproductive Justice organizations (Black Women's Health       Imperative, New Voices for Reproductive Justice, SisterLove,       Inc., SisterReach, SPARK Reproductive Justice NOW!, Inc., The       Afiya Center, and Women With A Vision), lifting up the voices       of Black women leaders on local, state, and national policies       that impact the lives of Black Women and girls, we write in       strong support of H.R. 4, the Voting Rights Advancement Act.       We oppose any Motion to Recommit. We urge you to vote ``yes''       during the anticipated House floor vote.        At the core of Reproductive Justice is the human right to       control our bodies, our sexuality, our gender, our work, and       our reproduction. That right can only be achieved when all       women and girls (cis, femme, trans, agender, gender non-      binary and gender nonconforming) have the complete economic,       social, and political power and resources to make healthy       decisions about our bodies, our families, and our communities       in all areas of our lives. This most certainly includes at       the polls.        The U.S. Supreme Court decision in June of 2013 that gutted       the Voting Rights Act of 1965, one of the most impactful       civil rights laws enacted to date, significantly set back       racial equality in voting. Since the Supreme Court decision       in Shelby County v. Holder, discrimination has become common       place in voting, nationwide, and voter suppression is       absolutely rampant throughout the system. We know that such       suppression disproportionately impacts communities of color.        Significant barriers exist for Black communities. In a       nationwide poll conducted by In Our Own Voice, National       Latina Institute for Reproductive Health, and National Asian       Pacific American Women's Forum in Spring of 2019, 33% of       women of color voters polled experienced an issue voting.       Additionally, countless hearings held by the House Judiciary       Committee throughout the year have shown significant barriers       to accessing the polls, significantly impeding voter       participation.        H.R. 4 is necessary to restore and modernize the Voting       Rights Act to acknowledge the lived experiences of those       working to access the polls in all communities. This       legislation would strengthen our voting laws to ensure       repeated voting rights violations are addressed, increases       processes and transparency around voting changes, and goes       great lengths to protection individuals from racial       discrimination in voting.        In Our Own Voice's work, particularly through our I Am A       Voter project, is to increase Black women's voter engagement       in state, local and federal elections, to ensure our stories       are told and our voices are represented. H.R. 4 is critical       to ensuring that we can express our beliefs and positions       through the ballot box. We urge Congress to pass this       historic legislation.            Sincerely,                                                    Marcela Howell,      Founder and President/CEO.                                   ____                                   American Civil Liberties Union,                                                   December 5, 2019.      Re Vote YES on H.R. 4, the Voting Rights Advancement Act.         Dear Representative: The American Civil Liberties Union       (ACLU) urges you to vote ``YES'' on H.R. 4 the Voting Rights       Advancement Act of 2019 (VRAA) this morning. The ACLU will       score this vote.        Congress enacted the Voting Rights Act in 1965 (VRA) almost       a century after the adoption of the Fifteenth Amendment,       which prohibits racial discrimination in voting. The most       powerful enforcement tool in the Voting Rights Act was the       federal preclearance process, established by Section 5. It       required locations with the worst records of voting       discrimination to federally ``preclear''--or get federal       approval for--voting changes by demonstrating to either the       Justice Department or the D.C. federal court that the voting       change would not have a discriminatory purpose or effect.       What preclearance meant in practice was that states and       jurisdictions with documented histories of voting       discrimination could not enforce new voting rules without       showing that the rules did not discriminate on the basis of       race.        While upholding the Voting Rights Act's preclearance       process itself, the Supreme Court's 2013 decision in Shelby       County v. Holder effectively nullified preclearance       protections contained in the Voting Rights Act by       invalidating the coverage formula that identified which       locations would be subject to preclearance. Many states have       taken the Shelby County decision as a green light to enact       discriminatory voting restrictions with impunity. These       restrictions include photo ID laws, restraints on voter       registration, voter purges, cuts to early voting,       restrictions on the casting and counting of absentee and       provisional ballots, documentary proof of citizenship       requirements, polling place closures and consolidations, and       criminalization of acts associated with registration or       voting.        In turn, this rash of discriminatory voting laws has led to       an explosion of litigation to protect voters from state and       local violations of federal law. Since Shelby County, the       ACLU has opened more than 60 new voting rights cases and       investigations and currently has more than 30 active matters.       Between the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections alone, the       ACLU and our affiliates won 15 voting rights victories,       protecting more than 5 6 million voters in 12 states that       collectively are home to 161 members of the House of       Representatives and wield 185 votes in the Electoral College.       The ACLU also submitted a 227-page report to the House       Judiciary Committee reviewing the legal landscape, evidence       of ongoing voting discrimination addressed by the bill, and       an analysis of its key provisions. The ACLU report is       publicly available here: https://www.aclu.orglreport/aclu- report-voting-rights-act.  [[Page H9317]]         The ACLU's recent litigation experience supports at least       two conclusions: our record of success in blocking       discriminatory voting changes--with an overall success rate       in Voting Rights Act litigation of more than 80 percent--      reveals that state and local officials are continuing to       engage in a widespread pattern of unconstitutional racial       discrimination and pervasive violations of federal law. It       also shows that there is a lack of tools necessary to stop       discriminatory changes to voting laws before they taint an       election. Even in the cases in which the ACLU has ultimately       succeeded, these discriminatory policies remained in place       for months or even years while litigation proceeded--crucial       time during which elections were held, and hundreds of       government officials elected, under unfair conditions.        In delivering the Supreme Court's 5-4 majority opinion in       Shelby County, Chief Justice John Roberts expressly invited       Congress to update the Voting Rights Act's protections based       on current conditions of discrimination. It is long past due       for Congress to renew the protections of the Voting Rights       Act. The price of inaction to protect the voting rights of       Americans is high, and history offers a myriad of examples       demonstrating its cost to the nation. Congress must act now       to cement the legacy of the Voting Rights Act and guard the       rights of all Americans. The ACLU urges you to vote ``yes''       on H.R. 4 and reauthorize the Voting Rights Act.            Sincerely,      Ronald Newman,        National Political Director, National Political Advocacy       Department.      Sonia Gill,        Senior Legislative Counsel, National Political Advocacy       Department.                                   ____                                           Anti-Defamation League,                                                      June 26, 2019.      Hon. Steve Cohen,      Chairman, House Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on the           Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties.      Hon. Mike Johnson,      Ranking Member, House Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on           the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties.        Dear Chairman Cohen and Ranking Member Johnson: On behalf       of ADL (the Anti-Defamation League), we write to urge the       House Judiciary Committee to take prompt action to protect       Americans' fundamental right to vote by approving H.R. 4, the       Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2019 (VRAA). We ask that       this statement be included as part of the official hearing       record for the subcommittee's June 25, 2019 hearing on       ``Continuing Challenges to the Voting Rights Act Since Shelby       County.''        Since the enactment of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) in 1965,       a central part of ADL's mission--``to stop the defamation of       the Jewish people, and to secure justice and fair treatment       to all''--has been devoted to helping to ensure that all       Americans have a voice in our democracy. Answering Dr. King's       call for ``religious leaders from all over the nation to join       us . . . in our peaceful, nonviolent march for freedom,'' ADL       lay leaders and staff joined more than 3,000 Americans in       ``peaceful demonstration against blind violence, in `gigantic       witness' to the constitutionally guaranteed right of all       citizens to register and vote in 1965.''        ADL continues to work today to ensure that all eligible       Americans can exercise their fundamental right to vote       through advocacy in the courts, legislatures, and       communities. We are proud to have stood with leaders such as       Dr. King and Rep. John Lewis in 1965 to fight for every       citizen's right to vote and we remain equally committed to       this goal today. Recognizing the this landmark law as one of       the most important and most effective pieces of civil rights       legislation ever enacted, ADL has strongly supported the VRA       and its extensions since its passage more than 50 years ago,       including by filing a brief in Shelby County v Holder.        In the years and decades following the enactment of the       Voting Rights Act of 1965, the law quickly demonstrated its       essential value in ensuring rights and opportunities. Between       1964 and 1968--the presidential elections immediately before       and after passage of the VRA respectively--African American       voter turnout in the South jumped by seven percentage points.       The year after passage of the VRA, Edward Brooke became the       first African American in history elected to the United       States Senate by popular vote, and the first African American       to serve in the Senate since Reconstruction. By 1970, the       number of African Americans elected to public office had       increased fivefold. Today there are more than 10,000 African       American elected officials at all levels of government.        To be sure, Section 2 of the VRA, which prohibits       discrimination based on race, color, or membership in a       language minority group in voting practices and procedures       nationwide, has helped to secure many of these advances. Yet       it is undeniable that Section 5 of the VRA, which requires       certain states and political subdivisions with a history of       discriminatory voting practices to provide notice and ``pre-      clear'' any voting law changes with the federal government,       played an essential and invaluable role in the VRA's success.       Between 1982 and 2006, pursuant to Section 5, the Department       of Justice (DOJ) blocked 700 proposed discriminatory voting       laws, the majority of which were based on ``calculated       decisions to keep minority voters from fully participating in       the political process.'' Proposed laws blocked by Section 5       included discriminatory redistricting plans, polling place       relocations, biased annexations and de-annexations, and       changing offices from elected to appointed positions, similar       to many of the tactics used to disenfranchise minority voters       before 1965. In addition, states and political subdivisions       either altered or withdrew from consideration approximately       800 proposed voting changes between 1982 and 2006, indicating       that Section 5's impact was much broader than the 700 blocked       laws.        Despite decades of success and extensive documentation of       the law's effectiveness in preventing discriminatory       restrictions on the right to vote, on June 25, 2013 the U.S       Supreme Court, in a sharply divided 5-4 ruling in Shelby       County v. Holder, struck down Section 4(b) of the VRA. In       doing so, the Court substituted its views for Congress's own       very extensive hearings and findings conducted in 2006 when       Congress almost unanimously voted to reauthorize the VRA for       another 25 years. The ruling invalidated the formula used to       determine which states and political subdivisions would be       subject to preclearance under Section 5 but did not evaluate       the merits of the preclearance provision itself. The majority       only held that ``the formula in that section can no longer be       used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to       preclearance.''        While Shelby County has done irreparable damage to voting       rights in the United States, Congress is not powerless to       mitigate this damage and restore the original force of the       VRA. In fact, the Court specifically noted that ``Congress       may draft another formula based on current conditions'' and       reinstate the preclearance provision in Section 5. The Voting       Rights Advancement Act of 2019 introduces a new, rolling       preclearance formula based on current need that would restore       the preemptory force of the VRA. The recent onslaught of       restrictive voting laws enacted across the country is       evidence that litigation pursuant to Section 2 is entirely       inadequate to prevent unconstitutional voting practices and       discrimination. Since 2010, over 25 states have enacted       restrictive voting laws. Half the country now faces stricter       voting regulations than they did in 2010.        Perhaps the most illustrative case for the ongoing       necessity of a preclearance process is the battle over a       Texas voter ID law. In 2011, Texas passed S.B 14, the       strictest voter ID law ever enacted in the United States.       Because Texas was required under Section 4 of the VRA to seek       preclearance for its voting laws, the law was initially       blocked from going into effect. The three-judge panel that       reviewed the law found that ``based on the record of evidence       before us, it is virtually certain that these burdens will       disproportionately affect racial minorities. Simply put, many       Hispanics and African Americans who voted in the last       election will, because of the burdens imposed by SB 14,       likely be unable to vote.''        Within hours of the Court's decision in Shelby County,       Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott announced that S.B 14       would go into effect immediately. Following the Attorney       General's announcement, multiple civil rights groups and       Texas voters filed suit under Section 2 of the VRA. In 2014,       a district court held that ``SB 14 was enacted with a       racially discriminatory purpose, has a racially       discriminatory effect, is a poll tax, and unconstitutionally       burdens the right to vote.'' On appeal, a court of appeals       stayed the district court's decision and allowed the law to       take effect.        For more than two years and over the span of two election       cycles, SB 14 prevented eligible voters from casting a ballot       while litigation was ongoing. By the time the law was finally       invalidated in 2016 by a 9-2 vote of the entire Court of       Appeals for the D.C Circuit (sitting en bane), no fewer than       seven federal judges had concluded the law was       discriminatory. Yet because Section 5 of the VRA was not in       effect, this patently unconstitutional law was permitted to       disenfranchise untold numbers of minority voters, over two       election cycles. The consequences of disenfranchisement are       not fully quantifiable but are certainly lasting. Elections       cannot be undone, and no judicial relief can restore the       confidence in our democracy that was unfairly taken from       thousands of disenfranchised voters.        Texas is not the only state to adopt strict voter ID laws.       The National Conference of State Legislatures identifies 10       states with ``strict'' voter ID laws and finds that 11% of       all Americans lack the necessary government ID that these       laws require. Voter ID laws have been found on multiple       occasions to disproportionately affect marginalized       communities, low-income and elderly Americans, and students.        Nor is Voter ID the only, tool states are using to       disenfranchise voters for political gain. In Georgia, then       Secretary of State Brian Kemp enforced new election code       policies for the 2018 election (in which he was a candidate       for Governor) which invalidated a voter's registration if       there was any discrepancy in their registration paperwork. Of       the 53,000 voters whose registration status was arbitrarily       questioned, roughly 70% were African American. In Ohio, a       ``use it or lose it'' law caused hundreds of thousands of       voters to be purged from the 2018 voter rolls because they       did not vote in the last presidential election.       Gerrymandering, voter intimidation and harassment, cuts to       early  [[Page H9318]]       voting opportunities, polling place manipulation and closure,       and felony disenfranchisement efforts are just some of the       other voter suppression tactics that have become prevalent       since Shelby County and were used to disenfranchise voters in       the 2018 election.        Indeed, we have seen the reversal of half a century of       voting rights advancements since Shelby County. While Section       5 of the VRA surely could not have prevented all of these       evils, there is no question that this country's democratic       institutions would be stronger and our electoral processes       more representative if the VRA were in full effect. Following       this incredible damage done to the most fundamental of our       rights as Americans, Congress now finds itself in the       position to act.        The Voting Rights Advancement Act (VRAA) of 2019 is an       important first step in restoring voter trust in America's       elections and preventing states from enacting additional       discriminatory measures to suppress the vote. Just over a       decade ago, as Congress was debating the most recent       reauthorization of the VRA, committees held 21 hearings and       compiled over 20,000 pages of records as evidence of the       success of Section 5, the prevalence of ongoing voting       discrimination, and the constitutionality of the law. As a       result, the reauthorization passed with overwhelming       bipartisan support: 390 to 33 in the House of Representatives       and 98-0 in the Senate. Congress now has both the power and       the imperative to pass the Voting Rights Advancement Act and       restore the critical voting protections that quite recently       received overwhelming bipartisan approval.        In the face of federal inaction, many states have taken the       lead on expanding and securing the right to vote for all       people. In 2018, Maryland, New Jersey, and Washington adopted       automatic voter registration, a policy which would       significantly increase access to the ballot. Since 2016, six       states have limited or reversed their felon       disenfranchisement laws and 16 states have enacted reforms       such as same-day registration, online voter-registration, and       expanded early voting opportunities that make it easier to       register and vote. Despite the absence of Congressional       leadership, there is substantial momentum behind expanding       ballot access and preserving America's voting rights.        S. 1945, the VRAA, creates a modern, flexible, rolling       formula to determine which states and political subdivisions       will have to pre-clear their laws with the federal       government. The formula will not require preclearance in all       the political subdivisions that have moved to restrict voting       rights in the past six years, including some of the examples       above, but, over time, the rolling formula will sweep in many       of the most problematic jurisdictions. It will restore       critical safeguards, preventing enactment of discriminatory       voting laws by once more ``shift[ing] the advantage of       inertia and time from the perpetrators of the evil to the       victims.''        The Fifteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution proclaims       that ``the right of citizens of the United States to vote       shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by       any state on account of race, color, or previous condition of       servitude.'' Section 2 of the Amendment expressly declares       that ``Congress shall have the power to enforce this article       by appropriate legislation.'' As the Supreme Court has       recognized, ``by adding this authorization, the Framers       indicated that Congress was to be chiefly responsible for       implementing the rights created in Section 1,'' and       ``Congress may use any rational means to effectuate the       constitutional prohibition of racial discrimination in       voting.'' Passage of the Voting Rights Advancement Act is not       only rational. It is critical to enforcing the constitutional       prohibition on racial discrimination in voting and protecting       the fundamental right to vote for all Americans.        We strongly welcome these hearings on the devastating       legacy of Shelby County and appreciate the opportunity to       present ADL's views. We urge the Committee to promptly       approve the Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2019.            Sincerely,      Eileen B. Hershenov,        Senior Vice President, Policy.      Steven M. Freeman,        Vice President, Civil Rights.      Erika L. Moritsugu,        Vice President, Government Relations, Advocacy, and       Community Engagement.      Melissa Garlick,        Civil Rights National Counsel.                                   ____                                                          AFL-CIO,                                                   December 5, 2019.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the AFL-CIO, I am writing       to urge you to vote for the Voting Rights Advancement Act       (H.R.4). This bill offers a flexible nationwide approach to       protecting voters from discriminatory practices, and it is an       important step toward restoration of the protections       undermined by the Supreme Court's 2013 decision in Shelby       County v Holder. We urge you to oppose any motion to       recommit.        The bill would establish a new preclearance coverage       formula that is responsive to the discriminatory practices       that have proliferated since the Supreme Court's decision in       Shelby County v. Holder. As Chief Justice Roberts himself       said in the Shelby decision: ``voting discrimination still       exists; no one doubts that.'' Discriminatory policies have       not only resurfaced in areas formerly covered by the Voting       Rights Act's preclearance requirement, but also have       proliferated nationwide. State and local officials brazenly       have imposed restrictive voting requirements, altered       district boundaries, and shifted polling locations in ways       that make voting more difficult and less accessible for many       voters. The Voting Rights Advancement Act would address these       disenfranchisement strategies, as well as others certain to       develop.        The right to vote is fundamental to our democracy, and the       effort to protect citizens from voting discrimination has       been bipartisan for more than half a century. Indeed, the       Voting Rights Act of 1965 would not have passed without       leadership from both political parties, and Republican       presidents signed each Voting Rights Act reauthorization into       law.        The integrity of our democracy depends on ensuring that       every eligible voter can participate in the electoral       process, and, thus, voting discrimination demands strong       bipartisan legislative action. Every member of Congress       should go on record today in support of this historic       legislation.            Sincerely,                                          William Samuel, Director,      Government Affairs Department.                                   ____                                      Bend the Arc: Jewish Action,                                                   December 5, 2019.      Re Vote for the Voting Rights Advancement Act (H.R. 4) and           against any Motion to Recommit.         Dear Representative: As the Washington Director of Bend the       Arc: Jewish Action, I urge you to vote for the Voting Rights       Advancement Act (H.R. 4) and to vote against any Motion to       Recommit (MTR), when it comes to a vote this week. This       crucial legislation would restore and modernize the Voting       Rights Act to combat voter suppression and discrimination       across the country. As the largest national Jewish social       justice organization focused exclusively on domestic policy,       Bend the Arc and our members across the country care deeply       about ensuring all people are able to exercise their       Constitutional right to shape our democracy through voting.        The VRAA responds to the urgent need to undo the onslaught       of abuses by state and local governments in the aftermath of       the Supreme Court's 2013 decision in Shelby County v Holder,       gutting the preclearance provision of the Voting Rights Act.       Since that decision, 14 states have imposed new voting       restrictions that would have likely been deemed unacceptable       were the VRA at full strength. These policies have had real       consequences, such as likely contributing to significantly       lower turnout amongst targeted populations, including people       of color, in both the 2016 presidential election and the 2018       midterms.        The fight to protect voting rights is deeply personal for       American Jews. There is something quintessentially American,       and also quintessentially Jewish, about voting. After all,       voting is a ritual, part of belonging to the community.       Additionally, the United States was the first federal       government to fully enfranchise Jews. For many Jews, our       families migrated to the U.S. fleeing persecution, coming       here to find a country where, even if they were not always       welcome or even fully protected under the law, they       nonetheless had a legal right to exist, and be a part of our       democratic system at the basic level.        Today, we draw inspiration not only from that part of the       American Jewish experience, but also from the Jewish leaders       of the recent past who worked to pass the Voting Rights Act       of 1965, and those today who participate in election       protection efforts every Election Day. This is why Bend the       Arc has helped mobilize the faith community in support of the       VRAA and organized National Days of Action for voting rights       to mark the 50th anniversary of the murder of Andrew Goodman,       James Chaney, and Mickey Schwerner in 1964, and the passing       of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.        Again, I urge you to vote for the Voting Rights Advancement       Act (H.R. 4) and against any MTR, to ensure that all       Americans are able to exercise their Constitutionally-      protected right to vote.            Sincerely,                                     Rabbi Jason Kimelman-Block,                                                Washington Director,                                       Bend the Arc: Jewish Action.     Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank the many  stakeholder groups that have worked so hard on this bill: the  Leadership Council, the Legal Defense Fund, the NAACP, the Lawyers'  Committee, the AFL-CIO, MALDEF, and so many more.   As we prepare to take this vote, let us be guided by our north star,  that is our wonderful colleague, our beloved colleague,   John Lewis,  who reminds us each and every day that the price of freedom is not  free. It has been bought and paid for by the courage of ordinary  Americans who dared to make this Nation live up to its ideals of  equality and justice for all.   Let us recommit ourselves to restoring the promise of voter equality  and pass H.R. 4 today.  [[Page H9319]]         Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the  following letters of support for H.R. 4.     Faith Leader Call on Congress To Restore the Voting Rights Act NOW         Voting is a sacred right and a cornerstone of democracy. We       desperately need to protect every American's right to vote--      and right now this right is endangered by gaps in the law.       Our spiritual ancestors in the Civil Rights Movement fought       for the Voting Rights Act. We must honor their sacrifices       today by passing the Voting Rights Advancement Act.--Rev. Dr.       Jennifer Butler, CEO, Faith in Public Life        We stand on the shoulders of so many in our nation who have       shown courage and resistance to realize their right to vote,       who have fought tirelessly to make sure America lives up to       its full potential. Voting is a crucial part of what we must       do to hold our elected officials--to hold America--      accountable to not just the dream that Rev. Martin Luther       King, Jr. laid out for us, but also the promise that America       has held since its beginnings. Yes, it's a promise       historically marred by injustice, but it is the promise of a       better way. It is a sin and a shame to witness how voting       rights have been suppressed and denied since 2013. Voting is       a way that we claim the freedom that we have in America. Our       most urgent request to Congress is the same as that made by       MLK over 40 years ago: give us the ballot.--Rev. Dr. Leslie       Copeland-Tune, Chief Operating Officer, National Council of       Churches        By our own admission, within our most precious documents,       we acknowledge that ALL people are part of God's creation and       that we are one nation under God. As such, our democracy says       that every citizen should be respected regardless of sex,       race, national origin, etc. and that the government is       accountable to defend and protect the rights of its public,       its citizens. The most precious nature of America society is       the right to vote. We have the dignity of citizenship rights;       laws are necessary to defend that dignity and those rights,       unobstructed, so citizens can enjoy voting and electing their       officials.--Imam Dr. Talib M. Shareef, USAF-Retired,       President, Masjid Muhammad, The Nation's Mosque        My faith teaches that every person is imbued with dignity,       and in a secular democracy our vote is an indicator of that       worth. Voter suppression and intimidation is a familiar, age-      old practice of marginalizing people in poverty and people of       color. A democratic system that suppresses the vote of any       citizen is not only unconstitutional, it is dehumanizing.       This dehumanizing must stop! Our nation is better than this.       A significant step forward would be to pass a 21st Century       Voting Rights Act now. This cannot wait. It is the faithful       and patriotic way forward.--Sister Simone Campbell, SSS,       Executive Director of NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social       Justice        The United Methodist Church affirms the critical role of       governments in protecting the rights of all people to free       and fair elections. In particular, the Church support efforts       to dismantle policies and practices that disenfranchise       communities of color and perpetuate systemic injustice.''--      Rev. Dr. Susan Henry-Crowe, General Secretary, General Board       of Church and Society of The United Methodist Church        The Religious Society of Friends (Quaker) faith was founded       on the belief in the equality of all. Voter suppression in       the United States violates this central belief and we must       work to assure everyone has the right to vote. We call on       lawmakers across the nation to take a stand against voter       suppression and pass the Voting Rights Advancement Act (H.R.       4).--Diane Randall, Executive Secretary, Friends Committee on       National Legislation        The requirement of society to provide human dignity for       all, which stands at the root of all theological traditions,       strikes a blow at the very heart of the spurious arguments       made by those who want to prevent others from voting based on       age, race, disability, or history of contact with the       criminal justice system. As an organization that works with       many who come from communities that have been historically       subjected to all forms of discrimination, the National       Religious Campaign Against Torture believes that the right to       vote and to fully participate in the democracy is a sacred       right and one that should never be taken away from anyone,       for any reason.--Rev. Dr. Ron Stief, Executive Director,       National Religious Campaign Against Torture        As Franciscans, our Christian faith teaches us that we must       recognize each person as a gift from God, and that we must       emphasize the importance of the essential humanity and       dignity of each person. Pope Francis has called on us to       ``meddle in politics'' and we interpret this concept as a       requirement that all Americans must have an equal say in the       public square. Therefore, we must immediately call on       Congress to pass the Voting Rights Advancement Act to ensure       that all Americans are able to vote.--Patrick Carolan,       Executive Director, Franciscan Action Network        At the National Council of Jewish Women, we are guided by       the Jewish imperative to pursue tzedek, or justice. For       justice to be realized, all eligible voters must have an       opportunity to participate in the electoral process. Without       access to the ballot, we can't elect lawmakers who represent       our communities and our needs. Congress must restore the full       strength of the Voting Rights Act without delay.--Sheila       Katz, CEO, National Council of Jewish Women        It was when the collective voice of the people cried out to       the Lord in Exodus 3:9 that God hears and sent deliverance to       Nation of Israel! Voting by the oppressed was the way black       people could lift up their voices, cry out, and participate       in creating a more just nation! Restoration of the Voting       Rights Act so all voices are heard is essential to perfecting       this nation and assuring that it does not return to and       separate but unequal society!--Rev. Reuben D. Eckels, Church       World Service (CWS)        Since voting is so fundamental to our democracy, all       citizens should be committed to making it possible for       everyone to exercise that right. The Voting Rights       Advancement Act is critical to having a genuine       representative democracy and to make sure that the most       vulnerable populations are not disenfranchised from the       democratic process. People of faith are concerned that the       voice of the people be truly representative of all the       people.--Bishop John Stowe, Bishop-President, Pax Christi USA        In the Bible, we are reminded that ``when justice is done,       it brings joy to the righteous'' (Proverbs 21:15). The       Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) understands       that justice is done when we live out our mutual       responsibility for one another by guaranteeing our neighbor's       right to vote and participate freely and fully in society. In       2013, the ELCA Churchwide Assembly, our denomination's       highest legislative authority, adopted a social policy       resolution titled Voting Rights to All Citizens. This       resolution calls us to express concern for our nation's       history of voter suppression from the Jim Crow era to the       current climate of restrictive voter laws that create       barriers to many people of color in their right to vote. This       resolution calls on all part of this church to ``promote       public life worthy of the name'' by speaking out as advocates       and engaging in local efforts such as voter registration and       supporting legislation to guarantee the right to vote to all       citizens. We support the Voting Rights Advancement Act (H.R.       2978) as a key step in ensuring the voices of all citizens       will be safeguarded and heard through its provisions which       would help reinstate guidelines that ensure protection       through oversight and combat voter suppression.--Rev. Amy       Reumann, Director of Advocacy, Evangelical Lutheran Church in       America        The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) has been a long-time       advocate for voting rights. We were deeply dismayed by the       actions of the Supreme Court to void Section 5 of the Voting       Rights Act. This decision left many people of color       vulnerable to discriminatory voting laws that have       historically plagued communities of color. Voting is our       right as U.S. citizens. Taking away or restricting one's       ability to exercise their voice at the polls is not only       immoral; it is unconstitutional. The actions of many states       in passing  [[Page H9327]]       extremely restrictive voting laws are unjust and must be       addressed. As the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. once       stated, ``injustice anywhere is a threat to justice       everywhere.'' Congress must stand on the side of justice and       restore the Voting Rights Act.--Rev. Jimmie R. Hawkins,       Director of the Presbyterian Church (USA), Office of Public       Witness        As Reform Jews, our teachings motivate our advocacy to       protect voting rights and fight voter suppression. Rabbi       Yitzhak taught, ``A ruler is not to be appointed unless the       community is first consulted,'' (Babylonian Talmud Berochot       55a). Diminished federal voter protections and rampant voter       suppression undermines the ability of all people,       particularly communities of color, to participate in our       democracy. It is time for Congress to restore those       protections and pass the Voting Rights Advancement Act (H.R.       4/S. 561). Our faith's commitment to political participation       demands that Congress pass this Shelby fix as a step towards       ensuring that the whole community is represented.--Rabbi       Jonah Dov Pesner, Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism        Voting is at the heart of the democratic process. It is the       most fundamental access point for individuals to have a voice       in the public policy decision-making process that can shape       the future of our local, regional and global collective life.       As people of faith, we believe every vote is a voice, and       every voices counts. It is unconscionable that we are       entering the 2020 election season with fewer voting rights       protections than we had in 1965. This signals an erosion of       our democracy that is a moral crisis. The right to vote is a       national value that transcends partisanship. It goes beyond       political party identification to our core values as a nation       and the centrality of a citizen's free vote, not limited by       the powers of money, social class and unequal access to       voting. It is imperative that we pass a fix for the damage       done by the Supreme Court Shelby decision by restoring voter       protections.--Sandra Sorensen, Director of Washington Office,       United Church of Christ (UCC)        The National Advocacy Center of the Sisters of the Good       Shepherd calls on Congress to pass the Voting Rights       Advancement Act. We have seen over the last six years       increasing hostility to full voting rights for all Americans       since the U.S. Supreme Court partially struck down the Voting       Rights Act. We have seen new barriers put up to restrict the       number of voters of color, suppressing the full American       voice and skewing our response to important civil and human       rights issues in need of our attention. As people of faith,       we are called to liberate the oppressed and marginalized.       Please restore the vote.--Lawrence E. Couch, Director,       National Advocacy Center of the Sisters of the Good Shepherd        It is clearer than ever today that democracy is a process,       not a static state. Democracy requires care, investment, and       vigilance to ensure all voices are represented. The shameful       history of racism in U.S. voting systems is not over, and new       approaches designed to restrict certain communities' access       to a free and fair vote cannot be tolerated. The federal       government must act now to reinstate and expand protections       of voting rights for all people.--Joyce Ajlouny, General       Secretary, American Friends Service Committee        The right to vote without any impediments or obstructions       is one of the most basic privileges of our democracy       belonging to all age-eligible American citizens regardless of       race, religion, or gender orientation. I call upon our Senate       and House to protect this sacred right which is critical for       the defense of all our other rights and privileges.--Rev. Dr.       Jeffrey Haggray, American Baptist Home Mission Societies        American Baptist Churches, USA have officially advocated       for voter rights for many decades and we continue ``. . . to       declare the right to vote to be a basic human right, and       support programs and measures to assure this right. The right       of citizenship in a nation, to participate in the political       process, to form political parties, to have a voice in       decisions made in the political arena are basic undeniable       human rights. The Bible teaches us that all humanity is       created in God's image and that we are all valuable in God's       sight.''--Dr. C. Jeff Woods, Acting General Secretary,       American Baptist Churches, USA        We are the church, the body of Christ in this world, at       this time. We need to stop the racist suppression of the       votes of people of color. Denying people their right to vote       is counter to the will of God. This is especially true when       rich and powerful interests seek to deny people who have been       historically marginalized from shaping our society. We need       to change our policies and our laws to make voting a concrete       reality for all of God's children.--Rev. Ms. Paula Clayton       Dempsey, Executive Minister, Alliance of Baptists        People have a right and a duty to participate in society,       seeking together the common good and wellbeing of all       persons, especially the poor and vulnerable. Voter       suppression laws strike at this tenet of Catholic Social       Teaching by denying that right to those who are       disproportionately poor, especially African American, Native       American and Hispanic American communities. As faithful       citizens of every faith and humanitarian tradition, we affirm       our common responsibility to promote the dignity of every       person and to work for justice and the common good. That can       only happen if we are all afforded the basic right to vote       and to participate fully in our democratic process.--Scott       Wright, Director, Columban Center for Advocacy and Outreach        As Unitarian Universalists, our 5th Principle affirms ``the       right of conscience and the use of the democratic process       within our congregations and in society at large''.       Therefore, we advocate for restoration of full protections       under the Voting Rights Act. When our democracy is in peril,       so too are our civil rights. Racial discrimination and voter       suppression are on the rise--an unacceptable circumstance to       freedom-loving citizens of the United States and one that our       faith calls us to confront. The pernicious impacts of Shelby       County v. Holder must be halted and reversed.        As the leader of a faith-based education, witness and       advocacy organization, I know that issues like poverty,       immigration, climate change, and rising inequity in our       society cannot improve unless we defend the basic tenets of       our democracy. Our democracy works best when everyone can       fully participate. Congress should strive to make our       elections more free, more fair and more accessible. The more       Americans who participate in our elections, the better our       democracy reflects who we are as a country and the better we       can meet the complex challenges of our times.--(Pablo) Pavel       DeJesus, Executive Director, Unitarian Universalists for       Social Justice (UUSJ).                                   ____                                        Lawyers' Committee for Civil                                                Rights Under Law,                                                   December 3, 2019.      Re Recommended Vote in Favor of H.R. 4, the Voting Rights           Advancement Act.         Dear Members of the U.S. House of Representatives: On       behalf of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law,       a nonpartisan civil rights organization formed at the request       of President Kennedy to enlist the private bar's leadership       and resources in combating racial discrimination and securing       equal justice under law, I am writing to urge you to vote in       favor of H.R. 4, the Voting Rights Advancement Act (VRAA). We       oppose any Motion to Recommit (MTR).        The VRAA would restore the Section 5 preclearance process       that was struck down by the Supreme Court in the 2013 Shelby       County v. Holder decision by creating a new formula for       coverage that ensures that only states and jurisdictions with       a recent history of voting discrimination or use of voter       suppression practices would be subject to review prior to       implementing new voting laws or procedures.        Prior to Shelby, covered jurisdictions had to provide       notice to the federal government--which meant notice to the       public--before they could implement changes in their voting       practices or procedures. Such notice is of paramount       importance, because the ways that the voting rights of       minority citizens are jeopardized are often subtle. They       range from the consolidation of polling places so as to make       it less convenient for minority voters to vote, to the       curtailing of early voting hours that makes it more difficult       for hourly-wage earners to vote, to the disproportionate       purging of minority voters from voting lists under the       pretext of ``list maintenance.''        In the more than six years since the Shelby decision, the       floodgates to voting discrimination have been swung open,       threating the voting rights of millions of Americans. The       gutting of the core protection of the Voting Rights Act did       not simply harm African Americans and other people of color,       it challenged the very foundation of our democracy and our       decades-long march towards equality. Voting is the right that       is ``preservative of all rights,'' because it empowers people       to elect candidates of their choice, who will then govern and       legislate to advance other rights. But, voting rights have       always been contested in this country, with gains in turnout       and representation by people of color often met with an       inevitable backlash that sought to reduce their electoral       power.        The passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965 marked a       turning point in our nation, when the promise of equal       justice and democracy in our Constitution was made real for       people of color for the first time in our history. Since that       time, overwhelming bipartisan majorities in Congress have       reauthorized the Voting Rights Act several times, each time       amassing a significant congressional record of the current       threats to the franchise and implementing changes to ensure       the ongoing efficacy of the Voting Rights Act. Now, we ask       you to take the mantle from your predecessors and restore the       full protections of the Voting Rights Act by passing H.R. 4,       the VRAA.        Thank you for your leadership in protecting the fundamental       right to vote and our democracy by voting for H.R. 4, the       VRAA, and by opposing any Motion to Recommit.            Sincerely,                                                    Kristen Clarke,      President & Executive Director.                                   ____                                           The Leadership Conference                                       on Civil and Human Rights,                                   Washington, DC, December 4, 2019.               Support H.R. 4, Voting Rights Advancement Act         Dear Representative: On behalf of The Leadership Conference       on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition of more than 200       national organizations committed to promoting and  [[Page H9328]]       protecting the civil and human rights of all persons in the       United States, and the 68 undersigned organizations, we write       in strong support of H.R. 4, the Voting Rights Advancement       Act. We oppose any Motion to Recommit.        The Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA) is one of the most       successful civil rights laws ever enacted. Congress passed       the VRA in direct response to evidence of significant and       pervasive discrimination across the country, including the       use of literacy tests, poll taxes, intimidation, threats, and       violence. By outlawing the tests and devices that prevented       people of color from voting, the VRA and its prophylactic       preclearance formula put teeth into the 15th Amendment's       guarantee that no citizen can be denied the right to vote       because of the color of their skin.        H.R. 4 has received vocal and vigorous support from the       civil rights community because it responds to the urgent need       to stop the abuses by state and local governments in the       aftermath of the Supreme Court's infamous 2013 decision in       Shelby County v. Holder, when five justices of the Supreme       Court invalidated the VRA's preclearance provision. In its       decision, the Court stated: ``Our country has changed, and       while any racial discrimination in voting is too much,       Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy       that problem speaks to current conditions.''        Since Shelby County, discriminatory policies have       proliferated nationwide and continued in areas formerly       covered by the preclearance requirement. In states, counties,       and cities across the country, public officials have pushed       through laws and policies designed to make it harder for many       communities to vote. While we have celebrated successful       legal challenges to discriminatory voter ID laws in Texas and       North Carolina, such victories occurred only after elections       in those states were tainted by discrimination. Lost votes       cannot be reclaimed and discriminatory elections cannot be       undone.        But voter suppression is not merely the province of those       states with a long history of discrimination. Pernicious       practices such as voter purging and restrictive       identification requirements--which disproportionately affect       voters of color--occur in states throughout the nation.       Although progress has been made, some elected leaders in this       country are still working to silence people who were       historically denied access to the ballot box.        During the 116th Congress, the U.S. House Committee on the       Judiciary held extensive hearings and found significant       evidence that barriers to voter participation remain for       people of color and language-minority voters in African-      American, Asian American, Latinx, and Native American       communities. The hearings examined the History and       Enforcement of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (March 12,       2019), Enforcement of the Voting Rights Act in the State of       Texas (May 3, 2019), Continuing Challenges to the Voting       Rights Act Since Shelby County v. Holder (June 25, 2019),       Discriminatory Barriers to Voting (September 5, 2019),       Evidence of Current and Ongoing Voting Discrimination       (September 10, 2019), Congressional Authority to Protect       Voting Rights After Shelby County v. Holder (September 24,       2019), and Legislative Proposals to Strengthen the Voting       Rights Act (October 17, 2019). The Committee on House       Administration also conducted numerous hearings and amassed       significant evidence of voter suppression during the 116th       Congress.        H.R. 4 restores and modernizes the Voting Rights Act by:        Creating a new coverage formula that hinges on a finding of       repeated voting rights violations in the preceding 25 years.        Significantly, the 25-year period is measured on a rolling       basis to keep up with ``current conditions,'' so only states       and political subdivisions that have a recent record of       racial discrimination in voting are covered.        States and political subdivisions that qualify for       preclearance will be covered for a period of 10 years, but if       they establish a clean record during that time period, they       can be extracted from coverage.        Establishing ``practice-based preclearance,'' a targeted       process for reviewing voting changes in jurisdictions       nationwide focused on measures that have historically been       used to discriminate against voters of color. The process for       reviewing changes in voting is limited to a set of practices,       including:        Changes to the methods of elections (to or from at-large       elections) in areas that are racially, ethnically, or       linguistically diverse;        Reductions in language assistance;        Annexations changing jurisdictional boundaries in areas       that are racially, ethnically, or linguistically diverse;        Redistricting in areas that are racially, ethnically, or       linguistically diverse;        Reducing, consolidating, or relocating polling locations in       areas that are racially, ethnically, or linguistically       diverse; and        Changes in documentation or requirements to vote or       register.        H.R. 4 also:        Allows a federal court to order states or jurisdictions to       be covered for results-based violations, where the effect of       a particular voting measure is racial discrimination in       voting and denying citizens their right to vote;        Increases transparency by requiring reasonable public       notice for voting changes;        Allows the attorney general authority to request the       presence of federal observers anywhere in the country where       there is a serious threat of racial discrimination in voting;       and        Revises and tailors the preliminary injunction standard for       voting rights actions to recognize that there will be cases       where there is a need for immediate preliminary relief.        For over half a century, protecting citizens from racial       discrimination in voting has been bipartisan work. The VRA       was passed with leadership from both the Republican and       Democratic parties, and the reauthorizations of the       enforcement provisions were signed into law each time by       Republican presidents: President Nixon in 1970, President       Ford in 1975, President Reagan in 1982, and President Bush       in 2006.        Voting must transcend partisanship. No matter what policy       issues we care most about, we get closer to these goals       through the ballot box. The integrity of our democracy       depends on ensuring that every eligible voter can participate       in the electoral process. Passing H.R. 4 would be a giant       step toward restoring the right to vote and undoing the       damage done by the Supreme Court's Shelby County decision.       During the civil rights movement, brave Americans gave their       lives for the right to vote, and we cannot allow their legacy       and the protections they fought for to unravel. We urge       Congress to pass this historic legislation.

Re MALDEF Urges Support of the Voting Rights Advancement Act           of 2019, H.R. 4.       House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: There is no right more fundamental to       our democracy than the right to vote, and for Latino voters       and other voters of color, that right is in danger. Following       the 2013 Shelby County v. Holder decision, which effectively       ended preclearance review under Section 5 of the Voting       Rights Act of 1965 (VRA), states and localities moved to       implement discriminatory voting practices that would       previously have been blocked by the VRA. What we have seen       post-Shelby County confirms what we have long-known--that       voter discrimination lives on. Congress must act to restore       the preclearance coverage formula in the VRA, legislation       that has long-enjoyed bipartisan support. MALDEF (Mexican       American Legal Defense and Educational Fund), the nation's       leading Latino legal civil rights organization, urges you to       support the Voting Rights Advancement Act (VRAA) of 2019,       H.R. 4, to reenact safeguards to protect minority voters from       discriminatory voting laws.        The VRA is regarded as one of the most important and       effective pieces of civil rights legislation due to its       ability to protect voters of color from discriminatory voting       practices before they take place. Since its founding, MALDEF       has focused on securing equal  [[Page H9329]]       voting rights for Latinos, and promoting increased civic       engagement and participation within the Latino community, as       among its top priorities. MALDEF played a significant role in       securing the full protection of the VRA for the Latino       community through the 1975 congressional reauthorization of       the VRA. Over its now 51-year history, MALDEF has litigated       numerous cases under section 2, section 5, and section 203 of       the VRA, challenging at-large systems, discriminatory       redistricting, ballot access barriers, undue voter       registration restrictions, and failure to provide bilingual       materials. As the growth of the Latino population expands,       our work in voting rights increases as well.        Section 5 of the VRA required states with a history of       discrimination in voting to seek pre-approval of voting-      related changes from the U.S. Department of Justice or a       three-judge panel in Washington, DC. A voting-related change       that would have left minority voters worse off than before       the change would be blocked. The states and political       subdivisions that were required to submit voting-related       changes for preclearance were determined by a coverage       formula in section 4 of the VRA. The preclearance scheme--an       efficient and effective form of alternative dispute       resolution--prevented the implementation of voting-related       changes that would have denied voters of color a voice in our       elections, and it deterred many more restrictions from ever       being conceived. The Supreme Court in Shelby County--struck       down section 4 and called on Congress to enact a new formula       better tailored to current history. As a result, currently,       states or political subdivisions are no longer required to       seek preclearance unless ordered by a federal court.        However, Chief Justice Roberts recognized in the majority       opinion in Shelby County that, ``voting discrimination still       exists; no one doubts that.'' Across the U.S., racial,       ethnic, and language-minority communities are rapidly       growing--the country's total population is projected to       become majority minority by 2044. Many officials in states       and local jurisdictions fear losing political power, and the       rapid growth of communities of color is often seen as a       threat to existing political establishments. Fear provokes       those in positions of power to implement changes to dilute       the voting power of the perceived threatening minority       community. Unfortunately, now that states and local       jurisdictions are not required to submit voting-related       changes for review, there is no longer a well-kept track       record on newly implemented discriminatory practices.       Nonetheless, we know, based on our litigation and analysis of       voting changes, that states and local jurisdictions are still       using discriminatory voting tactics to suppress the political       power of minority communities.        Last month, MALDEF, NALEO, and Asian Americans Advancing       Justice--AAJC released a new report, Practice-Based       Preclearance: Protecting Against Tactics Persistently Used to       Silence Minority Communities' Votes, detailing the need for       forward-looking voting rights legislation that provides       protections for emerging minority populations. During the       VRA's more than 50-year history, all racial and ethnic       populations grew, but the growth of communities of color       significantly outpaced nonHispanic whites. While there are       states and localities where communities of color have       traditionally resided in larger numbers, growing communities       of historically underrepresented voters are now emerging in       new parts of the U.S. Between 2007 and 2014, five of the ten       U.S. counties that experienced the most rapid rates of Latino       population growth were in North Dakota or South Dakota, two       states whose overall Latino populations still account for       less than ten percent of their residents and are dwarfed by       Latino communities in states like New Mexico, Texas, and       California. It is precisely this rapid growth of different       racial or ethnic populations that results in the perception       that emerging communities of color are a threat to those in       political power.        H.R. 4 includes important protections for these emerging       populations in the form of practice-based preclearance, or       ``known-practices'' coverage. Known-practices coverage would       focus administrative or judicial review narrowly on suspect       practices that are most likely to be tainted by       discriminatory intent or to have discriminatory effects, as       demonstrated by a broad historical record. This coverage       would extend to any jurisdiction in the U.S. that is home to       a racially, ethnically, and/or linguistically diverse       population and that seeks to adopt a covered practice,       despite that practice's known likelihood of being       discriminatory when used in a diverse population. The known       practices that would be required to be pre-approved before       adopted in a diverse state or political subdivision include:       1) changes in method of election to add or replace a single-      member district with an at-large seat to a governing body, 2)       certain redistricting plans where there is significant       minority population growth in the previous decade, 3)       annexations or deannexations that would significantly alter       the composition of the jurisdiction's electorate, 4) certain       identification and proof of citizenship requirements, 5)       certain polling place closures and realignments, and 6) the       withdrawal of multilingual materials and assistance when not       matched by the reduction of those services in English. The       Practice-Based Preclearance report looked at these different       types of changes and found, based on two separate analyses of       voting discrimination, that these known practices occur with       great frequency in the modern era.        Congress must protect access to the polls and pass the       VRAA, with known-practice coverage provisions. The VRAA is a       critical piece of legislation that will restore voter       protections that were lost due to the Shelby County decision.       We cannot allow another federal election cycle to take place       without ensuring that every voter can register and cast a       meaningful ballot. MALDEF urges you to stand with all voters       and to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 4.            Sincerely,                                                    Andrea Senteno,      Regional Counsel.                                   ____                                                             SEIU,                                                   December 4, 2019.        Dear Representative: On behalf of two million members of       the Service Employees International Union (``SEIU''), I am       writing to urge you to vote in favor of H.R. 4, the Voting       Rights Advancement Act (VRAA), which will proceed to the       House floor for a vote on final passage this week.        Following the 2013 Supreme Court decision in Shelby v.       Holder, we have seen a surge of voter suppression tactics by       states and localities. These shameful tactics include the       enactment of strict voter ID laws, the purge of voters from       state voter rolls, and the closure of hundreds of polling       places that negatively impacts the ability of people of       color, immigrants, young people, and other historically       marginalized groups from accessing their constitutional right       to vote. In 2016 alone, 14 states passed new laws that       restricted access to the ballot for hard working Americans       and since then multiple federal courts found intentional       racial discrimination in our elections. These unjust actions       by states and localities to our electoral system must be       addressed with urgency to ensure the voices of working       people--Black, white & brown--are heard at the ballot box.        H.R. 4 is an essential piece of legislation that will       restore critical civil rights protections for voters while       providing clear and consistent voting laws for every state to       ensure all eligible citizens can participate in our       democracy. The VRAA responds to the wave of biased attacks on       our election system since the Shelby decision by establishing       a ``rolling'' nationwide trigger mechanism so that only       states that have a recent record of racial discrimination in       voting would be covered. Under the legislation, these states       would have to submit any changes in their voting laws to be       precleared before implementation. In addition, the VRAA would       grant more power to the federal courts to hold accountable       states or jurisdictions whose voting practices have       discriminatory results. The VRAA is the dire reform of our       electoral system that our nation needs in order to restore       this fundamental right and make our democracy more accessible       to all people.        Our democracy works best when all eligible voters, no       matter their color or how much money they make, can       participate in free and fair elections to make their voices       heard. We need Congress to restore integrity to our election       system. On behalf of our members, we are proud to support       this legislation to strengthen our democracy and values as a       nation. We will add votes on this legislation, including the       motion to recommit, to our legislative scorecard.            Sincerely,                                                    Mary Kay Henry,                                           International President.                                   ____                                                                                             AFSCME,                                                   December 3, 2019.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the members of the       American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees       (AFSCME), I write in support of the Voting Rights Advancement       Act (VRAA, H.R. 4). The VRAA is an important first step to       restoring voting rights protections and the Voting Rights Act       (VRA) of 1965.        Signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson, the VRA of       1965 was landmark legislation necessary to secure the right       to vote for every citizen. It ensured that state and local       governments would not deny any American the equal right to       vote based on race, color or membership in a minority       language group.        The U.S. Supreme Court's 2013 ruling in Shelby County,       Alabama v. Holder undermined the VRA, and eliminated the       significant requirement for states and localities with a       well-documented history of discrimination to ``preclear'' any       new changes to voting practices and procedures. As a result,       those with a history of voter disenfranchisement would no       longer have to get approval from the Department of Justice or       a court to show that their laws do not have a discriminatory       purpose or effect. The results have been devastating and pose       a significant blow to the protections provided in the VRA. In       the wake of the decision, over three dozen state legislatures       have enacted new onerous restrictions on voter access. These       recent actions include onerous voter ID laws, restrictions on       early voting, and excessive purges of voter registration       lists, all of which subsequently make voting less accessible,       less transparent, more difficult, and challenging for many       voters.        H.R. 4 is needed to restore fairness. It establishes a new       coverage formula based on repeated voting rights violations       over the preceding 25 years of a state's political       subdivisions. It also responds to nationwide discrimination       and requires ``practice-based preclearance'' for known       disenfranchisement  [[Page H9330]]       strategies that disproportionately target communities of       color.        The VRA is one of our nation's most important civil rights       laws. It is central to any effort to build a representative       democracy where citizens can exercise their most basic right       to vote. I strongly urge you to support H.R. 4 when it comes       before the House of Representatives.            Sincerely,                                                        Scott Frey,                         Director of Federal Government of Affairs.                                   ____                                                                    American Federation of Teachers,                                                   December 6, 2019.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the more than 1.7 million       members of the American Federation of Teachers, I write in       strong support of H.R. 4, the Voting Rights Advancement Act       of 2019.        This important bill is a commonsense approach that responds       to the Supreme Court's 2013 decision in Shelby County v.       Holder, which struck down a long-standing key provision of       the Voting Rights Act of 1965.        For nearly 50 years, the Voting Rights Act enshrined the       right to free and fair elections in our country. But in 2013,       the Supreme Court weakened the ``preclearance requirement''       of the Voting Rights Act, deeming it no longer justified to       address the racial and geographic disparities it sought to       remedy when enacted. As a result, laws restricting voting       rights throughout the United States surged. In fact, an       analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice found that between       2016 and 2018, counties with a history of voter       discrimination purged voters from the rolls at much higher       rates than other counties. This trend is a direct consequence       of the Supreme Court's ruling in Shelby County v. Holder.        It is an understatement to say that the Supreme Court's       decision ignored the real-life and ongoing efforts to       suppress voting rights across our nation. Today, the renewed       disenfranchisement tactics of old include, but are not       limited to, restrictive voter ID laws, outcome-driven       redistricting, limited voting hours and opportunities, and       misinformation about polling places and times. And let's be       clear, these tactics are all engineered to disproportionately       affect the voting rights of African American, Latinx,       immigrant and low-income voters, as well as students and       seniors.        It is imperative that Congress take new action to ensure       the efficacy of the Voting Rights Act. We do not want future       generations of students to read in their history lessons that       the Supreme Court in 2013 turned the clock back on decades of       progress in voting rights and that that was the final word.        Passage of H.R. 4 is a critical step toward fulfilling our       aspirations for a stronger democracy, where all voters can       exercise their fundamental rights. The long-term damage of       not doing so is unacceptable.        To this end, I encourage you to fulfill your civic duty by       ensuring all Americans have their most fundamental of civil       rights protected by voting YES on H.R. 4.        Thank you for considering our views on this important       matter.            Sincerely,                                                  Randi Weingarten,                                                         President.                                   ____                                                                                   National Council of                                                    Jewish Women,                                                   December 4, 2019.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: The National Council of Jewish Women       (NCJW) urges you to vote for the Voting Rights Advancement       Act (H.R. 4) when it comes to the floor this week and vote       against any Motion to Recommit.        NCJW is a grassroots organization of volunteers and       advocates who turn progressive ideals into action. Throughout       its history, NCJW has educated and engaged our members and       supporters to drive voter turnout and expand voting rights,       including advocating for women's suffrage and the historic       Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA). This work is in pursuit of       tzedek, or justice--a core value of Judaism an inspiration       for our advocacy. Today, we work for election laws, policies,       and practices that ensure easy and equitable access and       eliminate obstacles to the electoral process so that every       vote counts and can be verified.        H.R. 4 would restore the Voting Rights Act to its former       strength. The 2013 Shelby decision effectively ended the       federal government's ability, granted by the VRA, to preclear       changes to state and local election laws before they went       into effect. In his decision, Chief Justice Roberts urged       Congress to update the formula that determines which       jurisdictions need to participate in preclearance. H.R. 4       does exactly that by creating a new coverage formula based on       the preceding 25 years.        Voter suppression most harms already marginalized       communities. Since Shelby, dozens of laws have passed across       the country making it easier to suppress the vote. These laws       disproportionately impact communities of color, minority-      language speakers, low-income voters, elderly and young       voters, women, and transgender individuals.        Voting is a fundamental right, protective of all other       rights. Congress has the power and responsibility to ensure       that every eligible person can cast a ballot by passing H.R.       4.            Sincerely,                                                    Jody Rabhan,                                               Chief Policy Officer.                                   ____                                                                                     Public Citizen,                                                   December 5, 2019.        Dear Representative: Tomorrow, the House of Representatives       will vote on the Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2019 (H.R.       4). This is an historic moment to cure an historic injustice.       Public Citizen strongly urges you to vote for H.R. 4.        The principle of ``one person, one vote'' is critical to       our constitutional democracy--but for too much of our history       it was honored in the breach. The passage of the Voting       Rights Act of 1965 (VRA) is one of the proudest moments in       American history, as it affirmed this principle and corrected       the shameful denial and suppression of votes to African       Americans and other people of color.        Shamefully, however, the U.S. Supreme Court in Shelby       County v. Holder stripped away Section 5 of the VRA, a       cornerstone of the law's protections. Since the Shelby       ruling, 23 states have enacted laws that disenfranchise       individuals and groups by restricting their ability to vote.       These sorts of repressive voter suppression tactics are       precisely the sort of draconian, discriminatory measures the       VRA was enacted to prevent.        It is essential that H.R. 4 be enacted into law to repair       the damage done by the Shelby decision. This legislation       would modernize the VRA and restore protections necessary to       prevent racial voter discrimination, voter purges and voter       suppression.        The heroes of the civil rights movement fought for the       VRA's original passage in 1965 amidst harsh Jim Crow-era       disenfranchisement laws and in the face of violent       opposition. It is utterly unconscionable that our nation has       backtracked on the voting rights progress achieved after       passage of the Voting Rights Act. Our country is better than       this.        Public Citizen urges in the strongest terms that you to       vote in favor of H.R. 4 and oppose any efforts that could       weaken or undermine the legislation.            Sincerely,                                                   Robert Weissman,                                                         President.     Mr. Speaker, I oppose the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I oppose this amendment because  it is a mere distraction. It is an attempt to politicize the Voting  Rights Act of 1965 by interjecting campaign finance and settlement  terms into civil rights legislation.   If Republicans were really serious about voting rights--about voting  rights--they would actually be willing to come to the table and talk  about how we can fully restore section 4 of the Voting Rights Act of  1965.   Leave it up to our colleagues across the aisle to interject money and  finance into civil rights law. What has been lost today in this debate  is the very heart of this bill; it is the central meaning of the bill.   Let's not forget the brave patriots of the civil rights and voting  rights movement who marched, prayed, and died for the right to vote.  These foot soldiers for equality, like our very own   John Lewis, were  ordinary citizens who dared to achieve extraordinary social change by  forcing this Nation to live up to its ideals of equality and justice  for all.   We know, Mr. Speaker, that the price of freedom is not free. It has  been bought and paid for by those brave foot soldiers so that, one day,  a little Black girl from Selma, Alabama, could sit in this august body.   I know I am not the only Black and Brown colleague of ours who owes  our very presence in this Chamber to the Voting Rights Act of 1965.   Mr. Speaker, old battles have become new again. We fight for the same  equity that these foot soldiers fought for in Selma.   Progress is elusive. Every generation must fight to maintain the  progress that we have had and to seek to advance it.   Since the Supreme Court's decision in 2013 in Shelby v. Holder,  States across this country have enacted harsh measures that make it  more difficult to vote.   Mr. Speaker, I dare say that Selma is now. Since the Shelby decision,  25 States have put in place new voting restrictions.    Selma is still now, because, since the Shelby decision, 12 States  have laws making it harder for citizens to register and stay  registered.   Selma is now. Since the Shelby decision, 10 more States have made  early and absentee voting more difficult.   While today there are no poll taxes or literacy tests, these modern- day barriers to voting are no less discriminatory or suppressive than  those old practices.   Voting rights should be a nonpartisan issue, and the fact that, in  this amendment, they would try to politicize voting rights, we should  all--all--be appalled by that.   Voting rights have been, always, very nonpartisan, and it used to be  that the Voting Rights Acts passed overwhelmingly with Republicans and  Democrats. In fact, the VRA was reauthorized five times--yes--under  Republican and Democratic Presidents. So what has changed?   I ask my colleagues across the aisle: What are you afraid of? Why are  you afraid to let more Americans vote?   Is it because your own political interests are only realized when you  limit access to the ballot box?   I say: Shame on you. Shame on you.   Could it be that what we need more than anything else is to look at  our North Star; that is,   John Lewis. Mr. Lewis, we are all honored,  every day, to be able to call you ``colleague,'' and the reality is  that what happened on that bridge in Selma, Alabama, in 1965 is still  occurring today.   If one person who is an American and who is a voter is not allowed to  vote, it goes to the very heart of the integrity of all of our  elections. We should all want to make sure that every American can  vote.   So, let us make sure that we remember what Elijah Cummings would say.  He would say: We are better than this.   We are better than this. Having an amendment that deals with  politicizing the Voting Rights Act is appalling.   I ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the amendment and to remember  the words of another civil rights activist, Amelia Boynton Robinson,  who also was bludgeoned on that bridge with   John Lewis in 1965, who  came to this Chamber in 2015, as my special guest, for the State of the  Union. Many of you on both sides of the aisle were willing to host her.   I say to you what she said. When people said: ``I stand on your  shoulders,'' she said, ``Get off my shoulders. Do your own work.''   I say now: Miss Amelia, we are doing our own work because we are  voting to restore the Voting Rights Act of 1965.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
