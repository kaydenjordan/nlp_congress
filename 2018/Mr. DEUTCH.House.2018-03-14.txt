 Mr. Speaker, today marks 1 month since the shooting at  Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida; 1 month  since we lost 14 students and 3 teachers in yet another senseless act  of gun violence; 1 month since the survivors inside those hallways have  seen their lives changed forever.   The survivors and the grieving families are not just grieving their  loss. They are helping to change the direction of this Congress and the  direction of this country.   Mr. Speaker, I am leaving from here to go join the thousands of  students who have descended upon the Capitol today, whose leadership  will help guide the direction of this country, and who understand that  1 month after the horrific shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High  School--1 month in--and this Congress has failed to act.   There are thousands out there today. There will be hundreds of  thousands and millions more in the weeks ahead.   The community that I represent, Mr. Speaker, will not be defined in  the future by the tragedy that happened at Marjory Stoneman Douglas  High School. It will be defined by the leadership of the student  survivors who are inspiring a nation and helping to take us to a place  where children can feel safe going to school in the morning and parents  can know that when they take their kids to school in the morning, they  will be able to pick them up safely at the end of the day.   That is the result of this tragedy. That is what this is going to  mean for our country. We are going to follow the lead of these student  leaders. They are an inspiration to us. They are an inspiration to all  of us, and I am off to join them now.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from New York.   Mr. Speaker, the trauma that my community in Parkland, Florida,  experienced was not unique. Gun violence tears apart American  communities on a daily basis. So, no, what happened on February 14 when  14 students and three teachers were hunted in their schools with an AR- 15 assault rifle by a former student, that wasn't unique.   But the problem of gun violence in America is a uniquely American  problem. It is an epidemic. It is a complex problem. There are many  facets. But we know what we need to do, and I am committed to taking  any step to getting any new policy across the finish line that will  make our kids safer.   This bill, the STOP School Violence Act, is a good bill. It will not  solve our gun problem. It won't ban bump stocks or require Americans to  be 21 to buy a gun, fix our broken background check system, or get  weapons of war--the weapons of choice for mass shooters--off our  streets and out of our communities. But it will help troubled students  who need help get help, and it will help teachers and law enforcement  identify potential threats before it is too late.   Before we vote, I would like to make a few things clear. First, this  isn't a response to the tragedy at Marjory Stoneman Douglas. In fact,  Congressman Rutherford and I introduced this bill a week before the  shooting. The programs in this bill are based on rigorous, evidence- based evaluation. They are proven to help reduce isolation and identify  kids who need help.   We had no idea at the time that we wouldn't be able to move fast  enough to stop this tragedy. We had no idea that we would have an  urgent need to help get more American schools access to these programs.  But since Congress has failed the American people by ignoring the  deadly scourge of gun violence, since we failed the families of  Stoneman Douglas just like we failed the families of Sandy Hook,  Columbine, and so many others, we owe it to students and teachers  across this country to at least give them tools to help identify  dangerous behavior.   The failure of Congress to take action in response to gun violence  has left the American gun violence debate in a ridiculous place. Armed  teachers in every hallway? Is that what we want education to be in  America? No. I am glad this bill includes a specific prohibition  against the use of grant dollars to arm school personnel, including  teachers, or to train school personnel to use firearms.   Since Congress has failed the American people by ignoring the scourge  of gun violence and failed the families of Stoneman Douglas, the  failure of Congress to take action has left us in this position of  debating gun violence where we are hesitant to even take small steps.  This is a small and important step.   I have heard civil rights concerns related to racial profiling and  discrimination associated with threat assessments in anonymous  reporting, and I am sensitive to those. Congress should never be in a  position to make this serious problem worse with new programs to expand  the discrimination already entrenched in our school system and society  as a whole.   I know the evidence shows that discriminatory discipline in schools  can have dramatic, long-term effects on academic performance and wide- ranging impact. But this bill, Mr. Speaker, does not perpetuate  discriminatory policies. Zero tolerance and other questionable  discipline policies are not evidence based, and, as such, would not be  considered a proper use of grant funds.    STOP School Violence program grants are not intended to be used to  discipline students. Instead, threat assessment intervention protects  potential victims and addresses the underlying problems to make schools  safe for everyone. Finally, studies on evidence-based school threat  assessment intervention practices have shown that these programs  actually decrease racial profiling, bullying, suicides, and  suspensions.   I am proud of the bipartisan work that has gone into this bill, and  once we have taken this step--this astonishingly modest yet important  first step--we must finally do our jobs and work together to make  meaningful changes toward stopping the epidemic of gun violence in this  country. I know that this does not go far enough in terms of what we  need to do. I understand that. I believe it deeply. But it is an  important, bipartisan step that we should take today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, many veterans face extraordinary obstacles when they  return home, especially in retirement.   Too often, one of the obstacles to a safe and secure retirement for  our veterans are so-called pension poachers. These are people who  create high-pressure sales pitches that directly target older veterans.  They make big promises, knowing they have no intention of ever  delivering on them.   These are criminals who not only prey on our veterans, they prey on  every American taxpayer who wants to do right by those who have served  our country. They prey on the fact that we try to take good care of our  veterans. They try to do it for financial gain. It is despicable, and  we need to take action to stop it and make them pay for it. It is our  job to ensure that they can't get away with it.   That is why I am proud to have partnered with my colleague, fellow  Floridian, a veteran and my friend, Mr. Rooney, to draft the Preventing  Crimes Against Veterans Act. This bill will give Federal prosecutors  the tools they need to target criminals who actively work to avoid  current mail and wire fraud statutes, all while targeting our veterans.  It is time to crack down on pension poachers and fraudsters.   I am thankful for Chairman Goodlatte, Ranking Member Nadler, and my  Judiciary colleagues for their support in helping to get this bill to  the  [[Page H1573]]  floor. I thank every Member of this House who voted unanimously to pass  this legislation in the last Congress.   Finally, I would like to thank Veterans Service Officer Greg Dover  from Palm Beach County, Florida, who has helped to alert my office of  these schemes and has worked tirelessly on behalf of our veterans to  stand up for their rights and the benefits they deserve.   I ask all of my colleagues to support our veterans and to vote  ``yes'' on the Preventing Crimes Against Veterans Act.
