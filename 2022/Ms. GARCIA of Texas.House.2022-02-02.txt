 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the  continued positive economic recovery led by the Biden administration.   In December, the Texas unemployment rate dropped all the way down to  5 percent compared to 12.9 percent at the height of the pandemic.   Service sector employment is now up above prepandemic levels, but a  strong economy for the future is only possible with smart investment  today. That is why the benefits the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs  Act will bring to my home State of Texas are critically vital. The  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is bringing jobs, opportunities,  and a better quality of life for Texans.   For Texas, the infrastructure bill means more than $35 billion in  projects alone, and that is just our State. These projects include  replacing old lead pipes from schools, increasing broadband access,  road and bridge repairs, and the maintenance of ports. And all this  means jobs, jobs, and more jobs.   Mr. Speaker, I think it is important to outline some of the biggest  provisions for Texans.   First, Texas is expected to receive $537 million to repair 818  bridges across the State, many in my district. This is huge.   Next, Texas will get about $1.2 billion for infrastructure  development for airports. Airports are critical, not just for  travelers, but because they are hubs for workers. And, of course, that  means jobs.   And Texas will receive at least $100 million to help provide  broadband internet coverage across the State. These dollars will  provide access to at least 1,058,000 Texans who currently lack high- speed internet. Mr. Speaker, every time I go back home to south Texas,  I am one of those Texans at my sister's house. She has no high-speed  internet.   As we have learned from the pandemic, internet is no longer a luxury;  it is a necessity. So this funding is critical.   Mr. Speaker, $2.9 billion is headed to Texas to improve water  infrastructure. This will ensure that clean, safe drinking water is  accessible in all communities, in their homes and their schools.   For decades, Texas infrastructure has suffered due to lack of  investment. We have seen it plenty of times, especially from last  year's electrical grid failure to the damage to pipelines, roads, and  bridges due to regrettably more frequent natural disasters.   It is time for Texans to have working infrastructure that protects  them, not hurts them.  [[Page H336]]    This law will kickstart new projects, create jobs, and put Texas on  the right track. And that, Mr. Speaker, means that working families  will have a better quality of life across the State.                            ____________________
