 Mr. Speaker, I rise today during Black History  Month to celebrate a remarkable woman and a fierce advocate for Staten  Island's African American community, Ms. Margie Garvin.   Sadly, Margie's unyielding commitment to increasing voter awareness  was spurred by her own experience with racism after she moved to Staten  Island's Park Hill Houses in 1979. When Margie went to borough hall to  try to update her voter registration a man there mockingly told Margie:  ``You people don't vote.''   ``Well, if my people don't vote,'' she said, ``where can I go get  some voter registration forms?''   Ever since, she has been an unstoppable force on Staten Island,  registering voters and getting people out to the polls.   In between election days, she is out there in the community,  demanding better playgrounds for kids, holding her elected officials  accountable, cooking meals for seniors, and so much more.   I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating Ms. Margie Garvin, who  is on the ground in the community, putting in the hard work to make New  York City's Staten Island and the United States of America a better  place.                            ____________________
