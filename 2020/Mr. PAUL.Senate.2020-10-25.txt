 Madam President, I rise today to honor one of  Louisville's finest, Louisville Metro Police Officer Robinson  Desroches, who was shot on September 23, 2020, during the protest in  Louisville. Fortunately, he is expected to make a full recovery. I join  my fellow Kentuckians in wishing Officer Desroches a speedy recovery.   Police work is an unquestionably difficult and dangerous job, but it  is among the noblest callings. Each and every day, officers risk their  lives to keep our communities safe.

Its 200-year history--which will be celebrated  this year by the placement of a Kentucky Historical Society marker--has  much to teach us as we face the struggles of the year 2020. Lynnville  became a settlement even before Graves County was founded and endured  the Civil War, the Black Patch Tobacco War of the early 20th century,  two town fires that completely destroyed local commerce, and even the  fiery destruction of its post office, about which The Courier-Journal  wrote that ``nothing remains but the postmaster himself.'' After each  bout of catastrophic loss, Lynnville's businesses, farmers, preachers,  and neighbors rebuilt structurally and recaptured their beloved  community. Their history of resilience and recovery is a refreshing and  poignant reminder to us all--from within the tiniest towns to our  Nation's finest cities--of the resilience that formed, nurtured, and  sustains our country. Thank you, Lynnville, KY, for being a symbol of  this important value, and congratulations on the celebration of your  200th anniversary.                            ____________________
