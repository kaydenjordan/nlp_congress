 Mr. President, the men and women at the company Delphi  Technologies helped make General Motors the world's largest automaker.  Yet those workers lost the retirement they earned through no fault of  their own when their company went bankrupt during the great recession.   That was a time--some of us were here then; Senator Crapo and I were  both here then--when Washington bailed out Wall Street, the people who  caused the crisis, but left too many Americans like the Delphi  retirees--again, who did nothing wrong--on their own.   Now, after years of effort by workers and retirees in Ohio and in  other States, it is past time for the U.S. Senate to do its job to  restore full retirement benefits for the thousands of Ohioans and tens  of thousands nationally of Delphi salaried retirees across the country.   I have been fighting for them and urging the Pension Benefit Guaranty  Corporation to do the right thing since 2009. I thought we had this  problem solved years ago when I blocked President Obama's nominee to  head the PBGC, Josh Gotbaum. We hoped that would signal to the  President that we were serious: PBGC needed to do the right thing for  Delphi workers. Unfortunately, Delphi retirees know what happened: He  got the job anyway; they didn't get the help they needed.   President Obama didn't do it. The next President, President Trump,  promised, went to Youngstown, went to Dayton, promised he would take  care of these retirees, and Ohioans voted for him. Ohioans thought  President Trump, this time, would be different, that he would do  something. Once again, American workers were left on their own.   We kept working. These retirees never gave up. This year, we  reintroduced legislation--with Congressman Ryan, a Democrat from Ohio;  Congressman Kildee, a Democrat from Michigan; Congressman Turner, a  Republican from Ohio--to save these pensions. We named the bill in  honor of  [[Page S4018]]  Susan Muffley, a Delphi retiree so cash-strapped after losing her  pension that she avoided seeing her doctor, and she passed away too  early as a result.   It is a bipartisan bill. We have Senator Portman and Senator Young on  board in the Senate, along with 39 Republicans who joined Congressman  Turner from Dayton voting for this in the House last week. The White  House supports it as well. The White House said:         By ensuring that those who put in a career of hard work       will receive the pension benefits they earned, this       legislation supports a secure retirement for affected       workers.    That is what the White House said.   So we have Senator Portman and Senator Young here. We have 39 House  Republicans on board. A number of Democrats are on board. The President  of the United States is on board.   Promises from President Obama and President Trump--now is the time.  These Ohioans and workers across the Midwest earned these pensions. It  is past time to restore them. The Senate has that opportunity today.   I hope my colleagues of both parties will join Senator Portman and  me.   I yield the floor to my friend from Ohio.    Mr. President, I thank my friend Senator Portman for our  work together on this.   Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 6929,  which was received from the House and is at the desk; that the bill be  considered read a third time and passed; and that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I thank Senator Crapo. Senator Crapo and I  have worked together on a number of things. He was chair of the Banking  Committee the last 4 years. I was his ranking member and worked with  him and Greg and his staff on a number of things. I take him at his  word.   I know that Senator Portman and Senator Crapo and I sit also on the  Finance Committee. And I am serious about this. I just had a private  conversation with Senator Crapo. He seems serious. I know Senator  Portman is.   We have waited too long. There are far too many people. It is not a  huge number, as Senator Portman said--not a huge number of people--but  it is awfully important to them. I know what it means to a community  that is struggling, like the Mahoning Valley and the Miami Valley.  Those two communities happen to have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds  of these retirees. When their pension shrinks like this, it affects  their buying power, it affects their standard of living, and it affects  the prosperity of the community.   So we will be back together working on it. I thank Senator Crapo. I  am disappointed, but I thank him.                             Tribute to Bill Nell    Mr. President, I rise today on a cheerful duty, if you will, to  recognize Bill Nell, who retired this month after a long career of  service, not working in the Senate but sort of working around the  Senate.   Bill was deputy director of the Congressional Program at the Aspen  Institute, something not particularly known to the public. It is a  nonprofit working to bring together diverse perspectives to solve  challenges facing the United States and the world.  [[Page S4019]]    Bill was the second hire when the Aspen Institute's Congressional  Program began. He is one of the Aspen Institute's longest serving  employees--35 years at Aspen.   Almost every week, for as long as I can remember, that the Senate and  the House were in session, Bill brought together Democrats and  Republicans from across the ideological spectrum for breakfast and  conversations with leading public policy scholars. Typically on a  Thursday morning at 8, you could come, and there would be 10 or 15 or  20 House and Senate Members--fairly evenly divided, depending on the  topic, perhaps, between the parties--and a scholar or an activist or  someone that Bill generally recruited came in and talked to us.   It helped educate us, for sure. It brought us together in ways that  the public doesn't necessarily see but helped us discuss issues with  each other. And we learned in so many ways about each other and about  these public issues. We learned from experts. We learned from each  other.   Bill helped host 636 breakfasts--someone counted them at Aspen--over  his career of service. During the hustle and bustle of the workweek,  these Aspen breakfasts were a welcome respite where Members of Congress  could come to listen and discuss and learn from experts, with little  partisanship involved. But Bill had brought in these experts. We  learned from them. We learned from one another.   I wish everyone could sit in on those breakfasts and see the  thoughtfulness of so many Members of both parties in Congress. It  really taught me a lot about partisanship and that most of my  colleagues here--I would not say everyone, but most of my colleagues  here--are here for the right reasons and want to do a good job, and the  thoughtfulness exhibited in those meetings was so important.   Bill was diligent about bringing a balanced presentation of topics  and experts at the forefront of their fields. These breakfasts helped  us to consider others' perspectives and think about things we might not  have thought about otherwise. Sometimes we found common ground, an  experience or opinion or a priority that our constituents share. It is  how we got things done. Whenever we could find agreement, we worked  together to accomplish things for the people whom we served.   It brings to mind one of my colleagues who is about to retire, Roy  Blunt from Missouri. He served with me in the House. I knew him,  actually, even before that. He one time said--and he is a conservative  Republican, and I am decidedly not. He said:         I have known Sherrod Brown for 30 years, and we have agreed       exactly five times.    Then he laughed, and then he said:         But all five of those are Federal law.    And that is what really matters. Senator Crapo and I look at the  world very differently. Senator Portman and I look at the world very  differently, but Senator Portman and I put together the strongest  language ever in Federal law on ``Buy American.''   We have done a number of issues like that. You may look at things  differently, but you find things you can agree on, and you go to town  and make it happen.   So back to Bill. Those who work closely with him describe him as one  of the hardest working people they know, and you can see that in these  records. By virtue of his diligence and his preparation, Bill was able  to make his job, which was anything but this, appear effortless.   His longtime colleague, former Ag Secretary, Congressman Dan  Glickman, recognized Bill as the ``soul of Aspen,'' as a natural leader  and a jack-of-all-trades.   His current boss, until his retirement last week, former Congressman  Charlie Dent--Glickman is a Democrat; Dent is a Republican--called Bill  an anti-procrastinator when I called him on the phone to talk about  him. It is a title rare in a town where ``procrastination'' seems to be  everyone's middle name. Bill's enduring personality is kindness, and he  was nothing if not kind. He brought so many together. He made people  feel comfortable. He made people heard. I have no idea what his  ideology or his party was. We didn't talk about that. He just served  and helped us understand. He seemed to have no enemies in doing his  job.   In retirement, Bill is spending time back in his beloved Montana,  just outside of Yellowstone, one of my favorite places in the country,  where I, years ago, took my daughters, as a single parent, on a train  to see Yellowstone for a week. He is spending time in his beloved  Montana with his beloved wife Cindy, a retired public school teacher  and an education activist.   The Aspen breakfast will continue. Bill will be missed by all of us  who were blessed by his kindness, his curiosity, and his capability. He  made this place work better. He reminded us of the importance of self- government, of democracy. It is up to us to uphold that legacy, to keep  working with each other towards a better future for the people whom we  serve.   Thank you so much, Bill Nell. We wish you the best in retirement.    Mr. President, I have four requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
