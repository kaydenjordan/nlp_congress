 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday, the Judiciary Subcommittee on  Border Security and Immigration that I chair held a hearing on the  humanitarian and security crisis along the southern border. One of the  witnesses we heard from was Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost, who  leads the dedicated law enforcement officers who safeguard our Nation's  borders every day. She has been with the Border Patrol for 25 years,  and she has witnessed firsthand the ebb and flow of border crossings  during that entire quarter century.   Chief Provost announced the most recent data that shows how dire the  situation along our southern border is. She described these numbers as  off the charts, which I think is a gentle way of putting it.   Before I get to the numbers, let me provide some context. In October  2018, the start of the fiscal year, Customs and Border Protection  encountered nearly 61,000 migrants at the border. That is higher than  any month in the previous fiscal year. At the time, we were all alarmed  by the increase, but last month's numbers completely eclipsed those  levels. Chief Provost announced at our hearing yesterday that in the  month of April, CBP encountered more than 109,000 illegal immigrants  along the southern border. From October to April, we jumped from  roughly 61,000 to 109,000 per month, a 78-percent increase over just  the 6-month period.   In addition to that enormous monthly total, she told us about the  record-breaking daily total last week. Border Patrol apprehended 5,200  people in a single day--the highest number on record. The problem is  that we can't simply send these migrants home under the current state  of the law. So the more individuals we apprehend, the more detention  space we need. If we don't have the detention space, these individuals  would simply just be released into the American population. We will  never hear from most of them again, unless they commit some other  crime.   But the fact of the matter is, we are overtaxing the capabilities of  the Border Patrol, of Customs and Border Protection, of the local  communities, and of the nongovernmental organizations that try to  assist these migrants while they are in our country and in our custody.  On certain days over the last month, CBP has had more than 14,000  people in custody, far greater than the capacity they are able to hold.   People may ask: Why do we have to detain people? Why can't we just  let them go and tell them to show back up for a future court date?   We know from sad experience that the majority will not return for  that court date, even if they have legitimate claims for asylum. We now  know that there are more than 700,000--I think approaching 800,000-- backlog immigration cases waiting to be heard by an immigration judge.  This, again, is overwhelming our capacity to deal with these on an  individual basis.   Back to the numbers, earlier this week the Rio Grande Valley Sector  announced that their stations and processing centers were holding more  than 7,000 illegal immigrants, and that is just one Border Patrol  sector. In a recent television interview, Acting DHS Secretary Kevin  McAleenan accurately described these facilities as being similar to  police stations. Suffice it to say that CBP does not have the  facilities or resources to manage that many people in a police station- like environment.   If you think that sounds pretty grim, just wait because it gets  worse. We aren't only overwhelmed by the number of individuals coming  across the border but by the types of people who are arriving. I am  talking about children and families who are mostly from Central  America. We were told that, all told, Border Patrol encounters, in a  given year, individuals from 140 different countries.   Since the criminal organizations that smuggle people into the United  States are open for business, they are more than happy to take a  Bangladeshi, a Yemeni, somebody from Iraq or from Afghanistan or, for  that matter, from Iran and bring them across the border into the United  States.    When our detention facilities were built, they were designed to hold  single adults for a short duration, which used to account for the  majority of people apprehended. That is simply not the case anymore.  The human smugglers and criminal organizations that charge $5,000,  $6,000, $7,000 a head to bring people into the United States have  studied our laws and have learned how to exploit the loopholes and the  gaps. That  [[Page S2761]]  is why the composition of these migrants has changed so much over the  years from single adults to children and to families.   In April, 68 percent of those apprehended were either families or  unaccompanied children. This has put the Border Patrol in a very  awkward position. Chief Provost noticed that her agents were spending  now about 40 percent of their time processing migrants and providing  care and transportation. She had a picture--a chart--that she  demonstrated with a Border Patrol agent nursing a baby with a bottle  and another Border Patrol agent cradling an infant in his arms. In  other words, instead of being on the frontlines against illegal drugs  coming across our border--which contributed to the deaths of 70,000  Americans last year alone and where 90 percent of the heroin and  synthetic opioids known as fentanyl come principally from Mexico-- instead of fighting that scourge and stopping that poison from coming  into the United States, our Border Patrol has now been diverted to  being, essentially, a childcare center handing out juice boxes and  diapers. They aren't processing or stopping illegal immigrants or the  human traffickers.   Trying to deal with these record high numbers, we know that the  numbers of people coming across are far exceeding the resources  available for the Border Patrol. With so many more people to process  and more manpower needed, the Border Patrol has been taken off the  line, leaving areas of the border vulnerable to exploitation by human  smugglers and drug cartels.   Think about it. If you are a leader of a drug cartel trying to move  heroin, methamphetamine, fentanyl, or other illegal drugs into the  United States, why wouldn't you try to flood the Border Patrol with  children and families so they would be taken off the line and  distracted to take care of these individuals, as opposed to stopping  those drugs? Of course, this is part of a larger plan.   Unfortunately, the Congress is doing little, if anything, about it. I  don't think it takes an expert to see that things are bad, and I hope  my colleagues can recognize that we need to act before they get worse.  This is a problem that the President can't solve on his own and the  Border Patrol can't solve on its own. This is about the legal  authorities that the U.S. Government has to deal with this chaos and  this humanitarian crisis at our own border. It takes a change in laws  passed by Congress. So we must act on a bipartisan and bicameral basis  to respond or this is going to get worse and worse.   Yesterday Chief Provost compared the current situation to holding a  bucket under a faucet. It doesn't matter how many buckets you have if  you never turn the water off. Well, that is what we need to do--stop  the flow of people trying to enter our country illegally.   Last week, Congressman Henry Cuellar--my friend, a Democrat from  Laredo, TX--and I introduced a bill called the HUMANE Act, which would  at least slow that faucet to a drip and provide serious relief for the  personnel who serve along the border. It focuses on the problems posed  by high numbers of unaccompanied children and families, whom we do not  have the capacity to adequately care for. It requires the Department of  Homeland Security to keep families together through court proceedings-- something we all should agree to--and provides safeguards to prevent  children from being placed in the custody of dangerous individuals--sex  offenders, human traffickers, and the like.   It also requires the Department of Homeland Security to establish  regional processing centers in high traffic areas and to improve the  processing of humanitarian relief claims by requiring those to be  processed at ports of entry.   Finally, it mandates the hiring of 600 new CBP personnel to alleviate  the personnel strain and get more of these highly trained men and women  back on the frontlines. I hope we will have the opportunity to review  this legislation soon in the Judiciary Committee. Chairman Graham has  told me he is willing to do that, and I hope our friends in the House  will take it up soon.    America would never think of sending our men and women in the  military to war without providing them the training, the equipment, and  the support they need in order to fight and win our Nation's wars. Yet  somehow we have sent the Border Patrol into a battle that is designed  for failure. They simply don't have the numbers. They don't have the  resources. We don't have the facilities in order to deal with this. We  can't just try to staunch the flow while it gets worse and worse and  worse and worse. Instead of putting another bucket under the faucet as  it runs wide open, we need to turn that faucet off, and the only way we  can do that is by Congress acting. It is on us, and we must act and act  soon.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I recognize and congratulate  the Texas blues rock band ZZ Top on their 50th anniversary. It is only  fitting that this group kicks off their anniversary tour in their home  State of Texas.   With plenty of gas in the tank, Dusty, Billy, Frank, and the rest of  their crew will be traveling to more than 60 cities across 14 countries  in their commemorative tour. An appropriate reminder of ZZ Top's  history, this tour clearly shows they have been able to reach millions  of fans across the globe for decades.   In 1969, two rival blues rock bands in Houston, TX--Billy's Moving  Sidewalks and Frank and Dusty's American Blues--coalesced into one  band, ZZ Top. Two years later, they dropped their first album, aptly  titled, ``ZZ Top's First Album.''   Bandmates Billy Gibbons, Frank Beard, and Dusty Hill have been  writing songs and creating a musical fusion between blues and southern  rock since their formation and have never looked back. Though they draw  inspiration from music greats like Jimi Hendrix, BB King, Cream, George  Jones, and Texas blues guitarist Freddie King, all of their influences  transform into one singularly unique sound.   In 1973, the band released its third album ``Tres Hombres,'' which  catapulted them to the national spotlight with the hit song ``La  Grange,'' still one of ZZ Top's signature songs.   ZZ Top's momentum and success built during its first decade  culminated in the legendary 1976 tour entitled the World Wide Texas  Tour, a production that included a longhorn, a buffalo, buzzards,  rattlesnakes, and a Texas-shaped stage. If their tour wasn't proof  enough that things are bigger in Texas, then maybe their record sales  will convince you otherwise.   The band has sold over 50 million records worldwide, and their 1983  album ``Eliminator,'' sold more than 10 million copies and included  rock hit ``Sharp Dressed Man.''   ``The Little Ol' Band From Texas'' has played for millions of fans  across the globe, Sweden to Australia, Japan to Germany. The band is  among a select few to say they have toured the globe for half a  century.   ZZ Top also lays undisputed claim to being the longest running major  rock band with the original members intact. Their iconic beards,  powerful rock anthems, dedication to music, and impressive artistic  talent has sustained them as a perennial rock power, whose music will  stand the test of time.   Over five decades of creating music, ZZ Top earned eight Top 40 hits  on the Billboard Hot 100; six No. 1 mainstream rock hits; and ranked  44th on VH1's 2000 ``100 Greatest Hard Rock Artists.''   ZZ Top's accomplishments throughout the years culminated in their  induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004, where they are  recognized as some of the greatest rock artists in the world.   I congratulate Billy, Frank, and Dusty on their 50th anniversary and  wish them luck as they embark on their year of touring around the  world.                            ____________________
