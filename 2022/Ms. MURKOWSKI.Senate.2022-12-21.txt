 Mr. President, I join my colleague to speak about the       PUMP Act, Providing Urgent Maternal Protections for Nursing Mothers       Act. Senator Merkley has outlined, I think well, the benefits of this       bill. Effectively, what this act does is it fixes an oversight which       unintentionally excluded about 9 million working moms from being able       to pump breast milk while at work.        I think we recognize, as Senator Merkley has said, women want to       come--so many want to be able to come back to the workforce after       giving birth, but they also want to be able to provide their infant,       their child, with the significant benefits that come with a mother's       milk.        These working moms are a significant part of our workforce. I think       it is incumbent upon us to make sure that they can pump while at work       without imposing burdensome requirements on businesses.        I have been the lead Republican on the PUMP Act now, working with       Senator Merkley for a couple years--a couple years working to get to       this point. It is so unfortunate that at this late date on the       calendar, as we are looking to close out, that this measure, this       important measure--important for the mothers, important for babies,       important for employers--it is so unfortunate that it is being held at       this moment.        It is unfortunate because I think what we have in front of us now is       a fair and a balanced proposal. It allows moms to pump at work while       ensuring that, again, businesses aren't saddled with burdensome and       costly regulation. The Chamber of Commerce has endorsed the measure.       This is too important to not continue the good work.        I want to acknowledge not only the work of Senator Merkley on this,       but to Senators Murray, Burr, Cantwell, and Wicker. They worked with us       and they negotiated in good faith to get the text to a good place and       to really help to develop the support for this bill.        But I do think that the work that has come to this point, the very       important sections that have gone forward, the agreements that have       been made, have put us in a good place.        Senator Merkley, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate and       to get us to a point where we can legislate to improve the lives of       millions of women across the Nation.        So I would urge those who continue to oppose this measure to       reconsider that, and I would yield at this moment to the Senator from       Washington.
