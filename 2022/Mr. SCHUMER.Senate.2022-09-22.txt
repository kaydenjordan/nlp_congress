 When five conservative Justices handed down their  opinion in Citizens United 12 years ago, the dissenters warned:         The Court's ruling threatens to undermine the integrity of       elected institutions across the Nation.    Sadly, they turned out to be right. By giving massive corporations  the same rights as individual citizens--multibillionaires being able to  have their voices shouted out, drowning out the views of citizens--and  by casting aside decades of campaign finance law and by paving the way  for powerful elites to anonymously pump endless cash into elections,  Citizens United has disfigured our democracy almost beyond recognition.   Today, the Senate will vote to begin curing our Nation of this cancer  when we take the first procedural vote on the DISCLOSE Act. Democrats  are ready to move forward. Republicans today must face the music:  either vote to bring transparency and fairness back to our elections-- as the vast majority of Americans want--or block this measure and cast  their lot with the forces of dark money.    So today is a very important day that would not be possible without  the work of my friend and colleague, the Senator from Rhode Island,  Senator Whitehouse. More than anyone in this Chamber, Senator  Whitehouse has labored relentlessly to shine a light on the link  between dark money and so many of the ills that plague our politics,  from the radicalization of our courts to the rise of climate deniers  and more.   I thank him for his work. Our entire caucus does. We stand with him,  strongly, fervently, in supporting this bill. The need for the DISCLOSE  Act is great. The past decade has been the most expensive in the  history of American elections. Billions have been raised and spent in  super PAC and dark money. Because of Citizens United, a person's  ability to affect the democratic process has largely become a function  of their net worth in gross violation--gross violation--of what the  Framers intended when they believed in one person, one vote.   The DISCLOSE Act will remedy these ills with a very simple notion  [[Page S4942]]  that sunlight is the greatest of disinfectants. It will require super  PACs and other dark money groups to support anyone contributing $10,000  or more during an election cycle.   The same goes for any group spending money in support or in  opposition to judicial nominees. In other words, it would apply  familiar forms of transparency that traditional campaigns and  candidates already face when accepting political contributions.   I urge my colleagues to vote yes--all of us should vote yes; every  single one of us should vote yes--because so many of the ills in our  democracy are rooted in the primacy of dark money. We must rid  ourselves of this foulness before it is too late, and our democracy  could well become beyond saving.   Over the past few days, the Republican leader has come to the floor  and repeated the same timeworn, misleading arguments he has used for  years when trying to discredit campaign finance reform. I mean, part of  his arguments just get to the point of absurdity. Without a shred of  irony, the Republican leader, for instance, has claimed that the  DISCLOSE Act is equivalent to threatening the privacy of individuals  who want to make political contributions.   I would ask the Republican leader: What about the privacy of tens of  millions of women across the country? Those rights are now gone because  radical Justices were put on the Court because of dark money in the  first place.   Does the Republican leader really think the supposed privacy of the  billionaire donor class trumps the rights of women who have suffered  the consequences of dark money spending?   He would also have us think that transparency requirements would add  a burden to average Americans who want nothing more than to simply  exercise their political opinions.   That is bunkum. Those with the power to cut $10,000 or million-dollar  checks can tilt the tide of an entire election with a single donation.  These are individuals with outsized influence that average Americans  simply don't have.   And when the Supreme Court extended the First Amendment to absurd  lengths in Citizens United, they went way beyond what the Founding  Fathers would have intended and what most Americans--the vast  overwhelming majority of Americans--believe.   At a bare minimum, the public has a right to know--simply to know-- who is behind these massive donations because at the end of the day, it  is their rights that are on the line.   And all of these arguments are really just done to obscure the issue.  I mean, it is hard to believe. It is hard to believe that people will  be--multibillionaires will be intimidated if they have to disclose  their attempts to influence elections. It is just incredible that  someone could argue that.   But all these arguments are made for one purpose by the Republican  leader and others, in my judgment, and that is to obscure what is  really at issue: The Republican Party for years has been built on a  foundation of dark money.   It is how they have hijacked our courts. It is how they have promoted  groups that push for voter suppression. It is how they have killed  climate policies for years before Democrats finally pushed through our  climate investments earlier this year.   In a healthy democracy, American voters alone should have the power  to determine the Nation's leaders without fear that their voices will  be drowned out by powerful elites or special interests. Whether you are  rich or poor, young or old, well connected or otherwise, it shouldn't  matter. We should all be equal in our exercise of the franchise. That  doesn't happen now. We all know that. The American people know it. Over  80 percent despise dark money.   The DISCLOSE Act will help us restore that norm back into our  politics by instilling transparency that we desperately need. Americans  are tired of the corrosive power of dark money in our politics. They  know something has been deeply amiss for a long time and that we need  reforms to bring democracy back into balance.   So I urge my colleagues to support this measure. I urge my Republican  colleagues to work with us to break the stranglehold that dark money  has in our elections. This bill would be a very important and much  needed start.   Democracy can't prosper without transparency. I strongly support  passing this legislation so we can safeguard our electoral process and  keep the dream of our Founders alive in this century.                                  GOP Agenda    Madam President, now on another issue, tomorrow, a cohort of House  Republicans will travel to western Pennsylvania to roll out what they  claim is their GOP agenda.   I want to skip right to the punch line. The GOP has made its agenda  perfectly clear for months: a nationwide ban on abortion, Medicare and  Social Security on the chopping block, raising taxes on working  families.   While Democrats continue to fight to defend a woman's right to  choose, a central feature of the Republican agenda is eliminating  abortions once and for all. Many of them will deny it, but, not 2 weeks  ago, the Senator from South Carolina introduced a nationwide abortion  ban here in the Senate. And the American people should not forget that  nearly every Senate Republican is on record as sponsoring and voting  for nationwide abortion bans.   So if Americans want to know what the GOP agenda is, look no further.   Also, while Democrats passed legislation to lower prescription drug  costs and extend affordable healthcare, every single Republican voted  against legislation that would lower insulin costs for seniors on  Medicare and have openly called for putting Medicare and Social  Security on the chopping block.   They seem to think tax cuts for the rich is good policy, but argue  that Medicare and Social Security should no longer be guaranteed.   And let's not forget, when they had the House, the Senate, and the  Presidency, their major, major accomplishment was cutting taxes on the  rich--cutting taxes on the rich. Is that what the American people want?  Well, if you do, elect these Republicans.   Finally, while Democrats want to keep taxes down for the middle class  and working families and we want to help Americans save on their  electric bills and healthcare, the Senator from Florida, who chairs the  Republican Senate campaign arm, has already released a GOP agenda that  calls for raising taxes on working people.   It is amazing that the election is around the corner, and Republicans  are still struggling to show a united front that appeals to the  American people. Their fundamental problem is that the GOP is now the  party of MAGA extremism, and there aren't enough press conferences in  the world to change that fact.                          Treaty Document No. 117-1    Madam President, finally, on Kigali, yesterday was truly a high point  for the U.S. Senate. After years of bipartisan work, the Chamber  ratified one of the most significant pro-climate, pro-job measures that  has ever come to the floor, the Kigali Amendment.   I thank the Senators from Delaware and New Jersey and Senators from  so many other States who worked so hard to make this happen.   Ratifying the Kigali Amendment, along with passing the Inflation  Reduction Act, is the strongest one-two punch against climate change  any Congress has ever taken. Thanks to our commitment to phase out  HFCs, we will put ourselves in a position to lower global temperatures  by half a degree Celsius by the end of the decade. So many people have  overlooked this, but it is truly a significant milestone. Half a degree  will have an enormous--an enormous--impact on the global scale.   And the Kigali Amendment will also help American businesses secure an  edge against China in the emerging industry of next-generation  refrigerants. This market will see most of its growth outside the  United States, and Kigali will make sure that U.S. businesses will be  able to take advantage of new opportunities that will yield billions in  investments and, best of all, will create tens of thousands of good- paying jobs along the way.   So, once again, ratifying Kigali is a win-win-win--a win for U.S.  jobs, a win for U.S. investment, and a win for U.S. leadership to  protect the planet.   I thank my colleagues for their excellent work in pushing Kigali  finally over the finish line.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak prior to  the vote.    Mr. President, let me just give as many kudo--because he  taught me the word was ``kudo,'' not ``kudos''--as I can, to our  wonderful Senator from Rhode Island.   There is no one--I don't think in America, let alone just in the  Senate--who has done more to highlight the evil scourge of dark money  that just plagues our Republic. It degrades our democracy. One of the  reasons that people are so upset with what is going on in this country  is because of the dark money. And no one has shined that spotlight on  it like Senator Whitehouse. Hats off to him.   Now, the choice before the Senate is simple: Will Members vote today  to cure our democracy of the cancer of dark money or will they stand in  the way and let this disease metastasize beyond control?   Members must pick a side. Which side are you on--the side of American  voters and one person, one vote or the side of super PACs and the  billionaire donor class rigging the game in their favor?   Sometimes the contrast is really that simple. Today is about standing  either with the American people or the dark money donor class.   And the DISCLOSE Act itself is simple to its core. It says that a  healthy democracy is a transparent democracy--a healthy democracy is a  transparent democracy--one where all of us can exercise our right to  the franchise on an equal playing field, without regard to our wealth  or our connections or lot in life. It is a quintessentially American  ideal.   In the 12 years since the conservatives on the Supreme Court ruled in  Citizens United, our elections have become rank with the stench of dark  money. You can smell it in every corner of this country--and  particularly in Washington. We must fix that. In free and fair  elections--one person, one vote--American voters should have the power  to determine our Nation's leaders without fear that their voices will  be drowned out by powerful elites or special interests. That is simply  what the DISCLOSE Act would do.   For the sake of our democracy, for the sake of transparency in  elections, for the sake of breaking the wretched stranglehold that dark  money has on our country, I urge my colleagues, plead with my  colleagues, to rise to this occasion to protect our democracy and vote  yes.   I yield the floor.                                Cloture Motion     Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    I move to proceed to Calendar No. 389, H.R. 6833.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  for the cloture motion filed today, Thursday, September 22, be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, before I yield, I want to join the Senate  in offering condolences to the family of Officer William Thomas of the  U.S. Capitol Police. Officer Thomas had been battling cancer and died  in his home on Tuesday, September 20. It breaks my heart. He was only  38 years old.   My thoughts go out to his entire extended family, especially because  I understand, this week, Officer Thomas's father also passed away. May  they find some comfort in knowing Officer Thomas devoted himself to  serving others for nearly 14 years. He was a member of the Capitol  Police Force, a beloved presence here in the Capitol Complex. Staff and  Members alike saw him every day. He dedicated his life to protecting  this great institution, and all of us in the Senate mourn his loss  today.   May he rest in peace. May his father rest in peace as well.   To all members of the U.S. Capitol Police Force struggling with this  awful loss, we are with you in this difficult time.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I have six requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of  the Majority and Minority Leaders.
