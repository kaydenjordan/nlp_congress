 Mr. President, the opioid epidemic continues to claim  the lives of far too many people, with record numbers of both Mainers  and Americans lost in 2021. While many perceive the face of opioid  addiction as young, the epidemic harms older adults as well. In Maine,  more than 10 percent of drug overdose deaths last year were among  residents 60 and older.   Each and every opioid death is preventable, but we must ensure the  unique needs of seniors struggling with addiction are not forgotten.  That is why I rise today with my colleague from Maryland, Senator  Cardin, to introduce legislation to improve seniors' awareness of, and  access to, opioid use disorder, OUD, treatment covered by the Medicare  Program. Our bill, the Supporting Seniors with Opioid Use Disorder Act  of 2022, is in response to recent findings from the inspector general  that confirm the urgent need to increase the number of Medicare  beneficiaries receiving treatment for opioid use disorder.   The challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, combined with the increased  prevalence of fentanyl, have aggravated this national crisis. Even  before COVID-19, however, the number of people age 55 or older treated  in emergency rooms for nonfatal opioid overdoses was increasing, with a  shocking 32 percent jump in E.R. visits from 2016 to 2017. In 2018, as  chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I chaired a hearing  on this very topic in attempt to shed light on this often-overlooked  population. One expert witness told the Aging Committee, ``Medicare  beneficiaries are the fastest growing population of diagnosed opioid  use disorders.''   Compounding these disturbing statistics is a December 2021 Department  of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, OIG, report  exploring whether Medicare beneficiaries with opioid use disorder  receive medication and behavioral therapy. It found more than 1 million  Medicare beneficiaries were diagnosed with OUD in 2020, yet fewer than  16 percent of those patients received medication to treat their OUD.  The report also concluded older beneficiaries were three times less  likely to receive medication to treat their OUD than younger  beneficiaries. Even fewer beneficiaries received both medication and  behavioral therapy. The conclusion is clear: Medicare beneficiaries are  not receiving the OUD treatment they need.   Our bill, the Supporting Seniors with Opioid Use Disorder Act of  2022, would codify the recommendations made by the HHS OIG regarding  how to improve beneficiaries' awareness of Medicare coverage for OUD  treatment and how to identify current gaps and opportunities to better  meet the needs of this unique population. Specifically, our legislation  would require CMS to conduct additional outreach to beneficiaries to  increase awareness about Medicare coverage for the treatment of OUD,  such as by revising outreach and enrollment materials, making State and  national contact information for healthcare providers publicly  available in an easily accessible manner, and developing or improving  continuing education programs on opioid medications  [[Page S3697]]  and substance use disorder treatment programs. Our bill would also  improve data sharing within Agencies at HHS with the goal of obtaining  a better understanding of current treatment gaps.   Lastly, the bill would require HHS to convene a stakeholder meeting  to share best practices on the use of behavioral therapy among  beneficiaries receiving medication to treat opioid use disorder.  Emerging research points to evidence that patients receiving medication  to treat opioid use disorder may also benefit from behavioral therapy,  so this opportunity for collaboration on strategies to support better  treatment engagement and continuity could be beneficial to both  patients and healthcare professionals.   The overdose crisis continues to ravage the country, and it is  critical that people who are suffering from opioid use disorder have  access to the treatment they need to survive and thrive--including our  seniors. Challenges in treatment and recovery undoubtedly persist, but  the actions taken in this legislation can help guide our continued  response. I urge my colleagues to support the adoption of this  important legislation that will support seniors' access to opioid use  disorder services and our understanding of potential disparities in  treatment.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Ms. Duckworth):   S. 4624. A bill to amend the Project Safe Neighborhoods Grant Program  Authorization Act of 2018 to support multijurisdictional task forces  that investigate and disrupt illegal firearm trafficking and straw  purchasing, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.
