 Madam Speaker, as we stand here, a 5-year-old  woke up in a cage. She committed no crime. She came here seeking hope  and refuge.   Instead, Madam Speaker, she was taken from her parents, from her  bothers and sisters, from all she knows and loves. She does not know  where she is; she does not know where her family is; she does not speak  the language of her captives; and she may never see her family again.   This morning, Madam Speaker, that innocent little child is crying in  a cage, and we stand here doing nothing as innocent little babies sit  in modern-day camps.   That is not right; it is not fair; and it is not just. And, Madam  Speaker, history will not be kind to us if we continue to pass this  unbelievable injustice on to our children.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Al Green).    Madam Speaker, our Nation is mourning. Our  Nation is crying out to save our little children, save our babies.   History will not be kind to us as a nation and as a people if we  continue to go down this road. We must stop the madness, and stop it  now.   There was a man by the name of A. Philip Randolph, who was the dean  of Black leadership during the sixties when we were planning the March  on Washington. He kept saying: ``Maybe our foremothers and our  forefathers all came to this great land in different ships, but we're  all in the same boat now.''   Our little children, our babies, our young people, are crying out for  help. We need help from Members of Congress. We can do better.                            ____________________
