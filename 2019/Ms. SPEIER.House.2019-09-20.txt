 Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from Rhode Island for  that generous introduction.   Madam Chair, I can't believe that we are having this discussion today  because it is like there is a parallel universe.   I am going to talk about the 70,000 women of Sterling Jewelers. This  is Kay Jewelers, and this is Jared Jewelers. They have been subjected  to rampant sexism. And when they complained about it they were denied  justice by mandatory arbitration. Sterling's forced arbitration clause  has prevented them from seeking justice. It is more like, first you are  groped, then you are gagged. That is what forced arbitration is all  about.   Diana Acampora was pulled onto the lap of a manager who held her  tightly as he fondled her.   Tammy Zenner was nicknamed ``Texas Tammy'' by colleagues because of  the size of her breasts and told she should be flattered by an  executive rubbing himself on her.   Dawn Souto-Coons was passed over for promotions in favor of lewd and  less qualified men.   Diana, Tammy, Dawn, and countless others deserve justice.    Instead, Sterling has made a mockery of our laws and has  used forced arbitration to make 70,000 women in this country subject to  a 14-year process. That is not justice. That is enslavement.
