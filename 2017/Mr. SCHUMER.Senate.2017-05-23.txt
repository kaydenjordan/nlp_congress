 Mr. President, first, the Senate's thoughts and prayers  go out to everyone in Manchester, England. Such violence is  particularly heartbreaking when it happens, as it did in Manchester, at  a concert with so many young people there to enjoy.   We mourn the families of the victims of last night's terrorist  attack. We hope the perpetrators are quickly found and brought to  justice. I saw on TV a mother waiting, trying to email and text her  daughter. She got no answer. She was wondering where her daughter was.  It brought back the horrible memories for me after 9/11, the day after,  when I went up there and saw hundreds of people holding up signs:  ``Have you seen my wife Evelyn?'' ``Have you seen my son John,'' not  knowing if they were alive or dead. Most of them ended up being dead.   We hope and pray that mother, and all the other mothers, fathers,  brothers, and sisters who are waiting for news that maybe their child,  their relative, is alive, will find them alive. Our prayers go out to  them.
