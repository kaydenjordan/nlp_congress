 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to  6 minutes on my amendment.    Mr. President, I call up my amendment, No. 1177, and ask  that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, thousands of calls to the VA from veterans  seeking mental health care went unanswered over the past year, and that  was just at the Atlanta VA.   One veteran in the midst of a mental health crisis called 10 times  over a 3-month period and could not get the care she needed, much less  anyone to answer her calls, so she ended up in an emergency room. Other  veterans who made VA appointments say their therapists didn't even show  up.   Meanwhile, a manager at the Atlanta VA responsible for overseeing the  scheduling of veterans' appointments actually called in to a meeting  from a bubble bath and posted this selfie on social media with the  caption:         My office for the next hour.    Another VA staffer lamented:         It's almost as if this employee is making a mockery of all       the veterans. I can sit here in my tub and relax, and you       just have to wait.    And that is exactly what is happening.   While this bill provides nearly $320 billion for the VA, what good is  it to give the Agency all of this money if the VA isn't even answering  the phone or showing up for appointments with our veterans?   This isn't just a problem at the VA either. Desperate travelers are  waiting hours on the phone or in line, hoping to speak with someone at  the State Department about passport delays that are causing vacation  cancelations, and seniors calling the Social Security Administration  are increasingly having their calls go unanswered altogether as the  Agency shifts toward remote work.   Frustrated Americans are sick and tired of being put on hold while  many Federal employees are phoning it in, ``working'' from home.   In his 2022 State of the Union Address, President Biden pledged that  ``the vast majority of Federal workers will once again work in  person.'' A year and a half later, government employee unions are still  fighting off efforts to bring their bureaucrats back.   Only one out of every three bureaucrats is fully back in the office,  according to a recent Office of Personnel Management survey. Some said  they never report to a physical office.   Seventy-five percent or more of the office space at the headquarters  of most Federal Agencies is not even being used. Taxpayers are picking  up the cost of maintaining these mostly empty buildings.   If Federal employees can't be found at their desks, exactly where are  they? The work locations of over 281,000 employees were redacted by the  Biden administration to a Freedom of Information request filed by the  nonprofit group Open The Books.   Well, folks, time is up for Biden's game of bureaucrat hide-and-seek.  I am offering an amendment making the Biden administration account for  the location of every bureaucrat who works for the VA and every other  Department funded by this bill. My amendment also requires taxpayers to  be told the financial and environmental costs of maintaining empty  offices and the impact remote work is having on veterans' care and the  response times of other government services.   To all of my Senate colleagues, don't claim that you are taking care  of veterans just because there is a spending increase for the VA in  this bill. We need to work together to ensure that the VA is actually  showing up and caring for our veterans.   My amendment will provide some much needed accountability to monitor  if that is happening. Our veterans answered the call of duty. Now it is  time for Federal employees to do the same.    Mr. President, I know of no further debate on my  amendment.
