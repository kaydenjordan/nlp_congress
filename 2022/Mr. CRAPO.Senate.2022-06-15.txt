 Mr. President, along with my colleagues Senator Jim  Risch, Representative Mike Simpson and Representative Russ Fulcher, we  congratulate Pat Kole on his well-earned retirement from serving as  vice president, legal and government affairs of the Idaho Potato  Commission.   Pat has been a steady hand at the helm of the Idaho Potato  Commission, IPC, promoting the iconic Idaho potatoes for more than 25  years. Serving as the IPC's vice president, legal and government  affairs, Pat has managed Federal, State, and local government affairs  for the IPC, directed its trademark-licensing program, directed its  research and education program, and supervised its IT needs. His work  has included litigating certification mark cases, registering  certification marks in many jurisdictions, testifying before the U.S.  Congress and advocating for public policy supporting Idaho potato  producers' ability to grow this central agricultural product and feed  consumers at home and around the world. To say Pat has gone the extra  mile to support Idaho potato production is an understatement,  considering in 2005 he ran the Marine Corps Marathon as a  representative of the IPC and to help promote the importance of complex  carbohydrates, such as those found in Idaho potatoes.   Pat, who earned his undergraduate degree at the University of  Michigan and law degree from the University of Denver, has practiced  law for more than 40 years. His experience, calm, persistence, and  ability to dig into the crux of the problem have been instrumental in  facing the challenges that have undoubtedly arisen over the years. This  includes his thoughtful advocacy for measured approaches to help with  the eradication of the pale cyst nematode, assist producers, and regain  markets. More recently, Pat provided critical assistance and advocacy  for the needs of Idaho's potato producers as relief efforts were  considered for the historic agricultural disruptions caused by the  COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout, Pat's efforts and those of the Idaho  potato producers he works with and supports have helped fortify the  Idaho potato as a standout symbol of Idaho and U.S. agriculture. It is  no surprise Pat has received recognitions for his attentive work. This  includes Pat being named The Packer's 2022 Potato Person for All  Seasons.   Pat is known as someone who always does his homework and who  carefully thinks through the details. That has made him and  instrumental partner to us as we work on Federal policy affecting the  potato industry. We always know that when Pat raises an issue, he does  so with scrupulous grounding, and we know we get a straight and  accurate response when we reach out to him for guidance. When policy  questions arise that we know will affect the potato industry, Pat is  the first we call.   Thank you, Pat, for being such a trusted advocate for the Idaho  potato industry all these years and your decades of service to the Gem  State. Congratulations, again, on your retirement.                            ____________________
