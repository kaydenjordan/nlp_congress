 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I first thank Chair Rogers, Ranking Member Pallone, Representative  Bilirakis, and, of course, Representative Pence, who sponsored this  bill together with me, for their leadership and hard work on this  bipartisan bill. I am a proud sponsor.   The Animal Drug User Fee Agreement is important for the safety of  both animal and human health. This bill will accelerate the development  of new medications for animals with a predictable and streamlined  review process.   It will hold the FDA accountable for performance goals that will  improve wait times for inspections and provide regulatory certainty for  innovators and pet and animal owners alike.   It will ensure that our Nation's food supply is safe by making sure  the medicines that are administered to food-producing animals are safe.                                time  1645    I want to underscore that this bill is a win for everyone, but it is  especially good for farmers.   In my district, farmers, ranchers, and dairymen rely on these FDA- approved medications to keep their livestock healthy. For them, keeping  animals healthy is not just about their affection and responsibility  for these animals. It is critical for food production, food safety, and  their very economic survival.   Having timely access to affordable, effective medications is a key  part of our domestic food chain, and that is really the heart of our  rural economies.   I am happy to go to bat for our rural areas and our agricultural  communities with this legislation. I encourage my colleagues to vote  ``yes'' on this important bill, Mr. Speaker, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   I thank Mr. Bilirakis and Members on the other side of the aisle for  working together on this bipartisan bill. I encourage my colleagues to  vote ``yes'' on this bill to make sure we can speed novel medications  to animals in this country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 813, the Global  Investment in American Jobs Act. As this legislation's name would  suggest, we should work to encourage foreign direct investment that  supports high-quality jobs here in the United States. Foreign direct  support and investment from  [[Page H3626]]  nonadversarial nations can be used to grow critical sectors important  for our economic success and national security, including by creating  new jobs in our Nation's manufacturing sector.   Once the envy of the world, our manufacturing base has faced steady  headwinds for the past several decades. Our Nation's share of global  manufacturing activity declined from 28 percent in 2002 to just over 17  percent in 2020. Investment in America's small and medium  manufacturers, the bedrock of our industrial might, has also declined  over the past 20 years by more than $200 billion. In that same two- decade period, our domestic manufacturing base has shed more than 4  million jobs.   It is time to reverse these trends by revitalizing our Nation's  manufacturing industry and bringing jobs back home. The work we did  last Congress passing the bipartisan infrastructure law, the Inflation  Reduction Act, and the CHIPS and Science Act is already helping to turn  the tide. The United States added nearly 700,000 manufacturing jobs  during President Biden's first 20 months in office. Total construction  spending on manufacturing in the United States has skyrocketed to  nearly $200 billion per month, more than doubling prepandemic levels.   Foreign direct investment can be another part of the solution to  revitalize American manufacturing and job creation. Over a third of all  foreign direct investments are in domestic manufacturing, exceeding a  total of $120 billion a year. This bill would ensure we keep that flow  of investments strong and that such investments support quality, good- paying jobs right here at home.   I commend Representatives Pence and Eshoo for their leadership on  this issue, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   I would summarize by saying that this is an excellent bill. There are  so many ways to build up our manufacturing sector and to invest in our  workforce. Many of those we have already done through the  infrastructure law, the Inflation Reduction Act, and the CHIPS and  Science Act. This is another way to shore up jobs and manufacturing  here at home by encouraging foreign investments from friendly nations.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
