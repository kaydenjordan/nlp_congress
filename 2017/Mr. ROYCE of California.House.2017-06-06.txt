 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  agree to the resolution (H. Res. 354) condemning the violence against  peaceful protesters outside the Turkish Ambassador's residence on May  16, 2017, and calling for the perpetrators to be brought to justice and  measures to be taken to prevent similar incidents in the future, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 354         Whereas, on May 16, 2017, President Donald J. Trump hosted       President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, a longstanding NATO       ally, for an official meeting at the White House to discuss       counterterrorism cooperation and bilateral issues;        Whereas, on the evening of May 16, 2017, over two dozen       protesters gathered outside of the Turkish Ambassador's       residence in Washington, DC, to demonstrate opposition to       Turkish government policies;        Whereas after hours of peaceful protest, violence erupted       when pro-Erdogan supporters and individuals from the Turkish       Embassy grounds pushed past District of Columbia police       officers to brutally attack the demonstrators;        Whereas those Turkish officials blatantly suppressed the       First Amendment rights of United States citizens, and       multiple armed Turkish security officials beat, kicked, and       choked unarmed demonstrators;        Whereas multiple video recordings of the violence and       reports by the Metropolitan Police Department of the District       of Columbia and the Department of State confirm that the       demonstrators did not instigate the violence;        Whereas at least 11 individuals were seriously injured in       the ensuing brawl, with two individuals requiring immediate       hospitalization;        Whereas separately, two armed Turkish security officers       attached to a security detail were detained for physically       assaulting Federal agents;        Whereas those two Turkish security officers were later       released and subsequently allowed to leave the United States       because they held Derived Head of State immunity;        Whereas the Department of State did not request that Turkey       waive the immunity for these two security officers in order       to fully investigate the assault prior to their being       released from custody;        Whereas a joint criminal investigation into the incident is       ongoing with the combined efforts of the Washington       Metropolitan Police Department, the United States Secret       Service, and the Department of State Diplomatic Security       Service;        Whereas at no point was President Erdogan in danger;        Whereas immunity for diplomatic personnel and certain other       foreign officials is a core principle, as is the right to       protest peacefully and freely in the United States;        Whereas this is the third instance of violence perpetrated       by members of Turkish President Erdogan's security detail in       United States territory;        Whereas in 2011, a brawl erupted in the halls of the United       Nations General Assembly between members of Turkish President       Erdogan's security detail and United Nations security       officers, resulting in one United Nations security officer       being hospitalized due to serious injuries;        Whereas in 2016, members of Turkish President Erdogan's       security detail engaged in unwarranted violence against       journalists reporting on an event at the Brookings       Institution;        Whereas Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on May 21,       2017, that the violence outside the Turkish Embassy was       ``outrageous'' and ``simply unacceptable''; and        Whereas the right to assembly, peaceful protest, and       freedom of speech are essential and protected rights in the       United States: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of       Representatives that--        (1) the rights to peacefully assemble and freely express       one's views are essential to the fabric of American       democracy;        (2) the Turkish security forces acted in an unprofessional       and brutal manner, reflecting poorly on President Erdogan and       the Government of Turkey;        (3) any Turkish security officials who directed, oversaw,       or participated in efforts by Turkish security forces to       illegally suppress peaceful protests on May 16, 2017, should       be  [[Page H4629]]       charged and prosecuted under United States law;        (4) the United States Secret Service and the Diplomatic       Security Service of the Department of State should review       this incident and confirm with the Turkish National Police       the standards expected by visiting security details to       prevent future violent incidents;        (5) the Department of State should immediately request the       waiver of immunity of any Turkish security detail official       engaged in assault in the United States prior to release of       that individual from custody;        (6) the Department of State should conduct a review of its       own security procedures to determine how to mitigate the       likelihood of such an event in the future;        (7) the United States respect for free speech requires       officials of the United States to speak out against such       incidents; and        (8) the United States should take steps to strengthen       freedoms for the press and civil society in countries such as       Turkey, and combat efforts by foreign leaders to suppress       free and peaceful protest in their own countries.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include any extraneous material in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by thanking the gentlewoman from  the District of Columbia, and also the gentleman from New York, the  ranking member of this committee, Mr. Engel, for working with us on  this clear condemnation of the violence against peaceful protesters  outside the Turkish Ambassador's residence in Washington, D.C., on May  16.   That day, President Erdogan of Turkey, a longstanding NATO ally, met  at the White House to discuss counterterrorism cooperation and to  discuss bilateral issues. This was an important meeting. But that  evening, armed members of the Turkish President's security detail  brutally attacked demonstrators who had gathered outside the Turkish  Ambassador's residence on Sheridan Circle in Washington, D.C. They were  there to protest various policies of the Turkish Government.   In an unprovoked attack, armed Turkish personnel broke through D.C.  Metropolitan Police lines and attacked the protesters. They choked,  beat, and kicked the demonstrators until D.C. Metropolitan Police  officers, and State Department Diplomatic Security were able to stop  the melee and restore order.   One woman was beaten unconscious. She testified before the Foreign  Affairs Committee that she sustained brain damage as a result. A  protester near her was beaten to the ground and repeatedly kicked in  the face. His front teeth were smashed.   Mr. Speaker, what was the reason these and other American citizens  were harshly beaten?   They chose to exercise their constitutional right to free speech and  assembly. They chose to criticize actions of President Erdogan's  government. The protesters got under the Turkish delegation's skin.   Let us be clear: at no time was President Erdogan in danger. This was  not an act of protection. It was an act of suppression on our American  soil.   The actions of the Turkish security detail were unprofessional and  dangerous. You had armed security personnel creating a melee. The  actions were unjustified and, up to this point, have gone largely  unchallenged.   H. Res. 354 puts Congress firmly on record in clear, unmistakable  terms condemning the actions of the Turkish security guards last month.  The resolution also demands that Turkey immediately lift diplomatic  immunity for all those who assaulted U.S. citizens and law enforcement  officers.   This resolution also calls for the U.S. State Department and the U.S.  Secret Service to review their security procedures and for them to  convey to Turkish officials in clear terms the expectations for the  behavior of their security teams when they are operating in the U.S.   Mr. Speaker, one of the most disturbing aspects of last month's  attack is that this assault by Turkish security officials was not an  isolated incident. Rather, it was the third instance of violence they  have engaged in while operating in the United States in recent years.   Passage of this resolution is an appropriate, strong response by this  House to those brutal actions by Turkish forces.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   The violent attacks, Mr. Speaker, by officers assigned to Turkish  President Erdogan's security detail against peaceful protesters back on  May 16 were designed to do one thing. They were designed to silence  those protesters' criticism of the Turkish Government. That is why it  is so important that we speak out.   We must speak loudly and clearly that we will protect our citizens  and their fundamental rights to free speech and to assembly. Turkey is  an important and longstanding NATO ally, but the Turkish Government can  and should do better than this, and it can start by addressing the  concerns of the House of Representatives and many Americans who were  very angered by the video capturing this disgraceful attack on these  citizens.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this  resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 390) to provide for emergency relief to victims of  genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes in Iraq and Syria, to  provide accountability for perpetrators of these crimes, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 390         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Iraq and Syria Genocide       Emergency Relief and Accountability Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Religious and ethnic minorities in Iraq and Syria are       persecuted groups, and the Secretary of State of State       declared on March 17, 2016, that Daesh, also known as the       Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), was responsible for       genocide, crimes against humanity, and other atrocity crimes       against several of these groups, including Christians and       Yezidis.        (2) According to the Department of State's annual reports       on international religious freedom, the number of Christians       living in Iraq has dropped from an estimated 800,000 to       1,400,000 in 2002 to fewer than 250,000 in 2015, and the       number of Yezidis living in Iraq has dropped from 500,000 in       2013 to 350,000 to 400,000 in 2015.        (3) The annual reports on international religious freedom       further suggest that Christian communities living in Syria,       which had accounted for between eight and ten percent of       Syria's total population in 2010, are now ``considerably''       smaller as a result of the civil war, and that the population       of approximately 80,000 Yezidis in 2010 may now be larger       because of refugees from Iraq.        (4) Local communities and entities have sought to mitigate       the impact of violence directed against religious and ethnic       minorities in Iraq and Syria, including the Chaldean Catholic       Archdiocese of Erbil (Kurdistan Region of Iraq), which has       used private funds to provide assistance to internally       displaced Christians, Yezidis, and Muslims throughout the       greater Erbil region, while growing needs and diminishing       resources have made it increasingly difficult to continue       these efforts.

PROHIBITION ON ADDITIONAL FUNDING.         No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to       carry out this Act. This Act shall be carried out using       amounts otherwise authorized.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by recognizing the efforts of our  colleague, Mr. Smith. Mr. Smith of New Jersey is chairman of the  Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and  International Organizations. We appreciate his strong leadership on  this critical issue. And, as always, I also appreciate Ranking Member  Engel for his support.   Mr. Speaker, more than 6 years ago, the world watched with dread as  Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad ordered action against what were  peaceful protestors coming down the main boulevard in Damascus. We  watched on CNN and international television. As they were saying it was  peaceful, we then saw the automatic weapons of the regime open up and  mow them down. What has followed has been year after year of mass  atrocities as Assad seeks to break the Syrian people.   Building on the vacuum created by Assad, ISIS burst onto the  international stage in 2014 by declaring themselves and their supposed  ``caliphate''--and committing obscene, horrific acts in an effort to  spread their nihilistic, death-filled ideology.   We also saw that they targeted anyone unlucky enough to cross their  path across Syria and Iraq. Yet, oddly enough, the regime in Syria did  not target ISIS. They were too busy carrying out their campaign against  the people of Syria--protesters, the Free Syrian Army, and others--who  were pushing back against the regime.   Here, alongside the nightmare that Assad created, came this new  nightmare of ISIS. These two evils, as I call them, ISIS and Assad,  exist side by side, perpetrating extreme violence on anyone who would  oppose their grip on power.   ISIS is committing genocidal violence against Yazidis and Christians  in Syria and Iraq, seeking to destroy their entire communities and to  erase their shared histories. Assad is committing massive crimes  against humanity, targeting men, women, and children from all sects,  all religions, and all groups, as documented by Caesar, a military  photographer who snuck out photos of what goes on in Assad's prisons,  documenting the torture and death of tens of thousands of citizens in  Syria.   More than a year after the Obama administration, under intense  congressional pressure, finally declared that ISIS' actions against the  religious communities of Iraq and Syria constituted ``genocide,'' there  is still an urgent need for assistance to these vulnerable communities.  These communities, which exist on the outskirts in Syria and on the  borders, have been devastated by ISIS' efforts to wipe them out.  [[Page H4634]]    These ancient communities, whose roots go back centuries, include  Christians, Yazidis, Assyrians, Syriacs, Turkomans, and many others.  Their presence in Iraq and Syria is crucial to the social fabric of  these nations.   While the U.S. has been generous in providing assistance to those  targeted, their needs are still urgent and extreme. Whole communities  have been displaced, enslaved, and slaughtered. Survivors need  assistance in feeding and clothing their families and in beginning to  address the extreme trauma caused by ISIS and Assad.   This bill offers additional immediate relief for these vulnerable  communities and also directs the State Department to do more to support  efforts to collect and preserve evidence of ``genocide, crimes against  humanity, and war crimes'' so that, someday, justice might be served.   I urge Members to support this bill so that the possibility of  justice and accountability for these atrocities can give hope to those  suffering today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                     Washington, DC, April 24, 2017.      Hon. Edward R. Royce,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Royce: I write with respect to H.R. 390, the       ``Iraq and Syria Genocide Emergency Relief and Accountability       Act.'' As a result of your having consulted with us on       provisions within H.R. 390 that fall within thc rule X       jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary, I forego any       further consideration of this bill so that it may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor for consideration.        The Judiciary Committee takes this action with our mutual       understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 390 at       this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject       matter contained in this or similar legislation and that our       committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as       this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may       address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our       committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate       conference involving this or similar legislation and asks       that you support any such request.        I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming       this understanding with respect to H.R. 390 and would ask       that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of H.R. 390.            Sincerely,                                                     Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                     Washington, DC, April 24, 2017.      Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Goodlatte: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of H.R. 390, the Iraq and Syria       Genocide Emergency Relief and Accountability Act of 2017, so       that the bill may proceed expeditiously to the House floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this resolution or similar legislation in the future. I       would support your effort to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees from your committee to any       House-Senate conference on this legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 390 into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the       resolution. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this       legislation and look forward to continuing to work together       as this measure moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                   Edward R. Royce,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), the author of this bill and also  the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global  Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an  additional 2 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Just in speaking about the conditions of the Christian community,  outside of Erbil, like Chairman Smith, I had the opportunity last year  to speak to Archbishop Warda and to many of those Christian families  that have survived, and to see many of the children that are struggling  there.   I did want to commend the Knights of Columbus, the archbishop, and  Catholic Charities for their sustained effort, which goes not only to  this Christian community, but also the neighboring Yazidi community.  These communities have no other means of support.   I think that as we reflect upon this, beyond the genocidal actions of  ISIS, we have also seen the depravity of the Assad regime, which has  engaged in a massive effort to destroy anyone, regardless of sect or  religion or ethnicity, if they suspect them of being unwilling to bow  to Syria's murderous dictator. None are safe.   I say ``suspect'' because so many of those who were tortured to death  to give up other names are simply caught up in a web of intelligence  services who go out and try to find those who they believe may not be  loyal. And they haul them in for torture. And under the knife, many of  these people will give up names of other families, whoever they can  remember, whoever they know who may or may not in any way be involved  in politics, but then find themselves in those same torture chambers.   The result of this kind of a society year after year breeds a sense  of absolute hopelessness, of blowback, of problems throughout Syria  from which, I must say, I suspect this long climb back is going to be a  very difficult one.   At the end of the day, though, it is still absolutely imperative that  those responsible for those hideous crimes be held accountable. A key  aspect of any lasting peace is going to be accountability, because a  renewal of trust and the prospect of justice is going to be based on  some measure on whether we are going to hold to account those who  committed those kinds of crimes, those who led to this kind of horror.  Whether it is Assad's regime or whether it is ISIS, there is so much  devastation left in the wake.   I urge Members to support this resolution so that the possibility of  peace can be sustained by the hope that justice will prevail. I again  thank Mr. Smith for authoring this measure. I also thank Ranking Member  Engel for his passionate leadership on the crisis in Syria for so many  years.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  agree to the resolution (H. Res. 355) condemning in the strongest terms  the terrorist attacks in Manchester, United Kingdom, on May 22, 2017,  expressing heartfelt condolences, and reaffirming unwavering support  for the special relationship between our peoples and nations in the  wake of these attacks, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 355         Whereas, on May 22, 2017, a terrorist triggered improvised       explosive devices at the Manchester Arena following the       conclusion of a concert by American recording artist Ariana       Grande;        Whereas the blasts took the lives of at least 22 people,       and seriously injured 59, many of whom were children;        Whereas British officials are continuing to investigate the       bombing to determine whether it was perpetrated by a lone       individual or by a terrorist network;        Whereas, on May 23, 2017, the Islamic State of Iraq and       Syria (ISIS) claimed responsibility for the attacks and       threatened further attacks;        Whereas on June 3, 2017, three terrorists drove a van into       pedestrians on London Bridge before committing multiple       stabbing attacks against innocent bystanders in the Borough       Market area of London;        Whereas British police quickly arrived at the scene and       successfully ended the terrorist attack;        Whereas at least seven people were killed, and more than 48       wounded in the terrorist attack;        Whereas British police continue to investigate the incident       to ensure that all involved in planning or supporting the       attack are brought to justice;        Whereas the horrific attacks at the Manchester Arena and in       London are the latest in a series of deadly assaults by ISIS       in Europe in recent years;        Whereas British first responders reacted swiftly and       heroically to both attacks, taking immediate measures to       secure the areas and care for the wounded in ways that       prevented further loss of life;        Whereas Prime Minister Theresa May stated on May 23, 2017,       that ``all acts of terrorism are cowardly attacks on innocent       people but this attack stands out for its appalling,       sickening cowardice, deliberately targeting innocent,       defenseless children and young people'' and paid tribute to       ``the spirit of Manchester and the spirit of Britain, a       spirit that through years of conflict and terrorism has never       been broken and will never be broken.'';        Whereas President Donald Trump condemned those who       perpetrated the attacks and offered any and all assistance to       the United Kingdom as it investigates these attacks and works       to bring the terrorists to justice; and        Whereas the United Kingdom has been a steadfast ally to the       United States: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) condemns the recent terrorist attacks in Manchester,       United Kingdom, on May 22, 2017, and in London, United       Kingdom, on June 3, 2017, and extends its deepest sympathies       to all those affected by these tragedies;        (2) reaffirms the American commitment to the special       relationship with the United Kingdom, and supports the       efforts of the British Government to bring all those involved       with these heinous attacks to justice;        (3) appreciates the significant efforts by the United       Kingdom to combat terrorism;        (4) recognizes the persistent and growing threat posed by       Islamist terrorist groups worldwide, and reaffirms the       commitment of  [[Page H4639]]       the United States to the multilateral, global fight against       such violent extremists; and        (5) remains committed to the defense of universal       democratic values.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize Congressman Gregory Meeks, the  ranking member of the Europe, Eurasia, and Emerging Threats  Subcommittee; and Congressman Paul Cook, the vice chairman of the House  Foreign Affairs Committee. I recognize them for their work on this  timely and important resolution.   On May 22, as the world knows, in a cowardly act of terrorism, a  suicide bomber attacked those exiting a concert at the Manchester Arena  in England. These were principally teenagers and children who were  attending that concert, in some cases, parents. What many had planned  to be a night of joy, a festival, a chance for them to gather to  celebrate turned with one horrifying blast into a nightmare of chaos  and devastation, and 23 innocent people were killed, 166 were severely  injured, and many of those victims were children.   This past week, in another cowardly attack, terrorists struck  unsuspecting and unarmed pedestrians on London Bridge, and then those  terrorists went on an attack against innocent bystanders in London's  Borough Market area, slashing and killing, and thus far, at least 7  victims have died and 48 have been seriously wounded. We grieve their  loss and send our prayers and condolences to their families.   We also commend the brave and selfless actions of British first  responders who, in the wake of both attacks, moved to quickly secure  the areas, aid the wounded, and prevent further loss of life.   Our deranged enemies, it is clear, are intent on striking us wherever  and whenever possible, often choosing to prey upon the most vulnerable,  the most innocent in our society, preying, in this case, on children  and teenagers. We must be even more determined in our resolve to stop  them and we must continue to build upon our own capabilities,  strengthening our cooperation with our friends and allies like the  United Kingdom.   Mr. Speaker, the United Kingdom has been a staunch friend and ally,  unparalleled in its support for the United States, including as a  partner in our counterterrorism efforts. At this sad time, we stand  solidly beside our friends and allies as they mourn, heal, and most  assuredly rise again following this tragedy. Passage of this resolution  is just one way that we can demonstrate this support.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in unanimously  supporting this measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Holding), chairman of the British- American Parliamentary Group and co-chairman of the Congressional  United Kingdom Caucus, and he also has strong family ties in Britain.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), chairman of the Foreign Affairs'  Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, following the killing in London this past weekend,  British Prime Minister May compared the attacks in Manchester and those  in the capital, and she said: `` . . . while the recent attacks are not  connected by common networks, they are connected in one important  sense. They are bound together by the single evil ideology of Islamist  extremism that preaches hatred, sows division, and promotes  sectarianism.''   ``Defeating this ideology is one of the great challenges of our time.  . . .''   Those were the Prime Minister's words.   We are committed to standing with our British friends and allies in  this important fight. This resolution signals our resolve to deepen our  collaboration with our friends and allies in the United Kingdom to  counter terrorism and to counter radicalization.   Mr. Speaker, I, therefore, urge my colleagues to join me in unanimous  support of this resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
