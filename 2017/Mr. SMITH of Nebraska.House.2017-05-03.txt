 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Gering High School, one of three national winners of the 2017 Samsung  Solve for Tomorrow contest. The team of 19 Gering students took top  honors out of thousands of entries and 10 national finalists.   It is exciting to see young innovators from western Nebraska,  especially my alma mater, recognized nationally for their ideas on how  to advance agriculture. The students designed a drone-powered system to  reduce herbicide quantity by allowing farmers to directly target  specific areas rather than spraying entire fields. I applaud each of  them for their hard work and the dedication they put into their winning  project.   Congratulations go to Curtis Anderson, Jonathan Blanco, Dakota Boles,  Blake Brunner, Gabriele Castro, Cody Catron, Eric Crane, Jeremy  Forella, Michael Haworth, Xavier Horst, Elexus Johnson, Kaiden  Reinmuth, Trevor Satur, Tyler Smith, Joel Torres, Carson Wallace,  Skylier Ward, Payton Welfl, Joshua Wilson, and their teacher, Mr.  Justin Reinmuth.                            ____________________
