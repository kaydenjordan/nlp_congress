 Mr. Chairman, I thank Ms. Plaskett  for yielding to me.   H.R. 1009 would empower Trump's White House to block all of the  independent financial agencies' proposed actions to protect our  economy. And, worse, the bill empowers President Trump's advisers to  influence monetary policy, including interest rates that affect  America's mortgages, credit cards and IRAs.   Independent agencies, like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,  would have to first receive the okay from Trump's administration,  packed with Wall Street insiders, before they could protect the  American public. For example, the administration could block the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's recent proposal to stop payday  lender debt traps. These agencies would be directed to write rules  favorable to industry, subjecting individuals once again to predatory  practices.   I am so deeply troubled that H.R. 1009 gives the Trump administration  a say in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions. The  importance of Fed independence is well established and results in  objective, nonpolitical policymaking, and a high degree of credibility  with financial markets.   However, today's bill threatens the integrity of these decisions.  Given that the Fed's actions can move stock markets by hundreds of  points, we should absolutely reject the Trump White House and  Republicans' desire to use the Fed for partisan gain.   An administration that believes bad polls are ``fake news,'' goes to  great lengths to inflate the number of attendees at the inauguration,  and misrepresents the Nation's debt level should not be allowed to  meddle with the interest rate decisions or marketplace guardrails  critical to our economy's health.   I urge Members to oppose this bill.
