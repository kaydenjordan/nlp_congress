 Madam Speaker, this week many people will be celebrating  National AmeriCorps Week. I will not be one of them. AmeriCorps has  been around for almost 30 years, and in that time we have learned never  to underestimate the ability of the Federal Government to muck things  up.   No one denies that AmeriCorps began with good intentions, and I  applaud the philanthropic spirit of those who volunteer out of a  genuine desire to help those in need. However, I cannot applaud a  bloated bureaucratic organization that is the poster child for fraud  and mismanagement.   AmeriCorps is entrusted with 1.1 billion taxpayer dollars every  single year. And every single year AmeriCorps proves it is an expert at  wasting taxpayer funds.   For example, some AmeriCorps programs cost taxpayers four to eight  times more money than programs that perform identical services. Even  more concerning is the fact that neither Congress, the Inspector  General, nor AmeriCorps itself have an idea of how taxpayer dollars are  being managed. In fact, AmeriCorps' financial statements are so bad  that they have not been able to be audited for the past 5 years.    According to AmeriCorps' Inspector General, if this occurred at a  private organization there would be a ``wholesale resignation or firing  of the leadership team, and the public would be shorting their stock.''   Even more concerning is the lack of oversight AmeriCorps provides  over its grantees that are plagued with fraudulent activity. For  example, a Hawaiian nonprofit executive was recently sentenced to 46  months in prison for embezzling over $500,000 from AmeriCorps, and a  school district in St. Louis was found guilty of encouraging AmeriCorps  volunteers to falsely inflate time sheets.   The private sector often does the same work as AmeriCorps but at a  fraction of the price and with far less waste, fraud, and  mismanagement.   It is our job as Members of the House of Representatives to ensure  that taxpayer funds are protected. The power of the purse is one of our  most important constitutional duties. We therefore must stop feeding  the black hole that is AmeriCorps and instead empower States and local  governments to meet the needs of their residents.   The last time AmeriCorps' programs were reauthorized was in 2009 with  the passage of the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act which was named  in honor of the late Senator who was the author of the legislation that  governs many of AmeriCorps' programs.   Yet, despite the support for national service, Senator Kennedy  himself emphasized the importance of proper stewardship of taxpayer  dollars, noting during a 1993 floor speech on the establishment of the  corporation that ``Congress will not, and should not, fund a program if  it is unsuccessful.''   I agree with him. AmeriCorps has had 29 years to prove itself, and  the only thing it has proven is that it is a drain on taxpayers and a  massive disappointment. This is a failed agency that needs to be  overhauled completely or just eliminated.                            ____________________
