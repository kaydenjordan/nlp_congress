 Madam Chair, I thank my friend and colleague for  yielding.   Madam Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 1. This administration,  the Biden administration, has stonewalled American energy production,  quite literally, from day one.   The permit for the Keystone XL pipeline was revoked just hours after  Biden's inauguration, and permitting for new oil and gas leases were  halted soon thereafter.   The results were predictable. Americans endured historically high gas  prices, with Floridians paying, on average, $4.80 per gallon last  summer. Government restriction and regulation fanned the flames of  inflation already burdening Floridians and Americans at gas pumps and  grocery stores.                                time  1345    We, as Republicans, have a responsibility to uphold our Commitment to  America. H.R. 1 will be the cornerstone of fulfilling that commitment  to our friends and neighbors in Florida's Third District.   We will start by overhauling our permitting regulations. This  administration has effectively frozen all new oil and gas exploration  permits, severely handicapping our ability to fulfill the energy  demands of Americans.   We can choose to rely on energy imports from hostile nations and  fair-weather friends, or we can utilize the vast potential of our  energy sector to meet our needs more efficiently and cleanly.   Our energy requirements extend to nearly all of our most vital  industries, arguably none more important than our agricultural sector,  because a nation that cannot feed itself cannot be safe. Essential  inputs, from fertilizer to gasoline for tractors, are directly reliant  on the price of energy. Unleashing the power of our energy will keep  the costs of businesses low for our producers and prices low at the  grocery store, benefiting all Americans.   Repealing export restrictions on LNG, liquefied natural gas, will  exponentially grow our share of global gas markets. The largest LNG  bunker barge, the Clean Canaveral, just completed its inaugural  bunkering in Jacksonville, Florida, making the Sunshine State a new hub  for natural gas. Floridians stand to benefit greatly in jobs and  economic growth from the reduction of regulations and LNG exports.   Madam Chair, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 1.
