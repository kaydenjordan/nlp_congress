 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of the  free press in America.   I can't believe that I have to say this, but our free press is under  attack--physical attack. As Americans have taken to the streets to  demand change in the wake of George Floyd's murder, we have seen our  First Amendment trampled as hundreds of journalists have been arrested  and assaulted by law enforcement officers.   In the past few weeks, members of the press have been detained,  gassed, shot at. One reporter lost an eye when she was targeted with  rubber bullets, and the most infamous example was the attack upon  peaceful protestors and journalists gathered outside the White House.   Mr. Speaker, a free press is one of the most fundamental and  cherished values in our country, predating our Constitution. It stems  from 1735 when John Peter Zenger was arrested and charged with sedition  for criticizing a corrupt British governor of New York.   A free press is one of the most basic ways we hold our government  accountable.   On the eve of our Nation's birthday, I invite my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to join me in sponsoring H. Res. 999, which condemns  attacks upon the press and the detention of journalists and reaffirms  the value of a free press to our democracy.                            ____________________
