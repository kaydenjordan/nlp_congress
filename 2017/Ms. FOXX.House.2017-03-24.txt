 Mr. Speaker, skyrocketing cost, diminished choices for  patients, small businesses destroyed, fewer jobs, and lower wages, that  is  [[Page H2421]]  ObamaCare's legacy. That is what Democrats imposed on our country.   We believe the American people deserve a better way, and that is what  this legislation will deliver. The American Health Care Act puts the  American people back in control of their health care. It restores  choices, protects the most vulnerable, encourages lower healthcare  costs, empowers States, and frees families and small businesses from  costly taxes and mandates.   Let's keep our promise to provide a better way on health care by  voting ``yes'' on the American Health Care Act.   Mr. Speaker, I ask the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden) to engage  in a brief colloquy.   Health sharing ministries play an increasingly important role in the  lives of many Americans, particularly in the devastating wake of  ObamaCare. In recent days, constituents have expressed concerns about  the future of these healthcare plans, particularly as it relates to  whether they would be considered credible coverage under the bill's  continuous coverage provisions.   Will Chairman Walden work with me, as the bill moves forward, to  ensure we address the concerns of those who benefit from health sharing  ministries?    I yield to the gentleman from Oregon.
