 Madam Speaker, my question is: Why hasn't Speaker  Pelosi called for a vote on the HALT Fentanyl Act, which would make the  dangerous fentanyl derivatives illegal permanently?   Drug overdoses from fentanyl and derivatives have skyrocketed,  hitting a tragically high level. Madam Speaker, 100,000 people died in  America last year.   Law enforcement officials in West Virginia are frustrated. From  Clarksburg, Parkersburg, and Martinsburg, they are all saying the same  thing, Madam Speaker: Enough is enough.   A slap on the wrist, and these fentanyl dealers are back on the  street, pushing their deadly poison into the hands of our children.   What is Speaker Pelosi waiting for? Close the border. Put traffickers  in jail. Increase sentences for dealers. Keep them out of our  neighborhoods.   Madam Speaker, enough is enough. Children are losing their mothers;  wives are losing their husbands; and parents are losing their children.   How many more people will lose their lives from fentanyl derivatives  before Congress--the Democrats--take action on this legislation?   I will say it one last time: Enough is enough.
