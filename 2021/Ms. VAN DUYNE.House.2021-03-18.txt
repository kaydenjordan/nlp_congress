 Mr. Speaker, the crisis at the border is astounding in  its scale, as thousands of illegal immigrants, enabled by drug cartels  and human traffickers, enter the country on a daily basis, many of them  unaccompanied minors, untested for COVID-19. Yet our colleagues across  the aisle accuse us of using this crisis at the border as an excuse.  Context matters and policies have consequences.   This is a surge at levels we have never seen before, and it is a  direct reaction to the Biden administration dispensing with numerous  measures which protected our southern border.   Yet, it is another day of political theater today on the House floor  and another set of bills without any real debate.   In addition to the lackluster effort here in Congress, our President  needs to enforce our laws. I and 20 of my colleagues from Texas  recently urged the Texas Attorney General to hold the President's feet  to the fire and enforce the laws, such as Title 42.   The President can use whatever language he wants to to describe what  is happening on our southern border, but his reckless policies are  creating a disastrous situation for Texans, putting our health and  safety in grave jeopardy.   Today could have been an opportunity for real debate and to send a  message that this manufactured crisis needs to stop and make true  reforms to our immigration system, yet that could not be further from  the truth.   It is obvious we have a broken immigration system, but Democrats'  flagrant disregard of laws to appease the far left is dangerous and out  of touch with the challenges real Americans are facing right now.  Ignoring laws, such as Title 42, denying a border crisis, that is not  leadership, and Texans know better than to take that sitting down.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill.
