 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, Representative  Manning, for introducing this very straightforward bill.   This bill affirms current law to ensure that women can determine the  course of their lives and decide if, when, and under what circumstances  to have a child. This is a fundamental right.   Despite broad public support for birth control, we have already seen  States use the Dobbs decision as an opening to try to block or ban  certain methods of contraception. These actions bring a new sense of  urgency to make sure no one can take away this very important tool from  women.   As a pediatrician, I have had the privilege of helping young women  decide which method of contraception would be best for them, and not  one of them wanted to become pregnant any time soon. Everybody should  be able to choose the contraceptive that meets their needs without  interference from politicians.   This is not a controversial bill. It affirms our right to use  contraception and for doctors to prescribe contraception. Frankly, it  should get unanimous support in the Chamber.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
