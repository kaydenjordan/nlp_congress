 Madam Speaker, don't let anybody tell you that all we  do here in the House of Representatives is investigate the White House.  We have passed 275-plus bipartisan bills for the good of the people.   For hardworking families, we have passed legislation to increase  wages and protect pensions.   For American women, we have passed legislation to promote personal  security and ensure equal pay for equal work.   For American communities, we have passed legislation to improve  public safety by strengthening background checks.   And for our American veterans, we have passed legislation to improve  transition assistance and access to mental healthcare.   Rather than govern, Senate Republicans have chosen to play politics.  This Congress, they have refused to consider more than 275 House-passed  bipartisan bills. Those are bills that have Republican support sitting  on the desk of the Senate leader not being passed.   Madam Speaker, I remind Senate Republicans: Do your job. Let's govern  wisely and get these bills passed.                            ____________________
