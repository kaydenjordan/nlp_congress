 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  90th birthday of Ms. Vera Powell, who lives in Pooler, Georgia.   Ms. Powell was born on July 16, 1927, in Tattnall County, Georgia,  about 60 miles due west of Savannah. After graduating from Tattnall  County High School, Ms. Powell dedicated her life to her family and  raising her three children: Bruce, Linda, and Crystal.   In 1994, Ms. Powell moved from Tattnall County to Pooler, Georgia,  and became a member of the First Baptist Church of Pooler. Her love of  God and fellowship with others turned into a meaningful role with the  church's weekly Sunday school class.   Now she has been an active weekly participant, greatly contributing  to the fellowship and scholarship with the class for the past 23 years,  and is a staple of the church.   The members of the congregation look forward to seeing Ms. Powell as  she greets them at the church doors every Sunday morning.   Ms. Powell's family and friends celebrated her 90th birthday with a  reception on July 16, 2017. Please join me in wishing this remarkable  woman a very happy birthday.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for hosting  this tonight and for his advocacy on the part of the community  pharmacy, but, more importantly, on the part of the patients, because  that is what this is about. This is about patients, about patient care,  about escalating prescription costs. That is what we are talking about  here, about unfair trade practices.   This is America. Like my colleague mentioned earlier, I am not  opposed to anybody making money. That is great. More power to them. But  where there is a problem with transparency, there is a problem with  PBMs. There is a problem with escalating drug prices.   I want to mention that I have been a practicing pharmacist, as  Representative Collins mentioned, for over 30 years. I have worked with  my neighbors and my friends to really provide a helpful voice for their  needs. Beneficiaries are facing increased costs in prescription drugs  without much of a basis notification as to why these costs are  skyrocketing.   My friend, Representative Collins; my friend, Representative Scott;  others--even on the other side of the aisle--Representative Peter  Welch, Representative Elijah Cummings, and Representative Dave  Loebsack, this is a nonpartisan issue. Everybody has to have  prescription medications. Whether you are a Democrat, whether you are a  Republican, whether you are an Independent, it doesn't matter. Everyone  is the victim of escalating prescription drug costs. The problem is we  have got to understand where that is coming from.   I thank Representative Collins for his legislation, the Prescription  Drug Price Transparency Act, to bring about greater transparency in the  role that pharmacy benefit managers, the PBMs, have in the drug pricing  structure.   Many people don't understand the structure or where the additional  fees are originating from, which is often a direct result of the lack  of transparency between the manufacturer and the dispenser. Let me  repeat that. Many people don't understand the structure. I will be  quite honest with you. I have been working with this for over 30 years,  and I still don't understand it. In fact, I have got numerous examples  of where CEOs have said they don't understand it. It is intentionally-- intentionally--complicated so that no one understands it.   I had the opportunity last year as a member of the Oversight and  Government Reform Committee. We had the CEO of Mylan pharmaceuticals.  Mylan, of course, is the manufacturer of EpiPen. It went up in price.  The EpiPen costs $600 for a dual pack.   I said: Okay. When it leaves you, the manufacturer, you are the  beginning. You are the manufacturer. How much have you got in costs?   She responded: I have got $100, maybe $150 in costs.   I said: Okay. You are the beginning. I am the end. I am the  dispensing pharmacist. When it gets to me, it is $600--$150 at the  beginning, $600 at the end. What happened in between? What happened in  between?   Now, a lot of times it is lost on some of my colleagues here and on  the average American because all they are concerned about what the  copay is, if the copay is $15 or if the copay is zero. Okay.   But keep in mind that somebody somewhere is still paying that $600.  In a lot of cases, it is the Federal Government through Medicare part D  or State Medicaid plans. Somebody somewhere is paying it.   But when you have the CEO of a manufacturer, when I asked her a  direct question, ``What happens in between that $150 and that $600?''  and she says, ``I don't know,'' and I am the pharmacist and I say, ``I  don't know either,'' somebody somewhere has to know. I can tell you it  is the middle man.   The most effective, the most immediate impact that we can have on  prescription drug pricing is to pass this bill that Representative  Collins has and to have transparency in drug pricing. Sunshine is the  greatest disinfectant of all. If we have sunshine, we will have lower  drug prices if we have transparency.   I want to give a couple of other examples. My colleague,  Representative Collins, mentioned about three PBMs controlling 80  percent of the market. That is not competition when you have got three  companies that control 80 percent of a market   Did you know that Express Scripts, the number one PBM in the country,  had gross revenues almost equal to McDonald's, Ford Motor Company, and  Pfizer pharmaceuticals added together? Added together, this one PBM.   Now, again, I am not opposed to anyone making money. More power to  them. But how are they making it? Nobody knows.   Why don't we have transparency?   Everybody wants lower drug prices, and we have all got to do a better  job. Pharmaceutical manufacturers have got to do a better job.  Pharmacists have got to do a better job. GPOs have got to do a better  job. But until we have transparency, we are never going to be able to  get it under control.   I want to give a couple other examples. The manufacturer of the  hepatitis C drug has had so much criticism about the price, and it is  too expensive. Gilead pharmaceuticals makes SOVALDI. SOVALDI accused  Express Scripts of not warning them to go down on the price of SOVALDI.  Gilead said: You never wanted us to go down on that price because you  are getting a percentage rebate. The higher the cost of that  medication, the higher rebate you are getting.   My colleague mentioned about the lawsuit that Anthem has against  Express Scripts. Anthem is not going to renew their contract with  Express Scripts because they are suing them for billions--that is  billions with a ``B''--of dollars, saying: You owe us billions of  dollars.   These are real-life examples of what I am talking about. That is why  we need to pass the Prescription Drug Price Transparency Act that  Representative Collins is pushing so hard, and has been, and we thank  him for that.   I want to also talk about some other bills here continuing in the  theme of transparency. We have an opportunity to address the issue of  retroactive DIR fees and the impact they have on drug pricing. My  colleague, Representative Scott, mentioned DIR fees and clawbacks. DIR  fees are having a negative impact on the ability to provide accurate  and comprehensive services to the beneficiary.   Those fees are a large unknown for pharmacists and don't provide  clarity on drug costs to the patient or whether they will be able to  accurately meet the needs of their patients. Ultimately, the patient  ends up being penalized, and that is an issue that must be addressed.  Ultimately, what this boils down to is the patient--the patient, Mr.  Speaker, the patient. Let's stay focused on what we are supposed to be  focused on, and that is the patient.   We talk about drug costs and we talk about healthcare. We want  accessibility, we want affordability, and we want patient-centered  healthcare.                                time  2045    That is what we want in prescription drugs, accessibility and  affordability. Yes, they need to come down in prices. And again, the  most effective, the immediate impact that we can have is to have  transparency, transparency in the middleman in what they are doing.   That is the reason why Congressman Morgan Griffith's legislation is  helpful in bringing about stability. Pharmacies would no longer be  penalized for providing the same quality service they always have  simply because PBMs have shifted cost under a lack of transparency.  With this legislation, we can keep costs down for beneficiaries.   Now, I want to talk about another piece of legislation that another  good friend, Representative Brett Guthrie from Kentucky has introduced,  H.R.  [[Page H5915]]  592, the Pharmacy and Medically Underserved Areas Enhancement Act, to  address the role of pharmacists in rural communities. With this bill,  many of the individuals who seek consultation, especially seniors, can  contribute to receive quality input and expertise.   There are many underserved and rural areas of the country where  patients don't have access to a primary care provider but have access  to a pharmacist. Pharmacists are the most accessible healthcare  professionals that we have. That is why provider status is so  important. That is what we call this, the Pharmacy and Medically  Underserved Areas Enhancement Act.   Under this legislation, pharmacists can continue to service those  rural and underserved areas and fill a role that is vital to the  healthcare of these residents in these areas.   I also want to compliment and commend Representative Griffith again  on his efforts to keep patients' access to compounded medications  intact. In June, he introduced a Preserving Patient Access to  Compounded Medications Act of 2017. This bill will provide further  guidance for the FDA, medical providers, patients, and compounding  pharmacies about what constitutes pharmacy compounding and what is  regarded as drug manufacturing. This legislation will provide a crucial  balance between public safety and patients' access to the medications  they need.   Lastly, the leadership of the Energy and Commerce Committee has been  critical in advancing legislation both in the 114th and 115th Congress  that will lead to research and development of new drugs and treatments.  I commend my colleagues on their hard work and thank my good friends  for the opportunity to speak tonight on this issue that is very  important to me.   Mr. Speaker, the President has identified escalating prescription  drug cost as being one of his biggest priorities. He has said himself:  If you are on the other side of research and development, you need to  beware because we are coming after you. PBMs, you are on the other side  of research and development, and we are coming after you.   This is too important. It is too important to the patients who are  trying to get these medications, who need these medications. All we are  asking for here is transparency. All we are asking for is to shine the  light on what is going on.   I know they make it difficult to understand. It is a shell game. It  is nothing more than a shell game. Again, I want to commend my  colleague, my friend, Representative Collins, for his untiring advocacy  on the part of community pharmacists and on the part of citizens who  need and depend on their community pharmacists.    There is no question about it. Let me, if I  may.    There is no question about it. Let me, if I  may.    There is no question about it. Let me, if I  may.    Mr. Speaker, if I might just give two  examples. First of all, there is an example of Caterpillar. Caterpillar  has done away with PBMs. They have done away with the third parties.  They are doing it themselves. And you know what it has resulted in?  Stable drug prices for the past few years.   As opposed to the increases that most companies have seen,  Caterpillar, when they cut out the middleman, they have had stable drug  prices. They said: We can do this better. And they have done it better.   Keep in mind--the second thing that I want to point out is, keep in  mind, why were PBMs created? First of all, they were created to process  claims, insurance claims. But what is their purpose? They will tell you  our purpose is to keep drug prices down. Our purpose is to keep drug  prices down.   Mr. Speaker, how is that working out for you? They are not keeping  drug prices down. They are keeping drug prices up. They are one of the  reasons why drug prices are going up, one of the primary reasons.   I can remember when I started practicing pharmacy in 1980. And I am  proud to say that I am that old. I started practicing pharmacy in 1980.  We used to buy directly from the drug companies. I would buy directly  from Upjohn, from Merck Sharp & Dohme, from Squibb, from whoever. There  was no middleman there. Now I can't even do that. I have to go through  the PBM. I have to go through all these different layers and layers in  order to get the medication.   PBMs, if their purpose is to control drug prices, then what is going  on? Because drug prices ar escalating. What a tangled web we weave.     Mr. Speaker, if I could just mention one  thing, and I would be remiss if I did not mention this, because the  gentleman has just brought up an outstanding point, and that is: What  value are they bringing to the system? What value are PBMs, are  middlemen, bringing to the system? That is what I would ask.   Now, look, pharmaceutical manufacturers need to do a better job. They  need to bring their prices down. But I will cut them some slack. At  least they are using their profits to go back into research and  development. At least they are doing that. PBMs don't put one red cent  into research and development, not one red cent.   I repeat what I said earlier. I am not against anybody making money,  but, Mr. Speaker, this is causing escalating  [[Page H5916]]  drug prices. The lack of transparency is causing the problems that we  are experiencing right now.   The most immediate, the most effective impact that we can have on  prescription drug prices is transparency. Sunshine is the greatest  disinfectant out there, and we need sunshine.   Thank you for what you are doing for the patients. Thank you for what  you are doing for the people who are struggling to pay for their  prescriptions. That is what this is about.
