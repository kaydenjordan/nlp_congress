 Mr. Speaker, I rise to welcome today's guest chaplain,  Reverend Dr. Tony Foster of Restoration Worship Center in Greenwood,  South Carolina.   Dr. Foster, a personal friend of mine, has faithfully served in  Christian ministry for more than 29 years. In that time, he has  preached the gospel in the United States and around the world,  ministering in the United Kingdom, Canada, India, and other countries.   Pastor Foster is cofounder and copastor of Restoration Worship  Center, which began in 2003 with just 25 members and the goal of being  a place for the community to worship God while growing in their faith.   He is partnered in ministry by his wife, Joanie, who is watching from  the gallery today. Pastor Tony and Joanie also have two sons, James and  Trey.   His ministry seeks to equip Christians to stand for righteousness in  the nations of the world.   Outside of the pulpit, Pastor Tony lives out his faith and his  commitment to helping troubled youth become all God wants them to be by  serving on the South Carolina Juvenile Parole Board.    Dr. Foster also serves on the board of directors for the Charter  Institute at Erskine, as well as president of Restoration Bible  College. Most recently, he took another step to serve the community  being sworn in as a magistrate judge in Greenwood County, South  Carolina.   I am proud to have Pastor Tony Foster here as the guest chaplain of  the people's House. I am grateful for his service to God and our  country and especially the youth of South Carolina.   I pray that God continues to bless him and his family, the State of  South Carolina, and the United States of America.                            ____________________
