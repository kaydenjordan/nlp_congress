 Mr. Speaker, last week, President  Donald Trump warmly welcomed Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov to  the White House and reaffirmed the strong alliance between our two  countries.   Based on this successful meeting, the United States and Bulgaria  announced a new strategic partnership framework to deepen our historic  bilateral relationship which spans over 100 years.   According to a joint statement to face a growing concern about the  security situation in the Black Sea, Bulgaria offered to provide a  maritime coordination function at Varna in support of NATO's Tailored  Forward Presence Initiative. This is so important and will be a welcome  step in the formation of an intelligence hub in the region to counter  destructive activity. The two also agreed to work more closely on  energy diversification to advance Bulgaria's energy sector, reduce  prices for citizens, and allow for Bulgaria to become a true gas hub  and key source of regional energy security.   These two measures underscore the important role that Bulgaria  continues to play as an ally and a valuable NATO member. I am grateful  that President Trump is prioritizing a relationship with a beloved ally  like Bulgaria.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
