 Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend from Virginia for  those loquacious comments.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 4182, the Ensuring a  Qualified Civil Service Act.   H.R. 4182 unnecessarily doubles the probationary period for Federal  employees from 1 to 2 years. During this period, employees have  essentially no due process rights and can be removed for any reason or  no reason at all with no right to appeal.   This is an arbitrary change to existing policy, and there is no  evidence to suggest that extending the probationary period will address  any issues surrounding employee performance or the department  performance.   Not only are candidates for Federal jobs already put through  extensive selection processes, but a year is sufficient for any  competent manager to determine the ability of any employee to  accomplish the job that they have been hired to do.   This bill will not improve agency outcomes but would penalize Federal  workers by weakening their due process rights. Without due process,  Federal employees will have little protection against employer  discrimination and termination without cause.    These due process rights are also critical to promoting equity,  fairness, and ensuring that whistleblowers continue to speak up without  fear of retaliation.   It is also a clear attempt to undermine Federal employees' right to  unionize since they would not be eligible to participate until their  probationary period is over.   We need evidence-based changes that value Federal employees, make  their workplaces safe, protect them against sexual harassment and  discrimination, and ensure that their voices are heard. I ask my  colleagues to reject this shortsighted legislation.
