 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this Rural  Opioid Abuse Prevention Act.   I am from rural America. I am from rural Iowa, and I have seen the  effects of opioids. It affects all ages. Those that are in high school  that get hurt, that have a knee go out or a shoulder, they get affected  by taking opioids.   This bipartisan legislation, which I introduced with my colleague,  Conor Lamb, will help prevent opioid abuse and overdoses in rural  America.   In 2021 alone, nearly 100,000 Americans died from some drug overdose.  This is unacceptable. This bill can do something about it.   My legislation will help the most vulnerable in rural America, in  rural communities, recover from addiction and provide our first  responders with the support they need to save lives.   There are too many barriers to rural healthcare right now, and we  need to ensure that our Federal programs can efficiently reach  communities in rural America that can make a difference when it comes  to opioid abuse, and that is exactly what this bill does.   I urge my colleagues to support this important program because too  many families have lost loved ones to the opioid epidemic, and they  have also been affected by a family member's addiction. That needs to  change.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this bill.
