 Mr. President, today I would like  to take a moment to recognize Ms. Nancy Whitworth of Greenville, SC,  for her over 40 years of service to Greenville County. I extend my  congratulations to her on her upcoming retirement and wish to reflect  on her successful career.   As the longtime economic developer and deputy city manager for the  city of Greenville, Nancy was responsible for commercial and  neighborhood revitalization, downtown development, business recruitment  and retention, planning and zoning, and building codes. She has also  authored articles on Greenville's award-winning downtown and meets  frequently with other cities to share Greenville's success story. Last  year, she was awarded with the 2018 Local Economic Developer of the  Year award.   Ms. Whitworth is to be commended for her role in spurring the  dramatic growth and revitalization Greenville  [[Page S7026]]  has seen in the past decades. Through her leadership and dedication to  her community, she has been an invaluable asset to the Upstate of South  Carolina. Ms. Whitworth is a shining example of a dedicated public  servant and should inspire us all to give our best to our communities.  I would like to personally commend and thank Ms. Whitworth for her  decades of service that encouraged Greenville's economic prosperity and  success.                            ____________________
