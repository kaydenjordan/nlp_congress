 Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman  and my good friend from Maryland for yielding me the customary 30  minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the rule before us today provides for consideration of  H.R. 8873, which--let's just call it what it is--this is a partisan  messaging bill from my friends across the aisle.   My colleagues want to ram this bill through Congress to change the  way Presidential elections are conducted. H.R. 8873 is attempting to  reform the Electoral Count Act for the first time since 1887. This is  the first time in 135 years we are taking a look at this. Yet, despite  that, no hearings were held on this bill, and the text was introduced  just a mere 24 hours before it was presented in the Rules Committee  yesterday.   During testimony before the Rules Committee, the sponsor of the bill,  Chair Lofgren, mentioned repeatedly the lengthy process they undertook  to draft this bill, including consulting the country's leading so- called experts. Yet, she did not bother to bring this legislation  before her own committee for consideration.   Given the majority's constant claims of democracy itself being under  attack, one would think that the Democratic Party and my colleagues  across the aisle would bring bills through the appropriate channels and  mechanisms. But my colleagues across the aisle will also try to tell  you that this bill is a reform, it is a reaction to the objections to  certifying the 2020 election. However, both sides of the aisle have  long used their legal authority to object to Presidential elections.   Notable individuals that have exercised this authority include no  other than Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Nancy Pelosi--and  that is just to name a few.   Again, they have all used this authority to object to Presidential  elections. Even our distinguished chairman of the Committee on Rules,  and someone I consider a good friend, objected to the 2016 elections.  My other Rules Committee colleague and good friend from Maryland also  objected.   In fact, following the 2016 election, Democrats objected to  certifying the electoral votes of more States than Republicans did in  2021.   Following her loss to President Trump, Hillary Clinton continued to  attack the integrity of our democratic process by insisting ad nauseam  that President Trump was, ``an illegitimate President.''   Stacey Abrams--another great example--the current Georgia Democratic  gubernatorial nominee, has built a national brand on denying election  results and making baseless accusations of suppression and voter fraud.  She claimed that she won the 2018 election for Governor and has yet to  concede the 2018 race.   But we can go all the way back to 2005. Democrats objected in that  year to certifying Ohio's electoral votes with Senator Barbara Boxer  joining Representative Stephanie Tubbs Jones to require a vote.   Madam Speaker, 31 Members of the House voted against certifying these  results; 12 of whom are still in Congress today, and I presume those 12  are now supporting this legislation, hypocritically. But this precedent  goes back even further than 2005 and 2001.   We can take this back to 1961 with President John F. Kennedy. JFK-- this is a great history lesson--drafted his own secret slate of  electors declaring himself the winner of Hawaii's electoral votes when  the State was originally called for Richard Nixon.   Let's just talk about today. Despite the history, today, the actual  purpose of this bill is nothing more than an attempt to federalize our  elections. This is a way to backdoor H.R. 1 into legislation.   This is nothing more than an attack on President Trump and the 2020  election, an attack on a man who has not been in office for nearly 2  years. This is about giving Congress unprecedented authority on how to  interpret State law, how to restrict State discretion, and how to  impose control on State election officials.  [[Page H8024]]    Madam Speaker, for those reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose this  rule.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I would remind my colleague and good friend from  Massachusetts that he objected to Alabama in 2017, just like my good  friend from Maryland objected in 2017 to Florida.   Now, as far as this bill being rammed through, I would take a minute  to rebut the accusation that it hasn't been rammed through. It  absolutely was.   We were given almost exactly 24 hours to look at this bill before it  came to the Committee on Rules. When we had the hearing in the  Committee on Rules, to my knowledge, that was the only hearing that we  have had in the House because Chair Lofgren didn't even have the  foresight or the willingness to take this through her own committee  process, her own committee that she chairs.   So I am just saying let's follow the process. And let's be frank  about something. If this bill were just about increasing the number of  necessary objectors to one-third in this Chamber and one-third in the  other Chamber, it might have a chance of passing with bipartisan  support. But that is not what this bill does. This bill is a backdoor  for H.R. 1.                                time  1245    Let me just give you a few examples of extra material in this bill  that makes it unpalatable.   This bill allows for Presidential candidates to sue to extend the  voting period, even after polls have closed, due to a broadly defined  catastrophic event. Then a panel of Federal judges, not State election  officials, are then responsible for deciding whether States must allow  for up to 5 additional days of voting. The real kicker here is that  this suit must be filed no more than 1 day after the election. So you  can see how a ``catastrophic event'' would probably be any Democrat  that is losing on the night of the election.   Rather than working with Republicans in a bipartisan manner on a  skinny form of an actual reform bill, House Democrats and the January 6  committee are desperately trying to score cheap political points on a  bill that does nothing to improve the Electoral Count Act and does  everything to take away constitutional and State sovereignty over  elections.   Let's be blunt about something else. The American people don't care  about this, especially when they are dealing with catastrophe after  catastrophe and failed policy after failed policy of this  administration. So while House Democrats are focusing on a partisan  messaging bill that has zero chance of actually becoming law, our  southern border just hit a record 2 million border crossings this  fiscal year. That is the highest amount ever recorded in a single year.   Meanwhile, for the past year-and-a-half, the Biden administration has  been transporting illegal immigrants from the southern border to places  all over the country, often in the dead of night, and with zero  notification to elected officials.   That is why if we defeat the previous question, I will personally  offer an amendment to the rule immediately to consider H.R. 6592, the  Immigration Transparency and Transit Notification Act of 2022.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with any extraneous material,  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser), my good friend, who is here to explain  more on this amendment.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to  the gentleman from Pennsylvania.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I can tell you that in my area of Pennsylvania, nobody  is talking about this. What they are talking about is failed economic  policy, failure to support law enforcement, which is leading to both  inflation, economic hardship, and some of the highest crime rates we  have ever seen on record.   I would implore my colleagues across the aisle to actually talk to  real Americans, not just the woke yuppies that comprise their voting  base, to see what Americans care about. But something tells me that the  American people will say loud and clear what they care about come  November.   It is also rich hearing about all of these ``assaults on democracy.''  Let's just go back to 2019. In 2019, Hillary Clinton said: ``No, it  doesn't kill me, because he knows''--meaning Trump--``that he is an  illegitimate President.'' So you have the former Presidential candidate  calling the former President an illegitimate President. That is clearly  echoing some of the sentiments that my friends across the aisle are now  accusing us of doing.    Adam Schiff, for example, my colleague from California, in his  opening statement for the Senate's January 2020 impeachment trial said:  ``The President's misconduct cannot be decided at the ballot box, for  we cannot be assured that the vote will be fairly won.'' How about that  for criticizing and questioning the democratic process?   Representative John Lewis, in 2017, said: ``I don't see this  President-elect as a legitimate President. I think the Russians  participated in helping this man get elected, and they helped destroy  the candidacy of Hillary Clinton.'' That was a baseless claim based on  the Steele dossier that was discredited.   Representative Jerry McNerney of California, in 2017: ``The election  of Mr. Trump lacks legitimacy.''   Vicente Gonzalez of Texas, just this month--this isn't even the last  Presidential election cycle. This was this month, regarding a special  election. This month, when discussing Mayra Flores' upset victory in  his upcoming election against her, said: ``They stole that last  election.'' So it is quite rich hearing all of these accusations now  coming from my friends across the aisle.   When we call into question election results, it is somehow a threat  to democracy. When they do it, they are magically upholding democracy.   But it just doesn't stop with my friends across the aisle here in  this Chamber. Let's talk about Kamala Harris. She agreed with the radio  show host that she should be concerned over Trump's legitimacy. She  said: ``We should believe exactly what the intelligence community has  told us, which is Russia did interfere in the election of the President  in 2017.'' That is the now Vice President saying that.   Also, it is absolutely rich that she cites the intelligence  community, when they knew the Steele dossier was a product of the  Hillary Clinton campaign; the same intelligence community that wasn't  able to discern that the Russian interference story was a hoax; the  same intelligence community that told us that the Hunter Biden laptop  was Russian disinformation, despite knowing that the FBI had that  laptop in their possession at the time they made that baseless  accusation; the same intel community, by the way, that told us that  Kabul would stand strong for months on end and Ukraine would fall  within hours. So that is the intel community that my friends across the  aisle are citing.  [[Page H8027]]    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Garbarino), my good friend, to speak more on the issue of immigration  and transparency.                                time  1300     Madam Speaker, I have a lot of respect and  admiration for my good friend from California, and he knows that. But  if you want to talk about sequels, let's just talk about all the times  the Democrats objected to election results. We can go all the way back  for decades.   Many Democrats, including Hillary Clinton, Barbara Lee, Maxine  Waters, and Sheila Jackson Lee, have cast doubt on every single  Republican Presidential victory in the last two decades. In fact, every  single Democrat President since 1977 has cast doubt on the legitimacy  of U.S. elections.   I will just go through some of that because my good friend from  California said this looks like a sequel to a bad movie. Let's just  look at the current administration. In both 2013 and 2016, Biden  claimed that Gore won the 2000 Presidential election. In May 2019,  Biden said that he ``absolutely'' agrees that Trump is an  ``illegitimate President.'' That is the current Democratic President  casting doubt on elections.    It doesn't stop with him, though. Let's again go to his Vice  President, Kamala Harris. In 2019, the Vice President agreed that Trump  was an illegitimate President.   It is just not those that were elected to office. Let's look at key  senior staffers.   For nearly two decades, Biden Chief of Staff Ron Klain claimed that  Al Gore won the 2000 election.   President Biden's press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, tweeted that  the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial race was stolen. Jean-Pierre also cast  doubt just not on that election but also on the 2016 election by  tweeting: ``Stolen election, welcome to the world of #unpresidented  Trump.''   Jamal Simmons, the communications director for Kamala Harris, for  years tweeted that Bush had stolen the 2000 election.   Then-Representative Marcia Fudge of Ohio, now the HUD Secretary, said  that Trump ``may not be a legitimate President.''   If you are talking about sequels to bad movies, this goes all the way  back to the 1970s, when my friends across the aisle undermined faith in  our elections by loose talk and baseless claims that elections were  stolen.   I will end the list of quotes with this because it is my good friend  from Maryland. In 2002, my friend from Maryland wrote that the Supreme  Court had ``[frozen] the election results'' in an ``outrageous assault  on democracy,'' saying that the Court had determined the outcome of a  Presidential election.   In 2003, my good friend also called Bush America's first ``court- appointed President.''   I have a litany of other quotes from my friends across the aisle, not  only current Members serving in this Chamber but also well-known  Democrats from across the United States that have questioned results of  elections.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time to close.   Madam Speaker, inflation is at the highest rate in over 40 years,  literally the highest rate since I have been alive. The majority of  American workers confirmed their income has fallen behind the rising  cost of things like buying groceries, paying utility bills, and just  filling up their gas tanks.   We have set a record for the highest illegal border crossings in 1  year, including 78 individuals on the FBI's terrorist watch list.   So far in 2022, homicide rates have increased roughly 50 percent  compared to this time in 2019.   The Federal Government is also set to run out of funding in 9 days,  yet here we are, focused for the second week in a row on trying to  attack President Trump, a President that hasn't been in office for  nearly 2 years. That is how we are spending our time.   House Democrats have chosen once again to put on yet another  partisan, political show while the American people are at home  suffering the consequences of their failed agenda, suffering the  consequences of inflation that is out of control, wages that are  dropping, energy costs that are skyrocketing, and crime rates that are  making them less safe in their communities.    H.R. 8873 tramples on States' rights and would do serious harm to the  integrity of our elections.   Madam Speaker, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no''  on the previous question and ``no'' on the rule, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   This is a 5-minute vote.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 219,  nays 209, not voting 4, as follows:                               [Roll No. 446]                                 YEAS--219       Adams      Aguilar      Allred      Auchincloss      Axne      Barragan      Bass      Beatty      Bera      Beyer      Bishop (GA)      Blumenauer      Blunt Rochester      Bonamici      Bourdeaux      Bowman      Boyle, Brendan F.
