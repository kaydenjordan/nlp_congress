 Mr. Speaker, the American people are sick and tired of  runaway government promises of how excessive spending, tax increases,  and Green New Deal special interest investments are somehow going to  make their lives better and reduce inflation.   Yet, we are here today in this Chamber to raise taxes on the American  people, hire 87,000 new IRS auditors forever more, Mr. Speaker, and  pass over a half trillion dollars in new government spending, all in  the name of the Inflation Reduction Act.   Mr. Speaker, is this some sort of joke? Do we actually think that the  American people believe that? Well, they don't.   By the way, regarding the $400,000 less won't get taxed, if a pass- through business makes $400K and the partners pay themselves $100,000  each, they will fall under the audit initiative by the IRS.   As well, the projections for IRS hiring do not count only taxing  those over $400K, so the whole thing was made up to make it sound  better than it is.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote.
