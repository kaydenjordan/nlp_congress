Whereas on December 20th, 2019, Speaker Pelosi extended an invitation  for President Trump to address a joint session of Congress on February  4th, 2020;   Whereas on February 4th, 2020, President Trump delivered his State of  the Union address, in which he honored the sacrifice of the following  American heroes and their families:   General Charles McGee, one of the last surviving Tuskegee airmen, who  served in World War II, the Korean war and the Vietnam war;   Kayla Mueller, a humanitarian aid worker who was caring for suffering  civilians in Syria when she was kidnapped, tortured and enslaved by  ISIS for over 500 days before being murdered by ISIS leader Abu Bakr  al-Baghdadi;   Army Staff Sergeant Christopher Hake, who was killed while serving  his second tour of duty in Iraq by a roadside bomb supplied by Iranian  terrorist leader Qasem Soleimani;   Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams, who is currently serving his  fourth deployment in the Middle East  [[Page H837]]  and his wife, Amy, who works full-time for the Army and devotes  hundreds of hours helping military families;   Whereas immediately following the address, while still presiding over  the joint session, Speaker Pelosi ripped up an official copy of the  President's remarks, which contained the names and stories of these  patriots who sacrificed so much for our country; and   Whereas the conduct of Speaker Pelosi was a breach of decorum and  degraded the proceedings of the joint session, to the discredit of the  House: Now, therefore, be it   Resolved, That the House of Representatives disapproves of the  behavior of Speaker Pelosi during the joint session of Congress held on  February 4, 2020.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        February 5, 2020, page H837, the following appeared: Resolved,  That the House of Representatives disapproves of the behavior of  Speaker PELOSI during the joint session of Congress held on  February 4, 2020.
