 Madam Speaker, I rise today to call on Congress to  reject the Republicans' reckless default on America act and to protect  the progress that we have made in the very important transition to  clean energy.   The Inflation Reduction Act is a significant investment in our  country's clean and healthy future. We are on the cusp of a major clean  energy expansion, generating billions of dollars in private clean  energy investments and thousands of clean energy jobs.   In northwest Oregon, the Inflation Reduction Act has brought millions  of dollars in funding for climate-resilient infrastructure, low- emission public transportation, and clean schoolbuses.   Benefits are flowing to red, blue, and purple States, bringing cost  savings to our constituents. Texas and Iowa, for example, are leading  the U.S. in solar and wind production. It would be foolhardy and fickle  to disrupt or delay this important work, just like it is foolhardy and  fickle of the Republicans to try to force draconian budget cuts by  threatening default.   We must put our constituents first by passing a clean debt limit  increase so we can turn our attention to the real work at hand,  creating jobs, cutting energy costs, growing our clean energy economy  for the sake of our vulnerable communities, future generations, and our  planet.   Madam Speaker, it would only take five brave Republicans to put  country over party and sign the petition.                            ____________________
