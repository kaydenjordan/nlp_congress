 Mr. President, we are now in the third week of  President Trump's government shutdown. This is yet another  manufactured, unnecessary, and irresponsible crisis from this  President. This one comes at a steep, steep cost for very real people.  A government shutdown ripples throughout the entire economy. It shakes  consumer confidence. It impacts hard-working families.   In my home State of New Mexico, almost 6,000 Federal workers have  been furloughed or are working without pay, many of whom were already  living paycheck to paycheck before this President's shutdown.   Carol from Tijeras wrote to me: ``I feel I am being held Hostage by  my government which I have always felt it was an honor to work for.''   Carol is worried about how she and her coworkers are going to pay  their mortgages and their car payments if this shutdown continues.   Kathy from Los Lunas wrote to me: ``I am a federal employee and I am  dismayed that the president is holding us hostage. . . . He needs to  quit toying with our lives and all of the public that we support and  serve and end this shutdown.''   It is hard to say it any better than that. The shutdown's impacts hit  far more than our Federal employees. Hundreds of thousands of New  Mexicans rely on the Federal agencies that President Trump refuses to  reopen.   During President Trump's shutdown, our public lands have had to lock  their gates or leave parks and facilities unstaffed. The impacts of  reduced visitation, the challenges for furloughed public land workers,  and the costs of repairing the damage accrued during the shutdown will  hurt communities across our State and many others.   In this era of increasingly extreme and catastrophic wildfires, I am  particularly worried about the impact that a prolonged shutdown will  have on our national forests.   Nicholas, a wildland firefighter fighter from Las Cruces wrote to me  that he and his coworkers have been furloughed. He says: ``If this  shutdown is  [[Page S56]]  not resolved, it will impact my ability to provide for my family.''   Nicholas deserves to be able to support his family. Our communities  can't afford to wait for Nicholas and his coworkers to do their  essential work that keeps our forests healthy and prevents more  destructive wildfires.   Our State's farmers and rural communities are also facing increased  uncertainty. That is because President Trump's shutdown has shuttered  the Department of Agriculture, which funds agricultural loans and many  economic development programs in rural communities.   If the shutdown continues into next month, as President Trump seems  entirely willing to allow, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance  Program--sometimes referred to as food stamps--will run out of funding.  That would mean that millions of Americans--including more than half a  million in New Mexico alone--would be left struggling to put food on  the table.   Over the weekend, KOB, one of our local television stations in  Albuquerque, talked to New Mexicans who would be impacted by a lapse in  food stamps funding. One man named Steven said:         All of us who use food stamps rely on it. That's how we       eat, that's how we get our nutrition.    He said that if he can't receive his support for food next month, he  might have to take out a loan and go into debt.   New Mexico is also home to many Tribal nations, which are  disproportionately impacted by a lapse in Federal funding and are now  under distress to meet very basic needs in their communities. That  includes things like law enforcement, education, housing, and  transportation.   Let me tell you one example I heard from the Mescalero Apache Tribe  in southern New Mexico. Mescalero's lands span more than 700 square  miles. Because of President Trump's shutdown, the Tribe's federally  funded police force has been furloughed. Just think about what that  means for someone who needs help, someone who needs to report a crime,  or someone who needs medical attention.   I need to remind us that this shutdown comes right after Congress  failed in December to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. Now,  without this law and without funding, Tribes are especially strained in  addressing an epidemic of sexual violence that has been so acutely felt  in their communities.   Mescalero has seen every single one of its Bureau of Indian Affairs  social workers and victims specialists furloughed. That is extremely  dangerous for women and children who are victims of abuse. These are  real people's lives being unnecessarily damaged by President Trump all  because he will not stop holding our government hostage.   Perhaps most telling about President Trump's shutdown is the impact  it is having on our Federal workers responsible for keeping our Nation  safe along our southern border. As a border State, New Mexico is more  familiar than President Trump with responsible and smart border  security policies. In fact, our State is the proud home of the Federal  Law Enforcement Training Center, one of the primary training centers  for U.S. Customs and Border Patrol officers. Because of President  Trump's shutdown, the workers at FLETC and all of the officers working  at our ports of entry and agents along our border are either furloughed  or working without pay. How can it possibly be the best way to keep our  Nation's border region safe and secure?   The President has said he would be proud to shut down our government,  and, well, I have to say there is nothing--nothing--to be proud of  about any of this. The President can--the President must--put an end to  this shutdown.   Look, the way out of this is pretty straightforward. The votes are  not there in either the House or the Senate to make Americans pay the  bill for President Trump's wasteful border wall.   Signing a bipartisan government funding bill to reopen the government  is the only responsible way forward. The only thing he is doing by  refusing to back down is hurting Americans like the families I  represent in New Mexico, like the people who work along our southern  border. They expect and deserve so much better than this  irresponsible--this preventable--shutdown.   President Trump has all the power to end this madness right now. I  will say this one last time. Mr. President, if you are listening,  listen to the American people. Listen to the people who work for you  and me and this entire Nation whom you are you hurting. Do the right  thing and end this now.    Mr. President, I will.    That is correct.    A little over 2 million people.    I was aware of that.    Thank you.
