 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Sheila Jackson for her  persistent and consistent leadership on so many issues, especially  getting this bill to the floor today.   As another daughter of Texas, I am deeply connected to the history of  Juneteenth. My grandfather, William Calhoun Parish, who helped raise  me, was born in Galveston, Texas, just 10 years after General Granger  announced that enslaved Africans were freed from the brutal and  barbaric legal institution of slavery. My ancestors--my great- grandmother--were enslaved in and around Galveston, Texas.   Like myself, so many in the African-American community have  celebrated Juneteenth as our liberation day. To us, it represents the  day that enslaved African Americans were recognized as free men, women,  and children.   Yet, the end of slavery did not stop with the brutal treatment of  African Americans in the United States. The persistence of racial  disparities in housing, income, education, the wealth gap, and other  areas of injustices African Americans really are experiencing today are  a direct result of the racism embedded in our institutions from our  founding.   So, it is not purely symbolic to make Juneteenth a holiday. It is an  important step toward the country reckoning the truth of its legacy of  slavery in the past as manifested today.     It is manifested in the racial injustices  which all of us must work together to end. So, yes, it is so important  that we have the truth told of this legacy of slavery so that we can  move forward and work together to end these racial injustices.   I am reminded of Dr. Maya Angelou and what she once wrote. She said,  ``I am the dream and the hope of the slave. I rise,'' in ``Still I  Rise.''   Madam Speaker, I want to thank you today for bringing this forward,  and I thank the chairwoman for yielding.
