 Mr. President, I rise to celebrate the 100th anniversary  of the passage of the 19th Amendment, providing suffrage for all sexes  in the Constitution of the United States.   The amendment states that the right to vote ``shall not be denied or  abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.'' The  suffrage Movement opened the doors to women's participation in the  electoral process and contributed to equitable civic leadership and  engagement.   Today, I honor the historic milestone of the women's suffrage  movement, and the contributions from my home state of Vermont, while  acknowledging the barriers to voting that have harmed and continue to  harm some of the most marginalized people in our country.   Vermont's contributions to the suffrage movement ranged from  participation on the local level to the national marches. Vermonters  fought for women's legal civic participation in our schools, municipal  offices, and our State legislature, along with the national right to  vote. I am grateful to every Vermonter who fought a more equitable  political system.   Notable Vermont suffragists include Clarina Howard Nichols of  Townshend, who fought for women's property rights. Annette Parmalee of  Washington, one of the most outspoken suffragists in my State, who  fought for suffrage locally, statewide and nationally. And Lucy Daniel  of Grafton, who used civil disobedience to lend her weight to the  fight. I am proud of every Vermonter's contribution to the movement and  helping our country expand access to the ballot box.   Suffragists were women of races, ages, and political backgrounds. Yet  after the 19th Amendment, millions of women--particularly African- Americans in the Jim Crow South--remained shut out of the polls for  decades. Many States and municipalities continued to ignore the 15th  and 19th Amendments, effectively withholding voting rights from women,  Black people, and anyone who was low-income or ``uneducated''. The harm  was most profound at the intersection of marginalized groups.   I find the efforts to stop people from voting to be deeply  unpatriotic--then and now. In our long history, the United States has  made it harder for some individuals to be civically engaged because of  their gender identity, their income, or race. We know that the literacy  tests kept those shut out of the education system from the electoral  process. We know that poll taxes kept poor people from casting a  ballot. And we know that barriers to voting still exist today.   We have seen people from majority Black districts wait in line for  double the amount of time as their neighboring white districts. We have  seen eligible voters turned away because of inaccurate voting roll  purges. From gerrymandering, to archaic voter ID laws, to limiting  voter registration, discriminatory efforts still exist that harm our  democracy and deprive Americans of a government that represents them.  In my view, voting should be a simple process. We should be passing  laws to make it easier to vote, not harder.   First and foremost, we must reinstate the Voting Rights Act. We need  to make election day a national holiday so that more people are able to  get to the polls without losing time or wages from work. We need to  expand automatic voter registration, early voting and vote-by-mail  capabilities. We need to address voter suppression head on. And we must  overturn the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision and reform  campaign finance laws to prevent large corporations and billionaires  from having an outsized voice in the electoral process.   Today in honor of the centennial of the 19th Amendment, I call on  Americans to pursue equity with the same vigor as the suffragists.  Question rules and laws that obstruct political participation. Speak  out against injustices. And continue to fight for policies that center  our Nation's political process on ``we the people.''                            ____________________
