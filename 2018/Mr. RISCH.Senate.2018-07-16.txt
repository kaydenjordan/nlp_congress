 Mr. President, I ask that the Senate now proceed to  Executive Calendar No. 601, as under the previous order.    Mr. President, as you may know, I enthusiastically  supported the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that passed the Senate and was  signed into law 6 months ago. Over the past 6 months, the law's  positive impact on our country's economy has not gone unnoticed.  Companies, both large and small, are distributing bonuses, raising  wages, and investing in their businesses. While many observers  recognize the positive ways in which the law is increasing economic  confidence and lowering rates for individual taxpayers, the benefits to  small businesses are sometimes overlooked. As chairman of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I strongly supported  the tax law because I believed it would reduce taxes for small  businesses responsible for employing millions of Americans, allowing  small business owners to invest in their businesses and increase  economic growth. I recently began this series of speeches to bring  attention to the benefits this law provides for small businesses.   While many reports over the past 6 months focus on the new tax law's  impact on large corporations, I rise today to bring attention to how  tax reform is benefiting HBM Technology Partners, a small business in  Reno, NV. HEM Technology Partners provides computer hardware,  information technology systems, and computer services  [[Page S4964]]  to businesses throughout the Reno area. HBM Technology Partners,  incorporated by Harry Foote in 1929 as Harry's Business Machines,  originally sold typewriters and various office supplies. After  weathering the hard years of the Great Depression and World War II,  Harry's son, Gordon, became active in the business after returning from  serving our country in the Armed Forces. In the early 1980s Gordon's  son, Gary, continued the family tradition of working in the business,  and the company began selling electronics, computers, and printers.  During this time, the company also started providing specialty plastic- card printing machines to customers in the gaming industry and  servicing Hewlett-Packard products. The company now sells several  different types of computer hardware and software, cybersecurity  products, data backup systems, and specialty printers. I commend HBM  Technologies for their ability to continually evolve to meet their  customers' needs and adapt as new technologies are introduced.   Because of last year's tax law, this third generation family-owned  small business recently distributed bonuses to its seven employees.  These bonuses allow the workforce at HBM Technologies to have more  financial freedom to provide for their families. Stories like this  exist all over the country. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act opens the door  for small businesses to invest in their businesses, hire new workers,  and increase wages. Additionally, the new law increases small  businesses' confidence and allows them to reward their longtime  employees, while also lowering small businesses' taxes and encouraging  new capital investment. I congratulate HBM technologies on their hard  work and look forward to watching their continued success.                            ____________________
