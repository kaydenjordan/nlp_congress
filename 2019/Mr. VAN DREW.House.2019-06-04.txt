 Mr. Speaker, last Wednesday, the south Jersey  Cumberland County College baseball team beat their rivals 11-7, winning  the National Junior College Athletic Association Division 3 World  Series championship. This achievement is the first national  championship win in any sport in Cumberland County in south Jersey.   The team's coach, Keith Gorman, attributed their success to their  impressive pitching staff and tough defense.   He also pointed to the importance of their values. Not only does the  Cumberland County baseball team value toughness, but they also focus on  selflessness. The diversity of Cumberland County has been represented  in their team and has contributed to their success.   Baseball is incredibly important to the community of Cumberland  County, and its college team reflects the values that the south Jersey  community holds: selflessness and togetherness.   I am very proud of the hard work of these young men and wish them  luck in the future.                            ____________________
