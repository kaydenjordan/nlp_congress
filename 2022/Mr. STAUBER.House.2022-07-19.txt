 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment I  introduced, which increases the Circuit Rider program. The modest  increase of $418,000, offset entirely, means cleaner water for rural  America.                                time  1515    Circuit riders travel from facility to facility across our small  towns, lending expertise and technical assistance because each  individual locality does not have the money to pay for their own. Many  treatment facilities in rural America have a dozen or less employees,  and these circuit riders save money for local budgets and taxpayers.   According to the National Rural Water Association, this minor  increase allows for about 90 more circuit riders. That is 90 more  experts traveling across rural America and rural Minnesota, lending  their invaluable knowledge to our rural water treatment facilities.   In an industry losing expertise to retirement or other jobs, this  funding can also be used to keep these mission-critical positions  competitive.   Finally, this amendment brings funding for the Circuit Rider Program  in line with a request I led along with 50 other bipartisan Members of  Congress.   Let's allow rural America to have clean, sanitary water, free up  local budgets, and ensure our rural operators get the technical  assistance they so desperately need.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of my amendment.
