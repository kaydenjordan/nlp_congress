 Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Carter, who is a  colleague, a friend, and a neighbor, and who also has genuine expertise  on this subject.   The administration recently published two rules that tackle the  issues faced by both our Medicare beneficiaries and the pharmacies that  serve them.   One rule in particular, the ``Modernizing Part D and Medicare  Advantage to Lower Drug Prices and Reduce Out-of-Pocket Expenses''  rule, addresses pharmacy direct and indirect remuneration fee reform by  instituting that DIR fees will be negotiated at the point of sale  instead of the underhanded and retroactive fashion by which the plans  and PBMs currently operate.   Currently, pharmacies can face these clawback fees after they have  already filled and sold a prescription for Medicare part D and Medicare  Advantage patients.   DIR fees have become a catchall category for pharmacy benefit  managers to collect more overhead after prescriptions are sold.   Pharmacies are often unaware of what they will owe, and the standards  for these fees can be impossible to meet. As a result, many independent  pharmacies in my district are forced to provide the drugs at below  cost.   Imagine that for just a moment. DIR fees are causing pharmacies to  operate in the red, all while they are providing lifesaving medication  to America's seniors.   DIR fees have also led to drastic increases in out-of-pocket costs  for our patients, which, in turn, forces seniors into the doughnut hole  of Medicare part D even sooner.   To protect seniors and pharmacists in my district, and as a medical  professional, I urge CMS to finalize the language included in the rule  that reflects the negotiated price at the point of sale.
