 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the Senate will be going home this week  for the Fourth of July recess, and most of us will be back in our homes  with our families and in our hometowns and  [[Page S3808]]  moving around. I still think the topic of conversation is going to be  healthcare.   I think this conversation and debate in Washington has really touched  a lot of families and businesses and individuals across this country.  The reason I say that is because about 6 years ago, I voted for the  Affordable Care Act, what is known as ObamaCare. For the longest time,  I was sure it was the right vote, and I am still sure today, but I  wondered why people didn't appreciate it because what we tried to do-- and we achieved some success--was to provide health insurance for a lot  of people in America who didn't have it. In my State of Illinois, we  cut the percentage of uninsured people in half because of the  Affordable Care Act. A large number of them are now covered by  Medicaid, and a large number are able to buy health insurance through  private insurance exchanges.   But for the longest time, when we asked people across America ``What  about ObamaCare? What about the Affordable Care Act?'' we got mixed  reviews. Less than a majority supported it.   Then we embarked on this conversation, this debate in Washington in  the Senate over the last 6 months, and an interesting thing happened.  When the Republicans, who are in the majority in the Senate and the  House, who were determined to repeal ObamaCare, set out to do it, they  found out it was a big, heavy lift.   So now, today, we have an interesting thing that has happened. For  the first time in the last several weeks, a majority of the American  people support the Affordable Care Act. All of those years after we  passed it, when we were talking about the good things it did, people  were skeptical, but when the notion of repealing it came up, people  started saying: Well, what would I lose if you repealed it? And when  they thought about what they would lose, they decided those things were  valuable to them personally and to their families. And what were those  things? Some pretty basic things--first, that you would have access to  health insurance.   I have repeatedly told the story of my friend Judy. Judy is in  hospitality. She works in a motel down in Southern Illinois that I have  stayed in from time to time. She is a sweetheart of a lady. She is 62  years old and has had jobs that don't pay a lot of money, but she goes  to work every day--there is not a lazy bone in her body. She is 62  years old, and Judy had never had health insurance in her life until we  passed the Affordable Care Act. Now she qualifies for Medicaid, and  thank goodness she does because she has been diagnosed with diabetes,  and she needs a good doctor she can count on, and she needs good  medical advice.   So when we said that we were passing the Affordable Care Act so that  more people would have access to health insurance, it happened.   We also said we were going to change the health insurance policies  you buy so that you don't get tricked into buying something that is  going to provide protection but only enough and not enough when you  really need it.   For example, there used to be lifetime limits. People would buy  health insurance and say: I am going to keep the premium low. I will  sign up for a lifetime limit. How could I ever need health insurance  for more than $100,000 a year?   Well, it is an eye-opener, but there are many diagnoses or accidents  that could happen to you next week that would cost more than $100,000.  So a lot of people found themselves facing personal bankruptcy because  they had a limit on their health insurance policy and faced a cancer  diagnosis and knew they would have to spend $150,000 or $200,000 for  the most basic care.   We also said: When you sell health insurance, you can't discriminate  against people because of a preexisting condition.   Well, it turned out that insurance companies defined ``preexisting  condition'' to include everything, such as acne when you were a  teenager or asthma--you name it. In fact, they went so far as to say  that being a woman was a preexisting condition. Some of those things  made no sense, so we said: That is over. We are not going to let that  happen anymore.   One out of three Americans has a preexisting condition. You can't  discriminate against a person because they are of a family with a child  who has survived diabetes or is living with diabetes or a spouse who  survived cancer surgery. So we said that from now on, under the  Affordable Care Act, when you buy a health insurance policy, it is  going to cover the basics.   We did something else that I want to mention because I don't want it  overlooked. There used to be a Senator who sat back here in the last  row, in the second seat, named Paul Wellstone of Minnesota. Paul  Wellstone was a great guy. You couldn't help but love him whatever your  politics. Over here was Pete Domenici, and he was a conservative  Republican Senator from New Mexico. Wellstone from Minnesota, Domenici  from New Mexico--what would those two have in common? What they had in  common was that each of them had someone in their family with a mental  illness, and they watched what happened to their loved one in their  family. The two teamed up and said: From this point forward, when you  buy health insurance in America, it is not going to be just physical  health that it is going to cover, it is going to cover mental health as  well.   So many families are touched by mental illness, some very serious  forms, some not so serious but need medical help, and they all should  be covered. So they put that provision in the Affordable Care Act so  that now, when you buy a health insurance policy in America, it is not  hit or miss; it covers mental illness, as it should.   Then they added a provision that most of us didn't pay attention to,  and we should, and we do now: mental illness and substance abuse  treatment. Think of this opioid and heroin epidemic and the people who  are dying right and left. Think of families who are absolutely consumed  by the addiction of a child, of a teenager, wondering if they can get  them into treatment so they can save their lives. For many of them,  that health insurance plan is paying for that treatment--treatment that  otherwise would come out of their pocket if they could afford it.   So we put all of these things into the law, and the law took place,  and when the Republicans said they were going to repeal it, people  stood up and said: Wait a minute. I have to face lifetime limits again?  I have to face preexisting condition prejudice again? I am not going to  have mental illness covered automatically or maternity care covered  automatically?   Well, when people reflected on this, they realized their  vulnerability. So simple repeal was not enough; the Republicans needed  to replace. If they were going to eliminate ObamaCare and all the  people protected by it, they needed to replace, and that is when the  process fell apart. In the House of Representatives, they went through  a process of writing the replacement. When it was all over, they didn't  wait for the Congressional Budget Office to analyze it because they  knew what was coming. The Congressional Budget Office announced that  some 23 or 24 million Americans would lose their health insurance  because of the plan that passed the House of Representatives. They also  knew that people could again face discrimination based on preexisting  conditions. They knew basic health insurance didn't include the  protections all of us really need to count on.    Do you remember the provision in the Affordable Care Act that said  your son or daughter could stay on your family health insurance plan  until you reached the age of 26? It is pretty valuable, isn't it? That  son or daughter, whom you like a lot and helped get through college,  doing internships and looking for a job--you wanted to make sure they  have health insurance, didn't you? That was part of the Affordable Care  Act, and we want to make sure the guarantee remains in any future  change of the law too.   The House of Representatives passed their measure, and,  unfortunately, it was a partisan roll call; only Republicans voted for  it. It passed by four votes. If two Republican Congressmen had changed  their votes, it would not have passed.   Then the measure came over to the Senate, as we remember from our  civics lessons, and the Senate had its chance. So what happened? We had  a chance to take this question to the committees of the U.S. Senate-- Labor  [[Page S3809]]  and the Health and Education Committee, which is chaired by Senator  Lamar Alexander, a friend of mine, Republican of Tennessee, and the  ranking member, Senator Patty Murray of Washington. We had a chance to  take the bill to the committee and to debate a better approach in the  Senate, to have public hearings and witnesses. But we didn't do that.   Instead, the Republican majority said: We are going to do this on our  own. We don't need any Democratic input. Thirteen Republican Senators  will meet in a room and write the alternative to the House healthcare  replacement bill, and they did. It went on for weeks, and no one saw  it. There were no reports of what it included and what was inside of  it. Then, 6 days ago--6 days ago--it was announced. We took a look at  it, and it wasn't that much different from what the House had done.   The Congressional Budget Office released a report on Monday of this  week and said that 22 million Americans would lose their health  insurance under the Republican healthcare plan--22 million. And--this  part was really troubling--there would be a dramatic increase in  premium costs for people between the ages of 50 and 64. Some of them  would see increases of up to $8,400 a year in premium costs because of  the Senate Republican plan.   What was the reaction of the medical professionals across my State to  both the House Republican plan and the Senate Republican plan? It was  the same reaction. They said: Senator, vote against it.   The Illinois Hospital Association said that if we cut back on  Medicaid, hospitals--particularly rural hospitals and downstate  hospitals--will have to cut back in services and may face closure.   The doctors in my State, the Illinois State Medical Society, came  forward and said: Vote against the Senate Republican plan and the House  Republican plan because we know what happens when people lose health  insurance. They still get sick. They don't come to see us early on when  we can prevent things from getting worse; they come to see us when  things are pretty bad and pretty expensive and pretty dangerous.   So the doctors opposed it, the nurses opposed it, the pediatricians  opposed it. Not one single medical advocacy group in Illinois supported  the Republican bill, which was unveiled 6 days ago.   When it came to preexisting conditions, it wasn't just the medical  groups that opposed the Senate bill. The cancer society, the heart  association, the lung association--most of the major disease groups  stepped up and said: The preexisting condition provisions in this bill  are unacceptable, and, sadly, the policies that are going to be sold  may not cover the basics that people absolutely need.   Then the other thing came out. What drove this whole debate, what  started healthcare reform in the House of Representatives and in the  Senate was not healthcare reform, but a tax cut. You see, the  Affordable Care Act imposed new taxes, particularly on higher income  individuals, and the money from those taxes went into sponsoring people  into Medicaid and helping people pay their health insurance premiums.  The Republicans in both the House and the Senate said: The first thing  we will do is cut those taxes--about $700 billion worth of taxes.  Ultimately, they took $1.1 trillion out of our healthcare system with  this tax cut and other cuts. When you pull that kind of money out of  healthcare in America, fewer people have health insurance, fewer people  have a helping hand when it comes to paying their premiums.   The reaction to the Senate Republican bill over the last 6 days has  been growing opposition--growing opposition, until yesterday. Senator  McConnell announced: We are not going to vote on it this week. We were  supposed to, but we are not going to vote on it this week. He said that  he may return to it when we come back from the July 4th recess.   Here is the point I wanted to make on the floor today. I am glad we  have reached the point that these proposals from the House and the  Senate are not going to move forward quickly to become the law of the  land. Too many people would be hurt--too many innocent people. Too many  families would lose their health insurance. The cost of health  insurance would go up dramatically. The premiums would go up,  particularly for people over the age of 50. We would see hospitals  facing closure across our States. We would see cutbacks in treatment  for mental illness and substance abuse. The list goes on and on. It  would have been a terrible outcome, and certainly doing this in order  to give a tax cut to the wealthy people of this country makes no sense.    Incidentally, how much is the tax cut? If your annual income is $1  million a year, under the Republican plan, your tax cut is over $50,000  a year. The people who are wealthy aren't asking me for that tax cut,  and the people who will suffer because of it are folks who aren't  making anywhere near $1 million a year.   Here is what we need to acknowledge: The current healthcare system in  America needs to be improved. There are things in the Affordable Care  Act that need to be addressed, and we need to do it in an honest  fashion, and we need to do it on a bipartisan basis.   I have talked to some Republican Senators. Senator McConnell has  pulled this bill back, and they want to sit down and talk.   Senator McConnell said that there will be no conversations with  Democrats; Republicans will do it by themselves. I hope over the Fourth  of July he reflects on that because there are Democratic Senators who,  in good faith, want to sit down and make a better healthcare system for  America so that more people have the peace of mind and security of  health insurance and so that it is more affordable for families all  across the board.   The biggest, toughest part of healthcare today is the so-called  individual health insurance market; 5 or 6 percent of people who need  to buy health insurance plans don't have it where they work, and they  don't qualify for Medicaid. Those are the ones who are seeing their  premiums spike. Can't we take the collective wisdom of Senators-- Democrats and Republicans--and sit down and address that problem  effectively? Of course we can, but we need to have a starting point.   So my plea to the Republican leadership is to listen carefully, as  our Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, said yesterday. Once you take  repeal off the table, once you take this massive tax cut for the  wealthy off the table, we are ready to pull up a chair and sit down at  the table.   Wouldn't it be a breath of fresh air in America in this day and age,  in light of all that is going on, if Democrats and Republicans worked  constructively together to make the healthcare system better, more  affordable, and stronger for families and businesses across our Nation?  I think that is why we were sent here. I think that is the reason we  are supposed to be here, and I sincerely hope that happens next.   So we are ending the debate in the Senate this week, but we are not  ending the debate in America. I urge those who think this is an  important issue, and I am one of them, to speak up and to go home--I am  going home soon--and to meet with people and have a conversation about  where we go next as a nation. We can solve this problem, and I know we  can do it in a constructive way.   If we show that kind of bipartisan leadership in the Senate, I think  the House will join us. I think they will do the same thing. I think  they can have a bipartisan approach too. What a relief it would be,  with all of the breakdown in comity, all of the breakdown in  communications politically, the warring camps that have become the  American political scene. If we can show why there is a Senate and why  there is a House and why people run for these offices--it is to solve  problems, not to put out a press release, not to stake out a political  position, but to solve a problem. This is a problem that needs solving.   I hope that over the next week, both parties will reflect on it, and  when we return after the Fourth of July recess, we can roll up our  sleeves and go to work.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
