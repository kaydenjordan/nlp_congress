 Mr. President, today I want to recognize and honor a  quintessential Oregonian and legendary figure in our State's media  circles, Patsy Smullin.  [[Page S5491]]    On September 12, Patsy earned well-deserved honors from the National  Association of Broadcasters for her long-time leadership as president  and owner of California Oregon Broadcasting, Inc., COBi.   As association president and our former Senate colleague Gordon Smith  put it in presenting Patsy with its Chuck Sherman Television Leadership  Award for local TV in medium and smaller markets, ``Patsy's passion for  excellence in small market local television is unmatched. She  exemplifies the best of broadcasting by running the longest  continuously-owned and operated, independent broadcast organization in  the West.''   Like former Senator Smith and countless elected officials throughout  our State, I have come to know Patsy from regular visits to southern  Oregon for townhalls, community meetings, and more.   When I visit TV station KOBI in Medford, I can always count on a  wide-ranging and thought-provoking set of questions from her station's  journalists, and of course, that steadfast commitment to serious and  fair journalism starts at the top with Patsy.   As the son of a journalist, I very much appreciate her unshakable  dedication to independent journalism that continues in the very best  tradition of both her profession and in the legacy established back in  1933 by California Oregon Broadcasting, Inc.   As a Senator, I appreciate in equal measure her rock-solid devotion  to local journalism that serves viewers so well in all of southern  Oregon.   In Patsy's remarks accepting her award, she noted that ``Television  in medium and smaller markets is a business where the hours are often  long, the pressure to get it right is heavy, and the monetary  compensation is not equal to the responsibilities.''   Then with classic Patsy modesty, she added, ``I have been very  fortunate throughout my career to be surrounded by individuals who  might not make a lot of money, but who make a positive difference in  their community each and every day and love their work.''   I will conclude my remarks by saying all of southern Oregon is  incredibly fortunate that Patsy has set the bar high both for working  long hours and love of her profession to make a positive difference in  her community each and every day.                            ____________________
