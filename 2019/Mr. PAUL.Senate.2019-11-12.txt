 Madam President, I want to recognize the accomplishments of  SSgt Daniel P. Keller for his heroic actions while in combat in  Afghanistan. On 16 August 2017, while assigned as a joint terminal  attack controller for Combined Joint Special Operations Air Component  Afghanistan, Staff Sergeant Keller performed his duty to his country  and his teammates with fierce determination and unquestionable courage.   While on a mission, his assault force struck an improvised explosive  device and came under heavy fire from the enemy. Despite being wounded,  Staff Sergeant Keller used his most potent weapon, the ability to call  in airpower, to strike enemy positions while simultaneously returning  fire with his personal weapon. Most admirably, Staff Sergeant Keller  took direct action to ensure the successful evacuation of 13 critically  wounded casualties while under continuous enemy fire. Upon saving his  wounded comrades, Staff Sergeant Keller continued to engage the enemy  and guaranteed follow-on forces were well prepared to continue the  fight.   For his valiant service, Staff Sergeant Keller received the Air Force  Cross, our Nation's second highest medal for combat valor. His citation  for this award stated that ``his personal courage, quick actions and  tactical expertise whilst under fire directly contributed to the  survival of the 130 members of his assault force, including 31 wounded  in action.''   I would like to offer my most profound appreciation to Staff Sergeant  Keller for his willingness to go above and beyond the call of duty to  ensure his mission while saving American lives. His courage and  dedication should serve as an example to us all and remind us of our  solemn duty to the men and women who volunteer to defend our great  Nation.                            ____________________
