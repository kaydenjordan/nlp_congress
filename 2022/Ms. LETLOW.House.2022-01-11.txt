 Madam Speaker, I rise to oppose the previous question so  we can immediately consider H.R. 682, the Reopen Schools Act. I believe  that this legislation is critical for our students, to ensure success  in the current school year, and also address the learning gap that has  arisen during this pandemic.   As parents, we know that education is the most essential cornerstone  in the foundation of our children's future. Throughout the past year I  have heard from countless parents who had to put their lives on hold to  assume the role of teacher in their child's virtual classroom, while  other family priorities, including returning to work, took a backseat.   As a former educator myself, I know how crucial classroom discussion  is to the learning process. The statistics clearly show that students  learn better when they are able to participate in person and interact  with their peers and teachers, and not reduced to just a face on a  screen.   I also want to note that in rural areas such as my district,  successful virtual learning is nearly impossible because of the lack of  access to broadband internet. In my home State of Louisiana, our  standardized tests show that the number of students in grades 3 through  8 who achieved the State's proficiency goals fell by nearly 5 percent  during the pandemic.   Over the past 2 years, Congress has appropriated billions of dollars  so schools can take the necessary steps to reopen safely. I want to be  clear: We are not asking schools to put either students or teachers  into unsafe environments. We did not send States and districts that  funding for them to simply shut their doors again.   Madam Speaker, it is absolutely critical for us to move forward on  this legislation to ensure that American students can continue to learn  in safe, face-to-face classrooms across this country.
