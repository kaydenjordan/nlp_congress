 Madam Speaker, the Democrat leadership in  this House, hell-bent on impeachment, is trampling on precedent,  fairness, and our system of representative democracy.   We are in the midst of a so-called impeachment inquiry despite no  vote ever having been held on the House floor, as was the case for  Nixon and Clinton.   I guess the majority has no concern for what the people of Tennessee  have to say. It is as if they are saying: Hey, you guys in Tennessee,  we are going to proceed with something as grave as impeaching the  President of the United States, and, oh, by the way, you don't get a  say.   This is an insult to democracy.   This House--supposedly, the people's House--cannot pass a single law  without a vote. We are a legislative body, and we speak after a vote is  taken. Failing to do so allows unchecked factions to control the  direction of the entire legislative branch. The Founders never intended  it as such. In fact, this is the very definition of tyranny.   The people of Tennessee deserve to be heard, and the people of  America deserve to be heard on this issue. We need to stop this charade  now and hold a vote.                            ____________________
