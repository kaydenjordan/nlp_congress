 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Arizona, my  good friend, for yielding time. And frankly, I want to associate myself  with her remarks about the underlying legislation.   My remarks, Madam Speaker, will focus on the manner in which the  bills that are before us are being brought to the floor.   It is, frankly, very disappointing to me, Madam Speaker, that this  even needs to be said. But given the grave consequences of what the  majority is proposing to do procedurally, I cannot condemn today's rule  strongly enough.   In today's measure, what the majority is proposing amounts to a de  facto change to the House rules, one that will trample on the rights of  the minority and deny any opportunity to amend the bill on the floor.   Rather than bringing up the two immigration items as the standalone  bills that they actually are, the majority has instead chosen the  procedural gimmick of using a Senate-amended House bill to package  these items together. This has the same effect of denying the minority  the more than 100-year-old right to make a motion to recommit, or MTR,  as they are commonly known, before moving to final passage.   This is because, under House rules, the minority is not allowed to  offer an MTR on any House measures that have been amended by the  Senate. Of course, for the majority, the denial of the minority's  traditional rights to an MTR is the whole point of this procedural  exercise. These underhanded procedural shenanigans are specifically  intended to deny the minority the right to an MTR on these bills.   Before my friend, the chairman, responds with the number of times a  Republican majority used this procedure, let me be perfectly clear. As  he knows, we never, never did that as a means to deny the minority an  MTR. In fact, we did it in consultation with the minority and with the  sole goal of accelerating passage of key bipartisan legislation in the  Senate.   So, why does the Democratic majority insist on these procedural  gymnastics? I can think of only one reason: The majority is embarrassed  that the minority has now passed an MTR six times in this Congress,  including one just last week.   Madam Speaker, this is now the second time in the past 6 weeks that  the majority is explicitly adopting a procedure to deny the minority  our rights.                                time  1245    I think that if the majority is really so frightened of the motion to  recommit and they really want to do away with MTRs, then they should  change the standing rules of the House, and that needs to happen on a  vote on the House floor so that everyone can see what the majority is  actually doing and how it operates.   When Republicans were in the majority, the thought of limiting the  use of the MTR to silence minority voices never once crossed our minds,  and that is because we recognized the importance of the MTR to this  institution. It has been around since the very beginning of the  institution, and it has been in its present form since 1909.   In fact, in 1919, Representative Abraham Garrett of Tennessee was  quoted as saying: ``The motion to recommit is regarded as so sacred it  is one of the few things protected against the Committee on Rules by  the general rules of the House.''   Evidently, not anymore.   The present majority is not content with that state of affairs, which  is why they are trying, once again, to do an end run around the House  rules and adopt a procedural gimmick specifically to stop the minority  from exercising its right to an MTR. It is beyond disappointing, Madam  Speaker.   It is shocking that the majority would feel the need to rig the  entire system to shut us up. My goodness, they have a 35-seat majority.  But we all know why that is. It is because the majority cannot  effectively defend its own policies.    So, today, Madam Speaker, I call on all Members to vote  ``no'' on this rule. I ask that my colleagues, regardless of party,  reject this rigged process, reject this rule, and act to protect the  rights of every Member of this Chamber. The future of the institution  depends on it.
