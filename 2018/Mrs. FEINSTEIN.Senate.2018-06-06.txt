 Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the  Contra Costa Transfer Act, a bill that will assure the health and  safety of the residents of Contra Costa County while also providing for  the efficient delivery of water from the Bay Delta to the customers of  the Contra Costa Water District (CCWD). Senator Harris is joining me in  cosponsoring the bill, and I understand that Representatives Mark  DeSaulnier, Jerry McNerney and Mike Thompson will be introducing a  House companion measure this week as well.   The CCWD is an urban water agency serving approximately 500,000  people in the eastern part of the San Francisco Bay Area region in  Northern California. CCWD operates and maintains the Contra Costa Canal  System, a unit of the Central Valley Project (CVP),  [[Page S3037]]  which is owned by the United States and managed by the Bureau of  Reclamation in the Department of the Interior.   The Contra Costa Canal System involves 48 miles of earthen canals  with about 30 miles of laterals which deliver water to cities from the  canal. Although the canal has been maintained, it poses a safety and  flood risk. Notwithstanding significant security fencing, 81 people  have tragically been drowned since the canal was placed into service  and hundreds of others have been rescued.   The bill I am introducing today would transfer title to the canal  system to CCWD so it can begin the process of replacing this old,  earthen canal with a secure buried pipeline. The conversion of the  canal to a pipeline will cost CCWD approximately $650 million.   CCWD has already repaid Reclamation for costs of constructing the  project. After title transfer of the canal is completed, CCWD would  remain a CVP M&I customer as set forth in the Long-term Renewal  Contract between the United States and CCWD providing for Project Water  Service and for Facilities Repayment (Contract No. I75r-3401 A-LTR1 May  10, 2005) (CVP Contract). This title transfer bill was anticipated in  Article 28.3 of the CVP Contract which allows for transfer of title to  the Contra Costa Canal System upon repayment of all outstanding  capitalized costs of the facilities and upon authorization of Congress.   Before title transfer occurs, there will be further environmental  review, including compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act  (NEPA), Endangered Species Act (ESA) and National Historical  Preservation Act (NHPA).   Title Transfer will result in lower costs and reduced administrative  burden, provide greater flexibility in management of the asset, and  will eliminate flood and other safety concerns. When the canal was  originally built, there was no one around it. Now there are many homes  and neighborhood along both sides of the structure. If the canal were  to fail as has occurred with other earthen canals, homes would be  flooded, and millions of dollars of property would be destroyed.   Title transfer would transfer this health and safety liability for  the canal to CCWD. Reclamation also benefits through lower costs and  reduced administrative burden. Currently, work on the Canal System  requires varying levels of coordination and documentation with  Reclamation for planning, design, project implementation, maintenance,  and operation.   CCWD has been responsible for O&M of the Canal System for almost 50  years and its staff is intimately familiar with the system. CCWD  ownership of the Canal System would eliminate much of this duplicative  consultation. CCWD now finds it is doing much of the same work  Reclamation conducts in its oversight and review responsibilities.  Third parties including local cities, Contra Costa County, local and  regional agencies, including recreation partners, and utilities working  within the Canal System rights-of-way all of whom would also benefit  from removing the additional layer of federal review and approval  bureaucracy that increases costs and causes schedule delays. I  understand that the other local partners have all expressed support for  this legislation.    Title Transfer to CCWD would also relieve the United States of any  risk of canal failure due to erosion or earthquake.   Ultimately, CCWD is seeking authorization to transfer title to all  Project Works associated with the Contra Costa Canal Unit. Construction  of the Rock Slough Fish Screen was completed by the Bureau of  Reclamation in 2011, and the bill I am introducing today would direct  the transfer of title of Rock Slough Fish Screen following a mutual  agreement on the transfer between CCWD and Reclamation.   Contra Costa Water District (CCWD) operates three screened intakes in  the Sacramento/San Joaquin Delta--Rock Slough, Old River and Middle  River. CCWD owns the latter two; the US Bureau of Reclamation owns Rock  Slough. Operations at all three intakes are covered by the biological  opinions on the long-term operation of the Central Valley Project and  the State Water Project (USFWS 2008 and NMFS 2009) as well as separate  opinions obtained for the original Los Vaqueros Project and the Middle  River Intake under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act.   The Central Valley Project Improvement Act (1992) and the Los  Vaqueros Project Biological Opinions (BOs) required the Rock Slough  intake to be screened. BOs from USFWS and NMFS were obtained for  construction and operation of the fish screen. A transfer of ownership  of the Rock Slough intake and fish screen will not affect the  applicability of the various biological opinions that apply to the  facility.   The primary stakeholders involve recreation and include the East Bay  Regional Park District (EBRPD), City of Antioch, and City of Walnut  Creek. EBRPD operates recreation facilities along the Contra Costa  Canal (trails) and at the Contra Loma Reservoir.   CCWD and EBRPD executed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in  December 2017 that commits both agencies to work together to obtain  authorization from Congress for title transfer of the Project Works to  CCWD.   The City of Antioch and Walnut Creek operate a Sports Complex and  trails, respectively, under management agreements with Reclamation. The  management agreements would be amended and assigned to CCWD, and CCWD  will provide for the continuation of recreation at these facilities by  the cities.   The City of Concord and the EBRPD have expressed interest in the  Clayton Canal. The Clayton Canal traverses the former Concord Naval  Weapons Station which is being developed to support civilian uses by  the City of Concord. EBRPD is also developing a regional park and  conservation area within the former Naval Station property. The Clayton  Canal is no longer used by CCWD and title transfer would support the  efficient disposal of the facility.   In summary, Mr. President, I believe title transfer is a sensible  measure that will reduce flood and public safety risk by facilitating  the conversion of the current earthen canal to a closed pipeline. Title  transfer will also improve administrative efficiencies on the operation  of the canal, and reduce the administrative burden on the federal  government.   I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill. Thank you,  Mr. President, and I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the  Contra Costa Transfer Act, a bill that will assure the health and  safety of the residents of Contra Costa County while also providing for  the efficient delivery of water from the Bay Delta to the customers of  the Contra Costa Water District (CCWD).
