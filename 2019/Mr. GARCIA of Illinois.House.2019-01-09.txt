 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Quigley for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, the Trump shutdown is harmful and irresponsible.   On the first day of this new Congress, House Democrats sent  legislation to open up the government. I supported it, and I will  continue to support this legislation to open up parts of the government  immediately.   Each day the Republican shutdown continues, hardworking Americans and  families suffer. Right now, the IRS is operating with only 12 percent  of its workforce, threatening the agency's ability to process and  disburse tax refunds in a timely manner.   That is why today I am sending a letter to President Trump with the  support of my colleague, Representative Lloyd Doggett of Texas, and  over 50 Members of Congress, urging him to end the shutdown and warning  him of the effects that that shutdown is having on families.   Just yesterday, The Washington Post noted that students reliant on  Federal financial aid for college are facing trouble providing the  Department of Education verification of their income because of  furloughs at the IRS. I represent many immigrant and working-class  families who rely on their annual tax refund to feed their families,  pay for their children's education, and buy their gas to get to work.   Mr. Speaker, families are suffering, and I urge my colleagues to  support this legislation and reopen the government.
