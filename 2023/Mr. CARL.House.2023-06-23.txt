 Mr. Speaker, I will take just a moment to thank David  Bullock, my pastor, my friend. I sometimes refer to him as a son.   I have known David most all of his life. We grew up in church  together. His beautiful family is here in the gallery with us. I am  sure you probably can't see them there, but David has come a long way  from our old roots in Cottage Hill Baptist Church.   When I say ``roots,'' we are roots. We are family. We all grew up  under the ministry of Dr. Fred Wolfe. I gave a speech on brother Fred  here a short time ago.   David is the next legacy. He is the next step in the vision of God  for our church and for our Nation. It is men like David and women like  David's wife, Leslie, and his children that make this country such a  special place.   We get on the floor and argue issues down here while we have prayer  warriors that are at home praying for us--all of us, not just for my  side of the aisle, but for all sides of the aisle.   I want to take just a moment to say thank you to the Bullocks and  thank you to David for coming and speaking today, and may God bless  this assembly.                            ____________________
