 Mr. President, I am glad today to stand with my  colleague to support S.J. Res. 4, affirming the validity of the Equal  Rights Amendment.   We have heard from Senator Cardin and Senator Murkowski why it is so  important for Congress to pass this resolution and enshrine protections  against sex-based discrimination in our Constitution.   The ERA would bolster efforts to ensure equality in the fields of  workforce and pay, pregnancy discrimination, sexual harassment and  violence, reproductive autonomy, and protections for LGBTQ individuals.   Although we have indeed made strides in each of these areas, we know  how fragile these gains can be without the durability of a  constitutional amendment.   Take, for example, the current Supreme Court's approach to the  Constitution. As the Dobbs decision makes clear, a majority of the  current Court believes that the meaning of equality under the equal  protection clause was frozen in 1868 when the 14th Amendment was  ratified.   Well, in the hundred years after 1868, the Supreme Court has adopted  and permitted all sorts of State laws that excluded women from jury  service, that excluded women from admission to the bar as lawyers, that  excluded women even from employment as bartenders, and allowed all of  those laws under the 14th Amendment. This business now of the Supreme  Court, looking back at history and tradition, is a backward look to bad  history and regrettable tradition.   So with the Supreme Court, it is particularly important that we not  rely on its interpretation of the 14th Amendment alone to guarantee  equal rights. Congress needs to stand up and act, and we have the power  to do so.   Congress has broad authority over the amendment process. If Congress  has the power to impose a time limit, Congress has the power to extend  or remove that time limit.   I join my colleagues to urge swift passage of this resolution. As one  witness at the Senate Judiciary Committee on the ERA eloquently put it,  gender equality is not a zero-sum game, and ``we are all uplifted when  everyone's rights are protected.''   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I am back now for the 288th time  with my trusty, battered ``Time to Wake Up'' poster to call attention  to the climate crisis.   Over the 10-plus years that I have been doing these speeches, I have  shown how climate change affects our ecosystems, industries, economy,  public health, kids, workers, our elderly. I have even conducted a  science experiment right here on the Senate floor, to the dismay of the  Senate staff.   One near constant in these speeches has been the oily, often covert  hand of the fossil fuel industry lurking behind the opposition to  climate action through its campaign of climate denial, delay, and  obstruction.   From the late 1980s, when Congress first became aware of climate  change, through the period after the 2010 Citizens United decision when  special interests could anonymously pour unlimited money into  elections, the fossil fuel industry has blocked every serious climate  bill in Congress until the Inflation Reduction Act.   Key to this obstruction was the strategic insight that they only  needed to capture one political party to strangle legislative action.  So the fossil fuel industry captured the Republican Party and has  prevented climate action for over three decades, except when we were  able to use the extraordinary process of reconciliation. That was just  last year.   Democrats had control of the House and Senate and passed the  Inflation Reduction Act via budget reconciliation. Congress finally  acted on climate.   There is lots more that Congress still needs to do on climate, but  the IRA was a big, meaningful bill that powered up tax incentives for  clean energy and put a price on oil and gas methane emissions.   In the 10-plus years I have been documenting the fossil fuel  industry's hold over the Republican Party, I have provided lots of  concrete examples, from election spending to phony front groups by the  flotilla, to polluter lackeys installed at the Trump EPA. But nothing  tops the debt limit proposal Speaker McCarthy released last week, the  ``Default on America Act,'' which the House just passed.   MAGA House Republicans like to claim to care about debt and  deficits--except, of course, in 2017, when they passed massive tax cuts  for the wealthy and large corporations that added trillions to the debt  and except when the debt increased by more than $7 trillion under  President Trump.   They are a fountain of fiscal hypocrisy. So no surprise that the  McCarthy package has little to do with reducing debt and deficits and  everything to do with providing goodies to big Republican donors, in  particular the fossil fuel industry.   Before I get into all the oily, corrupt deals for big polluters, a  few words about the rest of the proposal. McCarthy calling this  monstrosity the Limit, Save, Grow Act would make George Orwell blush.  In reality, McCarthy's plan would result in unlimited carbon pollution,       massive losses to the Federal Government and American       families and businesses, and very likely crashes in whole       sectors of the economy--some limit, save, and growth.   First, it would rescind the extra funding we provided to the IRS to  go after wealthy tax cheats. This would add $120 billion to the  deficit. For them, ``limit, save, and grow'' means limit IRS  enforcement, save their big donors money paying their taxes, and grow  their own campaign contributions.   Federal programs would face indiscriminate cuts of up to 33 percent  across research, science, housing, addiction treatment, national parks,  transportation, law enforcement, border security, drug enforcement, and  criminal prosecutions. If you want to defund the police, Speaker  McCarthy is your new poster boy.   The public hates all that stuff, so why pursue stuff that the public  hates? Why threaten to set off the U.S. default handgrenade to get this  done? Who wins? Creepy billionaires who hate the Federal Government and  fund Kevin McCarthy--chief among them, the fossil fuel industry.   For his big fossil fuel industry donors, McCarthy delivers four huge  giveaways. First, they take away the clean energy tax credits we passed  in the IRA. Second, they let fossil fuel interests leak polluting  methane emissions with no pollution fee. Third, they prop up dying  fossil fuel infrastructure with so-called permitting reform targeted to  help only fossil fuel. And fourth, they make it harder to protect  against water and air pollution.   This oily wish list is not about debt or deficits, and it is not  about growing the economy as it risks serious economic downturns. It is  about taking care of the industry whose dark money funds their party.   Look at the clean energy tax credits which McCarthy claims are  wasteful spending. It now appears that those tax credits will  incentivize more investment than expected. So what is McCarthy's  argument? There will be too much investment? Seriously?   Already, in less than a year, the IRA's clean energy tax credits have  encouraged over 100 projects that will create north of 100,000 jobs.  With time, the IRA could easily create over a million jobs--high-paying  manufacturing jobs, the kind we should want. Many projects are in  districts in the South and Midwest represented by Republicans.   Indeed, many House Republicans have cheered the very IRA-catalyzed  projects they are now trying to torpedo. Seriously. Back home, they  celebrate the jobs for their constituents. Here in DC, they vote to  eliminate the very tax credits that created them--all to serve fossil  fuel polluters.   Here are some of my favorite House Republican quotes celebrating IRA- catalyzed investments in Republican home districts.         This is the largest investment in the State of Georgia's       history--    One said--       one that will diversify and expand our economy while       providing strong job opportunities for Georgians today and       for generations to come.    And then a ``no'' vote against the IRA.         I'm thrilled that Honda has once again committed to Ohio       and our workers with today's announcement of a $3.5 billion       investment in EV production and a new battery plant within       Ohio's 15th Congressional District. I look forward to working       Honda and LG Energy Solution to bring 2,200 new jobs to the       Buckeye State.    And then voted to wipe out the program.         I am thrilled to welcome ENTEK to Terre Haute and to the       Hoosier state. As the only American company to own and       produce ``wet-process'' lithium-ion battery separator       materials, ENTEK is going to help to pave the way for       electric vehicle production in Indiana and reduce American       manufacturers' reliance on imported products. Their operation       in Terre Haute will create hundreds of new jobs.    And then voted to strip out the tax credits behind them.         I am honored to stand with other state and federal leaders       during this groundbreaking event as the first solar energy       microgrid-powered industrial site project was unveiled in       Jackson County. I know this important project will . . .       stimulate economic growth that will create new jobs in West       Virginia.    And then voted against the tax credits.   Where are the common themes here? Well, clean energy investments grow  the economy and create jobs. These investments will help America  compete against imports from overseas.   Usually, Republicans can't stop talking about how we need to reduce  our dependence on Chinese imports and build up our own manufacturing  industry--until their fossil fuel overlords tell them otherwise. Then  they vote against the credits that encourage domestic manufacturing of  the clean energy technologies that will dominate the economy of  tomorrow.   What a terrible bet. Republicans can't beat China with the energy and  technologies of the last century. No amount of fossil fuel-funded  obstruction here at home is going to stop the clean energy revolution  happening in the rest of the world.  [[Page S1376]]    In Europe last year, more than 12 percent of cars sold were fully  electric, up from less than 2 percent just back in 2019. Europe is  investing massively in wind and solar and green hydrogen, particularly  after the Russian invasion of Ukraine demonstrated just how dangerous  dependence on fossil fuels can be.   In China last year, 22 percent of cars sold were fully electric,  towards the goal of 40 percent of all cars sold fully electric in 2030.  China is, by far, the largest installer of wind and solar power, with  ambitions to dominate the clean energy technologies of tomorrow.   In most places, renewable energy is now the cheapest form of energy-- far cheaper than fossil fuel. So the rest of the world is going all-in  on wind, solar, batteries, green hydrogen, and other clean technologies  for their low-cost energy. And that savings doesn't even count the  trillions of dollars of value from avoiding the costs and harms of  fossil fuel pollution.   The future is clean tech. And there are fortunes to be made. Many of  these clean energy technologies were developed right here by our  scientists and engineers at our companies and national labs. But the  fossil fuel industry wants America to lose our technological leadership  and all the business opportunities that flow from it.   Remember limit, save, grow? If you want that for real: limit  pollution, save clean energy jobs, and grow the economy. The fossil  fuel industry behind this is the most subsidized industry on the  planet. It lives off public money and political influence. It gets to  pollute for free.   Just today in the Budget Committee, we heard testimony that fossil  fuel combustion, by warming the planet and polluting the air, costs  America over $800 billion per year in health costs. The International  Monetary Fund puts the effective subsidy in the U.S. for fossil fuels  at almost $700 billion per year.   If fossil fuel-funded Republicans want to talk about picking winners  and losers, bring it on. Their fossil fuel donors enjoy the biggest  subsidy in world history.   If fossil-fuel-funded Republicans want to talk about free markets,  bring it on. Market economics 101 teaches that the cost of your  pollution should be in the price of your product. But fossil-fuel- funded Republicans protect free polluting for fossil fuel.   It is not just costs that fossil fuels impose on the rest of us. It  is risks--economic risks associated with climate change. Central  bankers, economists, insurance CEOs, financial experts, and other  witnesses--serious grownups whose judgments are fiduciary--have come to  the Budget Committee to warn of systemic risks to the economy,  including a collapse in coastal property values and a carbon bubble  resulting from stranded fossil fuel assets.   Now, ``systemic risks'' sounds pretty mild. It is not. It is when  catastrophe spreads from one troubled sector across the entire economy,  much as the 2008 meltdown in the mortgage market spread across the  country to become the financial crisis and Great Recession, which, by  the way, resulted in an additional $5 trillion in government debt.  Disaster avoidance is debt reduction.   The stakes are huge. The consulting firm Deloitte estimates that the  global cost of doing nothing on climate is around $180 trillion in  economic damage--$180 trillion. But they go on to say that if we act  responsibly and limit warming to 1.7 degrees Celsius, we can save  ourselves from that and actually grow the global economy by $40  trillion. So you want limit, save, and grow? In this case, if you do it  right by limiting pollution and saving clean energy jobs and growing  the economy, the swing is $220 trillion between a bad climate outcome  and a responsible climate outcome.   But the corrupt fossil fuel industry says ``jump,'' and Kevin  McCarthy and MAGA Republicans say ``how high?''   Here is a ``how high": They eliminate the fee on wasteful methane  emissions that I worked to include in the IRA. The methane pollution  fee will raise $6 billion against the deficit and save even more from  avoided climate and air pollution damage. But the rotten House plan was  never about cutting debt and deficits, always about delivering for the  fossil fuel overlords. So out goes the methane program.   Methane traps 80 times as much heat as carbon dioxide, at least in  the short run, and it creates air pollution that sickens people across  the country. This is a satellite image of a methane plume. You can  actually detect methane plumes from space now, which is why charging a  fee for polluting makes so much sense, because you can find the  polluter quite easily. This one is being released from an oil well.  Now, the operator of this oil well could capture this methane and sell  it. It is natural gas. But, instead, oil companies like this just  release it. Pure waste. Pure pollution.    Putting a price on methane emissions will dramatically reduce this  pollution and raise budget balancing revenues. But McCarthy doesn't  care; the industry funds his caucus. So out goes the budget-balancing,  pollution-preventing methane fee.   Next in the fossil fuel-funded parade of horribles is a permitting  reform stuffed with giveaways to--you guessed it--the fossil fuel  industry. What the hell does permitting reform have to do with the debt  limit, you might ask? Well, good question. Does building in more fossil  fuel even make sense? The world is moving off fossil fuels. Peak oil  will occur, and demand will begin to decline. Once demand begins to  decline, the oil cartel will collapse in a rush for the exits, causing  serious economic turbulence as fossil fuel assets are stranded,  particularly in high production cost countries like the United States  of America.   This is the global production cost curve for oil. As you can see,  Persian Gulf oil is far cheaper to produce than U.S. oil. Here we are.   So when there is a rush for the exits, and instead of cheating the  world with cartel pricing, they go to cost-plus pricing, and we are out  of business in the U.S. fossil fuel industry, and American fossil fuel  infrastructure becomes hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of  useless, stranded assets. But fossil fuel says ``jump,'' and House  Republicans say ``how high?''   Last in this fossil fuel wish list is a provision to make it next to  impossible for EPA to promulgate regulations limiting air and water  pollution. Again, deregulating polluters has nothing to do with the  debt limit, but the fossil fuel industry wants it. So it is in.   In just the last few months, we have seen what Republican  deregulation means for American families and businesses. We saw it in  East Palestine, OH, when a train derailment resulted in a major spill  of toxic chemicals. We saw it in Northern California when Silicon  Valley Bank went belly-up. Both of these events could have been  prevented with better regulations. Both harmed American families and  businesses.   Protecting Americans from air and water pollution with good  regulations always pays because the costs associated with air and water  pollution are enormous. But fossil fuel does a lot of air and water  pollution. So here is another fact giveaway to the fossil fuel  industry.   If you ever needed proof that the Republican Party is the wholly  owned subsidiary of the fossil fuel industry, McCarthy's debt limit  package is that proof. Amazingly, almost 280 pages out of a 320-page  bill are devoted to fossil fuel industry giveaways.   Here are 320 pages; 280 of these pages are blue. The remaining 40 are  white. So this is a visual image of how much of the ``Default on  America'' bill is devoted to making nice for the fossil fuel industry  versus everything else.   It is like a bunch of delivery boys for the fossil fuel industry over  there. This bill isn't about debt and deficits. It is not about  limiting or saving or growing. It is about serving fossil fuel--the  source of the money that keeps them in power. Period.   Oil and gas extraction represents only about 5 percent of our GDP.  Farming, manufacturing, food and beverage, insurance, finance,  restaurants, retail, housing, healthcare--all representing a larger  share of GDP. Clean energy actually now accounts for more employment  than the fossil fuel industry. But for subsidies, nothing compares to  fossil fuel. So for political influence, to protect those massive  subsidies, nothing compares to fossil fuel.   There is actually a bug--an insect--that infiltrates another bug and  takes over the other bug's nervous system. And from inside the other  bug, it drives  [[Page S1377]]  it around. It is kind of a creepy, natural development. It happens in  the insect world. And it looks like it happened on the other side of  the building, because what the fossil fuel industry has done is to take  over the Republican Party and now just drive it around.   So fossil fuel money makes the McCarthy package serve its Big Oil  master. It is a deeply sad and dangerous state of affairs when one of  America's two main political parties abandons all pretense of  responsible governance just to service its prime political benefactor.  That is what Speaker McCarthy and House Republicans are doing. That is  this bill.   They threaten default, propose terrible cuts, deny climate warnings,  and are willing to kneecap the American economy, all in service to the  fossil fuel industry and its dark money.   It is time to fix our democracy so that it functions honestly and  this nonsense stops. It is time to wake up.
