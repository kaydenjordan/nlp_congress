 Mr. Speaker, I rise with great jubilation and  excitement to recognize and congratulate the Catholic Charities as they  celebrate this day, June 12, being an historic day in Texas because it  has been named as Texas Women Veterans Day.   The Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston wants  to ensure that the Texas legislators who supported this are, in fact,  congratulated. And we are grateful that it was signed into law.   Texas has the highest number of women veterans of any State in the  country--last year, 183,597--and these heroes and sheroes could soon  have a special day when the State will annually recognize their  sacrifices.   June 12 now has historic significance. On June 12, 1948, the Women's  Armed Services Integration Act was passed nationally, allowing women to  serve as regular members of the military.   ``We are delighted that this special population that has bravely  served our Nation will be honored in this important way,'' says Cynthia  N. Colbert,  [[Page H4838]]  Catholic Charities president and CEO. ``We serve women veterans through  several programs, and we love having the opportunity to recognize those  who have served and sacrificed for all of us.''   So this is a great day. Thank you Texas and the legislators who  sponsored it. I look forward to working with legislation to ensure we  have a national day here in the United States.   But to the staff of Catholic Charities, those who travel to Austin  and all of those who recognize that we must honor these veterans as the  heroes and sheroes of the Nation, congratulations. You have a day, June  12. Now, forever, we will honor you on this day.   God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.                            ____________________     Well, first of all, it is my honor and privilege to  thank Congresswoman Plaskett for her ongoing leadership in speaking to  our colleagues and the American people. Let me take a moment of  personal privilege to say to her that, over the weekend in Texas, I was  with a number of individuals from the Virgin Islands, and it certainly  was my first task to tell them of the excellent representation that  they were getting by her leadership on so many issues.   But to you, I want to say that we were at the commissioning of the  USS Gabrielle Giffords, and proudly so. The commander of that ship is  from the Virgin Islands, so there was a contingent of individuals from  all over the country for recognizing the commander and his wife. Let me  say that I made sure that those sailors knew who was supporting them as  well. It certainly was a great honor to former Congresswoman Giffords,  and there wasn't a dry eye as we did that. So I just wanted to add that  and thank you for your indulgence of that.   If I might, let me also acknowledge my colleague on the floor,  Congresswoman Val Demings, and Floridians who are here, just to make  note of the commemoration of the tragedy at the Pulse Nightclub.                                time  1945    This is the area in which the Congresswoman policed, if you will, and  her spouse still there leads the community in law enforcement. I will  honor to those who lost their lives, but to the recognition that  terrorism and hateful acts are not to be accepted by any of us.   As a good friend of mine, a Muslim, said yesterday as we stood  against hateful acts against Muslims around the world, and particularly  around the United States, he said that the way that we deal with this  danger is to love in recognition of the human dignity of all.   To the LGBTQ community, my deepest sympathy and recognition in this  month that we honor and have Pride Month that we recognize your deep  involvement in this country and your right to human dignity. So I thank  Congresswoman Plaskett for allowing me to engage in that statement.   Let me say that I would hope that none of us would have wanted to be  on the floor tonight to talk about the changing face of America since  the election of the President of the United States but, in fact, to  recognize that there has been a surge in discrimination throughout this  Nation.   The roots of racial extremist violence against peaceful Black  communities runs deep in American history: from this country's dark  path of chattel slavery; to the southern lynch mobs that sought to  permanently disenfranchise the Black vote; to the church bombing that  killed four little Black girls in Birmingham; to the dismantling of an  entire economic district in Tulsa; and to the senseless stabbing, just  a few weeks ago, of a bright, young man by the name of Richard Collins  III.   I am sad that the election of President Trump--and I am not sure  whether this has been brought to his attention. I would like to bring  it to his attention--has created a divisive atmosphere. Trump's  political debut was centered on the racist birther movement, which  questioned the citizenship of then-President Obama.  [[Page H4841]]    He was not in office then. And to some, it was a little humorous;  some were shocked. Certainly, the Black community did not take it  humorously. This was a Senator who had been duly elected by the  citizens of Illinois. He had done nothing to bring in commentary on  himself personally. He sought the Presidency of the United States. He  offered to the American people all of the documentation that would be  required, yet Donald Trump persisted for 5 years in insisting, through  fake news, that he was not a citizen of the United States of America.   During his political campaign, he repeatedly refused to reject the  endorsement of White supremacist groups. He failed to condemn  supporters who shouted out racist slurs, and, on occasion, violently  attacked protestors who happened to be an African-American woman, in  particular.   In a nation completely comprised of immigrants, he has built a  hateful movement around building a wall. And to my friends who are  Hispanic, particularly Mexicans, he called them drug dealers and any  number of names.   This country has prided itself on the value of immigration, of  diversity, and, certainly, freed slaves who have come to make this  country the great country that it is. Overall, his anti-immigrant  incidents were the most reported, 315 incidents; followed by anti- Black, 221; anti-Muslim, 112; and anti-LGBT, 109.   So I just want to take a moment to add to my commentary, the things  that I think are grossly horrific; that we should realize that this is  not a time for the CBC to be on the floor casting blame.   Let me also, as I acknowledge Congresswoman Plaskett, thank our  chairperson, Congressman Cedric Richmond, for his really unceasing  leadership of the Congressional Black Caucus and the work that he has  done to make sure that we astutely have the information to be the  conscience of Congress.   These are the pictures of hatred. This is the individual who killed  the young man that--I don't want to show the wrong picture--but this is  a picture of an individual who was engaged in the killing of two  individuals, I believe in Portland, Oregon, because they were trying to  defend someone of a different background.   We have a noose found hanging near a school in Washington, D.C. This  is a picture of that. This has all happened since the election of  President Trump.   We have an incident, June 9, 2017, The Washington Post says, `` `Shut  up, Slave!': A spilled Starbucks drink led to a racist tirade and  sidewalk fight. . . .''   I don't know if people are under extreme tension, but this is all  happening in 2017.   We have another one: A day without racism? Not for Trump's  administration. The Department of Justice is dismantling, or lowering  the Civil Rights Division, cutting the staffing that is there.   Hate crimes in the U.S. rising. These are the kinds of things. And  tragically, here is a handsome, beautiful, young man who was taking his  commission and getting ready to graduate, Richard Collins III, and he  was killed.   Let me finish on these points about the criminal justice system that  I think is very important.   Black Americans are more likely to have their cars searched.   Black Americans are more likely to be arrested for drug use.   Black Americans are more likely to be jailed while awaiting trial.   Black Americans are more likely to be offered a plea deal that  includes prison time.   Black Americans are more likely to serve longer sentences than White  Americans for the same offense.   Black Americans are more likely to be disenfranchised.   We also know that we have statistics, that I will offer into the  Record, of Black American youth who are more likely to be included in  the juvenile detention center, police stops, police searches, use of  force during arrest, juvenile arrests, transgender arrests. Sixty  percent of the transgender arrests are Black or Latino; arrests for  marijuana.   Most Blacks are not likely to get pretrial release. More Blacks are  likely to be prosecuted. More Blacks are likely to get prison versus  community service. Length of incarceration is longer than Whites.    State judge incarceration, there are 208,000 people in State prison  for drug offenses; 32 percent are White, 68 percent are Black.   Federal drug convictions are higher among African Americans. Forty- seven percent were Hispanics, and we are higher than those.   Federal court sentencing, and, of course, incarceration of women  African Americans are higher. Sentencing to life without parole,  African Americans are higher, 65 percent.   Hiring people with criminal records, that makes it very difficult for  us to work, and eliminating the right to vote.   So, Congresswoman, I will close by simply saying, where is the  President on standing with the moral compass of asking the hatred to  stop; to really empower a Department of Justice not to be led by an  individual who has fought against voting rights, fought against the  rights of those who are seeking to be rehabilitated in the criminal  justice system; to join a bipartisan army of individuals against mass  incarceration? Where is the President in standing against the hatred  that has impacted the African-American community?   The words that he has said, where is the President in stopping this  onslaught that is generating into violence in the streets?   Where is the moral compass of this administration? If it is not you,  Mr. President, the Congressional Black Caucus will not take a back seat  to you. We will fight and bring this country back to where it should  be, and that is a country that believes in the equality of all  Americans, and the African Americans who have died and bled in wars,  and have been slaves, and, in essence, came through a reformation to be  free. We will not take a back seat to all of this hatred.   I ask you, Mr. President, where are your answers?   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues, Congressman Veasey and  Congresswoman Plaskett for anchoring this important special order on  ``Racism and Discrimination in America.''   For over 40 years the CBC has been at the forefront in the fight  against the evils of racism, discrimination, marginalization, and the  various manifestations of institutionalized racial bias.   In today's uncertain times, we must be more steadfast than ever to  continue that fight.   No matter what your party identification is, I believe we can all  agree that we must root out extremist violence everywhere, and  especially within our borders.   And while we are all committed to eliminating ISIS and all its  sympathizers, we must not underestimate the threat of domestic  terrorism and domestic violence by racial extremists.   Throughout the history of this country, African-American communities  have faced innumerable threats from those who don't comprehend that  there is value within our nation's diversity.   The roots of racial extremist violence against peaceful Black  communities runs deep in American history: From this country's dark  past of chattel slavery, to the southern lynch mobs that sought to  permanently disenfranchise the Black vote, to the church bombing that  killed four little girls in Birmingham, to the dismantling of an entire  economic district in Tulsa, to the senseless stabbing of a bright young  man by the name of Richard Collins III just a few weeks go.   As a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, or the ``Conscience of  the Congress'', I call on this body to do all it can to stem the rising  tide of racial violence.   Although progress has been made, President Trump's divisive rhetoric,  and the actions of his followers, have shown us that we still have much  work to do before all of America can feel safe.   Consistent rhetoric of intolerance coming from Trump's campaign and  now his administration has not only put a target on African-American  communities, but also on Mexican-Americans, Muslim-Americans, women,  and those within the immigrant population.   The election of Donald Trump has had a significant effect on the  nation's race relations:   Trump's political debut was centered on the racist ``birther  movement'', which questioned the citizenship of then President Obama  for months.   During his political campaign, he repeatedly refused to reject the  endorsement of white supremacist groups.   He failed to condemn supporters who shouted out racist slurs and on  more than one occasion, violently attacked protesters.   In a nation completely comprised of immigrants, he has built a  hateful movement around building a wall to keep them out.  [[Page H4842]]    This country has prided itself on being the melting pot of the world.  The bastion of freedom of equality. Violence against any person based  on their class, color, or creed is not only immoral, it's anti- American.   We must condemn, denounce, and seek to eliminate these acts of racial  terror with the same fervor that we would when dealing with religious  extremists.   I have to quote former Attorney General Eric Holder who stated,  ``Though this nation has proudly thought of itself as an ethnic melting  pot, in things racial we have always been and continue to be, in too  many ways, essentially a nation of cowards.''   Regardless of who resides at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., this body, the  people's chamber, has a responsibility to do all that it can to ensure  the safety of all Americans. That is why I, along with my colleagues  from the Congressional Black Caucus, have sent out a letter to the  Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the acting  director of the FBI urging them to allocate more time and resources to  curbing the recent uptick in violence.   Incidents of Racialized Violence Since the Election:   The Southern Poverty Law Center has conducted a report on incidents  of racialized violence following the Presidential election.   There were over 1000 violent attacks reported within a month of the  election.   Overall, anti-immigrant incidents were the most reported at 315  incidents, followed by anti-black (221 incidents), anti-Muslim (112  incidents), and anti-LGBT (109 incidents).
