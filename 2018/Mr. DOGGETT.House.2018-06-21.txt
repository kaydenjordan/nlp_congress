 Mr. Speaker, last September, President Trump took our  Dreamers, those incredible young people who are contributing so much to  America, he took them hostage.   Then, this month, he added to the hostages by ordering that babies,  literally, be yanked out of their moms' arms. Today, with his  Republican enablers, he is basically saying: Give me my $25 billion  wall ransom, and give it to me paid in full. But I am not promising to  release the hostages.   Today's bill is wrong for Dreamers. It is wrong for taxpayers. It is  wrong for those families who have been torn apart by this government- sanctioned child abuse.   How great that, with his latest U-turn today, the President is  dispatching his wife, a mother herself, to the Texas border.   I just happen to feel that the kids that are tied up in those cages  don't want to see a mother. They want to see their mother.   Tonight, they will cry themselves to sleep again, because the self- described ``stable genius'' didn't bother to include anything in his  executive order to reunite those families.    Mr. Speaker, I would say, instead of taking these  hostages and passing this bill, they need to build a great mirror and  look in it to see how they have become willing accomplices to this  wrongdoing. I bet Mexico would pay for that.
