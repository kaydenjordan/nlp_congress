 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, all across my district, I have encountered stories of  individuals and families whose lives have been irrevocably changed by  the scourge of the opioid epidemic: a father who lost his daughter too  young and is pouring his grief into advocacy, a former neighbor and a  dad who left behind two young children, a young man who is walking the  hard path of recovery and showing others how to do the same.   These are the stories I hear day in and day out. They fill my heart;  they fill my voice. And it is because of them that I am so very proud  to cast a vote in favor of H.R. 6 today. It is my hope that this  legislation will be another small step for our Nation on its road of  recovery from this epidemic.   I am particularly proud that this bill incorporates legislation that  I have introduced, along with my good friend Representative Ben Ray  Lujan of New Mexico, which will provide a meaningful expansion to high- quality addiction treatment by allowing additional healthcare  providers, such as nurse midwives, to prescribe buprenorphine, a  medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder.   In addition, this provision will make permanent buprenorphine- prescribing authority for nurse practitioners and physician assistants  and allow certain providers to treat more patients in the first year of  their license.   These changes will make a big difference for individuals struggling  from addiction across our country, especially in rural areas, and for  vulnerable populations like pregnant and postpartum women and the  13,000 babies born each year with neonatal abstinence syndrome.   I also want to highlight the inclusion of my Medicaid Reentry Act  into this bill, which aims to improve care for individuals who are  leaving jail or prison and reentering a community setting.    These individuals are highly vulnerable to opioid overdose  due to lack of effective addiction treatment while incarcerated. By  passing this legislation, we will allow States to engage in  demonstration projects to improve medical care and transition-related  services to Medicaid-eligible incarcerated individuals in the 30 days  prior to their release, reducing the risk of overdose as individuals  are coming back into the community for a second chance. I truly believe  that this provision will transform lives.   I thank Ranking Member Pallone, Chairman Walden, and their staffs for  their continued efforts in this process. Without their dedicated,  bipartisan work, we would not be making this progress today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6.    Mr. Speaker, during this 115th session of Congress, the  House lost one of its most passionate souls, the late Representative  Louise McIntosh Slaughter.   She worked day in and day out with great passion and with great  integrity. She understood that it was about trust that was placed into  a Member of Congress by the people who have chosen you to be their  voice here in Congress.   To Louise Slaughter it was important to make certain that government  was transparent and accountable, so she drove the Stop Trading On  Congressional Knowledge Act, which was dubbed the STOCK Act. I am so  proud to have sponsored legislation today that has renamed, in her  honor, the STOCK Act.   Louise Slaughter worked for transparency in this House. She knew that  it was about making lives of the constituents that we represent all the  stronger and all the fuller and not enriching our own lives by the  trust placed in us.   It is an honor to rename the STOCK Act because of her hard work and  because of her integrity.                            ____________________
