 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise in strong support of the Protecting the Right to Organize Act.  I rise in support of unions and millions of workers fighting for higher  wages, better benefits, and safe working conditions.   For years, Republicans and corporate interests have been chipping  away at the rights of workers in America. Employers are aggressively  waging a campaign against unions and against the best interests of  their workers.   It is illegal for employers to intimidate workers who want to join  unions, but it is still happening, because these union-busting bosses  are not being held responsible. The PRO Act will ensure that penalties  are enforced to help put an end to these antiunion activities.   American workers are putting in the work; they should also be reaping  the rewards of their labor. The PRO Act will help workers stand  together to demand their fair share and to make their bosses listen.   Mr. Chair, I enter into the Record a letter from the International  Longshore and Warehouse Union in support of the PRO Act.                                          International Longshore &                                                 Warehouse Union,                        San Francisco, California, February 3, 2020.        Dear Representative: As President of the International       Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU), I urge you to support       the PRO Act (Protecting the Right to Organize Act, H.R. 2474)       when debated on the House Floor this week. The ILWU further       urges you to oppose amendments that would weaken this       important legislation.        The ILWU is committed to organizing the unorganized. We       recently celebrated the first union contract for workers at       Anchor Steam Brewing Co. in San Francisco, California. We       have organized other workers into our great union, but have       been unsuccessful in achieving a fair contract due to bad       faith bargaining. The truth is that every day workers are       intimidated, threatened, and coerced simply because they       aspire to join a union and achieve a better life. Our current       labor law allows this immoral corporate behavior without       meaningful consequences.        The United States gave Americans the right to organize       labor unions under the National Labor Relations Act (NRLA).       The increase in unionization encouraged by the law       significantly diminished income inequality over the next       forty years. American workers prospered as a result of having       a voice in the workplace.        However, over time, corporations and their political allies       have gutted organizing rights, and diminished unions, which       has caused great economic disparities. The decline in union       density accounts for one third of the rise in income       inequality among men and one fifth among women according to       the Economic Policy Institute.        The time is now to restore workers' potential to organize.       The PRO Act restores the balance of power we desperately need       between workers and management. This bill authorizes the NLRB       to assess monetary penalties for each violation in which a       workers is wrongfully terminated or suffers serious economic       harm. The bill importantly imposes personal liability on       corporate directors and officers who participate in       violations of workers' rights or have knowledge of and fail       to prevent such violations.        The PRO Act also gives workers the right to override so-      called ``right to work'' laws that prevent unions from       collecting dues from the people they represent. The bill       would give employers and unions the right to enter into a       contract that allows unions to collect fair share fees that       cover the costs of collective bargaining and administering       the contract. It is simply unfair and divisive for some non-      dues paying workers to get a free ride off the backs of their       fellow dues paying workers.        Further, the Act protects First Amendment rights by       removing prohibitions on workers acting in solidarity with       workers at other companies. The bill also prohibits companies       from permanently replacing striking workers.        A critical part of the legislation seeks to facilitate       initial collective bargaining agreements. Even when workers       succeed in forming a union, nearly half of newly formed       unions fail to ever reach a contract with the employer. The       bill facilitates first contracts between companies and newly       certified unions by requiring mediation and arbitration to       settle disputes.        The ILWU fully supports the PRO Act and we urge you to       actively support this important legislation to benefit the       organized labor and those workers who seek to join a union.       It is time to restore the right to organize to American       workers.            Sincerely,                                                     William Adams,                                                         President.
