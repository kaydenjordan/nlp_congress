 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Sid Martin Biotech  at the University of Florida for winning the Randall M. Whaley  Incubator of the Year Award, the top award given by the International  Business Innovation Association.   This marks the third time in the last 10 years that Sid Martin  Biotech has been recognized as the top incubator in the world. Even  more, Sid Martin Biotech is the only program in the world to win more  than one Randall M. Whaley award. This is a tremendous feat, and I am  proud that this program is located in North Central Florida in  Florida's Third Congressional District.   Sid Martin Biotech has incubated 106 startups since its first  opening. These companies have raised over $8.8 billion in funding and  created over 8,000 high-tech jobs.   Madam Speaker, I congratulate the entire team at Sid Martin Biotech  for this great accomplishment, and I am confident that this success  will continue in the future.   Go Gators.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my good colleague from Arizona (Mr.  Biggs) for putting this on. I really do appreciate it because it is so  timely.   Growing pains, I think that is what we can say we are going through  is growing pains again as a nation, a nation birthed over 200 years  ago.   And for anybody who watched yesterday's debate, Madam Speaker, on the  House floor, I think it was interesting to see the amount of, I guess,  race-baiting that was coming from the other side, from my colleagues,  which I found very unreasonable that, for some reason, if you are a  Black man, you have to tell your children how to act with the police.   My mom and dad had that talk with me, probably for good reason, too,  and they said: If you get pulled over, ``Yes, sir,'' ``No, sir,'' and  then when you get home we want to know what happened and why you got  pulled over. I had to have that talk with my children. So that is  nothing new, and I think that we sometimes overplay that.   Does it happen maybe more with minority communities? Yes, I think it  does, but nobody is immune to that. When I came into Congress, I got  stopped multiple times to see if I had the right credentials. That has  happened to me.   Since we have been up here, the divide in this country has gotten so  much worse, and it has been since Donald Trump has gotten elected. And  people will blame the President for doing this, but we can go back to  other Presidents where we have seen this happen. We are Americans. We  need to come together as a nation.   I have had the great fortune of being in Congress. This is my last  term. I will have served 8 years. I was the chairman of the Asia- Pacific Subcommittee last year, last Congress; I am the ranking member  this year. I have bean able to travel the world. I have been in the  Democratic Republic of the Congo.  [[Page H2586]]    Africa is a continent of 1.2 billion, yet today, in the 21st century,  650 million people do not have electricity. I suppose they have a  reason to protest. I suppose they have a reason to complain. But do  they have the right to protest?   Being on the Asia-Pacific Subcommittee we got to travel to a lot of  the Asian countries. We all know what is going on in Hong Kong today.  Hong Kong is a province of China. There was an agreement of one  country, two systems, where Hong Kong was supposed to be a semi- or a  self-ruling area with an independent judiciary committee. Yet, 23 years  into that agreement, Xi Jinping, the leader of the Communist Party,  said that is null and void, and they have put the heavy hand of the  Communist Party in there.   These young students are out there holding up that flag behind you,  Madam Speaker, holding up that flag for liberty and freedom because  they have tasted that. That is all they have ever known. Yet the  Chinese Communist Party wants to take that away because it scares them.  Free thought, independent thinking, freedom, they know the Communist  Party cannot survive, so they are going in there to squash that.   These students are holding those signs up. Our flag is up. They have  been in my office here in the Washington Capitol. They have a reason to  protest, but they do not have the right.   You talk about Venezuela, somebody talked about it. Go down to Cuba  and talk against the Castro regime. You don't have the right. Talk  about religion in those countries. You do not have the right.   But then I look at this country, and I am as guilty as anybody else  in this country. We have the right to protest, the First Amendment, but  sometimes I think--and this is where I feel like I am guilty, like a  lot of us. I think we take it for granted what we have in this country.    It was interesting because I was with the Ambassadors of both  Malaysia and Indonesia, and they talked about the founding of their  country. When they got their independence, when they broke away and  they formed those countries, they told me that their founding fathers  could have picked any system in the world. They could have taken Great  Britain's system of government. They could have taken Germany's,  Russia's, China's. But you know who they took? They took the principles  of America because they had read our history, they had read those  documents and what those documents meant.   And I heard people over and over here today, since I have been in  Congress, America is not a perfect country because people are in it,  and people are not perfect, but the ideals laid out there were the best  ideals that have ever been laid out. If not, why are other countries  adopting them? Why do people in Cuba come across the ocean, a 90-mile  stretch, on inner tubes, on rafts, on surfboards to get to this  country? It is called freedom. It is called justice.   But do you know what? We are not going to fix it if this side is  accusing this side, and this side over here is accusing that side of  pandering to our audience.   So what that meant to me when I was with those Ambassadors from  Indonesia and Malaysia, what it meant to me was: Do you know what?  America is bigger than a Presidency. It is bigger than the Democratic  Party. It is bigger than the Republican Party. It is those ideals that  this country stands for that we all need to fight to hold on to.   I want to read something that one of my constituents sent me. It  says: ``The lesson taught at this point by human experience is simply  this, that the man who will get up will be helped up, and the man who  will not get up will be allowed to stay down. . . . Personal  independence is a virtue and it is the soul of which comes the  sturdiest manhood. But there can be no independence without a large  share of self-dependence, and this virtue cannot be bestowed. It must  be developed from within.''   I had an African-American man, a conservative Republican who is  afraid to tell people he is a conservative Republican because he gets  labeled Uncle Tom. You have been put on the plantation.   These are not my words. These are words coming from him.   But that quote came from somebody I wish we could go back and meet,  Mr. Frederick Douglass, a person born into slavery who picked himself  up by the bootstraps, who educated himself. He stood beside President  Lincoln when they dedicated the Emancipation statue.   And I have got these people out here who loathe, despise, disdain  this country, and it is being flamed by people--and I can't blame just  people, the Democrats. There are people out there who just hate this  country, but they are using that to tear this country apart instead of  remembering the ideals that this country is built on. And those are  American ideologies--not conservative, not liberal, not Republican or  Democrat, American--and I think it is time that we all come together  and realize we are Americans and we are on the same team.
