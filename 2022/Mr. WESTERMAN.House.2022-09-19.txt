 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill along with the other  suspension bills that we have worked with Chairman Grijalva to get on  the floor today.   Mr. Speaker, I would also like to recognize the dedicated service of  one of my staff members, Terry Camp, who will be leaving us next month.   Known affectionately as ``Turbo'' by his colleagues, he has certainly  lived up to that nickname. Since starting on the House Committee on  Natural Resources in 2015, Terry has had a hand in nearly 60 bills that  have been signed into law. This total doesn't even account for the  countless bills he has been a part of that have been enacted as part of  various legislative packages.   While this is an impressive total, it doesn't even come close to the  number of now-famous Capitol tours he has given, which he offers in  both English and Spanish.   As our national parks staffer, he has visited numerous national park  units throughout his tenure, frequently stopping by any nearby units on  family vacations. That dedication has led to the creation of many new  bills, including the Save the Liberty Theater Act which was signed into  law earlier this year.                                time  1730    Terry's passion for public service is perhaps surpassed only by his  passion for the Utah State University Aggies.   Terry exemplifies the guiding principles of my office by always  abiding in love, competing to win, and succeeding through service.  While we will miss him in the Halls of Congress, we wish him, his wife,  Kayla, and their son, Elijah, all the best as they start the next  chapter of their lives back in their home State of Utah.
