 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a  vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that  a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is  not present.    Mr. Speaker, today I rise to share the story of a  very remarkable group of children: the James Island Ocean ActKIDvists-- Betty, Louis, Makena, and Liam--all between the ages of 6 and 8, who  have made it their mission to protect our oceans and our marine life.   Recently, they successfully lobbied the Charleston and James Island  City Councils to ban plastic bags, straws, and foam containers,  collecting over 300 signatures in support of the ban. At town council  meetings, these young activists had the courage to speak up for the  marine life that could not speak for itself.   It is our job to preserve the low country's vibrant natural resources  for future generations to come. I am proud of the James Island Ocean  ActKIDvists for helping lead the way. I thank Betty, Louis, Makena, and  Liam.                            ____________________
