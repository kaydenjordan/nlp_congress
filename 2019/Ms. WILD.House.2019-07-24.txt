 Mr. Speaker, the crisis facing multiemployer pensions is  not some faraway event, and it is not about politics or ideology. It is  about people's lives and whether they will be able to retire in dignity  after a lifetime of hard work--American people.   By 2025, the Central States Pension Fund and the PBGC will be  insolvent. That means over a million American employees' and retirees'  earned benefits could disappear if we don't act right now.   This crisis doesn't just affect those enrolled in multiemployer  pension plans. If we don't act, the consequences will be detrimental  for our local businesses, economies, and residents, ultimately  affecting everyone, including millions of American families.   Participants nationwide, including thousands in my district, could  lose everything they have earned if we don't act. These folks who came  to watch the proceedings today never wanted a bailout, as my colleague  across the aisle termed it. They just want and deserve what they have  earned. They deserve it.   We need to pass this bill. We must pass this bill for them and for  our country.
