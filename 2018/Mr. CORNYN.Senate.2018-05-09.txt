The following Senators are necessarily absent: the  Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Graham) and the Senator from Arizona  (Mr. McCain).    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, earlier today the Senate Select Committee  on Intelligence heard from the President's pick for Director of the  Central Intelligence Agency, Gina Haspel. Actually, we had an open  hearing this morning, and I just returned from a recently concluded  closed hearing, during which classified information was shared with the  committee and discussed with the nominee.   As we know, the President's nominees for various positions have been  the victims of hearsay, innuendo, and rumor. Thankfully, Ms. Haspel had  the opportunity today to respond to some of the questions--and attacks,  really--that have been posed against her in the public. She has now had  a chance to respond, and I thought she did so with tremendous  knowledge, grace, and the kind of temperament you would hope for in a  Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.   She exemplified the core attributes we have come to know about her  since she was nominated: professional integrity, an innate sense of  loyalty to her country, and a strong drive to work hard, not just for  the advancement of her individual career but also to protect Americans  and put our national security first.   The fact that she is here today, as President Trump's nominee to  become the first female Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, is  a testament to both her character and her exceptional, decades-long  career as an intelligence professional.   All the while, she has endeared herself to her colleagues in the  intelligence community, who have an immense amount of respect for her  and her work. In fact, in addition to being the first female Director  of the Central Intelligence Agency, Ms. Haspel would be the first  operations officer in perhaps 40 years or more. In other words, at the  CIA they have analysts, they have people who do operations, who are  case officers and who do intelligence work, and, then, they have other  people who perform technical intelligence activity. She would be the  first in 40 years to actually have worked in some of the hot spots  around the world that I will mention more about here in a moment.   Yesterday, I spoke about some aspects of her career, about some of  the pieces that our colleagues across the aisle have left out of the  picture, which, in fairness, should be painted in full context so  people can understand that her career, spanning 33 years, is far more  than a couple of anecdotes or caricatures of her experience. In other  words, she is not defined by those experiences. Although, as she has  said today, we have all learned from those experiences.   Her 33 years of service showcase an unparalleled commitment to the  Central Intelligence Agency and a devotion to the rule of law. She  understands that when the intelligence agencies don't follow the rules  of the road, somebody is going to be held to account for it at a later  time. In this case, ironically, having followed the rule of law, we  find that some of our colleagues from across the aisle want to  relitigate decades-old incidents after the fact of 9/11, where, relying  on the premier legal authorities in the country from the Department of  Justice and having received orders from the Commander in Chief, they  simply did their job and now are being questioned in a way that  suggests they did something less than honorable, when, in fact, they  did exactly what they were asked to do.   The fact is that here in America we have not seen a follow-on attack  from 9/11. I mentioned yesterday a book I was reviewing that reminded  me that in the days following 9/11, on which 3,000 people died--some at  the Pentagon, where one plane crashed, and two others crashed at the  World Trade Center--there was some chatter about a potential nuclear  device getting into the hands of al-Qaida, the same people who took  down the two towers and hit the Pentagon.   That would have been catastrophic, obviously. Thankfully, as a result  of the good investigatory work and intelligence collection that the  intelligence community acquired, we learned that those rumors did not  end up proving to be true. But that sort of sets the tone for the  environment and attitude that many had about the potential for follow- on attacks, which would have been tremendously devastating.   It is a strange business that we ask our intelligence officials to  play to the edge of the law--in other words, to follow the law but to  be aggressive, to be forward-leaning to prevent these attacks. Then,  when they do exactly that, we come back years later, when we are  feeling safe and secure, and say: Well, you went too far.   We can imagine what it would have been like if there had been another  follow-on attack during which American citizens were killed. We can  imagine that our intelligence community would be criticized for  allowing that to happen, for somehow not stopping it, finding out about  it, and preventing it.   Unfortunately, too many people have 20/20 hindsight and are engaged  in second-guessing. Frankly, for people who serve honorably in the  intelligence community, it seems like a lose-lose proposition: Do too  much and prevent an attack, and we will criticize you. Don't do enough  and an attack occurs, and we will criticize you for that.   Suffice it to say that in all respects, during her career Gina Haspel  has acted in accordance with the law, as determined by the Department  of Justice. By the way, the Supreme Court of the United States is not  going to hand out an opinion in a case where the executive branch has  to act. Opinions handed down by the Office of Legal Counsel in the  Justice Department are the authoritative legal guidance for executive  branch agencies like the CIA.   Ms. Haspel has worked in assignments from Africa and Europe, and she  has been posted to dangerous capitals around the world. She has been  shot at, survived a coup d'etat, and run clandestine assets against  hard targets.   Those who have worked with her say her management skills and  integrity are unmatched. That is why she served as a station chief, the  Deputy Director of the National Clandestine Service, and Deputy  Director of the Central Intelligence Agency itself. All of this  experience is extraordinary and it is important, and it is exactly what  our country needs in this uncertain time.   Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testified in  recent memory that, in his 50 years in the intelligence business, he  has never before seen such a diverse array of threats confronting our  country--from North Korea to Iran, to Russia, to China, to the  terrorism threat, to domestic home-grown terrorist attacks inspired by  social media and online activity from overseas.   America clearly needs someone with the deep expertise and  understanding of the Central Intelligence Agency and the intelligence  community and someone who doesn't have to get up to speed. Americans  need someone with extensive counterterrorism experience who has worked  with difficult and hostile intelligence services and, I would say, also  with our friends and allies around the world. Some of the relationships  we have with other countries, like Britain, are some of the most  important relationships we have--government to government, intelligence  community to intelligence community. Ms. Haspel has the admiration and  respect of those coalition agencies around the world.   She may well be the most qualified person ever to be nominated for  the role of CIA Director. But we saw today in the hearing that there is  a determination by some to relitigate the past. We saw an attempt to  relitigate issues that have been closed for a long time, going on 17,  almost 20 years.   There were questions about Ms. Haspel's role in counterterrorism  efforts in the days immediately following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. I  am not questioning the questions, but I am questioning using some of  these issues as pretext to block or to vote against her nomination. She  was accused of making decisions that clearly were made by her  supervisor, when it came to getting rid of videotapes because of  concerns for the safety and security of the intelligence officers  depicted on those videotapes, even though there were verbatim cables of  the activity on the tapes. Obviously, in this case, the  [[Page S2580]]  decision to destroy the tapes was not hers but her supervisor's, who  took full responsibility for that.   As I said, it is easy here today, in the safety and security of 2018,  to remember what the post-9/11 climate was like. It is easy to second- guess the legal guidance that had been provided to our intelligence  professionals at the time, which they relied upon in good faith. It is  easy to overlook the considerable pressure placed on the Agency at that  time. As I said, if they didn't do enough, we would criticize them. If  they did too much, we would criticize them for that. So it is a fine  thin line they had to walk, which they did with incredible skill and  determination.   I would say it is nothing less than obscene to hold someone to a  standard that was set after their actions were performed, in good-faith  reliance on the law, as determined at the time they did act. In this  case, two different Justice Departments--one under President Bush and  one under President Obama--conducted investigations, exonerated Ms.  Haspel, and chose not to proceed against her or her colleagues at the  CIA.   The fact is that early on Congress was briefed on a regular basis and  approved of the activities in which she was engaged when it came to the  enhanced interrogation program, which she herself did not directly  participate in but which occurred during her time in the  counterterrorism center.   That Congress decided after the fact to change some of those policies  does not make the prior implementation of the policies improper at all.  Indeed, it was her professional obligation to carry them out, and it  was not for her or her fellow officers to second-guess the legality of  those policies. At the time at issue, Ms. Haspel was a GS-15, which is  a civil service ranking that would be the equivalent of either a major  or lieutenant colonel. It is as if saying that as for decisions made by  the Commander in Chief, where a lieutenant colonel participated in  executing those orders, that somehow they were responsible for the  policy decision made by the Commander in Chief in the military. It just  doesn't make any sense at all. As long as our military and intelligence  officials rely in good faith on the best legal guidance given to them  at the time, they should be free to conduct their activities and not be  second-guessed later on.   Some have now gone so far as to complain her full personnel file has  not been released. As I said, Ms. Haspel has the unique qualification  of having served 33 years essentially undercover, and she has  participated in some of the most sensitive intelligence activities our  country is engaged in. The idea that now we would jeopardize the  sources, the methods, and the alliances we had at that time just so  colleagues could display that in full public view strikes me as  terribly misguided.   It is true that in the Intelligence Committee we did have a  classified hearing, at which all of those matters were aired, but in an  appropriate setting, protecting that important sensitive information,  which is absolutely critical to keeping the country safe. The idea that  we ought to release her full personnel file, including sensitive  operations, to jeopardize the safety of other officers and expose  sensitive sources and methods of intelligence collection is to risk  national security itself. Some of our colleagues are suggesting that  this happen, but they simply know better, and they should know better.   You saw a stark difference at the hearing today between those who  wish to ensure we have the most qualified person leading the CIA and  those who have determined to obstruct President Trump's nominees at all  cost. In fact, during my time questioning Ms. Haspel, I mentioned a  national security expert who said, if Ms. Haspel had been nominated by  President Obama, it would be an easy call, but because she was  nominated by President Trump, and ironically happens to be the first  woman nominated to this important position as Director of the CIA, for  some reason, now we are going to hold her and President Trump to  another standard, a double standard.   If people were really listening, they would have heard Ms. Haspel  confirm what many of us have been saying about her all along; that she  is the right person for this job. We learned that former Defense  Secretary and CIA Director Leon Panetta and former Director of National  Director James Clapper, both former Obama officials, unequivocally  support Ms. Haspel. We have heard from Michael Hayden, John Brennan,  both former CIA Directors. Both have criticized President Trump for  other matters but praised this pick to head the Agency.   We read about this nominee, too, as the Wall Street Journal Editorial  board penned its support, writing:         [T]he people misrepresenting the CIA nominee were in the       cheap seats during the worst days of the war on terror. Ms.       Haspel didn't have that luxury.    I couldn't agree more with that characterization. Yet some of our  colleagues simply refuse to listen. In fact, we have been seeing this  same pattern play out throughout the Trump Presidency--people playing  politics and obstructing the nominees of the President simply because  they disagree with the President, not because of the qualifications of  the nominees. Sadly, we have seen character assassination against  nominees who have subsequently withdrawn because they have simply been  unwilling to go through the process and see the destruction of a  reputation they have worked a lifetime for. It is our Nation's loss  that good people withdraw from the process rather than go through that  sort of character assassination.   The Senate has a duty, after all, to ensure that our country has  well-qualified people at the head of our national security agencies  like the Central Intelligence Agency. While Ms. Haspel's credentials  are certainly more than sufficient to support her nomination against  some of the baseless claims we have heard, there is just as important a  case to be made for her that is based on upholding the CIA as an  institution.   Two lawyers who formerly served in the White House Counsel's office  and the Justice Department, David Rivkin and Lee Casey, wrote in the  Wall Street Journal: ``If agents are blamed following the directives of  their superiors, the CIA's ability to protect the U.S. will be  fundamentally compromised.''   I agree. We want our intelligence officers to be as aggressive as  they can within the confines of the law, collecting and analyzing  intelligence they can then provide to policymakers so we can keep our  country safe. We ought to, at least for a while, put a hold on the  politics of obstructing nominees, particularly at a national security  post, so we can put Americans' safety first.   We have to ask ourselves, in an increasingly uncertain and dangerous  time, what does the CIA mean to the national security of the United  States? For an agency at the very forefront of protecting our country's  citizens, what type of person do we want at the helm? I believe we want  a person like Ms. Haspel. It is Ms. Haspel--short and sweet--who I  think fits the mold of that sort of person we want.   I urge our colleagues to rethink what they are doing here, to shift  gears and support this nominee who is so well-qualified and so devoted  to protecting our country. Can you imagine the individual sacrifices  intelligence officers who serve undercover have to make--the sort of  strain on relationships when they are deployed abroad like our military  is and the hardships they have to sustain, but they do it because they  love our country and they are dedicated to keeping the American people  safe. Those sort of people--that kind of character, that kind of  integrity--ought to be rewarded and not criticized and punished.   As I said, I urge our colleagues to rethink what we are doing and  shift gears and support this qualified nominee. She is exactly what the  American people deserve, so let's get her confirmed.
