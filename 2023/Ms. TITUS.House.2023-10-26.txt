 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge, congratulate,  and celebrate the victory of the Las Vegas Aces, who won the 2023  Women's National Basketball Association championship.   On October 18, 2023, the Aces defeated the New York Liberty 70-69 in  game four of the WNBA Finals. They won despite two of their starters  being out with injuries, star guard Chelsea Gray and center Kiah  Stokes.   They won and have had an amazing two-cycle victory as champions under  the leadership of Hall of Fame Head Coach Becky Hammon.   Owner Mark Davis and team president Nikki Fargas have proven once  again that investing in women's sports is investing in success.   In the championship game, the Finals Most Valuable Player, A'ja  Wilson, led the way with 24 points and 16 rebounds; Jackie Young added  16 points; and Kelsey Plum--Plum Dawg, they call her--delivered a well- rounded performance of rebounds, assists, and points.   The Aces certainly raised the stakes when securing another  championship for Vegas, firmly establishing District One as the sports  capital of the world.    All of southern Nevada is very proud, and I can't wait to cheer the  team on next year as they go for three in a row.                            ____________________
