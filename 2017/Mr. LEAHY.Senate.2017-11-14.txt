 Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Consumer  Privacy Protection Act of 2017. This legislation, if enacted, will help  ensure that when Americans entrust corporations with their most  sensitive personal information, these corporations take the right steps  to keep this information secure, and do the right thing in the event of  a data breach. In today's modern world, data security is no longer just  about protecting our identities and our bank accounts; it is about  protecting our privacy and even our National security.   The need for this legislation has long been clear, and never more so  than in the wake of the recent, massive Equifax data breach. After  media investigations and multiple Congressional hearings, we learned  that the Equifax breach exposed the sensitive personal information of  almost half the American population. We also learned that Equifax  failed to take basic steps to secure its databases, and waited an  unjustifiably long period before notifying consumers and regulators.  Clearly, it is past time for all corporations that hold our personal  information to maintain some common-sense, baseline cybersecurity  standards.   Corporations make significant profits from our personal information,  and they should be obligated to keep it safe. Yet too often, data  breaches continue to plague American businesses  [[Page S7216]]  and compromise the privacy of millions of consumers. At the same time,  the amount of information we share with corporations who are the target  of these breaches is growing. Corporations collect and store our social  security numbers, our bank account information, and our email  addresses. They collect information about our private health and  medical conditions. They know what routes we take to work and where we  drop our kids off at school. They can replicate our fingerprints or  even faceprints. We trust them with private photographs that we store  in the cloud. This information is increasingly targeted by both  criminal hackers and nation-states, including hostile foreign powers.   The Consumer Privacy Protection Act I am introducing today is based  on legislation I first introduced in 2015, and builds and expands on  data security legislation that I have introduced in Congress since  2005. It seeks to protect the vast amount of information that we now  share with corporations each and every day. Americans want to know that  the corporations who are profiting from their information are actually  doing something to prevent the next data breach. Americans want to know  when someone has had unauthorized access to their bank accounts and to  their private family photographs, but they do not just want to be  notified of yet another data breach. Consumers should not have to  settle for mere notice of data breaches. American consumers deserve  protection. This legislation would accomplish that.   The Consumer Privacy Protection Act requires that corporations meet  certain baseline privacy and data security standards to keep  information they store about their customers safe, and requires that  corporations provide notice and protection to consumers in the event of  a breach. This legislation protects broad categories of data,  including, (1) social security numbers and other government-issued  identification numbers; (2) financial account information, including  credit card numbers and bank accounts; (3) online usernames and  passwords, including email names and passwords; (4) unique biometric  data, including fingerprints; (5) information about a person's physical  and mental health; (6) information about geolocation; and (7) access to  private digital photographs and videos.   It is true that not every breach can be prevented. Cyber criminals  and nation-state actors are determined and constantly looking for new  ways to pierce the most sophisticated security systems. But just as we  expect a bank to put a lock on the front door and an alarm on the vault  to protect its customers' money, we expect corporations to take  reasonable measures to protect the personal information they collect  from us. Unfortunately, many of the corporations that profit from the  very information that we entrust them to protect, have woefully  inadequate measures to secure this information. For others, security is  simply not a priority. American consumers deserve better and our  national security demands it.   This legislation creates civil penalties for corporations that fail  to meet the required privacy and data security standards established in  the bill or fail to provide notice and protection to consumers when a  breach occurs. The Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission,  and State attorneys general each have a role in enforcement. This  legislation also requires corporations to inform Federal law  enforcement of all large data breaches, as well as breaches that could  impact the federal government. Such notification is necessary to help  law enforcement bring these cyber criminals to justice and identify  patterns that help protect against future attacks.   Many Americans understandably assume Federal law already protects  this sensitive information--common sense tells us that it should.  Unfortunately, the reality is that it does not. States provide a  patchwork of protection, and while some laws are strong, others are  not. For example, my home state of Vermont has a strong data breach  notification law that that has been in effect since 2007. But there are  many other States that have not passed data security laws designed to  prevent data breaches.   This legislation sets a floor: a baseline standard that that protects  Americans across the country, while also freeing individual States to  provide even stronger protections to their residents. In crafting  Federal law, we must be careful not to override strong State laws, but  we also need to ensure that all Americans, regardless of where they  live, have their privacy protected. To this end, the Consumer Privacy  Protection Act preempts State law relating to data security and data  breach notification only to the extent that the protections under those  laws are weaker than those provided for in this bill. We must ensure  that consumers do not lose privacy protections they currently enjoy.  Since this bill is modeled after those States with the strongest  consumer protections, I believe it will improve protections for  consumers in nearly every State.   I am joined today by Senators Markey, Blumenthal, Wyden, Franken, and  Baldwin in introducing this legislation. These Senators have long  shared my commitment to protecting consumer privacy. This legislation  also has the support of leading consumer privacy advocates, including:  the Center for Democracy and Technology, the Consumer Federation of  America, New America's Open Technology Institute, and Public Knowledge.   Millions of Americans who have had their personal information  compromised or stolen as a result of a data breach consider this issue  to be of critical importance and a priority for the Senate. Protecting  privacy rights should be important to all of us, regardless of party or  ideology. I hope all Senators will support this common-sense measure to  better protect Americans' privacy.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Consumer  Privacy Protection Act of 2017.
