 Madam Speaker, 8 years ago the Supreme Court demolished  the Voting Rights Act, in the deluded, dangerous belief that we had  somehow overcome white supremacy and no longer needed the greatest  achievement of the Civil Rights Movement.   The next day, States began making it harder for Black and Brown  Americans to vote, initiating the biggest wave of racist voter  suppression since Jim Crow. But today, we act to restore the Voting  Rights Act. We also act to reverse the Supreme Court's recent assault  on the right to vote by passing my bill with Representative Ruben  Gallego, the Inclusive Elections Act, which is part of this package.   Having said that, let us be clear-eyed about how we got here and the  threat that remains. The John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act will not be  safe so long as six far-right justices of the Supreme Court stand ready  to destroy our democracy.
