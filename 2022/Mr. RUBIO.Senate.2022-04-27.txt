 Mr. President, for too long, Americans' taxpayer dollars  have been used as a backdoor way to help promote abortion as a family  planning service. President Trump put a stop to this. Back in 2019, he  barred the Federal Government from providing these funds, the funds  through the title X Family Planning Program, from going to entities  that refer or provide abortions, organizations such as the big business  that is known as Planned Parenthood.   Now, understand, it didn't reduce title X funding. It didn't cut one  penny of it. Instead, it directed it to organizations that do not  perform and do not promote the taking of innocent life.   Last year, unfortunately, the Biden administration, as was to be  expected, pulled the plug on this vital protection, and now we see  taxpayer money flowing once again to these abortion providers and to  their referrers. This has to stop, and that is why I have worked with  Representative Tony Gonzales in the House to introduce the  Congressional Review Act of title X to ensure that not one more  taxpayer dollar is used to fund the abortion industry.   By reversing this administration's ruling, abortion clinics will once  again be excluded from receiving this taxpayer money, and it would put  more money toward improving and saving lives instead of ending them.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 355, S.J.  Res 41.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I honor Mary Cecile Barreto on the  celebration of her 100th birthday.   Mary Cecile Barreto was born in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, Canada  on April 19, 1922. Seeking new opportunities, she and her parents moved  to Miami, FL, in 1925. She attended Gesu Catholic School, joined  several school clubs, was crowned Miss Gesu, and met Roger Barreto, her  high school sweetheart whom she married after graduation.   Cecile worked as a secretary at the Pan American Airlines Seaplane  Terminal in Miami before giving birth to seven sons and four daughters.  Her children were raised with both her Canadian roots, as well as her  husband's Hispanic upbringing. French and Spanish were regularly spoken  throughout their home.   Cecile made time for each of her children and made them feel special.  She is a kind listener who is always there for them, no matter how busy  their days are. Under her guidance, her children grew up to become a  Miami Beach Police chief, real estate agents, Super Bowl host committee  chairs, and a Miami-Dade Rescue deputy chief.  [[Page S2188]]    In her free time, Cecile participates in the Miami Herald's write-in  competitions, answering numerous topics and writing jingles. She has  won many prizes for her answers to the competitions and even donated a  trip to Washington, DC, to her sister for her honeymoon.   During the holidays, it is not uncommon for 40 or more people to  gather in her home to celebrate. Cecile invited not only family and  friends, but also those who may not have a place to be or anyone to  spend time with.   Cecile has lived a full life and has made countless differences for  her community over the past 100 years. My wife Jeanette and I offer our  best wishes to Cecile and hope the coming year will bring her much  happiness and good health. May God bless her and her family during this  time of celebration.                            ____________________
