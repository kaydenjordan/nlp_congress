 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  McCaul) for yielding.   With respect to my friend from Massachusetts, Representative Moulton,  I was asked tough questions in the Middle East as well by my soldiers.  I was asked: ``How do we kill our enemy?'' And I was asked, perhaps  more jarring: ``How do we live and go home?''   We need two things on the front lines. We need speed, and we need  lethality. This body has proven itself incapable of empowering our  troops to act with speed and lethality.   Operations are dangerous. When I went out doing combat and rebuilding  operations on the front lines in two conflict environments, I was very  noticeable, Mr. Speaker. I am a White guy. I am pretty upfront about  that. But you better believe that they know I was a soft target. It is  important for my own survivability that, should anything happen to me,  they know that a Reaper drone is going to rain a Hellfire missile down  on them.   That is deterrence. That works far better than appeasement.   I would also like to add that we talked a lot about the process.  Supposedly, we are attacking the process and not reality. Well, the  reality is that I have had friends of mine tortured to death, friends  of mine I knew very well in conflict environments.   It is in their spirit that I say this. This is awful, what we are  doing. We need to empower our Commander in Chief. Despite your hatred  of his policy, we need to empower him to act with decisiveness.
