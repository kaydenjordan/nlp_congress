 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize four members of the Boone  and Church Band, who recently won the 95th Annual Future Farmers of  America (FFA) National Convention Talent Competition in Indianapolis,  Indiana.   Jaxton Boone, Ethan Church, Eli Church, and Walker Boone performed  before a crowd of 62,000 at the convention and came away with a  resounding victory, and they were the only applicants from North  Carolina.   What is most impressive, Mr. Speaker, is the backgrounds of these  young men. Eli, Ethan, and Jaxton are all current high school students,  and Walker is a full-time college student.   Two others associated with the Boone and Church Band deserve  recognition: Colton Boone, another recent high school graduate  balancing college courses with a full-time job, and Lynn Church, a  father who manages the group.   The six-member group has traveled across western North Carolina since  2016 and has performed at church services, fairs, and even festivals.   Mr. Speaker, I had the great fortune of hearing them this weekend at  the Avery County Historical Museum, and I saw firsthand how great they  are. While they make beautiful music, they also really enjoy themselves  as they perform. It was so uplifting to be there to see that.    Their caliber of talent is awe-inspiring, Mr. Speaker. Based on the  variety of songs that they perform, they use 10 different instruments,  such as a banjo, mandolin, fiddle, and piano, to name a few.   Together, they blend a variety of music styles, including bluegrass  and southern gospel. But what is truly magnificent, aside from their  wonderful talents, is how these musicians live the truth found within  the gospel every single day. The lives they lead and their relationship  with God is directly reflected in the music they share with so many  people.   Truly, they are a shining example of what makes western North  Carolina so great.   Congratulations, again, to the Boone and Church Band on this  wonderful accomplishment.   May God continue to bless them and their great work.                               Save Franchisees     Mr. Speaker, the Biden administration's destructive  regulatory agenda is jeopardizing the franchise model. President Biden  will stop at nothing to advance big labor's agenda, even if it means  harming workers. The Biden administration is working overtime to shove  as many workers as possible into unions, regardless of worker  preference.   The Biden administration's proposed joint employer rule will  fundamentally destroy the franchise model by taking autonomy away from  individual franchise owners, depriving them of the ability to run their  own businesses.   Being able to own a franchise business, like a fast-food restaurant,  is a ticket to the American Dream, especially for women and minorities.   Americans who invested their time and energy into building a business  do not deserve to have it snatched away all because President Biden  wants to appease big labor.   To save the American Dream for these businessowners and promote  better opportunities for our entire workforce, Republicans will oppose  this dangerous power grab. Instead, we will support policies that put  workers and job creators first.                            ____________________
