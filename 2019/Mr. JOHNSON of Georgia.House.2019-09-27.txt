 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to  the expansion of the Alcantara Launch Center in Brazil.   This agreement between the Trump and Bolsonaro administrations  threatens to displace hundreds of Afro-Brazilian quilombo families from  their land, further disparaging an already marginalized community.   Brazil's Constitution provides explicit protections for quilombo  lands, and Trump and Bolsonaro are blatantly disregarding these  protections with this land grab.   Previous expansions of this military base have displaced over 300  families. The expansion of that base on quilombo land will displace  some additional 800 quilombo families from their constitutionally  protected ancestral land.   I appreciate America's longstanding relationship with Brazil;  however, I cannot support policies that dehumanize native people and  bring harm to vulnerable communities in Brazil.   Madam Speaker, I oppose this agreement, and I urge my colleagues to  do the same.                            ____________________
