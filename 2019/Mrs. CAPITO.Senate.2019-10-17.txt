 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize my  friend John Robertson, a dedicated servant to the great people of West  Virginia and native of our State capital, Charleston. After a 41-year  career, John is retiring as the general manager of the Charleston  Coliseum and Convention Center. Throughout these past four decades,  John's leadership has transformed the facility, turning it into one of  the cultural epicenters of our State.   In August of 1978, with a bachelor's degree from the University of  Charleston under his belt, John began his career as an assistant  manager for the Charleston Civic Center. At the time, the building was  in its fledgling stages, having just broken ground the month before.  For John, it was all hands on deck, and he hit the ground running,  assisting in structural related duties, as well as the concession stand  operations. Two years later, in August of 1980, the Charleston Civic  Center was host to its first big concert--the band Queen.   With John's vision and leadership at the helm, this was just the  beginning for the Charleston Civic Center. Soon after the center was  completed, the necessary renovations to turn the civic center into  exhibit and meeting facilities were well under way. Through additional  construction, two parking structures were placed contiguous to the  Civic Center, creating an entirely different complex by 1983.   John's greatest of many accomplishments has come within the past few  years, when approval of a city sales tax appropriated the proper  funding to build the state-of-the-art facility that he had always  dreamed of creating for his home town. John worked tirelessly with the  mayor and Charleston city council, civic center board members, his  staff, city planners, and consulting firms to complete the new  Charleston Coliseum and Convention Center in the fall of 2018. This  achievement is underscored by the fact that the center was continually  operated during the entire construction period.   The Charleston Civic Center is held so fondly in the memories of so  many West Virginians. For some, it is where they saw their favorite  band perform live for the first time. For others, it was where they  were able to bring home a State basketball title. From Garth Brooks  concerts, to oldtime car shows, West Virginia versus Marshall  basketball games or the West Virginia Book Festival, one thing has  remained the same; that is, John's dedication to the citizens of  Charleston through his tireless work to make sure that every detail of  every event, no matter how big or small, held at the Charleston Civic  Center was in place.   In retirement, John will now have more time to spend with his loving  wife Kimberly, his daughters Bethany and Allyson, and his grandchildren  Lucy and Henry, but the lasting effects of what he did for our State  and the city of Charleston will continue on for generations to come. I  wish John all the best as he continues to make a difference in his  community with his unwavering diligence and kind soul. It is truly an  honor to call you friend and fellow West Virginian.                            ____________________
