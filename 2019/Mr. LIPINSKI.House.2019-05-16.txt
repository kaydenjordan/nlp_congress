 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, American families increasingly struggle with rising  healthcare costs. That is why I am pleased to support the underlying  bill which contains some commonsense provisions that will protect  consumers, lower drug prices, and stabilize the individual insurance  market, which will provide families with some needed relief.   The amendment I am offering will further help Americans who purchased  health insurance on healthcare.gov.   Americans in 39 States without a State-based exchange depend on  healthcare.gov to purchase insurance during open enrollment. This past  year, over 8.4 million plan selections were made on this website.   Over the past 2 years, the Department of Health and Human Services  had announced maintenance outages on healthcare.gov for over 12 hours  every Sunday during open enrollment. I am an engineer. I understand the  complexity of this website and the heavy volume of users, which means  that routine maintenance is necessary, even during open enrollment.  However, I want to ensure that HHS is doing all it can to ensure this  maintenance is conducted in a way that has the least impact on  consumers.   Families need ample time to choose health insurance plans. We must  make sure that enrollment is not being negatively impacted by these  outages. My amendment would require a GAO study to determine if  healthcare.gov outages are having a negative impact on enrollment.   HHS claims that maintenance is scheduled for times of low site  traffic, but they have not provided data to support this claim. I know  that when I am using the online exchange to purchase my insurance each  year, I often will try to do it on a Sunday when I have free time. This  may be an anomaly. We need to figure this out.   What the GAO study would provide is clarity on the best time to  schedule maintenance. This would help us to make sure HHS is doing  right by Americans as they navigate the complex process of buying  health insurance.   Mr. Chairman, this is a simple, commonsense amendment. I urge a  ``yes'' vote on this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I think this is a commonsense amendment. I ask GAO to look at the  study and say: Okay. What is the best time to take healthcare.gov  offline to do maintenance?   Let's do this the right way. As an engineer, that is the way I think.  I think most companies would look at it this way.   So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.                                time  1645
