 Madam Speaker, which is it? For 3 months, the Democrats  told us the 2020 election was fine. There was no need for an  investigation. It was flawless. But, today, they tell us we need to  change election law with an 800-page bill. Think about it. We need all  of this? 800 pages to fix a flawless election? Maybe something else is  going on here.   Last year, COVID was the pretext for making changes to election law.  Partisan courts and partisan secretaries of State went around State  legislatures in an unconstitutional fashion and changed election law in  some States,  [[Page H991]]  and now they want to make sure those unconstitutional changes in a few  States become the law in all States. That is what this is about.   This isn't the first time Democrats have tried to have it both ways,  talked out of both sides of their mouth. Remember what they said.   Democrats said: Republicans tried to overturn the will of the people  on January 6, 2021, when we objected to six States.   But on January 6, 2017, they objected to ten states. The Democrat  chair of the Rules Committee objected to Alabama, a State President  Trump won by 30 points. The lead impeachment manager objected to  Florida, and the chairwoman of the Financial Services Committee  objected to Wyoming. For goodness sake, a State that President Trump  won by 40 points. They tried to overturn the will of the people in  Wyoming.   We know what this is about. This is about raw politics, and we should  all vote ``no.''
