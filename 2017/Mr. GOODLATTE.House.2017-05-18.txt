 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on H.R. 115.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 323, I call  up the bill (H.R. 115) to amend title 18, United States Code, to  provide additional aggravating factors for the imposition of the death  penalty based on the status of the victim, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, Federal law provides a list of 16 aggravating factors a  jury is required to consider when deciding whether a death sentence is  warranted in a Federal capital case. These factors include whether the  defendant acted in an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner;  whether the defendant engaged in substantial planning and  premeditation; whether the victim was particularly vulnerable; and  whether the victim was a high public official.   High public official, as defined in the statute, includes a litany of  high-ranking public persons from the President, to a foreign head of  state, to a judge or law enforcement officer. Currently, however, the  law only contains specific protections for Federal officers, not State  and local officers.   H.R. 115, the Thin Blue Line Act, introduced by my colleague, Mr.  Buchanan, amends Federal law to add the killing of a State or local law  enforcement officer as an aggravating factor for a jury to determine  during the sentencing phase of a trial, when the jury is considering  whether a sentence of death is justified.   This legislation enjoys widespread support in the law enforcement  community. And, Mr. Speaker, we can all understand why. In recent  years, police officers across our Nation have laid down their lives in  the service of their communities, often with little recognition or  support.   According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, 17  police officers have already died as a result of gunfire this year.  Most recently, 2 days ago, Deputy Sheriff Mason Moore of the Broadwater  County, Montana, Sheriff's Office was shot and killed during a routine  traffic stop. We honor Deputy Moore's sacrifice, which is a stark  reminder of how a routine event can quickly turn fatal for an officer  of the law.   Now, Mr. Speaker, it is true that the scenarios where the provision  in H.R. 115 applies may be limited. It is true that the vast majority  of homicide cases are prosecuted in State courts. It is also true that  the circumstances where a defendant killed a State or local law  enforcement officer during the commission of a Federal capital offense  are probably limited.   But H.R. 115 is, nevertheless, vitally important in the scenarios  where it will apply--for example, in many terrorism cases. My  colleagues may not remember that the terrorist who bombed the Boston  Marathon also murdered an MIT police officer during their flight from  the law. H.R. 115 would also apply to situations where a State or local  officer is killed serving as a member of a Federal task force. And it  would cover volunteer first responders, who are, of course, authorized  by law to carry out their duties.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation sends a simple message: The stalking  and killing of law enforcement officers will not be tolerated.   H.R. 115 is straightforward, commonsense legislation that will  provide all the men and women of law enforcement, who serve and protect  our communities every day, with the support they deserve.   As we conclude the 2017 National Police Week, I urge my colleagues to  support this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters in support of the bill.                                             National Association of                                      Police Organizations, Inc.,                                    Alexandria, VA, January 5, 2017.      Hon. Vern Buchanan,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Buchanan: On behalf of the National       Association of Police Organizations (NAPO), I am writing to       you to express our strong support for the Thin Blue Line Act.        NAPO is a coalition of police units and associations from       across the United States that serves to advance the interests       of America's law enforcement through legislative and legal       advocacy, political action, and education. Founded in 1978,       NAPO now represents more than 1,000 police units and       associations, including the Florida Police Benevolent       Association, 241,000 sworn law enforcement officers, and more       than 100,000 citizens who share a common dedication to fair       and effective crime control and law enforcement.        The Thin Blue Line Act increases penalties on those who       harm or target for harm public safety officers by making the       murder or attempted murder of a local police officer,       firefighter, or first responder an aggravating factor in       death penalty determinations.        This bill is critical, as law enforcement officer assaults,       injuries, and deaths have increased sharply in recent years.       In 2016 alone, ambush-style killings of law enforcement       officers increased by 167 percent. Establishing stricter       penalties for those who harm or target for harm law       enforcement officers will deter crime. Any persons       contemplating harming an office must know that they will face       serious punishments. NAPO strongly believes that increased       penalties make important differences in the attitudes of       criminals toward public safety officers, and ensure       protection for the community.        We thank you for your continued support of the law       enforcement community and we look forward to working with you       to pass this important legislation.            Sincerely,                                     William J. Johnson, Esq., CAE,      Executive Director.                                   ____                                                  National Fraternal                                                 Order of Police,                                     Washington, DC, 9 January 2017.      Hon. Vernon G. Buchanan,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Buchanan: I am writing on behalf of the       members of the Fraternal Order of Police to advise you of our       strong support for H.R. 115, the ``Thin Blue Line Act.''        The ``Thin Blue Line Act'' increases the penalty for an       individual who targets, kills, or attempts to kill a person       who is a law enforcement officer, firefighter or any other       public safety officer, while he or she was engaged in the       performance of his or her official duties, because of the       performance of his or her official duties, or because of his       or her status as a public official or employee.        Law enforcement officers have always faced threats while on       duty but within the past few years, officers have become a       target for violence solely because of the uniform they wear.       As you know, the FOP has called upon Congress to expand the       current Federal hate crimes law to include law enforcement       officers for this very reason.        Of the 63 deaths by gunfire suffered by law enforcement in       2016, 21 of them--that's 33%--were ambush killings. These       were deliberate and sadly successful efforts by individuals       who set out to kill a police officer:        The ambush attack against the Dallas Police Department; the       deadliest day for law enforcement since 9/11 that saw 5       officers killed from gunfire;        The ambush attack against members of the Baton Rouge Police       Department that saw 3 officers killed from gunfire;        The ambush attack against 2 Iowa police officers, Scott       Martin and Anthony Beminio who were killed as they sat in       their respective patrol cars;        Officer Thomas Cottrell of the Danville Police Department       (OH) was killed by ambush.        All of these officers died because of the uniforms they       were wearing. Those in our profession have always been in       harm's way. It is our job to protect others but it should not       be ``part of the job'' to be a target of someone who is       looking simply to kill a cop. We do not accept that our       uniforms alone make us targets because someone was driven to       rage over a perceived injustice or desires to strike a blow       against our civil government.        On behalf of more than 330,000 members of the Fraternal       Order of Police, I want to  [[Page H4334]]       thank you for introducing this legislation and amendment. If       I can be of any further help, please do not hesitate to       contact me or Executive Director Jim Pasco in my Washington       office.            Sincerely,                                                  Chuck Canterbury,      National President.                                   ____           Sergeants Benevolent Association, Police Department, City             of New York,                                                  January 17, 2017.      Hon. Vern Buchanan,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Buchanan: I am writing on behalf of the       more than 13,000 members of the Sergeants Benevolent       Association of the New York City Police Department to advise       you of our strong support for H.R. 115, the ``Thin Blue Line       Act.''        For too long, members of the NYPD, along with law       enforcement officers across this nation, have been targets.       There has been a proliferation of groups and pundits       impugning the motives and mission of law enforcement. They do       so with no regard for the impact it has on our ability to       protect life, property, and the freedoms we all hold dear.       These constant attacks and the excessive, exaggerated       rhetoric of anti-police elements have led some to declare an       open season on police officers, and to welcome with cheers       and praise the cowardly criminals who target law enforcement       officers with acts of violence. We saw this first hand in New       York City in December 2014, when Officers Wenjian Liu and       Rafael Ramos were ambushed and senselessly murdered as they       sat in their radio car on a Brooklyn street corner.       Unfortunately, they are not alone. According to the National       Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, in 2016 there were 21       police officers killed in ambush-style attacks. Shockingly,       20 of these officers were killed in eight multiple-shooting       death incidents--such as those that claimed the lives of 8       officers in Baton Rouge, LA and Dallas, TX--the highest total       of any year since 1932.        It is for these reasons and many others that the       legislation you have introduced is so important. The ``Thin       Blue Line Act'' would make the murder or attempted murder of       police officers, prosecutors, firefighters, and other first       responders at any level of government an aggravating factor       in federal death penalty determinations. The bill applies to       things like the interstate homicide of an officer, and is       applicable whether the officer is murdered on duty, because       of the performance of their duty, or because of their status       as a public official. While we know that law enforcement       officers will continue to be targets, regardless of their       uniform and whether they are on duty or off, active or       retired, this legislation sends the message that any action       to target law enforcement officers for murder or violence       will be met with the harshest of penalties. And that is a       message that is long overdue.        On behalf of the membership of our organization, thank you       for your leadership on this important issue. We look forward       to working with you to see it swiftly enacted into law.            Sincerely,                                                        Ed Mullins,      President.                                   ____                                               Major County Sheriffs                                                      of America,                                                     April 25, 2017.      Hon. Vern Buchanan,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Buchanan: I write to you today on a matter       of significant importance to the Major County Sheriffs of       America (MCSA) and all of America's law enforcement       professionals. MCSA is an association of elected Sheriffs       representing the Nation's largest counties with populations       of 500,000 or more. Collectively, we represent more than 100       million Americans.        As Vice President in charge of Government Affairs for the       MCSA, I am pleased to express our association's support of       your legislation, the Thin Blue Line Act. This legislation       would make the murder of law enforcement officers,       firefighters and other first responders an aggravating factor       in capital punishment determinations.        In 2016, one hundred forty-four officers died in the line       of duty and to date, line of duty deaths are up 10 percent.       The targeting of law enforcement officers is unconscionable       and those who commit such heinous acts should be prosecuted       to the fullest extent of the law. Law enforcement officers       and other first responders have the right to go home to their       families at the end of their shifts.        The Thin Blue Line Act is a step in the right direction and       your work on this legislation is sincerely appreciated. We       value your support and look forward to working with you in       the future.                                            Michael J. Bouchard,                                       Sheriff, Oakland County (MI),                                Vice President--Government Affairs.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, at this time, I am pleased to yield 2  minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Buchanan), the chief sponsor  of the legislation.
