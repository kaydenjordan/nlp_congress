 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a  father, son, and public servant, Sheriff's Deputy Peter John Herrera,  who passed away at the age of 35 on Sunday, March 24, after being  fatally shot at a traffic stop.   A lifelong El Pasoan, Sheriff's Deputy Herrera proudly served the El  Paso County Sheriff's Office for 11 years. His leadership was  exemplary. He was widely commended by his fellow officers for always  wearing his badge with pride. He was the epitome of a public servant  who loved his community and demonstrated it every day.   He was highly respected, supported, and loved by many as a devoted  father, husband, brother, and friend. The community of El Paso mourns  his untimely death, but we are endlessly thankful for his unwavering  service and contributions to our community. It was a privilege to stand  alongside so many El Pasoans last week as he was laid to rest.   Sheriff's Deputy Peter Herrera's memory will live on among us for  dedicating his life to protecting and serving with integrity and  purpose.                            ____________________
