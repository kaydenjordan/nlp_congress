 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in  the Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 767) to establish the Stop,  Observe, Ask, and Respond to Health and Wellness Training pilot program  to address human trafficking in the health care system.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the Senate amendment is as follows:   Senate amendment:         Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the       following:       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Montana (Mr. Gianforte), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed working with my colleague from  New Mexico in moving this bill forward.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 767, the SOAR Act, will head to the President's  desk after passage today. It is critical in ensuring adequate treatment  of victims of human trafficking.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 2322) to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to  define the term natural cheese.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2322         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Codifying Useful Regulatory       Definitions Act'' or the ``CURD Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds as follows:        (1) There is a need to define the term ``natural cheese''       in order to maintain transparency and consistency for       consumers so that they may differentiate ``natural cheese''       from ``process cheese''.        (2) The term ``natural cheese'' has been used within the       cheese making industry for more than 50 years and is well-      established.       SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF NATURAL CHEESE.         (a) Definition.--Section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and       Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321) is amended by adding at the end       the following:        ``(ss)(1) The term `natural cheese' means cheese that is a       ripened or unripened soft, semi-soft, or hard product, which       may be coated, that is produced--        ``(A) by--        ``(i) coagulating wholly or partly the protein of milk,       skimmed milk, partly skimmed milk, cream, whey cream, or       buttermilk, or any combination of such ingredients, through       the action of rennet or other suitable coagulating agents,       and by partially draining the whey resulting from the       coagulation, while respecting the principle that cheese-      making results in a concentration of milk protein (in       particular, the casein portion), and that consequently, the       protein content of the cheese will be distinctly higher than       the protein level of the blend of the above milk materials       from which the cheese was made; or        ``(ii) processing techniques involving coagulation of the       protein of milk or products obtained from milk to produce an       end-product with similar physical, chemical, and organoleptic       characteristics as the product described in subclause (i);       and        ``(iii) including the addition of safe and suitable non-      milk derived ingredients of the type permitted in the       standards of identity described in clause (B) as natural       cheese; or        ``(B) in accordance with standards of identity under part       133 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (or any       successor regulations), other than the standards described in       subparagraph (2) or any future standards adopted by the       Secretary in accordance with subparagraph (2)(I).        ``(2) Such term does not include--        ``(A) pasteurized process cheeses as defined in section       133.169, 133.170, or 133.171 of title 21, Code of Federal       Regulations (or any successor regulations);        ``(B) pasteurized process cheese foods as defined in       section 133.173 or 133.174 of title 21, Code of Federal       Regulations (or any successor regulations);        ``(C) pasteurized cheese spreads as defined in section       133.175, 133.176, or 133.178 of title 21, Code of Federal       Regulations (or any successor regulations);        ``(D) pasteurized process cheese spreads as defined in       section 133.179 or 133.180 of title 21, Code of Federal       Regulations (or any successor regulations);        ``(E) pasteurized blended cheeses as defined in section       133.167 or 133.168 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations       (or any successor regulations);        ``(F) any products comparable to any product described in       any of clauses (A) through (E); or        ``(G) cold pack cheeses as defined in section 133.123,       133.124, or 133.125 title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (or       any successor regulations);        ``(H) grated American cheese food as defined in section       133.147 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (or any       successor regulations); or        ``(I) any other product the Secretary may designate as a       process cheese.        ``(3) For purposes of this paragraph, the term `milk' has       the meaning given such term in section 133.3 of title 21,       Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulations)       and includes the lacteal secretions from animals other than       cows.''.        (b) Labeling.--Section 403 of the Federal Food Drug and       Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 343) is amended by adding at the end       the following:        ``(z) If its label or labeling includes the term `natural       cheese' as a factual descriptor of a category of cheese       unless the food meets the definition of natural cheese under       section 201(ss), except that nothing in this paragraph shall       prohibit the use of the term `natural' or `all-natural', or a       similar claim or statement with respect to a food in a manner       that is consistent with regulations, guidance, or policy       statements issued by the Secretary.''.        (c) National Uniformity.--Section 403A(a)(2) of the Federal       Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 343-1(a)(2)) is       amended by striking ``or 403(w)'' and inserting ``403(w), or       403(z)''.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H10426]]    Mr. Speaker, before us today is a bill to define the term ``natural  cheese.'' The House sponsor is our Speaker from Wisconsin, obviously,  from the cheese State and the dairy State. What we are debating is S.  2322, the CURD Act.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support its passage, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I support S. 2322, the CURD Act, which  would define the term ``natural cheese'' within the Federal statute  and, with passage, head to the President's desk.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support the bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
