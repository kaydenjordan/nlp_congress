 Mr. Speaker, I am here to speak in support of the Farm  Workforce Modernization Act, an event that should be a cause of joy for  Members on both sides of the aisle and for America.   We have tried and failed for dozens of years to deal with the issue  of the farm workforce. We have never been able to get a majority vote  on the floor of this House. So this year, we tried a different  approach.   Starting last March, we had stakeholders, the United Farm Workers  Union, the growers and the farmers sit down together, listen to each  other, understand each other and what their needs were. They were  joined by a bipartisan group of members who cared about this issue, and  we came up with this bill, a compromise that does this:   It secures the status of the million or so farm workers who don't  have their proper documentation by allowing them to get a certified  agriculture worker visa that is renewable, and ultimately, if they  wish, after a significant period of time, to apply for legal permanent  residence. It streamlines the H-2A program, so it works better for  employers and actually works better for workers.   We stabilized the wages. We allowed the dairy industry to get access  to the H-2A program. We increased the availability of farmworker  housing while lowering the cost to employers.   And, finally, once this whole thing is implemented, we have always  believed that if you have a workable immigration system, you ought to  enforce it. And so we will implement E-Verify after full  implementation, but only for the Ag sector.   I would note that the Farm Labor Organizing Committee of the AFL-CIO,  UFW, Farmworker Justice, the Catholic Bishops--over 300 agricultural  organizations have asked that we pass this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter in support of the Farm  Workforce Modernization Act.                                                 November 18, 2019.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader McCarthy: The       undersigned groups, representing a broad cross-section of       agriculture and its allies, urge you to advance the Farm       Workforce Modernization Act (H.R. 5038) through the House to       address the labor crisis facing American agriculture. A       stable, legal workforce is needed to ensure farmers and       ranchers have the ability to continue producing an abundant,       safe, and affordable food supply.        The effects of agriculture's critical shortage of labor       reach far beyond the farm gate, negatively impacting our       economic competitiveness, local economies, and jobs.       Economists have found that every farm worker engaged in high-      value, labor-intensive crop and livestock production sustains       two to three off-farm jobs. As foreign producers take       advantage of our labor shortage and gain market share,       America will export not only our food production but also       thousands of these farm-dependent jobs. Securing a reliable       and skilled workforce is essential, not only for the       agricultural industry but for the U.S. economy as a whole.        The House must pass legislation that preserves       agriculture's experienced workforce by allowing current farm       workers to earn legal status. For future needs, legislation       must include an agricultural worker visa program that       provides access to a legal and reliable workforce moving       forward. This visa program needs to be more accessible,       predictable, and flexible to meet the needs of producers,       including those with year-round labor needs, such as dairy       and livestock which currently do not have meaningful access       to any program.        While the bill does include a few provisions that raise       significant concerns for the agricultural community, we are       committed to working together throughout the legislative       process to fully address these issues. It is vital to move       the Farm Workforce Modernization Act (H.R. 5038) through the       House as a significant step in working to meet the  [[Page H10037]]       labor needs of agriculture, both now and in the future.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleagues, Mr.  Newhouse, Mr. Simpson, Mr. LaMalfa, Mr. Diaz-Balart, Mr. Panetta, Mr.  Costa, Mr. Correa, Ms. Escobar, Mr. Peterson--I am going to get in  trouble because there are more people than I can mention in the 15  seconds, but this has been a very large bipartisan effort.  [[Page H10038]]  It should be a model on how we can legislate and get something done for  the American people.    Mr. Speaker, I want to make a few additional comments on  the Farm Workforce Modernization Act since the gentlewoman from Florida  had a little bit of time to provide.   There have been some who have criticized, I think incorrectly, the  bill, that it does not actually stabilize wages in the H-2A program.  That is incorrect.   The bargain that was made by the United Farm Workers union and the  various employer groups was to: first, freeze wages for 1 year; second,  to limit how fast wages could rise to 3.25 percent or how low to 1.5  percent; and also, to preclude changes in the middle of a contract, so  there would be stability.   I just wanted to get that issue on the table. People who  misunderstand it will be relieved to know that that is not correct.   I want to address another issue, which has to do with the  legalization provision. We have several million farmworkers in the  United States today. Half of them don't have their proper papers. They  are living in a state of fear.   I was out in the Central Valley recently. These are hardworking  people who have been here for decades in some cases. There is no line  for them to get into to get legal. They are so afraid that they are  afraid to go to mass.   This bill allows them to apply for a temporary visa, an agricultural  worker visa that is renewable. It allows them to go back and forth if  they need to go to a funeral in their country of birth. It allows them  to work legally.   After an extended period of time, if they want, they can apply to  become legal permanent residents of the United States, or they can just  stay on their temporary visas. Their families are included because we  should not be in the position of breaking up hardworking families.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to note that this bill is the  product of a lot of time. It was introduced  [[Page H10041]]  in October. It was marked up in the Judiciary Committee before  Thanksgiving, and here we are today, not that far from Christmas,  finally, hopefully, passing it.   We have been in discussions with various Senators. There is nothing  ever for sure with the United States Senate, but I will say there is a  recognition and an interest that doing nothing is not acceptable for  farmers or for farmworkers.   I hope we can pass this bill today.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill today. I am proud  of the bipartisan work that was done to get us to this point.  Representatives Newhouse, Simpson, LaMalfa, Diaz-Balart, Upton--so many  others on the Republican side--here: Panetta, Peterson, Carbajal, Cox,  Harder, Correa, Costa, Escobar--I better stop because there are more  people who toiled on this legislation for almost a year.   Now, it is not always easy to find common ground even when you have a  common goal, but if you listen to each other, if you work hard, you can  get it done. We have been several decades in failing to accomplish  anything in this arena. This is a chance to solve a problem for America  that needs a solution.   It is the product of bipartisan negotiation, and I will say, also  amongst stakeholders. We have the United Farm Workers Union meeting and  discussing points of concern with growers and farmers all across the  United States.   You know, I grew up in a union household, and I was taught to respect  collective bargaining. And when it comes to wages, hours, and working  conditions, the union and all those employers had a robust discussion,  and our bipartisan group decided to respect the work that they put into  it.   This bill is a compromise. It is not exactly what I would have  written, but it does stabilize the workforce. We have farmworkers who  have been here for a very long time without their papers, living in  fear, and in some cases, being arrested and deported. We need to allow  them to get an agricultural worker visa that is temporary and renewable  so they can do the work we need them to do and that their employers  need them to do.   We also need to stabilize the H-2A program, which this bill does. It  simplifies and it also stabilizes wages. It is a good solution and one  of the things we have always said--those of us who think the  immigration laws ought to be reformed--is when you have a workable  system, you ought to be willing to enforce that system.   And so what we have in this bill is when these agricultural reforms  are implemented, we will institute the E-Verify program on the  agricultural sector. And I think that is the right thing to do.    Now, the ranking member of the subcommittee has raised a couple of  [[Page H10069]]  issues, and I want to deal with them just briefly. You know, we have  robust protections against criminality in this bill. And I would like  to note, that the bars that we have put into this bill are  substantially more than was in the bill proposed by Representative  Goodlatte that most Republicans voted for in the last Congress. He  didn't have anything additional. We do. We have security bars; we have  criminal bars that are additional.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself an additional 15 seconds.   Mr. Speaker, any felony conviction, any aggravated felony conviction,  more than two misdemeanors of any kind, we have the ability in the  Department of Homeland Security to simply deny the visa if there is any  concern about the conduct of the applicant.   Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. We should support it, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would just note that we write the laws,  and we get to decide who can come and who can't come, and that is what  this bill does.   I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a  member of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Costa), who has worked so very hard on this bill and  represents an area where agriculture is king.    Mr. Speaker, Representative Sylvia Garcia, a member of  the Judiciary Committee, and a former cotton picker, will submit a  statement in support of this bill.   And I would just note, for the prior speaker, that the Florida Agri- Women, the Florida Blueberry Growers Association, the Florida Citrus  Mutual, Florida Fruit & Vegetable Association, Florida Nursery, Florida  Strawberry, and Florida Tomato Exchange think this bill will work.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Castro).    Mr. Speaker, it is really a great honor to yield 1  minute to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Schrier), a freshman  Member, but a person who has worked very hard behind the scenes to help  advance this bill.                                time  1515     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Schrader), someone who has done a great deal of work and  helped us get here today.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Crow), a freshman Member who has worked behind the scenes  to help bring us here today.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), someone who has been through a lot. She is a senior  Member of the House and the most senior woman in the House, has served  the most time.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Ohio an  additional 15 seconds.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains on  each side.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I would like to first make a comment in lieu of the  testimony that was going to be given by Representative Clay from  Missouri. Unfortunately--or fortunately; I don't know what they are  voting on--the Financial Services Committee is meeting, and he has been  detained there voting in that committee.  [[Page H10077]]    Mr. Clay was here to talk about an important thing that the Financial  Services Committee helped us with in the drafting of this bill, and  that is the improvement in the availability of farmworker housing while  lowering employer costs as it relates to housing, and that is a win. We  need to make sure that H-2A workers who come to the United States have  a decent place to live while they are here working.   Now, preserving the existing housing stock, including by adopting  H.R. 3620, the Strategy and Investment in Rural Housing Preservation  Act, which authorizes $1 billion to rehabilitate housing that is aging  out of the USDA incentives program, is included in this bill.   Incentivizing new housing by tripling funding for USDA section 514  and 516 rural housing loan and grant programs and doubling funding for  section 512 rental assistance programs, increasing the USDA per project  loan limitation, and granting operating subsidies to 514, 516 property  owners who house H-2A workers is going to be a real important boost to  rural America. Not only will it increase the amount of housing and the  quality of housing, but it will also inject new economic activity in  rural America. And we all know that, economically, rural America is  suffering in terms of jobs more than other parts of the country.   So this is a win-win-win. It is a win for farmers by lowering their  costs; it is a win for H-2A migrant workers so they can have a decent  place to live; and it is a win for people who live in rural America who  are going to be building these facilities, who will see an injection of  funds to improve their economy.   So Mr. Clay could not be here to talk about his bill, but I am  talking about it on his behalf.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Panetta), the Representative for Salinas Valley, someone who has  worked on this bill for a huge amount of time--not only he, but his  staff.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, this is the time to act. For many years, under the  leadership of different Speakers with different majorities, we have  talked about dealing with this issue, and that is all we did: we  talked.   You know, there is never a perfect piece of legislation, but as Mr.  Panetta said, this is a darn good piece of legislation.                                time  1545    It was the one that was crafted together, and a lot of people across  America might be surprised that Republicans and Democrats sat down in a  room, along with stakeholders who often don't agree with each other,  and we worked things out. We came up with a plan that will work.   We know it will work because we have a list of close to 300  agricultural entities, farmers all across the United States, who are  asking us to please pass this bill. They know it will work.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record that list.                                                 November 18, 2019.      Hon.

Madam Speaker, I also include in the Record a list of  those who care about immigrants who are also asking us to pass this  bill: Farmworker Justice, Justice for Migrant Women, the National  Domestic Workers Alliance, the Forest Worker Center, the Service  Employees International Union.                                                 November 19, 2019.        Dear Member of Congress: We write to urge you to support       the Farm Workforce Modernization Act of 2019, HR 5038. The       bill is a bipartisan compromise representing the culmination       of hard fought negotiations to address the needs of       farmworkers and our agriculture system in the context of our       broken immigration system. Importantly, this bill recognizes       the valuable role of farmworkers in our food system by       providing an earned path to legal immigration status and       citizenship to farmworkers and their families.        If enacted, the Farm Workforce Modernization Act would       provide an opportunity for experienced agricultural workers       to apply  [[Page H10079]]       for legal status if they show employment in U.S. agriculture       and meet other criteria. At least half of the nation's       roughly 2.4 million farmworkers are undocumented immigrants       and immigration relief is urgently needed to address the       constant fear of deportation many farmworkers and their       children experience. The ability to obtain immigration status       and a path to citizenship is key to enabling farmworkers to       bargain for better working and living conditions and to       challenge serious labor abuses. This legislation would result       in a more stable farm labor force and greater food safety and       security to the benefit of employers, workers, and consumers.        The bill also would revise the existing H-2A visa program       to address concerns of both farmworkers and agricultural       employers. The compromise includes concessions made by all       sides in this debate and includes both important new       protections for farmworkers, such as new protections against       trafficking, as well as provisions sought by employers.       Importantly, for the first time, the bill would recognize the       humanity of those working here under temporary visas by       providing a path to permanent status for those who satisfy       the specified work requirements.        The Farm Workforce Modernization Act of 2019 is an       important step forward and sends a clear signal that there       are leaders in Congress ready to engage constructively on       immigration and reach across the aisle to develop sensible       policies. We encourage you to support this legislation and       join this important effort to protect farmworkers and our       nation's agricultural system.

Madam Speaker, there is a letter here from Farmworker  Justice that I include in the Record explaining why this is an  important thing to do.                             Farmworker Justice      Judiciary Committee, House of Representatives, Farmworker Justice          Statement on House Agricultural Immigration Reform Bill         Farmworker Justice supports the Farm Workforce       Modernization Act of 2019, H.R. 5038, which is under       consideration by the Judiciary Committee of the House of       Representatives. The FWMA should be approved by the Judiciary       Committee and passed by the full House.        The bipartisan bill resulted from lengthy, complex       negotiations led by Rep. Lofgren (D-CA), Chair of the       Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship, and Rep.       Newhouse (R-WA), a farmer and former Director of Washington       State's Department of Agriculture, and additional colleagues.       To help reach agreement, Members of Congress involved       farmworker advocates, including the United Farm Workers, UFW       Foundation, and Farmworker Justice, and agricultural employer       trade associations. Farmworker Justice appreciates the       scheduling of the markup of the FWMA by the Chair of the       Judiciary Committee, Rep. Nadler.        Of utmost importance, the supporters of this legislation       recognize the important contributions of farmworkers to our       nation's food and agriculture systems. An estimated 2.4       million people labor on our farms and ranches to provide us       with fruits, vegetables, milk and other food. This       legislation addresses the fundamentally unfair conditions       experienced by many farmworkers due to our nation's broken       immigration system. The large majority of the nation's       farmworkers are immigrants, and a majority lack authorized       immigration status. Undocumented farmworkers and their family       members live in fear of arrest, deportation and the breakup       of their families. In these circumstances, many farmworkers       are reluctant to challenge illegal or unfair treatment in       their workplaces and their communities. At times, they cannot       go to work due to the presence of immigration enforcement       agents. The country's farms and our food system depend on       immigrants, both documented and undocumented.        The Farm Workforce Modernization Act bill provides a path       to lawful permanent residency for undocumented farmworkers       and their family members. It would eliminate the constant       fear of deportation and family breakup that is so stressful       for many farmworker families. Removing the threat of       immigration enforcement also would reduce disruptions of       farming businesses. With legal status and a path to       citizenship, farmworkers would be better able to improve       their wages and working conditions and seek enforcement of       their labor protections. These improvements would result in a       more stable farm labor force and greater food safety and       security to the benefit of employers, workers, and consumers.       The earned legalization program's requirements are more       rigorous and expensive than we would have preferred, but are       acceptable in the effort to reach a realistic compromise.        The bill also would revise the existing H-2A agricultural       guestworker program to address farmworker and employer       concerns with the program. Farmworker advocates have pressed       for reforms to reduce widespread abuses under this flawed       program, while agricultural employers have lobbied heavily to       remove most of its modest labor protections, claiming that       the program is unduly expensive and bureaucratic. The bill's       lengthy provisions include important new protections for       farmworkers, as well as changes to address agricultural       employers' concerns. Compromise was necessary to achieve       legislation that could become law and address serious harms       imposed on farmworker families by our broken immigration       system.        Farmworker Justice supports the Farm Workforce       Modernization Act of 2019 because the bill, if passed, would       enable hundreds of thousands of farmworker families to       improve significantly their living and working conditions and       their participation in our economy and democracy.        Farmworker Justice, based in Washington, D.C., is a       national advocacy organization for farmworkers with over       thirty-five years of experience serving the farmworker       community regarding immigration and labor policy. FJ's       website contains extensive information about farmworkers,       immigration policy, labor conditions and the H-2A       agricultural guestworker program. www.farmworkerjusice.   Madam Speaker, there have been some who have suggested  privately, or even in public--the ranking member of the full committee  in the Rules Committee last night said, Well, we should be covering  chicken processing plants.   We did just one thing in this bill, and that was to deal with  agriculture. We didn't expand the definition of agriculture. There may  be issues in other parts of the American economy, but we decided to  focus on just this one thing: agriculture--not processing, not  trucking, not forestry, just agriculture.   The Laborers International Union has sent a letter in support, which  I include in the Record, endorsing this bill and noting that this bill  works in the agricultural sector and they hope that we will vote for  it.                                                          LiUNA!,                                                   December 9, 2019.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the more than 500,000       members of the Laborers' International Union of North America       (LIUNA), I want to express our support for H.R. 5038, the       bipartisan Farm Workforce Modernization Act.        Workers in agricultural industries, like those in all other       industries, must have a  [[Page H10080]]       path to legal immigration status and citizenship. H.R. 5038       does just that, providing security for millions of farm       workers and their families. This in turn will lead to better       wages and working conditions for a group of workers who have       historically been subject to horrific abuses.        H.R. 5038 also specifies that employers who try to misuse       the H-2A program in industries covered by a different guest       worker visa program (H-2B), including construction and       landscape, cannot do so. Specifically, LIUNA is pleased that       the House included language to the H-2.A program requirements       to investigate and prevent fraud in the H-2A program, as well       as to ensure that employers cannot use H-2A workers if the       majority of the worker's duties are related to Construction.        While LIUNA is supporting H.R. 5038, we want to be clear       that while many of these reforms may make sense in the       agricultural industry, it does not mean that all of the       bill's provisions are necessary or helpful for other guest       worker visa programs or workers in other industries.       Historically, agricultural workers have been treated under       different rules and laws than those in other industries, both       permanent and guest workers. All of the reforms in H.R. 5038       for the H-2A program may not work for the H-2B program, for       example. The H-2B guest worker program is commonly abused by       employers in the landscape and construction industries to       deny workers already in the U.S. access to jobs and to       exploit workers both in and out of the U.S. The H-2B program       must be significantly reformed in ways that will address the       specific abuses of our union's construction and landscape       members and foreign workers alike. LIUNA looks forward to       working with Congress on H-2B reform in the near future.        For decades, LIUNA has fought for comprehensive immigration       reform, which remains our goal. While we work toward that       end, LIUNA supports efforts including H.R. 5038 to give       vulnerable workers and their families who have suffered       historic exploitation a path to security and citizenship.       LIUNA asks that you vote for H.R. 5038, the Farm Workforce       Modernization Act.        With kind regards, I am            Sincerely yours,                                                  Terry O'Sullivan,                                                 General President.    There may be other issues when you come to other parts  of the economy. We should address those issues as well, but we are  going to have to do that by sitting down, just as we did in this case,  with the unions, with the employers, with the stakeholders to see what  the issues are and how can we craft a bipartisan solution that makes  America strong, that makes our economy work.   I am confident we will have a chance to do that.   Now, I just want to say, some of the comments made, although I am  sure made in good faith, about the bill are incorrect.   The elements, the suggestion that this will be riddled with fraud is  just simply incorrect. These antifraud measures are the same that were  included and, in fact, in some cases are tougher than were included in  the Goodlatte bill that Members supported in the last Congress.   The criminal national security bars are stronger than were included  in the Goodlatte bill in the last Congress.   And I have heard also that these farmworkers, who have worked in the  fields, who have allowed us to eat vegetables and to have a salad, that  they should get in line.   I will tell you a sad thing: There is no line for them. There is no  line. So we are creating a line with this bill. We are allowing them to  get right with the law and live lawfully, pay taxes, and do the jobs  that we need them to do, that their employers need them to do, with  dignity and without fear.   I cannot forget going out and talking to farmworkers who are so  afraid because of enforcement. They are afraid to leave their homes to  go to church on Sunday morning. That is not the kind of situation we  want to have in America.   We write the laws. We can make sure that these individuals comply  with the law. We have E-Verify in this bill. We have a system that will  work for farmers, for farmworkers, and for America.   We have done it over a period of months. We have done it bipartisan.  We have the support of American agriculture, and I hope we have the  support of a broad, bipartisan group when this bill comes to a vote  today.   Let's not disappoint the people who are counting on us. Let's stand  up and get something done, finally, on this measure that we have failed  on over and over again.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.
