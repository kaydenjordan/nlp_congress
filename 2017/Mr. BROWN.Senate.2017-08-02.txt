 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, during his campaign, President Trump made  a lot of big promises to workers in Ohio and across the country. He  told them he would look out for them.   In a letter I sent to the President 2 days after the election, on  November 10 or 11, asking the President to work with me to renegotiate  NAFTA, insisting on ``Buy American'' provisions and infrastructure, the  President scrawled across the top of the letter: ``I will never let  down workers.''   He said he would look out for them, but too often the people he puts  in charge are along the lines of this latest nominee to the National  Labor Relations Board, Marvin Kaplan. Mr. Kaplan has devoted his  career--imagine such a thing--to working to strip workers of their  rights and trying to undermine the workers' watchdog he is now seeking  to join. I never question people's motives in this body. I just don't  quite understand why somebody would devote his work life to trying to  take away workers' rights and undermine labor protections. Someone who  views unions and collective bargaining as a threat to be dealt with  rather than as essential rights to be protected has no business serving  on the National Labor Relations Board.   The National Labor Relations Board was created, in part, at this  desk. Then Senator Hugo Black of Alabama, in the early 1930s, sat at  this desk. At this desk, one of the pieces of legislation he wrote was  the minimum wage law. One of the other pieces of legislation he worked  on with Senator Wagner was the National Labor Relations Act. In those  days, people understood that you had created the National Labor  Relations Act to strengthen workers, to create workers' rights, and to  protect those workers' rights.   Mr. Kaplan's nomination sets that on its head. It is the latest in a  long, long line of evidence that we in this country  [[Page S4705]]  simply don't value work the way that we used to. Workers have  continually seen their rights undermined. Workers' wages have been  stagnant. People who work hard and play by the rules don't have the  standard of living they had in our parents' generation or even half of  a generation ago.   We see companies refusing to pay overtime to workers who have earned  it. We see companies misclassify workers so that companies can pay them  less. We see executive salaries and CEO compensation going up and up  and up. Yet for the broad middle class in this country, for people who  aspire to be middle class, for low-wage workers, they have simply not  gotten a raise for the last 20 years. So then, are we going to appoint  somebody to the National Labor Relations Board--the President says we  are going to confirm somebody to the National Labor Relations Board-- who has devoted his entire career to undermining workers, to taking  away workers' rights, to scaling back workers' protections, and to  scaling back wages--all these things we as a country never stood for?   I don't know what is happening in this country that we think it is  right to deprive workers of their wages, to take away overtime, to  basically hit workers day after day after day in their pocketbooks, all  while productivity goes up, profits go up, and while executive  compensation goes up.   When I was a kid, the average CEO-to-worker ratio of pay was about 35  to 1 or maybe even less than that. Today it is often 300 or 400 to 1.  The CEO will make 300 times what the average worker in the same company  makes. How much is enough? What moral principle says to pay a CEO 300  or 400 times what a worker makes? How much do they need? Why do they  keep doing that?   They keep doing that in part because of people like Mr. Kaplan, who  always sides with the CEOs against the workers. As we think about this,  I think everybody in this body can learn something from Pope Francis.  At the end of June, Pope Francis spoke to workers in Italy at the  Italian Confederation of Trade Unions. He was talking about something  we do not think about much in this town that really ought to be at the  heart of everything we do. He talked about the value and the dignity of  work. An employer--a CEO--cannot say that he--and it is usually a  ``he''--values work when he takes away workers' rights. He cannot say  he appreciates the dignity of work, when he scales back their wages or  cheats them out of their overtime or takes away, by misclassification,  the dollars she has earned.    When Pope Francis talked about the dignity and value of work, he  meant all work. He meant looking out for the little guy whether she  punches a time clock or fills out a timesheet or makes a salary or  earns tips, whether she is a contract worker or a temporary worker,  whether he works in a call center or in a bank or on a factory floor.   I went to my high school reunion in Mansfield, OH, about a year and a  half ago. I sat across from a bank teller who works for one of the  largest banks in the United States. She has worked at that bank for 30  years. She makes $30,000 a year, and she has worked at a bank, as a  bank teller, for most of the last 30 years. That is not respecting the  dignity of work. That is simply undermining the value of work.   Pope Francis said:         The person thrives in work. Labour is the most common form       of cooperation that humanity has generated in its history.        Work is a form of civil love . . . that makes the world       live and carry on.    Yet too often that work--the cooperation that gives life purpose and  that powers our country--does not pay off for the people who are doing  it. While corporate profits are up, the GDP is up, and executive  salaries have exploded upward, wages have barely budged. Workers simply  have not shared in the wealth they have created.   I went to an auto plant once after the passage of the North American  Free Trade Agreement. At my own expense, I flew to Texas. I was  representing a congressional district in Northeast Ohio then. I rented  a car with a friend, went across the border from New Mexico, and I  visited an auto plant in Mexico. It was an American company, but it was  in Mexico.   This auto plant looked just like an American auto plant. It was  clean, and it was up-to-date. In fact, it was newer than most of our  auto plants. The floors were clean, the workers were working hard, and  the technology was up-to-date.   Do you know the difference between the American auto plant and the  Mexican auto plant? The Mexican auto plant did not have a parking lot  because the workers did not make enough. They were not paid enough by  this American auto company. They were not paid enough in Mexico to buy  the cars they make. The work was not respected, profits were going up,  the GDP was going up, executive salaries were going up, and the workers  were not sharing in the wealth they created.   This is a universal problem. It affects blue-collar workers, and it  affects white-collar workers. It is in the industrial heartland of  Ohio, and it is on the farmlands of Iowa. It is a problem on both  coasts. People earn less. People cannot save for retirement. People  feel less stable--all while working harder, all while producing more  for their employers, which feeds right into huge executive  compensation, but they do not share in the wealth they create for their  companies. They are also less likely to have a union card that protects  them.   So the President's appointment to the National Labor Relations Board  is pretty much a guy who has tried to make sure unions do not get a  foothold in our economy and in our companies.   The Pope spoke about the labor group. He said it performs an  ``essential role for the common good.''   He said:         It gives voice to those who have none . . . unmasks the       powerful who trample on the rights of the most vulnerable       workers, defends the cause of the foreigner, the least, the       discarded.    This is the Pope talking.   Think about airline baggage handlers. Airline baggage handlers used  to make a good union wage. They used to work for United. They used to  work for American. They used to work for Delta. Now they work for  private companies that are contracted by United, American, and Delta.  Airline baggage handlers' wages in the last 10 years have dropped 40  percent. They are working just as hard--they are probably working  harder--but they are making 40 percent less than they used to.   Again, the Pope said:       . . . unmasks the powerful who trample on the rights of the       most vulnerable workers, defends the cause of the foreigner,       the least, the discarded.        The capitalism of our time does not understand the value of       the trade union because it has forgotten the social nature of       the economy, of the business. This is one of the greatest       sins.    We know from rightwing attacks on the labor movement, from so-called  right-to-work bills to Mr. Kaplan's efforts to undercut rules that  protect workers, that too many in this country do not understand the  value of the trade union.   Right now, in Mississippi, autoworkers at Nissan are organizing and  trying to form a union, and the corporation has responded. This foreign  corporation has responded with despicable intimidation tactics. This is  one of the most powerful, profitable companies in the world that is  attacking workers one at a time in Mississippi.   One worker said: ``There is no atmosphere of free choice in the  Canton plant--just fear--which is what Nissan intends.''   It is shameful the lengths that this corporation is going to--all to  prevent workers from bargaining for fair pay. It is why we need a  strong, not an undercut, weakened, emasculated National Labor Relations  Board. We need a strong National Labor Relations Board to defend these  workers and defend our laws on the books because an attack on unions is  an attack on all workers. It is an attack on our economy as a whole  because it depresses wages.   There is the idea that you give tax cuts to the richest people in the  country and that you make sure executive salaries are $5- and $10- and  $15 million. You squeeze workers so they do not get increases. Is that  a good economy? No. The money does not trickle down and build the  economy. You build the economy from the middle out. We know that.   In the 1990s, we built the economy from the middle out, with 22  million private sector jobs during the Clinton years. In the Bush  years, they had two  [[Page S4706]]  huge tax cuts for the rich under the Wall Street Journal theory that it  would trickle down and everybody would be better. There was literally  no net private sector job increase during the Bush years. There were 22  million private sector jobs in the Clinton years and zero net growth in  the Bush years. That is because, during the Bush years, they believed  the economy was built from the top down. It is not large businesses  that drive the economy--it is the workers. That is how you grow the  economy--from the middle class out. If work is not valued, Americans  cannot earn their way to better lives for their families no matter how  hard they work.   That is what I think of when I hear Pope Francis talk about the  social nature of our economy. Work has to support families and  communities. Today businesses seem to be more focused on cutting costs  than on investing in their workforces. Workers are often nothing more  than a line item in a budget, a cost to be minimized. More businesses  use temp workers, more businesses use contractors--look at the  airlines--and more businesses use subcontractors. They pay a lower  wage. They provide less job security. They roll back their retirement  benefits. They undercut their health benefits, and they take away legal  protections. We have to change this.   This spring, I laid out a plan to make work pay off by raising wages  and benefits, including retirement, giving workers more say and more  power in the workplace, encouraging companies to invest in their  greatest asset--the American worker. My plan to restore the value of  work has to include the labor movement. Modernizing labor law means  recognizing the right of all workers, even those in alternative work  arrangements, to collectively bargain for higher pay and better wages.   Pope Francis concluded:         There is no good society without a good union, and there is       no good union that is not reborn every day in the peripheries       that does not transform the discarded stones of the economy       into its cornerstones.    We are a country of discarded stones--of people who rose from humble  beginnings and joined together to build institutions that were greater  than any one of us. We need laws that reflect that--that reflect the  dignity of work and that reflect, as in the Pope's words, the dignity  of every discarded stone, of each and every American who works too many  hours for too little pay.   The last thing we need for the National Labor Relations Board is  another nominee who does not value work, who demeans work, and who  demeans the workers and the unions who do it. Everyone in this town  ought to listen a little more to Pope Francis and a little less to  corporate lobbyists, a little less to big banks, and a little less to  Wall Street. Maybe, then, we will start to make hard work pay off again  for American workers. We can start today by rejecting this anti-worker  nominee.   I yield the floor.   (Disturbance in the Visitors' Galleries.)    Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, this week, the city I call home lost  a great Ohioan, and Connie and I lost a friend, Belle Likover of Shaker  Heights. Belle passed away at age 97, and over her extraordinary life,  she saw the creation of our country's greatest social insurance  programs: Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid--and fought to  protect those lifelines for American seniors.   Ms. Likover was born the same year as my mother and grew up in Beaver  Falls, PA. She remembered her childhood as a happy one, with one big  exception: the Great Depression. In an interview several years ago, she  talked about the lasting effects those memories had on her, saying,  ``We saw everybody else suffer. I remember the shantytowns. I remember  people living in what used to be packing crates. There was a constant  stream of people who came to our backdoor for food. My mother never  turned anybody away.''   Those experiences would shape her activism throughout her life. In  high school and later in college, at the Ohio State University, she  said she was ``never bashful about speaking out.'' She joined the high  school varsity debate team as a sophomore, as the only girl on the  team, and learned how to marshal an argument. She told an interviewer  that, ``Every position of leadership I've had, I owe to that debate  coach.''   In college, she put that training to use, first getting involved in  political causes in 1937, when she and a friend helped organize an  antifascist group at Ohio State. They saw what was happening in Germany  and across Europe and how dangerous that was for the world.   Growing up in that time of turmoil and as a woman at a time when her  abilities would be constantly questioned, Belle faced setbacks. As a  child, she asked for chemistry sets instead of dolls, but in college, a  chemistry professor told her, ``If you want a Ph.D., you better marry  one.'' Her first husband laid down his life for our country during  World War II, leaving Ms. Likover with a newborn daughter to raise.   She published papers without the Ph.D. that her male peers had and  worked at the Cleveland Jewish Community Center's senior department,  where she saw what a difference Social Security made in the lives of  the elderly--and later how Medicaid and Medicare would change their  lives. She went to grad school on a JCC scholarship.   Throughout the years, she never ceased in her activism. She joined me  at events many times to talk about the importance of Medicare. I  interviewed Belle in the summer of 2015, marking the 50th anniversary  of the passage of Medicare and Medicaid. She told me she was thrilled  when it passed because she remember how poor older people were when she  was growing up--``They didn't have Medicare, they ended up in  poorhouses,'' she told me. And she added, ``Do you know how many people  can't wait until they're 65 to get covered by Medicare?''   Just last fall, she joined us on a call with Ohio reporters to talk  about how devastating it would be to raise the retirement age. That was  Belle Likover--an activist and advocate, full of compassion but never  bashful, all the way through age 97. Our family's thoughts and prayers  are with Belle's loved ones. We will miss her, and we will strive to  carry on her advocacy for Ohio seniors.                            ____________________
