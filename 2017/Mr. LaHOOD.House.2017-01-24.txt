 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7, the No  Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure  Act.   Unfortunately, in our Nation, the most vulnerable and the most  helpless lives amongst us have had their lives ended unceremoniously  and tragically through abortion. Since 1973, 57 million lives have been  lost to abortion. Even more disheartening, taxpayer dollars have been  funding these abortions, despite the fact that polls show that 60  percent of Americans believe that abortions should not be directly paid  for with tax dollars.   Since 1976, the Hyde amendment has saved 2 million lives by  prohibiting tax dollars from funding abortions. It is time to make this  lifesaving amendment permanent and governmentwide. If signed by our new  President, this   [[Page H641]]  measure would do just that. Supporting comprehensive, life-affirming  care is a better and more effective way to invest in women's health.    I am thankful to all those who will come to Washington, D.C., this  week to March for Life on behalf of the unborn. As a practicing  Catholic and the father of three, I am proud to be the voice for the  unborn here in Congress.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 7 and stand up for life.
