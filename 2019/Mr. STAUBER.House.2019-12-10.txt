 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Commander David  Wheat, a Vietnam veteran and former prisoner of war from Minnesota's  Eighth Congressional District, who is about to celebrate his 80th  birthday on December 16.   David grew up in Duluth, Minnesota, and graduated from the University  of Minnesota Duluth before entering the Naval Aviation Officer  Candidate School and earning the commission of an ensign. In April  1965, he received his naval flight officer wings and was deployed to  Vietnam, flying in an F-4B Phantom as a radar intercept officer.   In October 1965, David was shot down and captured by enemy forces. He  spent the next 7 years and 4 months as a prisoner of war in various  camps, including the infamous Hanoi Hilton. Despite the cruel torture  and inhumane conditions David endured at the hands of his captors, they  were never able to rob him of his resilient American spirit.   Following his release from prison, David vowed that he would be happy  for the rest of his life. David went on to continue a life of service,  reporting to pilot training and earning his naval aviation wings in  1975.   Throughout his career, David flew various types of aircraft and  retired after 20 years of honorable service. David also got married and  started a family of his own.   In my hometown of Duluth, Minnesota, we are incredibly proud to have  a hero like Commander David Wheat living amongst us. David has been an  active member of our community, supporting activities and fundraisers  for various veterans organizations.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of every Minnesotan, I thank Commander Wheat  for his brave service and wish him the happiest of birthdays.                       Taking a Stand Against Violence     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the heartbreaking  trend of violence troubling our Native American communities and  recognize the Tribal leaders from my district who are taking a stand on  this issue.   Native American women in particular face a disproportionately high  risk of violence. According to one study, the murder rate of Native  American women is 10 times the national average.   During my 23 years as a law enforcement officer in northern  Minnesota, I heard far too many horror stories about trafficked or  murdered Native American women. Too often, these cases go unresolved.   These victims and their families deserve action. I was glad to hear  that President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order  establishing an interagency task force to review unsolved cases. I was  especially pleased to see Fond du Lac council member Roger Smith, Fond  du Lac chairman Kevin Dupuis, and Mille Lacs band chief Melanie  Benjamin standing alongside our President in the Oval Office as he  signed this executive order.   I applaud Minnesota's Tribal leaders for standing united against this  epidemic of violence, and I remain committed to supporting them in this  critical mission.                            ____________________
