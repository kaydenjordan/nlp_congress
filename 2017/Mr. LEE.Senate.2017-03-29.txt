 Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of Judge  Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court of the United States.   Last week the Judiciary Committee, on which I serve, held a week-long  series of hearings concerning Judge Gorsuch's nomination. After  listening to the judge's flawless testimony, after listening to him  answer questions from my colleagues for days on end, I am even more  convinced than ever that he is exactly the kind of jurist we need on  the Supreme Court of the United States.   I want to briefly explain my support for the judge, and then respond  to some of the criticisms that have been leveled against him.   First and foremost, Judge Gorsuch understands the proper and  necessarily limited role of the judiciary in our constitutional  Republic.   Last week, over and over, Judge Gorsuch affirmed--even against great  criticism that at times can be difficult to understand in its  entirety--but responded time and again to criticisms by pointing out  that it is his job as a  [[Page S2064]]  judge to interpret and apply the law--not to make it, not to establish  policy, but to apply that policy which has already been placed into law  by the legislative branch.   When you are reading law, the text matters. Our laws consist of words  and each word matters. If the law leads to an uncomfortable outcome for  the parties, for politicians, or for anyone else in our society, then,  it is our job as a Congress--or if it is State law at issue, it is the  job of a State legislature--to get the policy right, to fix the policy  problem at issue. The judge's job is to go where the law leads the  judge, not to correct the law.   Over and over, Judge Gorsuch affirmed the importance of precedent in  our system. It is clearly a topic that he takes very seriously, having  coauthored a treatise on that very subject. While precedent is not  always absolute, in so far as you have a clear conflict with the text,  Judge Gorsuch testified that you start with the ``heavy presumption in  favor of precedent.'' He described precedent as the ``anchor of the  law.''   Over and over, Judge Gorsuch explained that judges are not partisans  in robes. No, they are different. They are different from politicians.  They are meaningfully different than the politicians who make the laws  or the politicians in the executive branch who enforce and execute the  laws. They are unfailingly independent when they are doing their jobs  right. They are devoted to the rule of law. They do their best to  decide cases on the basis of the law and the facts, rather than on the  basis of achieving whatever outcome they or others might desire.   Some of my colleagues' views of Judge Gorsuch's record are different,  and I want to address some of their concerns. First, some of my  colleagues have questioned the independence of Judge Gorsuch and his  ability to exercise judicial independence. This is a very serious  accusation. In fact, it is probably one of the worst things you could  say about a judge. So my colleagues who have raised this criticism  would need to back that up against something. If you are going to raise  a really serious accusation against someone, as you are whenever you  are calling into question a judge's independence, you have to be able  to back it up.   Let's look at that. Can they back it up? I don't think so. In fact, I  am quite certain they can't because they haven't. The argument boils  down to the complaint that Judge Gorsuch hasn't sufficiently criticized  President Trump's comments about judges. But here is what Judge Gorsuch  said about this topic last week. He said this in response to questions  raised by Senator Blumenthal on the Judiciary Committee. He said:         Senator, I care deeply about the independence of the       judiciary. I cannot talk about the specific cases or       controversies that might come before me, and I cannot get       involved in politics.        But, Senator, when you attack the integrity or honesty or       independence of a judge, their motives, as we sometimes hear,       Senator, I know the men and women of the Federal judiciary, a       lot of them. I know how who hard their job is, how much they       often give up to do it, the difficult circumstances in which       they do it. It is a lonely job, too. I am not asking for       crocodile tears or anything like that. I am just saying I       know these people, and I know how decent they are. And when       anyone criticizes the honesty or integrity, the motives of a       Federal judge, well, I find that disheartening, I find that       demoralizing, because I know the truth.    Senator Blumenthal asked Judge Gorsuch whether, when he said  ``anyone,'' that applied to the President of the United States. Judge  Gorsuch responded simply: ``Anyone is anyone.'' It is true that Judge  Gorsuch didn't use the magic words: I disagree with President Trump.  But he can't get involved in politics. He said here what he can say. In  fact, he said all he can say in this context.   Moreover, here are some additional parts of Judge Gorsuch's  testimony, which shed light on this issue.   From Tuesday:         I have no difficulty ruling against or for any party other       than based on what the law and the facts in the particular       case require, and I'm heartened by the support I have       received from people who recognize that there's no such thing       as a Republican judge or a Democratic judge. We just have       judges in this country.    On Wednesday he said:         I do not see Republican judges, and I do not see Democrat       judges. I see judges.    So I think any fairminded person looking at this would have to agree  that Judge Gorsuch's feelings about judicial independence in cases  before the Federal judiciary are very clear. To my colleagues who might  see the issue differently, I would ask simply: What should Judge  Gorsuch have said without getting involved in politics, without miring  himself in a debate that is within the political branches of government  and, therefore, within the political rather than the judicial  interpretive arena?   Second, some of my colleagues allege that Judge Gorsuch is somehow  out of the mainstream. But consider these facts. Judge Gorsuch has  decided roughly 2,700 cases. His decisions have been unanimous 97  percent of the time. Keep in mind that he is an appellate judge who  sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Appellate  judges never sit alone in that capacity. They sit in panels--normally  in panels of three and sometimes in panels of a dozen or so when they  sit on the bench. And 97 percent of the time, all of the judges with  whom Judge Gorsuch sits in any case agree with whatever decision he  reaches. He is in the majority 99 percent of the time.   He is about as likely to dissent from a Republican-appointed judge as  a Democratic-appointed judge. He has been reversed twice, and in both  cases he was following circuit precedent. I want to make it clear that  there is nothing wrong with a judge who dissents more than this. In  fact, in many instances, dissents are necessary. In many instances, a  dissent can be useful, even indispensable. There are judges out there  who dissent more than this, and there wouldn't be anything wrong with  Judge Gorsuch if he dissented any more. My point is that of all the  arguments you can make against Judge Gorsuch, this is not a fair  characterization. To say that he is out of the mainstream simply runs  against mathematics. It runs against the bold statistics on their very  face, which contradict this characterization.   Some of my colleagues respond that only a handful of cherry-picked  cases matter. If you watched the hearing last week, you might recognize  the names of some of these cases. They include TransAM Trucking, Hwang,  Luke P., Hobby Lobby. What I find revealing is that my colleagues never  mount much of a legal argument against any of these decisions. No, you  are not going to find quibbling with the statutory construction in  these cases. They don't parse the statutes at issue and then explain  where it is that Judge Gorsuch somehow got it wrong, somehow departed  from what the law actually says. No, they are looking at outcomes. They  think Judge Gorsuch should have bent the law in order to go where they  think the law should go. They want judges who have the right approach  in mind, the right outcome in mind, and to decide the case according to  what outcome they desire.   I flatly disagree with this view of judging. It is a view, frankly,  that is way out of the mainstream in American law. To say it is out of  the mainstream in American law does not mean out of the Republican  mainstream or the conservative mainstream or the mainstream among  members of the Federalist Society. No, I am talking about rank-and-file  practitioners of the law, jurists from every conceivable point along  the political and ideological spectrum. This is just not something that  a judge would ever want to admit to doing. Certainly, it is never  anything a judge would aspire to do--to choose an outcome and say: I am  going to reach that outcome, and I don't really care that the law  doesn't really authorize me to do it. I am just going to do it because  I think, in some abstract sense, that outcome would achieve a greater  degree of fairness than what the law actually requires me to do.   Third, I am distressed by a lot of the rhetoric that we heard during  the confirmation hearing last week--rhetoric that I expect to continue  and even mount over the next 10 days or so. One of my colleagues last  week actually went so far as to describe the Supreme Court of the  United States as an ``instrument of the Republican party.''   Other colleagues have complained about the so-called dark money  campaign to support Judge Gorsuch's nomination, and still other  colleagues complain that President Trump or Steve  [[Page S2065]]  Bannon or Reince Priebus or others are enthusiastic about Judge  Gorsuch's nomination, as if the fact that someone is supported by  someone they don't like means that the person in question is not  qualified. This is unfair to Judge Gorsuch.   Judge Gorsuch didn't decide Citizens United. He didn't decide Hobby  Lobby or any other case my colleagues dislike. He made clear in no  uncertain terms that no one speaks on his behalf but him.   They may dislike some of the cases in which he offered opinions, but,  again, in those cases, they are not quibbling with the way that he  interpreted the law. No one has attacked his interpretation of a  statute, his approach to statutory construction. They are quibbling  with the outcome. They are quibbling with the fact that they wish it  had turned out differently on policy grounds, policy grounds that have  everything to do with the policymaking arms of the government and not  with the jurisprudential arm of the government.   Even worse, these types of statements are damaging to our judiciary.  If you don't like a judicial decision, engage the decision on its own  terms, engage in a discussion of how that decision turned out wrong or  where it is that it departed from what the law requires. Make a legal  argument, in other words.   The courts announce reasons for their decisions. There is plenty of  material to dig into, but don't impugn the judge's motives or  independence. This is especially harmful when you impugn the judge's  motives without actually getting into what the judge did or what the  law says and explaining how those two things diverge.   Don't accuse the Supreme Court of functioning as an instrument of the  Republican Party. In fact, you might as well call someone a so-called  judge in a case where you disagree with the outcome. In fact, calling  someone a so-called judge is probably no worse than calling the Supreme  Court of the United States an instrument of the Republican Party.   Finally, I want to talk about the filibuster. The minority leader has  urged his colleagues to filibuster. The minority whip has announced he  will filibuster. Only two Democrats have said they will vote yes on  cloture, so here we are.   I ask my colleagues: If Neil Gorsuch can't get 60 votes for cloture,  which Republican nominee can?   Some of my colleagues have argued that if a nominee can't get 60  votes, the President should find a new nominee. I ask my colleagues:  Was that the standard for several of President Obama's nominees at the  U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit?   Well, yes, it was. Under rule XXII, that was the standard. That was  the standard until, in November of 2013, the Democrats in the Senate  went nuclear, and they created a new precedent, taking that threshold  down from 60--by precedent--to 51. Through going nuclear, this is the  result they achieved.   Their analysis, in its entirety, went in this direction. Their  analysis nuked the Executive filibuster. It nuked the filibuster on the  Executive Calendar.   Interestingly, although some were insisting at the time and went to  the floor to explain at the time that they didn't intend for this to  extend to Supreme Court nominees, when everyone thought Hillary Clinton  would be President--Harry Reid admitted that the Democrats would extend  this same precedent through which the Democrats had nuked the Executive  filibuster to Supreme Court nominees.   So, look, I work with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle on  a great number of important issues, issues that are very important to  me, issues like criminal justice reform, reform of the Foreign  Intelligence Surveillance Act, reform of the Electronic Communications  Privacy Act of 1986, which is badly in need of reform, and a number of  other issues, many of which involve privacy protections. These are A- plus legislative priorities for me. Nothing else is more important, and  I stand ready to reform the law whenever I see the need to do so and  will continue to work with my Democratic colleagues.   As we approach this discussion, I want to be clear that unilateral  disarmament doesn't work. I hope the Democrats reverse course and do  not filibuster this nominee, but if they do, I am confident Judge  Gorsuch will be confirmed.
