 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my dear friend from Kansas  for letting me share with the American people the stories from home,  Texas 22.   My home county, my home district is on the verge of coming close to  900,000 people. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has changed all of their  lives in a dramatic and very important way. Texas 22 is better off now.  My home county, Fort Bend County, Texas, is the most diverse county in  America; 140 languages are spoken all over Texas 22.   Every time I am home, I ask people what they think about lower tax  rates for their families, a 21 percent corporate tax rate, full  expensing of their expenses in the same year, and an end of the death  tax. They say the same thing over and over; 140 languages become one  language, and that language is pure Texas.   Quote from back home:         I like these tax cuts.    Are they good?         Dang straight. I reckon I can buy a new pickup truck,       provide healthcare for my employees who have back pains       because their wallets in their back pockets of their Wrangler       jeans are so darn heavy they are twisting their spine.    Mr. Speaker, these Texans say:         I can't understand how Democrats in the U.S. House can call       these tax cuts mere crumbs.    Crumbs. Back home, they are puzzled: How can these Democrats be so  out of touch with America? How can my family keeping our money be such  a bad thing?   But one old boy Texan in Meadville, Texas, solved this problem. He  said:         If the money I get in my pocket from keeping my money is       crumbs, I am fixing to be a world record holder in the       Guinness Book of World Records. I will have a mound of crumbs       as big as a Texas icon, Enchanted Rock.    That rock is 640 acres big and stands 525 feet above the terrain.  That is a dang big pile of crumbs.   Gary Allred owns Rosenberg Tractor right there in Fort Bend County.  He has had that up and running for 32 years. Being in the tractor  business, agriculture, lots of ups and downs: One year it rains; the  next year it doesn't. One year it is hot; one year it is cold.   The big city is coming his way. We are growing dramatically in  southeast Texas. All this growth has made his land very, very, very  valuable. He knows if he has to sell his land sometime in the future,  land that has been in his family now for almost 50 years, he will have  to pay a death tax; and maybe his daughter, his son, his grandsons, his  granddaughters won't have his dream, their tractor company in their  possession.   But Gary knows now he no longer has to worry: the death tax is dead.  That is because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. He said:         I have guys coming in, customers, looking to buy a new       tractor and all the farm implements that go with them.    He is worried because he is a hay farmer, piles and piles of hay. He  is worried because these so-called crumbs he will get will be so huge,  they will block out all of his hay crops. That is a big, big, big pile  of crumbs.    Mr. Speaker, the final crumb story I have, again, is from an icon  from Richmond, Texas. His name is Andres Novoa. He owns La Cocina  Mexican restaurant. For every crumb of the Mexican food he makes, he  sells, he gives two crumbs back to his local community.   He has the largest Cinco de Mayo celebration in all of Fort Bend  County. He raises thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars for  causes like Meals on Wheels in Fort Bend County. He has raised enough  money to buy two vans for Meals on Wheels. With the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act, he can buy another van, a third van, for Fort Bend County Meals on  Wheels.   These Texans are all excited. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 2.0 is coming  quickly. That means this great law will be permanent. It will be more  competitive. And guess what. We will have more and more records in Fort  Bend County of piles and piles of crumbs for the Guinness Book of World  Records.   Americans are better off right now, and they will be better off in  the future.
