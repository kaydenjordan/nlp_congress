 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Consumer Protection and  Recovery Act.   This legislation is essential to promoting the Federal Trade  Commission's mission to enforce antitrust law and to protect consumers.  For decades, the commission has secured monetary relief for victims of  unfair, deceptive, and anticompetitive conduct, such as pharmaceutical  companies blocking access to lower-cost drugs.   In a recent example, the FTC returned nearly $60 million to patients  suffering from opioid addiction. But a few months ago, the Supreme  Court severely weakened one of the FTC's most vital tools for  protecting consumers and deterring bad conduct by ruling that the FTC  could not seek monetary relief under one of the key statutes that it  enforces. This legislation would reverse the Court's decision and would  restore one of the Commission's critical tools for fighting monopolists  and protecting consumers.   Mr. Speaker, I commend the bill's sponsor, Mr. Cardenas, and I thank  Chairman Pallone and Chairwoman Schakowsky for their leadership to  address this urgent problem, and I urge my colleagues to support this  important legislation.
