 Mr. President, I would like to start my remarks this  morning by offering my thoughts to the victims of yesterday's  horrendous act of terror in New York City, my thanks to the first  responders, and I would note the resiliency of the people of New York.  Once again, they are going forward with their lives today, showing the  world and anyone who would do us harm that Americans stand together and  that we move forward regardless of what our foes may try to do.
