 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, Congresswoman  Marcia Fudge, for bringing this bill to this Chamber.   I stand here as the chair of the Subcommittee on Diversity and  Inclusion. I have probably spent more hours and time looking into the  difference diversity makes, whether it is a small business, whether it  is an educational system, whether it is a child.   I remind us to history. In 1960, a little Black girl by the name of  Ruby Bridges was denied the right to enter a school--against the  Supreme Court of this land--by a Governor.   I stand here on this floor and hear indictments about President  Obama. Mr. Speaker, let me say to my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle, anything that his educational Secretaries did was better  than what we have now with Secretary Betsy DeVos.   Let me just say that it is so important when we think about diversity  and inclusion and we think about those little children, Black children,  marginalized White children.   When I look at the votes for what my colleagues on the other side  have said about us--and they don't vote for budgets; they don't vote  for funding that can save lives--their arguments are weak. Their  arguments are unfounded.   This bill is about equal opportunity. This bill is about removing  systemic racism.   We already know that racism is a national crisis. So when I think of  housing, when I think about feeding a child, what kind of Member of  Congress would stand here against Congresswoman Fudge, Congressman   Bobby Scott, who is the chair of this committee and has done more in  his lifetime on education than anyone who has been to this microphone  on the other side?
