 Madam Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a  vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Madam Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1665, the Building  Blocks of STEM Act.   I was proud to join my colleague, the chair of the Research and  Technology Subcommittee, Representative Haley Stevens, in introducing  this legislation.   As one of only two Members of Congress with a Ph.D. in science, I  understand how important it is to start children off on the right foot  by teaching STEM concepts and principles at an early age. Research  shows that kids as young as 1, 2, or 3 are capable of absorbing STEM  concepts. Children have a natural curiosity that can be fostered into  an interest in science, technology, engineering, math, and computer  science.   Equally important is ensuring that we get more girls involved in the  STEM fields so that we can have as many people as possible contributing  to the knowledge base of our society.   H.R. 1665 directs the NSF to fund research and studies that focus on  early childhood and young women in STEM at the K-12 level. Investing in  children early ensures that we are laying the groundwork to develop  young innovators in STEM.   Hoosiers know that to grow our Nation, we need everyone involved.  This bill helps ensure that we are preparing students to fill the jobs  of the future, continuing America's global leadership in science and  technology.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3153, the Expanding Findings  for Federal Opioid Research and Treatment Act, also known as the EFFORT  Act.   The opioid crisis has, tragically, destroyed the lives of many  Hoosiers. According to the most recent available data from the National  Institute on Drug Abuse, in 2017, drug overdose deaths in Indiana  increased by 22\1/2\ percent from the previous year. Indiana's 2017  rate of overdose deaths at over 29 per 100,000 was significantly higher  than the national average.   This epidemic does not discriminate, and we must use evidence-based  policy to ensure the health and well-being of current and future  generations. The National Science Foundation's research has increased  what we know about addiction, and while this research is at the top of  its class, gaps still remain in the prevention and treatment of opioid  addiction.                                time  1445    That is why I joined my colleague, Congresswoman Wexton, to introduce  the EFFORT Act, directing the National Science Foundation, in  consultation with the National Institutes of Health, to support merit- reviewed and competitively awarded research on the science of opioid  addiction.   By expanding basic research, we can promote collaboration and further  understand how to better treat the multiple aspects of the opioid  addiction.   I hope we can see an end to this crisis soon, and I am proud that  Congress is taking action to fight back.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.    Madam Speaker, today I rise to celebrate the 50th  anniversary of Apollo 11 and the triumph of the human spirit. On July  16, 1969, three Americans boarded a rocket at Kennedy Space Center on  Merritt Island, Florida. When they lifted off a few hours later with a  flight path toward the unthinkable, humanity was changed forever.  Millions of men, women, and children were inspired watching the  extraordinary events unfold over the next 4 days as humanity took these  first steps on the Moon.   Fellow Purdue University alumnus Neil Armstrong's words: ``That is  one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind'' will forever  define that moment in history. The successful journey to the Moon  brought with it a tremendous sense of triumph and pride. Our Nation  found a bold, common goal that we reached through American ingenuity  and determination.   This is the spirit that carries us forward in exploration and  innovation today. Right now we are looking at returning to the Moon  within the next 5 years and eventually landing on Mars. Madam Speaker,  what has been previously unheard of is now being thrust into the scope  of reality.   It is our responsibility to keep taking giant leaps to challenge what  is perceived as impossible, and I look forward to the next chapter of  American space exploration.                            ____________________
