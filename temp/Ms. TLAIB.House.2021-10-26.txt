 Mr. Speaker, we can't build back better without replacing  every inch of lead service line in our country.   In too many of our communities from Flint to Benton Harbor to the  cities of Wayne and Hamtramck and across the State of Michigan and our  Nation, the water is poisoned with lead.   We have an opportunity now to change it, with a bold and clear  investment to replace every single lead-contaminated service line in  our Nation.  [[Page H5876]]    Experts have already estimated that we need $60 billion to replace  every service lead pipeline in America. But we know the Senate  proposal--which was negotiated without a shred of input from frontline  communities or their representatives--only devotes $15 billion. That is  just simply not enough.   People are drinking water with lead now, and we know which  communities lose out when there isn't enough money to go around. They  are communities that look like mine. It is environmental justice  neighborhoods.    We must--we must--do more, and we already have secured another $30  billion in Build Back Better to get us closer to our goal. Again, a  clear way to bring us all together is making sure that we all have  access to clean water.   There are 2.65 million service lines in Michigan, and over 12 percent  of those lines are contaminated with lead. To replace these lead pipes  in Michigan alone, it would cost $1.65 billion.   Again, I ask everyone, how can we build back better when children are  being poisoned?   Benton Harbor in Michigan needs $11.4 million to provide clean water  to its residents. We just discovered new lead-contaminated issues in  the cities of Wayne and Hamtramck in Michigan. That is why it is  critical that the Federal Government, our government, steps up with  bold and aggressive investment.   In 2018 a report from the Natural Resources Defense Council revealed  that between 2015 and 2018 about 5.5 million Americans in communities  around the Nation got their water from a system that exceeded the EPA's  lead action level of 15 parts per billion. That is just the stuff we  know about. We know that there is more.   The threat of lead-contaminated water is a longstanding one that has  overwhelmingly impacted communities like mine, low-income communities,  communities of color, for decades. And yet we have not done anything  meaningful for a very long time to really, truly remove lead service  lines.   We continue waking up to stories about children being poisoned with  lead and cities handing out bottled water because we have failed to  invest in our water infrastructure. Folks are being forced to drink,  bathe, cook, and wash dishes with water that is literally contaminated  with lead because politicians have put their well-being on the back  burner.   On top of it all, the leaky, outdated infrastructure also means many  of those same people can't even afford to pay for water that is being  poisoned. Literally, they are paying money for water that is  contaminated with lead. Some people in Washington like to pretend to  worry about how we are going to pay for lead pipe replacement, but what  we really can't afford is another moment of inaction.   Clean, affordable drinking water is a human right. There are Flints  and Benton Harbors and cities of Wayne and Hamtramck in every part of  this country, communities right now where children are drinking water  that can alter the course of their lives forever.   So please join me in replacing lead service lines across the country.  It is a moral imperative. We need to immediately pass the full $45  billion in the Senate proposal as well as the Build Back Better  proposal. Again, there is no building back without it.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to please join me in  recognizing the outstanding accomplishments of Wayne Metro Community  Action Agency, a service organization based in Wayne County, Michigan,  in my district.   Today, they celebrate 50 years of assisting southeastern Michigan's  most vulnerable populations, a truly remarkable milestone.   Wayne Metro's staff and organizational leadership's holistic approach  to serving our communities translates to exceptional service that has  put many families on the path to a better quality of life.   Whether it is connecting a resident to emergency housing, helping  with utility payments, or financial coaching, Wayne Metro has been a  trusted agency for so many of my residents.   Their longevity is a testament to the trust in their reputation as a  responsive and caring community partner in service. It has always been  one of the main reasons I work very closely with them.   Madam Speaker, I congratulate Wayne Metro Community Action Agency on  50 years of service and best wishes on many more to come.                            ____________________
