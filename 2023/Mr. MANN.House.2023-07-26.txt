 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the direction of our  country. In America right now, we are facing a lot of problems. House  Republicans have done our part to pass commonsense solutions, but we  still have a lot of work to do to get this country back on track.   In January, I released my commitment to the Big First, which is a  legislative roadmap to create an economy that is strong, a Nation that  is safe, a future that is built on freedom, and a government that is  accountable.   Most of the glaring problems in America today fall into one of these  four categories, and the reality is that House Republicans have  commonsense solutions to all of them, but the Biden administration is  refusing to listen.   We need to create an economy that is strong. Washington has a  spending addiction. America is $32 trillion in debt, and the Federal  Government is deficit spending to the tune of $1 trillion every year.  The Biden administration has canceled the Keystone XL pipeline and  pushed Green New Deal regulations on small businesses, while attempting  at the same time to do away with stepped-up basis and impose a new farm  killer capital gains tax on agriculture producers.    Here is the commonsense solution: When you stop the wasteful  spending, you don't have to tax people to death. When President Biden  took office, inflation was at just 1.4 percent. Inflation hit 6.4  percent in 2022. That is a tax on all Americans.   In the House of Representatives, we passed the Lower Energy Costs Act  and the REIN IN Inflation Act to unleash American energy production and  revitalize our economy, but the White House still isn't listening.  America's position in the global marketplace is degrading, the value of  the dollar has been plummeting for a year, and it is time to get our  economy back on track before it is too late.   We also need to create a Nation that is safe. Violent crime is on the  rise, the suicide rate is climbing, drug addiction and mental illness  are spiking, and many parts of our country are basically in chaos.  Meanwhile, we are still hearing calls from Washington Democrats to  defund the police, and the Biden administration refuses to address the  humanitarian crisis at our southern border where fentanyl, criminals,  and victims of human trafficking come across every day, unfortunately,  into our country.   Here is the commonsense solution: House Republicans passed  legislation to secure the border, finish the wall, criminalize all  forms of illicit fentanyl, and support the training and hiring of more  State and local law enforcement officers. Today, we don't live in a  Nation that is safe, but House Republicans have already passed bills  that would stop the chaos and usher in safety and order.   We also need to create a future that is built on freedom. Each year I  host at least one townhall in every one of the 60 counties in the Big  First District. As I travel across the State and meet with Kansans, I  listen to their concerns about Big Government, sweeping executive  order, and infringement on basic rights, like the Second Amendment and  the right to life.   House Republicans are standing for freedom in the face of Big  Government overreach. We passed the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors  Protection Act that would defend the lives of innocent children  following a botched abortion attempt.   We also passed the Parents Bill of Rights that states that parents  have the right to know what their children are being taught. These are  no-brainers. It is sad that we even need to pass bills like this  because the rights to life and freedom are supposed to be foundational  to America in the first place.   On the American farm we also see freedom under attack. The Biden  administration vetoed legislation that would have revoked President  Biden's Waters of the U.S. rule because his administration prefers to  regulate every puddle and drainage ditch from sea to shining sea.                                time  1030    On top of that, the Biden administration hamstrung producers by  adding the lesser prairie-chicken to the endangered species list, and I  am looking forward to my colleagues' and my voting to disapprove of  that rule.   Our message is this: Whether you are a parent, a child--born or  unborn--a student, a farmer, or a small business owner, you don't need  the Federal Government trying to control your life.   Finally, we need to create a government that is accountable.  According to recent IRS whistleblower testimony made public by the Ways  and Means Committee, it appears that President Biden was not only aware  of his son, Hunter Biden's, corrupt foreign business deals, but was  also in the room for them. We need to conduct rigorous oversight to  root out corruption in the executive branch. We also need to hold the  Federal Government accountable and rein in the White House's abuse of  power.  [[Page H3959]]    As the Biden administration has proven time and time again, executive  orders are out of control, and they are no way to govern in a  democracy. That is why I introduced the More Accountability is  Necessary Now Act, which requires the President to notify Congress and  the public before issuing any new executive orders pertaining to  agriculture, energy, natural resources, the right to life, the Second  Amendment, and immigration. This is a commonsense way to hold the  government accountable and stop some of the Big Government overreach  that Kansans and the Big First are sick and tired of.   I don't serve in Congress to be a caretaker in the slow demise of  America. I am here to do my part in making America stronger. We need to  rebuild our country on behalf of Americans who have had their rights  stripped from them, their taxpayer dollars wasted, their values shoved  back in their face, and their country's economy brought to the brink of  disaster by an administration that isn't getting the message.   We need everything from a balanced budget to a strengthened supply  chain, from lower taxes to a secure southern border, and from a strong  farm bill to robust police and military forces.   We have a lot of work to do, and if we open our eyes to the real  problems that Americans are facing today and look at the commonsense  solutions on the table, we can accomplish real meaningful change in our  country.   With prayer and hard work, I believe America's brightest days are yet  to come.                            ____________________
