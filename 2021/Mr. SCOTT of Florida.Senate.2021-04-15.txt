 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the 60th  anniversary of the Bay of Pigs operation.   Today, we commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Bay of Pigs  operation and pay tribute to the brave and courageous members of  Brigada de Asalto 2506, Assault Brigade 2506. On April 17, 1961, a  group of Cuban patriots landed at the Bay of Pigs to overthrow Fidel  Castro's communist dictatorship. We remember the sacrifice made by  these brave individuals, and their memory lives on in the fight that  continues today.   There is no doubt that where we see instability, chaos, and violence  in  [[Page S1978]]  Latin America, we also see the fingerprints of the Castro regime. The  Cuban people have suffered decades of oppression under Castro's regime.  So many courageous individuals have dedicated their lives to the  freedom of Cuba, and their commitment and sacrifice have kept the hope  of liberty alive.   It is time to show Castro that his era of influence in Latin America  is over. The United States must always support those fighting for  freedom and democracy, and I will never stop fighting to bring a new  day of freedom to Cuba and all of Latin America.                            ____________________
