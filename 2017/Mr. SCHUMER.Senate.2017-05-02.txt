 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.  [[Page S2660]]     Mr. President, first, I wish to respond to the  President's latest tweets about the bipartisan, bicameral deal we just  reached to fund the government through September.   Members of both parties worked very hard to come to this agreement.  There was a real spirit of cooperation. I thank Majority Leader  McConnell and Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi, as well as Senators  Cochran and Leahy and Congress Members Frelinghuysen and Lowey, all who  worked together often until the wee hours of the morning to make this  happen. We all spent a lot of time working on it, and I think we got a  very good outcome. So when the President threw cold water on this deal  and actually recommended a government shutdown, I was deeply  disappointed. Here we saw Democrats and Republicans working together in  the best traditions of the Senate, and the President disparages it in a  way that is destructive, essentially saying: Let's have a shutdown.   The President has been complaining about the lack of bipartisanship  in Washington. Well, this deal is exactly how Washington should work  when it is bipartisan. Both parties negotiated and came to an agreement  on a piece of legislation we each can support. It is truly a shame that  the President is degrading it because he didn't get 100 percent of what  he wanted. Bipartisanship is best summed up by the Rolling Stones: You  can't always get what you want--or at least everything you want.                            ____________________     On taxes, Mr. President, yesterday, Secretary Mnuchin,  in an appearance at the Milken Institute Conference, admitted that the  administration plans to go it alone on taxes. He said they are trying  to design their proposal to fit into the rules of reconciliation so  they need only Republican votes to pass their tax cut.   The message was clear as day. The President is not interested in  working with Democrats to craft a proposal that both parties can  support. He is just going to pass his plan with Republican votes or not  pass it at all. What that means is that the Trump tax plan likely will  not have to change much from the 200-word outline that they put out  last week, and that means the Trump tax plan will benefit the  incredibly wealthy and the special interests while leaving the middle- class, working Americans with crumbs, at best.   We Democrats support tax relief, so long as it is aimed at the middle  class and those struggling to get there. Those are the folks who really  need the help. College is getting ever more expensive. Take-home pay is  being squeezed in so many different directions. The middle class and  those working to get there should be able to keep more of what they  make, but the Trump tax plan seems designed to benefit his Cabinet and  the incredibly wealthy on Wall Street, not Main Street and the middle  class.   There are many wealthy people doing very well in America. God bless  them. Their lifestyles are getting better every year. Their incomes are  getting better every day. They don't need the help, but the middle  class does. But in the Trump plan, taxes on the very wealthy and big  corporations would go down, while tax deductions that benefit the  middle class would go away. For example, President Trump campaigned on  getting rid of the carried interest loophole. Instead, his plan keeps  the carried interest loophole and creates an even bigger loophole for  the wealthiest by allowing the so-called passthrough entities, which  include wealthy businessmen like President Trump, to pay just 15  percent. So with this 15-percent passthrough, hedge fund managers,  corporate lawyers, and big business CEOs who make millions of dollars  every year would pay 15 percent, while their workers will pay 20, 25,  30 percent.   To add insult to injury, the Trump tax plan would repeal the estate  tax, a tax on estates only of over $10 million--very wealthy people.  How many of us have a $10 million estate? And it would result in the  5,200 wealthiest families in America each year--or estates in America-- receiving an average $3 million windfall. While the Trump plan  eliminates taxes for the very wealthy, it also eliminates tax breaks  that are most beneficial to the middle class, like the State and local  deduction. The loss of this deduction for those who use it would cost  New Yorkers an average of $4,500 a year.   The middle class has seen rising expenses and virtually stagnant  incomes. They need tax relief, not the loss of key tax deductions that  helped put a few more dollars in their pockets. And the biggest danger  for the middle class might be what happens after the Trump tax plan  gets passed, if that happens.   A tax cut for the wealthy of the size President Trump is proposing  would explode the deficit, costing between $5.5 trillion and $7  trillion over 10 years, by some estimates. The Republicans might be  willing to ignore the debt and deficit now in order to get their tax  cut. But make no mistake about it, a few years down the line, they will  start howling about the deficit again and say: Oh, we have no choice  but to cut Social Security and Medicare to make up for the massive debt  they created with their tax cut. This has been the nefarious goal of  the hard right for decades.   In fact, the same story played out during the Bush years. President  Bush passed a big tax break, primarily for the wealthy. It racked up  debt, and then he pursued deep cuts to the social safety net to try to  balance the ledger. He might have gotten it, but Democrats stood in his  way. This could be deja vu all over again.   In sum, the very wealthy get a huge tax break while the middle class  gets very little. And down the road, programs like Social Security and  Medicare--so crucial to the middle class--would be endangered.   If this administration wants to pursue such a plan all on their own,  that is their choice, but as we saw with healthcare, the go-it-alone  approach doesn't guarantee success. What it does guarantee is a very  partisan bill that will benefit the very wealthy and the special  interests--a bill that I predict will be very, very unpopular with the  American people.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin)  is necessarily absent.
