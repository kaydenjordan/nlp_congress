 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 624) to require the Securities and Exchange Commission to carry  out a study of Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 624         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Promoting Transparent       Standards for Corporate Insiders Act''.       SEC. 2. SEC STUDY.         (a) Study.--        (1) In general.--The Securities and Exchange Commission       shall carry out a study of whether Rule 10b5-1 (17 C.F.R.       240.10b5-1) should be amended to--        (A) limit the ability of issuers and issuer insiders to       adopt a plan described under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A)(3) of       Rule 10b5-1 (``trading plan'') to a time when the issuer or       issuer insider is permitted to buy or sell securities during       issuer-adopted trading windows;        (B) limit the ability of issuers and issuer insiders to       adopt multiple trading plans;        (C) establish a mandatory delay between the adoption of a       trading plan and the execution of the first trade pursuant to       such a plan and, if so and depending on the Commission's       findings with respect to subparagraph (A)--        (i) whether any such delay should be the same for trading       plans adopted during an issuer-adopted trading window as       opposed to outside of such a window; and        (ii) whether any exceptions to such a delay are       appropriate;        (D) limit the frequency that issuers and issuer insiders       may modify or cancel trading plans;        (E) require issuers and issuer insiders to file with the       Commission trading plan adoptions, amendments, terminations       and transactions; or        (F) require boards of issuers that have adopted a trading       plan to--        (i) adopt policies covering trading plan practices;        (ii) periodically monitor trading plan transactions; and        (iii) ensure that issuer policies discuss trading plan use       in the context of guidelines or requirements on equity       hedging, holding, and ownership.        (2) Additional considerations.--In carrying out the study       required under paragraph (1), the Commission shall consider--        (A) how any such amendments may clarify and enhance       existing prohibitions against insider trading;        (B) the impact any such amendments may have on the ability       of issuers to attract persons to become an issuer insider;        (C) the impact any such amendments may have on capital       formation;        (D) the impact any such amendments may have on an issuer's       willingness to operate as a public company; and        (E) any other consideration that the Commission considers       necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors.        (b) Report.--Not later than the end of the 1-year period       beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, the       Commission shall issue a report to the Committee on Financial       Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee on       Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate containing       all findings and determinations made in carrying out the       study required under section (a).        (c) Rulemaking.--After the completion of the study required       under subsection (a), the Commission shall, subject to public       notice and comment, revise Rule 10b5-1 consistent with the       results of such study.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks on  this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to rise in support of H.R. 624 and to  recognize the bipartisan fashion in which this bill is being brought to  the floor and, in particular, thank Ranking Member McHenry for his work  on this bipartisan bill.   It is terrific to see the first bill out of the committee and onto  the floor be not only a bipartisan bill, but the kind of thing that I  think we should be able to find agreement on in this Congress.   We have a robust debate in the committee and in this Congress around  the question of how we establish well-balanced regulation on the  capital markets and the financial services industry. That is a good  debate in which the answer is always moving, but it is terrific to see  that we can agree that wherever there is an opportunity either for  fraudulent behavior, insider trading, or rent-seeking to occur--that is  to say, when there is an advantage for a particular player in the  market--that the parties can come together to move legislation like  H.R. 624.   Whatever we may think and however we may argue over the proper  balance of regulation, if market participants do not have confidence in  those markets, we have a huge problem. And nothing erodes confidence so  much as the suspicion that there may be players in the market who have  an inside advantage who are operating fraudulently.   So, again, I thank Mr. McHenry for his work on this bill. I thank  Chairwoman Waters, in particular, for her hard work on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank very much Madam Chairwoman for  yielding, and, again, to the ranking member. It is a delight, as I said  before, to come right out with a bipartisan bill that really addresses  the fundamental question of confidence in our markets.   H.R. 624--and I will be proud to vote for it and urge my colleagues  to do the same--closes a number of technical loopholes that have  allowed corporate  [[Page H1223]]  insiders over time flexibility to actually trade possibly on inside  information. That, of course, has the effect of causing regular  investors to wonder whether they want to compete with that sort of  player in the market.   H.R. 624 is a terrific bipartisan, thoughtful bill right out of the  gates in the Financial Services Committee.   I want to just take 30 seconds, though, to reflect on the fact that  at this point in time, there is currently no Federal law explicitly  prohibiting insider trading. That requires the SEC and the Department  of Justice to rely on general antifraud provisions in the law to go  after people suspected of insider trading.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would just like to urge the committee, the  chairwoman and the ranking member, to reflect on the words of U.S.  District Judge Jed Rakoff, who wrote: ``But if unlawful insider trading  is to be properly deterred, it must be adequately defined. The  appropriate body to do so, one would think, is Congress.''   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman and ranking member for their hard  work on this bill. I hope we can take it to the next step of making it  very clear that insider trading itself is a crime for the lack of  confidence that it generates in our capital markets.   Mr. Speaker, I again thank the chairwoman and the ranking member, and  I urge passage of H.R. 624.
