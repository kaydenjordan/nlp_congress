 Madam Speaker, as I rise, gasoline is once again flowing  through the Colonial Pipeline, and we are getting ready to undertake  our routine briefs--those of us who sit on the Intelligence Committee  and the Committee on Homeland Security--of this week's cyberattacks.  Many of them will have come from Russia, from China, from North Korea,  from Iran, or from some shadowy criminal group, which is often  sheltered or at least tolerated by one of these countries. Many will  have succeeded in stealing critical data or penetrating essential  networks. Only a few, like the recent attacks on the Colonial Pipeline,  will ever become publicly known.   There is a long list of things that we must do to stop these attacks.  We should require private companies to tell the public, or at least the  government, when these attacks occur. We should make sure that experts  in places like the NSA and the FBI are working side-by-side with  network operators to address these attacks, and we should have a clear  policy on the payment of ransom to ransomware attacks.   But at the very top of the list is the need to fundamentally change  the game by establishing a sure and swift deterrence.   Time and again, we do too little, too late.   Five years ago, President Obama responded to the Russian attack on  our 2016 election, the very essence of our democracy, with the  expulsion of 35 so-called Russian diplomats and the closing of a few  secondary Russian facilities, and he told Putin to ``cut it out.''  Putin barely felt the slap on the wrist.   We know that, because fewer than 4 years later, a Russian  intelligence agency used a supply chain attack on Microsoft and  SolarWinds to penetrate thousands of networks, including those of the  Federal Government. In response, the United States--you guessed it-- expelled some Russian diplomats.   For the bad guys, the cost of doing business is very low indeed.   It is time to strike back using our unparalleled offensive cyber  capabilities with the ferocity and precision and, yes, the  proportionality that these and many other cyberattacks would have  provoked had they been undertaken kinetically.   Let's hurl the full weight of the American legal, diplomatic, and  cyber capabilities against DarkSide and the organizations or countries  that assisted it. There is no reason why our immense power, if applied,  can't result in jailed hackers, businesses sanctioned into bankruptcy,  emptied bank accounts, and melted computers.   The same goes for Putin, who draws no formal distinction between the  Kremlin and the private groups who supply it with propaganda,  mercenaries, and hacking services. Putin respects only the  Machiavellian language of force and retribution. For him, all else is  tactical. So let's demonstrate the cyber capabilities we have spent  billions of dollars developing. Let's make sure that he and the  oligarchs who support him feel the fear and anxiety felt by millions of  Americans contemplating crashed email systems and gasoline lines down  the street.   The objection to my arguments has always been consistent: that as a  highly networked nation, we are particularly vulnerable to a cyber tit- for-tat. In a cyber exchange, the Russians, the Chinese, or the  Iranians might choose to attack our critical infrastructure, like, say,  a gasoline pipeline. Yes, there is risk, but that risk must be weighed  against the fully unacceptable status quo.   Hitting back isn't the only answer. It is part of the answer. In this  new world, a credible deterrent must be combined with clearly  articulated international rules, norms, and an understanding of our  national doctrines: all the things that helped keep the Cold War with  the Soviets from becoming hot.    Above all else, however, it is time to change the game and impose the  meaningful costs that will finally deter our adversaries. Until we do,  we are all just waiting for the next Colonial Pipeline attack.                            ____________________
