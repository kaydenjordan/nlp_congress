 Madam Speaker, America is at a crossroads. As the violent  riots at the Capitol last week so painfully and shockingly reminded us,  the unhinged partisan rhetoric that too often consumes the political  dialogue in this country has become toxic and is tearing us apart. If  we continue down this path, there is no telling how much damage to our  Union there may be.   Sadly, that is what is happening here today. The majority is rushing  through yet a second impeachment of President Trump, who has but 7 days  remaining in office. As prominent constitutional law professor Jonathan  Turley has cautioned: Today a dangerous precedent is being set that  could lead to the normalization of snap impeachments without any  hearings or any meaningful discussion or debate.   The majority is ramming through this House the most potent tool at  our disposal without a single hearing, turning a process that usually  takes months into a few short hours.   We haven't heard testimony from a single witness. We haven't heard  from any experts on the nature of these charges, nor the damage this  effort could inflict on our Republic. We didn't know even how this  debate would unfold until 9 a.m. this morning.   This is truly an unprecedented situation and one which could cause  irrevocable harm to our Nation.   Madam Speaker, it doesn't have to be this way. We don't have to  continue down this misguided path. We could instead follow the wisdom  provided by none other than Abraham Lincoln during another divisive  time in our Nation's history and listen to the better angels of our  nature. We could choose a more positive, constructive path and vote  down this ill-conceived effort.   We should tone down the political rhetoric. We should work together  to solve the problems that face our Nation. We should put aside our  differences and find common ground.   We should bring Americans back together because there is no crisis we  can't overcome if we stand united.
