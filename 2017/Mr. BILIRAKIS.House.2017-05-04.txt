 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2192 to  ensure Members of Congress and staff are not exempt from the American  Health Care Act. Making good on our word, this legislation will be  passed alongside the American Health Care Act and fixes a technical  error made to comply with the Senate rules.   In our country, lawmakers are not above the law. Elected officials  and the people we represent should have the same health care, period.   As an original cosponsor of H.R. 2192, I believe this is common  sense. It is straightforward legislation, and it is necessary as a  companion bill to the American Health Care Act.                                time  1130    It is really quite simple: Congress should live by the same laws it  creates.   When the American Health Care Act becomes law, Members of Congress  and staff will have the same health care as the American people. I urge  passage of H.R. 2192, in conjunction with the American Health Care Act.
