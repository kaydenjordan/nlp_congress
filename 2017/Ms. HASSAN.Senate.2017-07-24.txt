 Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Minnesota for  his words and his advocacy on behalf of the people of his State and all  across our country.   I rise today to join my colleagues and once again speak out against  the Senate Republican healthcare bill and the dangerous impact it would  have on the people of my home State of New Hampshire and Americans from  all walks of life.   This week, Senate Republicans are pressing ahead with plans that  would increase health insurance costs, give Americans worse health  insurance, and strip away health coverage from millions of Americans.  Yet, despite statements that a vote will come tomorrow or in a matter  of days, Senate Republican leadership will not tell even their own  Members what proposal we will vote on, let alone hold a hearing on the  impact of the bill.   As version after version of this bill has emerged from behind closed  doors, somehow each time it is even worse than the last, and every  version would be devastating for people across New Hampshire. These  bills would lead to higher costs for worse coverage. In fact, the  nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said we would see even  higher deductibles than the ones we already see. This proposal would  decimate the Medicaid Program and end Medicaid expansion. It would take  coverage away from millions. The Congressional Budget Office has  projected that between 22 and 32 million people would lose coverage,  depending on which bill we vote on.   We know that rising healthcare costs are squeezing hard-working  people across America. I have made clear to my colleagues across the  aisle that I am willing to work with anyone who is serious about  working together to build and improve on the Affordable Care Act, to  lower costs, but unfortunately these Senate Republican bills would do  just the opposite.   Over the past months, I have heard from people all across New  Hampshire. They have shared their most personal stories, their  frustrations, and their fears about what will happen if this bill  becomes law.   Last month, Senator Shaheen and I held an emergency hearing in  Concord to hear from our constituents about how proposals put forward  by Senate Republicans would impact them. We held this emergency hearing  at 2 p.m. on a Friday afternoon in the summer, with just a day's  notice. Yet hundreds of people showed up, and more than 50 people got  up and shared their most personal stories about the importance of  healthcare, of how they have benefited from the important protections  provided under current law, including maternity care, prescription drug  coverage, and coverage for substance use disorder services.   One of those Granite Staters was a woman named Maura from Exeter, NH.  Maura told us that the Affordable Care Act has been a ``financial life- saver'' for her family. She explained to us how, when she signed up for  health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, her premiums dropped  by $750 a month because of subsidies. As Maura described it, she and  her family were able to put the extra $750 each month toward childcare,  food, and their mortgage.   On another recent visit to Granite State Independent Living in  Concord, a nonprofit that provides a range of assisted-living services  for Granite Staters, I also heard about the importance of Medicaid from  a Granite Stater named Terry. Terry has physical disabilities and  requires the assistance of personal care aides, who are paid through  Medicaid. They help her with daily tasks, such as getting up in the  morning and getting dressed and preparing meals. Terry said that  without the support from Medicaid, she wouldn't be able to go to work,  to her job, or do basic tasks, such as shopping on her own. Without  Medicaid, she would need to burden her family in order to complete  everyday, basic activities, and she wouldn't be able to go to work.  Terry fears that this support could be taken away under this  legislation, and she is right. It could be. She said that given the  cuts to Medicaid and the provisions in TrumpCare, she ``wouldn't get  anywhere near what I need to survive.''   Finally, I have heard from advocates and those in recovery from  substance use disorders about how vital Medicaid expansion has been in  helping them get the support they need in order to get well and back on  their feet. In fact, those on the front lines of this epidemic have  said that Medicaid expansion is the No. 1 tool we have in order to  combat the heroin, fentanyl, and opioid crisis, which is the most  pressing public health and safety challenge facing my State.   A few weeks ago, I visited Goodwin Community Health in Somersworth  and heard from a woman named Elizabeth. At one point in her life, as a  result of substance misuse disorder, Elizabeth was homeless and she had  lost custody of her son. Elizabeth is now in recovery, and she works at  the SOS Recovery Community Organization in Rochester, helping others  get the support they need.   She said that she owes her recovery to Medicaid expansion and the  Affordable Care Act and that holding on to Medicaid is essential  because without it, many people who are in the throes of addiction  would not be able to find help.   Elizabeth said:         I just really want to emphasize the ripple effect that       recovery has on the community. It's not just because I'm in       recovery that I can help somebody else. Everyone around me is       impacted. When we talk about the recovery revolution, it's       about how everyone in the community is affected when someone       gets into recovery.    Elizabeth is right. People who can get healthcare can get healthy,  and that has a tremendous ripple effect. It lifts us all. It makes us  productive and strong.   At the heart of all of these stories--Maura, Terry, and Elizabeth-- and the stories that I hear all over my State is the basic fact that  our communities, our families, and our entire country are better off  when we give more people a chance to participate, to get the support  they need, to live their lives with dignity, to contribute to our  economy, and to thrive.   Unfortunately, if TrumpCare becomes law, the progress we have made  will be lost, insurance costs will rise, and millions of people will  lose the care that they need.   I am going to continue to stand with my Democratic colleagues and  fight against this legislation until we defeat it once and for all.   I urge the people of New Hampshire and across our beloved United  States of America to continue speaking out about how this legislation  would impact their lives.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). The Senator from Vermont.
