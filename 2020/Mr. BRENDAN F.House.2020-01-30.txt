 BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I am a proud  cosponsor of both of these bills on the floor today--H.R. 2456 to  repeal the 2002 AUMF and H.R. 5543, No War Against Iran to prevent any  funds from being used for military force against Iran. Having  previously voted in support of these bills as amendments to the Fiscal  Year 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, I believe bringing these  bills to the floor today is important in order to reassert Congress'  constitutional authority. The 2002 AUMF is an outdated piece of  legislation. U.S. military deployments and operations carried out  pursuant to the 2002 AUMF--dubbed Operation Iraqi Freedom--officially  concluded in 2011. Almost 18 years after the resolution's passage, the  United States recognizes the sovereignty of Iraq and considers Iraq a  key ally. Under the constitution, Congress has the sole authority to  declare war. Repealing obsolete AUMFs is essential to Congress living  up to its constitutional responsibilities. Leaving the 2002 AUMF in  place increases the likelihood that future Presidents will use it as a  basis to start a new war, or expand a current one, without Congress's  explicit authorization. Following our January 9 vote on, H. Con. Res.  83, a War Powers Resolution to make clear the President could not  constitutionally escalate the conflict with Iran without congressional  approval, the Trump Administration has only continued to thumb its nose  at the Constitution and has ignored Congress' authority as a coequal  branch of government. I, again, urge the Trump Administration to  refocus its efforts on creating a coherent and constructive strategy  towards the Middle East.    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, had I been  present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 33 and ``yea'' on  rollcall No. 34.                             PERSONAL EXPLANATION
