 Madam Speaker, restaurants and small businesses are the  heart and soul of our communities, but  [[Page H4410]]  the pandemic has cost them over $280 billion in sales, and  approximately 90,000 were forced to close.   That is why we created the Restaurant Revitalization Fund, a historic  investment to increase aid to restaurants and bars hit hardest by the  pandemic. The funding has run out, and restaurants are still  struggling.   In Connecticut, the restaurants have been one of the hardest hit  sectors by the pandemic. Due to high demand, I heard from far too many  of my constituents who applied on the very first day the RRF funds were  available and were still unable to receive them. We must do more to  ensure that small businesses receive the funding they need to survive  and continue to serve our communities.   The bill before us does just that by providing $42 billion to  replenish the fund and putting $13 billion toward other businesses  impacted by the pandemic. This bill is the center of our efforts to  help these small businesses survive and thrive.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to voting in favor of this bill, and I  urge my colleagues to do the same.
