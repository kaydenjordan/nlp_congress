 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   While we fight the COVID-19 pandemic, we must continue to focus on  economic relief and recovery for our workers, businesses, and  communities. A major investment in infrastructure can get America up  and running again.   This bill is transformational and supports not only the roads, rails,  and waterways across our country, but also the schools, housing, and  broadband that connects our communities.   This package will invest $1.3 billion in transportation dollars into  my home State of New Hampshire over the next 5 years, creating good,  high-paying jobs and making long-overdue improvement.   This bill reflects the priorities I have heard about from Granite  Staters, including the expansion of active transportation networks,  increased funding for computer rail programs, provisions for climate  resiliency, and helpful wastewater treatment plants to manage PFAS  contamination.   This comprehensive approach to infrastructure is critical to pave the  way for our Nation's recovery. I urge my colleagues to come together to  support this legislation and a stronger future for all Americans.
