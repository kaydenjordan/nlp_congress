 Madam President, I am honored to pay tribute to the  memory of a true American hero, Jacklyn ``Jack'' Harrell Lucas.   Jack, a long-time resident of Mississippi, and the youngest marine to  ever receive the Medal of Honor, left an indelible mark on American  history. During the Battle of Iwo Jima, Jack jumped between two live  grenades to shield three of his fellow marines from the explosion. This  act of heroism caused him significant injuries. Even after his time in  the military, Jack continued to inspire generations through his  commitment to veterans' causes and his advocacy for those who suffered  in service to their country. Jack Lucas took his final salute on June  5, 2008, in Hattiesburg, MS, leaving behind his wife, their five  children, and a legacy of patriotism and service to this Nation.   On October 7, 2023, the Navy will commission its first Arleigh Burke  Flight III guided-missile destroyer. DDG-125 will bear the name of this  distinguished son of Mississippi, Jack. H. Lucas. The USS Jack H. Lucas  was built at Ingalls Shipyard in Pascagoula, MS, further highlighting  Mississippi's commitment to the defense of the United States.   Jack's heroism will continue to inspire generations of Americans for  years to come. As we reflect upon the life of Jack H. Lucas, let us  honor his memory by dedicating ourselves to upholding the principles  for which he so bravely fought.                            ____________________
