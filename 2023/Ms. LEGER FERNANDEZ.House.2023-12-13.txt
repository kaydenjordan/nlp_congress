 Mr. Speaker, every conspiracy theory we just  heard has been debunked, not true, and distorted from the facts because  this impeachment inquiry is political vengeance directed by a twice- impeached, four times indicted President and carried out by extreme  MAGA Republicans.   Republicans rejected my amendment to require the committees to hold  at least one public hearing.   Why?   It is because 11 months and a mountain of evidence and documents  gathered so far prove that President Biden respected the rule of law  and fought corruption.   Republicans want to continue a secret investigation so they can  distort the facts.   For example, Republicans tried to create a scandal about the $4,140  Hunter paid to his dad in 2018.   What really happened?   Joe Biden paid his son's truck payments while Hunter struggled with  addiction. Hunter paid his dad back. A parent's love is never without  pain. A  [[Page H6881]]  parent doesn't stop loving a child struggling with addiction.   Americans will see in those truck payments some of their own attempts  to help their struggling kids.   Shame on my colleagues for politicizing a parent's pain. Americans  know what evidence of an impeachment looks like.   The Capitol Police who were battered and beaten as Trump tried to  overturn an election know what an impeachable offense feels like.   This puppet show is more of the same attack on our democracy that we  saw here.                                time  1300
