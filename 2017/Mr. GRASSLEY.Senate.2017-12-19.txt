 Mr. President, today we have the opportunity to pass  the most sweeping changes to our Tax Code in more than 30 years. This  historic moment is long overdue, and my constituents in Iowa will  benefit from it.   Since the last tax reform effort in 1986, the Tax Code has grown out  of control in both length and complexity. All told, taxpayers spend  over 6 billion hours annually just complying with the dictates of the  Internal Revenue Code. Moreover, our outdated corporate tax system puts  American companies at a competitive disadvantage as they try to compete  in the 21st century global economy.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will make good on our commitment to provide  significant tax relief to middle-income taxpayers both in my State of  Iowa and in the entire United States, while making the Tax Code  simpler, fairer, and, obviously, more pro-growth.   The bill provides significant tax simplification for the vast  majority of tax filers. Most taxpayers will find that they are better  off simply by taking the standard deduction. No longer will they have  to spend hours sifting through receipts and forms to determine what  they can and cannot deduct.   Middle-income taxpayers can also expect to see significant tax cuts.  A median income family of four could see their tax bill reduced by over  $2,000. This is relief that families will see almost immediately, as  less tax is withheld from their paychecks. This tax relief stems from  many pro-family and pro-middle-class income tax provisions in the  legislation.   First, there is the nearly doubling of the standard deduction. For  families, this means the first $24,000 of their income will be exempt  from tax altogether. As a result, a significant number of lower income  Americans will be removed from the tax rolls entirely.   Second, the middle-income tax brackets are significantly lowered and  expanded to include more taxpayers. This includes reducing the current  15 percent bracket to 12 percent, and the 25 percent bracket to 22  percent.   Third, the tax bill specifically recognizes the costs associated with  raising a child by doubling the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000.  Furthermore, to ensure that lower income families with children are  able to benefit from this expansion, the refundable portion of the tax  credit is increased from $1,000 to $1,400.   While my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have attempted to  claim that this tax bill is all out to help the wealthy, I want to make  very clear that this is simply not true. This is evidenced from the  features of the bill that I just discussed, but, also, if you need more  evidence, look no further than the distribution analysis of the bill by  the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation of the Congress of the  United States. According to the analysis of the Joint Committee on  Taxation, on average, every income group will experience a tax cut,  with the largest percentage tax cuts going to the middle-income groups.  Moreover, the tax bill would make the Tax Code more progressive, with  taxpayers earning more than $1 million shouldering a larger share of  the tax burden than they do under current law.   The bill also enacts much needed tax relief for job creators. It  provides a significant deduction on business income for small  businesses, effectively lowering the top tax rate to under 30 percent.  All small businesses down to the smallest family-owned corner store and  the family farmer stand to benefit from this provision. As small  businesses are responsible for creating the majority of new jobs, this  is a key provision promoting economic growth and job creation.   Additionally, the bill lowers the statutory corporate rate down from  the highest in the developed world to 21 percent. The highest rate in  the developed world at 35 percent makes our current corporate tax rate  on American companies the highest of those industrialized nations and  puts us at a  [[Page S8107]]  competitive disadvantage globally, costing American jobs.   Moreover--and this is important for the John Deere workers in  Waterloo, IA, or in any other corporation--economists generally agree  that a significant portion of the corporate tax falls on workers in the  form of reduced wages. Estimates of this burden of the corporate tax on  workers ranges from a low of 25 percent to a high of 70 percent. While  the exact amount may be debated by economists, one thing is very clear.  A corporate rate reduction will result in bigger paychecks for hard- working Americans.   These business tax reforms are crucial to getting our economy  growing. We can't continue to settle for the anemic growth of less than  2 percent that we have experienced since 2010. Lower tax rates, coupled  with greater expensing of depreciated equipment under the bill, will  encourage new capital investments that are necessary to increase  productivity, generating both higher wages and higher growth.   The bill before us signals the faith we have in the ingenuity and  entrepreneurial spirit of the American people, rather than putting our  faith in government to grow the economy. We do this to get our economy  on the right track, and this legislation will put us on the right  track. In all, tax reform will put more money in the pockets of middle- class Americans, make U.S. industry and workers more competitive, and  get the economy growing again after 8 years of stagnation--the most  stagnation in any decade since World War II.   This is a historic opportunity to help Americans from every walk of  life. I look forward to joining my colleagues to pass this once-in-a- generation tax bill and have it signed into law before the new year.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, in the 114th Congress, we came very  close to passing Kevin and Avonte's Law, a bill named in honor of two  boys with autism who wandered away from their caregivers and drowned.   I reintroduced this legislation last month with Senators Klobuchar,  Tillis, Schumer, and others to equip communities with important tools  to help locate individuals who wander away from their families or  caregivers due to dementia or a developmental disability. The bill we  crafted adds new protections for children with developmental  disabilities, like autism, which are linked to wandering.   The original version of this bill, which I authored with Senator  Schumer, passed both Chambers of Congress late last year. It passed  this Chamber by voice vote over a year ago, while a similar House  companion garnered over 90 cosponsors before passing the other Chamber,  346-66, last December. Unfortunately, we ran out of time to resolve the  differences between the two Chamber's versions before the 114th  Congress adjourned.   This year, the Judiciary Committee approved Kevin and Avonte's Law by  voice vote, and, before reporting the bill to the full Senate last  month, we reached bipartisan consensus on an offset. Our offset  consists of the Federal Register Printing Savings Act, which Senator  Portman introduced earlier this year. Senator Portman's office agreed  to work with us and incorporate S. 1195 into Kevin and Avonte's Law. We  currently are seeking unanimous consent to pass both bills in one  legislative package.   Meanwhile, the House has passed its own version of the Federal  Register Printing Savings Act, introduced by Congressman Russell of  Oklahoma. The House-passed version of that bill won the approval of the  Homeland Security Committee earlier this year, and that panel is  seeking unanimous consent to pass it. I support this legislation, which  is virtually identical to Senator Portman's bill, but I placed a  temporary hold on the House companion yesterday, so that we can find a  way to pass that legislation and Kevin and Avonte's Law simultaneously.   By ensuring that both measures pass as one package, we can make  additional resources available to equip first responders, law  enforcement officials, and other community leaders with the training  and tools necessary to better prevent and respond to missing person  cases. By doing so, we also can make grants available to educate and  train caregivers as well as other members of the community on how to  prevent wandering by those with dementia or developmental disabilities.                            ____________________
