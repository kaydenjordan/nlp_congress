 Mr. Chairman, this morning I called a 12-year-old in my  district who is worried about their future as a nonbinary kid in this  country. They should be playing and learning, and not writing to their  Congress Member, desperate to not lose their right to exist.   These are the priorities of the Republican majority--not addressing  gun violence, rising rent, or medical bills, but violating the privacy  of children. I am glad I get previews. I get special previews of what  this Republican majority is going to try to do in this body because  they are simply taking bills that are being passed in Florida and  across the South, horrible bills, and trying to get them passed up  here.   This isn't about a problem that needs a solution, but about  politicians looking for a target. We want freedom and liberty for all  of our people, and they want the government to be in children's pants.  Disgusting.   History will not look kindly on this. Trans people will continue to  fight for equity. We will be right by their side, and we will win.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today because the American people know  that their right to abortion care is under attack.   As I speak right now, across the street, the Supreme Court of the  United States is getting ready to rule on whether or not to keep a ban  on restrictions on an abortion pill that has been around for decades  and has safely helped millions when they needed it the most.   In my home State of Florida, our wanna-be-President of a Governor  signed a 6-week abortion ban into law that effectively means that  people who have been raped, who are the victims of incest, and who are  experiencing life-threatening pregnancies are going to be denied the  care that they need and will be forced to give birth.   It is barbaric and disgusting. That isn't liberty. That isn't  freedom. Being able to make a decision about your future and your body,  that is freedom. Having control over your own reproductive care, that  is freedom. Having a choice, that is freedom. That is what we need to  fight for: freedom and liberty for all of our people, not ripping away  one of their most sacred human rights.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I am here today because I am ecstatic that we  have a President who has chosen to lead with love and compassion when  it comes to other humans in this country.   I thank President Biden for having the heart and courage to do what  his predecessor never did: show respect and dignity to Dreamers and  DACA recipients, who came to the United States through no choice of  their own and are full-fledged Americans in every single way but one-- on paper.   The Biden administration's move to expand healthcare coverage to DACA  recipients is bold and historic and follows Democrats' commitment to  helping immigrant communities that have spent their lives living in the  shadows of this country.   There are over half a million Dreamers in the United States who were  extended a literal lifeline through the Deferred Action for Childhood  Arrivals, or DACA, and over 20,000 DACA recipients who call my home  State of Florida their home.   Though DACA has been a wonderful beacon of hope for so many, through  his action, President Biden has acknowledged that more can be done to  help this vulnerable community.   For years now, DACA recipients have been living with a weight on  their shoulders. Constantly worried about losing their job means the  end of being able to afford care, forcing them to stay in working  environments that perhaps mistreat them, backed into a corner where  they have to decide between getting to see a doctor or having to push  through the pain and the illness.   Let me be clear. No one should have to make that decision between  access to medical care or putting food on the table or having a roof  over their head. Healthcare in this country is and should be a human  right for all people by virtue of being alive.   That is a scenario that is all too familiar for DACA recipients. I  have read stories of young people from my hometown in central Florida  who have gotten healthcare for the first time in their lives only then  to lose that care because of a layoff or job cuts.   I am hard-pressed to find a working person or working family that can  afford to pay $500 or more a month for health insurance. I have always  said that if you love somebody, you want them to have healthcare and a  good-paying job that treats them fairly. If you love somebody, you want  them to succeed and thrive. If you love somebody, you want them to be  healthy and to be able to see a doctor or medical professional if, God  forbid, they become sick.   Dreamers are people. DACA recipients are people. Immigrants are  people. They deserve to be able to get their care through Medicaid and  the ACA just like anybody else in this country.   We still have so much work left to do to ensure that we actually  create a humane, compassionate immigration system that offers a real  pathway to citizenship for the hundreds of thousands of Dreamers and  DACA recipients who call Florida and this country home, but this action  is a beacon of hope.   To the Dreamers across the country who are listening right now: Hear  me when we say we won't stop fighting, not just for you but with you.  Home is here. Healthcare is a human right.   I thank all the organizers, young people, advocacy groups, and allies  across the country who have spent years fighting for this very moment.  Let's get to work and continue to provide for all people.
