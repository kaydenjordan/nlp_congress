 Madam Speaker, this budget resolution allows us to  implement President Biden's Build Back Better agenda to revitalize our  economy by creating millions of good-paying jobs, and it allows us to  aggressively combat the climate crisis. The goal of the Energy and  Commerce Committee with this budget resolution is to make healthcare  more affordable and accessible for all Americans. We can help  accomplish that by closing the Medicaid coverage gap to provide quality  comprehensive coverage to an estimated 4 million Americans who qualify  for Medicaid but who have been denied access to care in their State.   It will also continue subsidies under the Affordable Care Act to  reduce health insurance costs. The Energy and Commerce Committee plans  to lower the price of out-of-control and skyrocketing prescription drug  prices by giving the Federal Government the ability to negotiate lower  prices and will use the savings to expand Medicare benefits. Our plan  is to provide investments in our public health infrastructure to help  us respond to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and better respond to  future public health emergencies.   The Build Back Better agenda will allow us to create millions of new,  homegrown jobs and combat the climate crisis by aggressively investing  in clean energy and clean technology. The moment is here to invest in a  more advanced and resilient economy and toward a 100 percent clean  economy.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this budget resolution  that allows us to carry out President Biden's bold vision and deliver  on the Build Back Better agenda for the people.
