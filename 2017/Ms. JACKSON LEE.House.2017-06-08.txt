 Mr. Chair, I rise today to speak in opposition to  H.R. 10, the ``Financial CHOICE Act of 2017''.   I agree with Ranking Member Maxine Waters by calling this bill the  ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act. H.R. 10 is a misguided anti-regulatory bill that  will only diminish national efforts to protect and secure the financial  stability of our nation.   H.R. 10 is ill-conceived, destroying key financial regulations and  consumer protections put in place by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform  and Consumer Protection Act.   H.R. 10 aims to deregulate a financial system that has failed to  regulate itself in the past leading to the financial crash of 2008.   The nation still feels the reverberations of that crisis to this day.   We all remember the foreclosures, the neighborhoods and communities  financially devastated, the jobs lost, and the retirements deferred.   Americans lost $13 trillion in household wealth, 11 million Americans  lost their homes, and the unemployment rate climbed to 10 percent.   This bill is inherently paradoxical because it claims to promote  self-accountability on Wall Street, by taking away governmental  regulations on financial institutions, but that is not the nature of  the beast.   As evidenced by a very recent past, if given the opportunity, Wall  Street runs rampant with greed and disregard for the citizens of our  country.   After the 2008 financial crash, Congress enacted legislation to  protect those that are most vulnerable and to help the country regain  its rightful place in the economic system.   H.R. 10 attempts to halt the progress made to protect our economy and  puts our entire nation's economy at risk of another crisis by launching  an attack against the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), an  institution designed to ensure a financial crash such as the 2008  crisis does not occur again.   CFPB is an effective government institution that has returned nearly  $12 billion to consumers cheated by banks and other financial  institutions.   This bill strips the bureau's ability to stop unfair and abusive  practices perpetuated by financial institutions by removing the  bureau's political independence, threatening its funding and crippling  its ability to ensure Americans' financial welfare.   Taking away CFPB's power is harmful to consumers and small investors,  those whose life savings and futures depend on the protections that  Congress provides.   People of color and low-income families remain especially vulnerable  to the abuse perpetuated by financial institutions.   Houston, home to some of the most diverse population in the nation,  would see direct consequences. H.R. 10 would risk the livelihood of  many living in Houston.   The ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act abandons hard working people and aids Wall  Street in the abuse of hard working Americans, jeopardizing the  financial stability of the entire nation.   The ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act will drag us back to the days when lax  lending, predatory practices and profiteers on Wall Street take  advantage of vulnerable American families.   We must not return to the days when massive taxpayer bailouts were  the norm.   We must not put our financial stability in jeopardy of another  financial meltdown.                                time  1445     Madam Speaker, I rise to discuss two issues and to  speak on their impact to the American people.   The first one is the Financial CHOICE Act, which we just debated. I  oppose it for the very reason that we passed Dodd-Frank. We passed it  to respond to the greatest recession in 80 years, which saw a financial  crisis that caused working men and women to lose the greatest amount of  wealth they have ever lost. Yet, our colleagues here believe that it is  important to choose large corporate interests over working men and  women.   At the same time, today we heard the testimony of Director Comey  under oath. He gave a list of very troublesome acts and words offered  by the President of the United States. Shortly thereafter, the  President's lawyer, who was not under oath, came forward to deny,  disparage, and suggest that Director Comey was not telling the truth.   That is clearly an indication that the Judiciary Committee should  begin an inquiry. That is our jurisdictional duty: to begin an inquiry  to discern who is telling the truth. The FBI is under our jurisdiction.   It is time for the House to hold hearings now. The truth must be  known by the American people.                            ____________________
