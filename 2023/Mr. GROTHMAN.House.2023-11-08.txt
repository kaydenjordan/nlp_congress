 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment eliminates funding for the  Department of the Treasury's Community Development Financial  Institutions Fund.   This amendment, if passed, would save $280 million in fiscal year  2024.   Let me emphasize one more time that in putting together all these  appropriations bills, the goal of all Members should be to reduce the  level of spending.   In the year that has just wrapped up, we are borrowing 22 percent of  every dollar spent. If you are borrowing 22 percent of every dollar  spent, you have a big problem. Even if we stick to the numbers that we  agreed to in raising the debt limit bill, next year, the amount we are  borrowing will be equal to 23 percent of every dollar spent.   Mr. Chair, we have a real crisis here. Things are getting worse and  worse as we go through these appropriations bills, so we should be  looking for fewer ways to spend money and return it to the Treasury.   The CDFI Fund provides grants to community development financial  institutions, community development entities, and other private  financial institutions. As a result of that, this amendment not only  saves money but saves money by taking away money from a fund that  frequently results in public-private partnerships.                                time  1030    I think there is nothing worse than public-private partnerships,  because it means what you are doing is you wind up enriching already  wealthy people at the expense of the taxpayer and allowing people in  the community to become wealthier, not by necessarily doing something  that is better for the community or successful in the free market. You  become wealthier by schmoozing with the local elected officials.   I think it is corporate welfare. I don't like corporate welfare. I  think over time, more and more people are getting wealthy, not by  providing something that would be winnable in the free market, but they  do something by taking advantage of grants and credits offered by the  government.   I will quote The Heritage Foundation: ``The only rigorous empirical  assessment of the NMTC to date found the program to be largely  ineffective at meeting its goals of increasing community investment and  development. The study found that most CDE investments were relocated  investments rather than new net investments''--in other words,  transferring one business to another area--``suggesting that `all NMTC  investments do not likely represent new funds to low-income  communities.' ''   President Trump tried to eliminate this in his 2021 budget, showing  that President Trump was sometimes a President who was pushing for less  spending. In his budget, they noted that the CDFI fund was created to  jump-start an industry at a time when CDFIs had limited access to  private capital. The CDFI industry now has ready access to capital  needed to extend credit and offer financial services to underserved  communities, eliminating the need for such grants.   In the interest of ending cronyism, saving some tax dollars, stopping  government waste, and getting rid of a program that I think too  frequently makes wealthy development types still wealthier, I urge a  ``yes'' vote on this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I will just make one more point here.  Assuming some of this money benefits Americans, not just the wealthy  wheeler-dealers, we right now--at least if Wisconsin is any  indication--have huge surpluses in our State coffers. If it is a good  idea, it should be handled by the States, not by the Federal Government  that is broke out of its mind.   One of the reasons we are so broke is too many of my colleagues don't  look at the Constitution and realize that some things are supposed to  be handled by the State and local government and other things are  supposed to be handled by the Federal Government. By the time you drip  the money down from the Federal Government, there is a huge amount of  waste there.   In any event, in the interest of trying to keep our dollar the strong  currency it has been throughout our lifetime, I urge adoption of this  amendment and send these programs back to the States.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
