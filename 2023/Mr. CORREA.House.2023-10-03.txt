 Madam Speaker, today, I rise in honor of UCLA's  Chancellor Gene Block to thank him for 17 years of leadership at  America's premier public institution of education, UCLA.   Since 2007, Chancellor Block has increased accessibility and  diversity, grown enrollment, and doubled funding for research at UCLA.  Today, nearly a third of UCLA graduates are first-generation college  students, as Chancellor Block was himself.   Madam Speaker, as a proud UCLA alumnus, I thank Chancellor Block for  his service to the public and to the Bruin community, and for keeping  UCLA as a top research institution in the Nation. Go Bruins.                         Recognizing Gustavo Ocegueda     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a young man in my  district, Gustavo Ocegueda, a remarkable young man whose journey is one  of determination and inspiration.   When he was a boy, Gustavo looked at the sky and began collecting  model planes, dreaming of becoming a commercial pilot.   As a proud Godinez Fundamental High School alumnus, he stayed focused  on his dream, worked hard, volunteered in the community, and played  basketball.   He grew up in an underserved community, but his parents' support and  sacrifice and hard work pushed him to study at Embry-Riddle  Aeronautical University where Gustavo spent long nights studying in the  library. In the end, it was all worth it.   The multiple jobs and family sacrifices were all worth it when his  mother joined him as his first passenger on a commercial flight. He is  now a commercial pilot and has finally achieved his dream.   Madam Speaker, I thank Gustavo for his great work and keep flying  high.                            ____________________
