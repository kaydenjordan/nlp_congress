 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate the Brubaker family from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania,  owners and operators of Brubaker Farms, as they celebrate the notable  Pennsylvania Leopold Conservation Award.   This award is given in honor of the world-renowned conservationist  Aldo Leopold, who many consider being the father of wildlife ecology  and a devout conservationist.   The Pennsylvania Leopold Conservation Award recognizes Pennsylvania  farmers, ranchers, and foresters who inspire others with their  dedication to land, water, and wildlife habitat resources in their  care.   America's farmers, ranchers, and foresters are the original  conservationists, and the Brubaker family is no exception.   The Brubaker Farm is a 1,200-cow dairy run by Luke Brubaker and his  sons, Mike and Tony. They use an assortment of conservation practices  to farm the acres, to feed their herd, including no-till farming and  cover crops.   Additionally, the Brubakers fenced cattle away from streams and  planted trees in 15 acres of riparian buffers, allowing deer, turtles,  and waterfowl in the area to thrive.   Mr. Speaker, the Brubaker family has a longstanding history of being  true stewards of the earth, and their continual commitment and  dedication to conservation while remaining competitive in the dairy  industry is a noteworthy feat.   Once again, I want to congratulate the Brubaker family on this well- deserved accomplishment, and I look forward to seeing what the future  holds for this family-owned farm.                            ____________________
