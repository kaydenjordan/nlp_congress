 Mr. President, I rise today to honor a great man  and Montanan.   Donald Lee Clark was a soldier, husband, father, professor, author,  and mentor who loved, lived, and learned for all of his 90 years.   He tested positive for COVID-19 on November 28, 2020, and died 7 days  later. At a time when it is easy to be a cynic, Clark was unusually  optimistic, surrounding himself with family and friends who admired and  loved him.   Throughout his accomplished life in the Air Force, where he served  our Nation as a colonel, Clark never lost sight of making time to enjoy  the world or people around him. He earned a 3rd degree black belt in  Judo from the Kodokan Judo College while stationed in Japan. He learned  to scuba dive as an attache in the Soviet Union in hopes of diving in  the world's deepest lake. He taught himself to ride a unicycle just for  the fun of it and took up skiing in his 40s while living in New  Hampshire as a research fellow at the Fletcher School of Law and  Diplomacy at Tufts University. He skied the Alps while serving as an  action officer assigned to the joint staff in the Office of  International Negotiations.   He was born in Dallas, TX, to Victor and Sheppard Clark. Don is  survived by his wife of 65 years Patricia Conway Clark, their two sons  Brian and his wife Marie of Kalispell, Darren and his wife Myrna of  Rancho Santa Margarita, CA, and three grandsons Kellin Clark and his  wife Lauren Fox of Washington, DC, and Ryan Clark and Kevin Clark of  California. He was preceded in death by his older sister Delores.   Don and his sister were raised in Dallas by their single mother  Sheppard. He attended Southern Methodist University on theology and  ROTC scholarships and graduated with a degree in sociology. He later  earned his masters in political science from George Washington  University while in the Air Force.   He met and later married the love of his life Patricia Conway in 1955  at Perkins Chapel on the campus of Southern Methodist University. After  graduating from SMU, Clark began his military service career, which  included assignments around the U.S. and the world.   During his military career, he served in the Strategic Air Command as  a B29 navigator, Air Training Command, Security Service, and  Intelligence. Most of his 23-year military career was focused on  intelligence. He was a Soviet specialist for numerous U.S. delegations  including the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, Law of the Seas, and  Mutual and Balanced Force Reductions.   He retired from the Air Force as a colonel in 1974 and moved his  family from DC to Bozeman to ski at Bridger Bowl and become the  assistant to the president at Montana State University. Six years  later, he became the director of international education where he also  taught courses in political science. He later started MSU's  International Education programs while teaching classes in  international affairs. While at MSU, he wrote a weekly newspaper column  for several Montana dailies, excerpts from which were sometimes  broadcast over Voice of America. His writings also appeared in  ``Skiing'' magazine, the Air University Review, the ``Alternative,''  and Defense Analysis.   After 20 years of teaching at MSU, Clark retired again and moved with  Patricia to Flathead Lake just outside of Bigfork, MT. In his  retirement, Clark started writing fiction and published several novels  intertwining his passion for politics, world affairs and the human  condition. In his 70s, Clark also volunteered his time to numerous  community groups. Clark joined CASA--Court Appointed Special  Advocates--and became a key volunteer working with families and  children in need. He served on the State advisory board for CASA and on  the United Way and Red Cross advisory boards in Montana.   Don was never a victim in life or in death, but his loss is his final  teaching moment. Even as his mind was fading with Alzheimers, he  maintained his positive attitude. He never failed to tell his family  how proud he was, how much he loved them, and what a wonderful life he  had lived. Don will be missed.                            ____________________
