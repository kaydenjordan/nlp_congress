 Madam Speaker, as I get set up, in past years, when I  used to have to sit up there, it was because the Speaker was annoyed  with me. I am sure that would never happen in your case. You don't have  to say anything.   Madam Speaker, I try to come to the floor every week and sort of talk  about what we see actually happening in the economy, what is happening  in jobs, and those things. But it is more of a global discussion. And  part of that discussion is we see the stories, we know the facts; we  are about to be buried in a debt tsunami. And it is not Republicans and  Democrats. It is demographics.   There are 74 million of us who are baby boomers; 74 million. We are  halfway through turning 65, moving into our earned benefits. And it is  such a difficult subject around here because, the fact of the matter  is, as soon as you use the word Medicare or Social Security in any type  of discussion, even when you are passionately trying to protect those  programs, in our modern politics of rage, you just wrote an attack ad  saying, well, he talked about Medicare; he must be meaning to do  something. That is absurd. If we are not talking about it, we are not  going to save them.   Here is the thought experiment. Next 5 years, just the growth of  Social Security, Medicare, healthcare entitlements, but mostly  Medicare, just the growth, equals the entire Defense Department.   Last week, I was here with some boards walking you through, showing  [[Page H1152]]  that almost all the 30-year debt, almost every dime of it, is just  Social Security and Medicare. It is demographics. And my passion is, I  believe there is a way we keep our promises, by using a calculator, by  using, actually, economic modeling, using the tools we have around us.   The problem is, in this body, it is complex. Our ability to do simple  things the last year has been just incredibly heartbreaking because  everything is right now about political gamesmanship, one-upmanship,  trying to get the lead, instead of dealing with the reality. It is  complex.   So I put up this slide almost every time I come speak, trying to make  the point that if you can grow the economy through tax policy, through  trade policy, through smart regulations, population stability, getting  the immigration system correct, family formation, the adoption of  disruptive technology in healthcare--and we are going to talk about  that a little bit today--incentives to stay in the labor force.    We are having a miracle right now, mathematically, of the number of  our brothers and sisters who are in the labor force and moving into the  labor force.   Last Friday, the number of folks who moved from not even looking that  entered the labor force was stunning. I know that is geeky, but it is  really, really, really important.   I have sat on the Joint Economic Committee now for years, and it was  only 3 or 4 years ago we would have these really smart economists come  and tell us that labor force participation was going to crash; this  type of full employment economy was impossible.   It is here. These types of wage gains, as you know, we just had to  recalculate. The productivity numbers turned out to be much higher in  2019 than we thought they were.   How do we take what is working right now, expand those concepts so we  hit a level of economic stability and growth that gives us a fighting  chance not to be buried in debt? And how does that become partisan rage  around here?   I accept my brothers and sisters on the left live in an economic  folklore of, well, we will tax rich people, and that will take care of  it. And my brothers and sisters with me on the Republican side, we  often will get behind microphones and say things like, well, it is  waste and fraud. None of those are true.   Let's just, for once, try to tell the truth about the math. The math  is stunningly ugly. Simple concepts.   And even last week, I think I brought this board here. If you take  the next 30 years, and you pull Social Security and Medicare out, that  next 30 years--and I have a 4-year old; I would really like her to have  the same type of future I got to experience in my life. But if I strip  Social Security and Medicare out of the next 30 years, we have $23  trillion in the bank. We are $23 trillion positive. Not inflation  adjusted; that is the raw number.   If I pull Social Security and Medicare back into that 30-year window,  we are $103 trillion in debt. And if you want to do constant dollars  removed, then drop the number by a third.                                time  1300    You cannot be intellectually credible, honest walking behind these  microphones saying you are going to protect Social Security, you are  going to protect Medicare, and then not be willing to talk about the  actual math. Because I think there is a way that we keep our promises;  it just means we have to do everything.   So one of the first things I want to walk through today is a concept,  and I am desperately trying to sell and have this sort of become  intellectually sort of socialized.   The ACA, ObamaCare, if you really strip it down, what was it? It was  a financing bill. Take it down to its most basic. This is hard for a  lot of us to accept, but it was who got subsidized and who had to pay.   Our Republican alternative, if you really strip it down, what was it?  It was a financing bill. It is who got to pay and who got subsidized.   We almost never have an honest argument around here of what to do to  crash the price of healthcare. We have lots of discussions of little  incremental changes, and all those incremental changes are important,  whether it be HSAs, whether it be disclosures of cost and these things.  Wonderful. But they are dishonest when you start to understand the  scale--the scale--of what is coming at us.   Back to that 5 years; make it 10 years. Just the growth of Social  Security, mostly Medicare, healthcare entitlements, equals the entire  discretionary budget. Just the growth portion.   So what do you do to disrupt the cost of healthcare? And my argument  is we need to legalize technology.   I am not going to show it today, but in the past, I have come here  and shown that we now have the technology; it is in its final stages of  hopefully being perfected. It looks like a big kazoo. You blow into it  and it instantly tells you you have the flu. It instantly could bang  off your medical records on your phone, instantly order your  antivirals.   The algorithm we know right now is incredibly accurate, except that  technology is illegal in today's conscript. Think of that.   So how do you disrupt healthcare prices? Well, one, I am going to  take us to something a little bit different.   Did you know that almost a half a trillion a year--actually, over  half a trillion a year, 16 percent of our entire healthcare cost, is  just people not following the rules for their pharmaceuticals. They  don't take their hypertension medicine. They take too much of this.  They don't take this. That is an adherence problem.   Sixteen percent of our entire healthcare cost is the failure to  follow your pharmaceutical protocols. That is not drug pricing; that is  not prescription pricing; that is not a PBM; that is not a benefit.  That is just you and I, as Americans, we are not following the rules  for the pharmaceuticals we have.   Well, it turns out the fastest thing you and I could do to actually  have an immediate pop-down on the price of healthcare is actually  change pharmaceutical adherence.   Well, it turns out we have technology for that, and here is the  thought experiment. We have pill bottle tops that tell you when you  open it up or if you didn't open it up, and it will ping you.   So we know right now the adherence of taking your hypertension  medicine is one of the most powerful things we can do to actually crash  the price of healthcare, but you have got to take it. How many of us  forget?   Well, the fact of the matter is, for a few dollars, we could issue  that pill bottle with a cap that starts pinging your phone, pinging  your family, pinging whoever the hell you want to ping that you didn't  follow the rules.   We have actually brought the display here before. It looks like a  little dome. It actually distributes pharmaceuticals into a cup.   So, if you are my grandmother, rest her soul, and you have a couple  pills you take in the morning, one for digestion at lunch, and a couple  before you go to bed, it actually will distribute those at the proper  time, in the proper amounts, and then tell you, reminds you, reminds  the family if that little cup with the pharmaceuticals hasn't been  touched.   It turns out it is a technology solution, and it is a half-a- trillion-a-year issue. Yeah, it is a little hard to explain, but 16  percent of our healthcare cost is just not taking our pharmaceuticals  properly.   Is this Republican or Democrat? It is just what we are. And the fact  of the matter is a bunch of really creative entrepreneurs, these small,  disruptive tech companies, are coming up with a solution.   How do we make that part of what we are trying to move forward? How  do you make it reimbursable? How do you actually take Medicare part D  and say, instead of the rules right now where someone is supposed to be  trying to call, actually, widen up that definition so they could also  be providing the technology to make sure someone is taking those  pharmaceuticals in the proper fashion?   I am begging this place to open up our minds and think a bit more  creatively about what do we do to disrupt the price of healthcare,  because, remember, that 30-year debt curve, it is mostly healthcare.  And, guess what. Technology is about to help us disrupt it if we could  just make that technology legal, reimbursable, part of our plan. We can  do some amazing things.  [[Page H1153]]    And, actually, in this hyperpartisan environment, this technology  hasn't been made Republican or Democrat yet. I am sure we will find a  way. What will happen is one of the corporate executives will write  someone a check, and we will decide they are all left and right, and we  will beat the crap out of each other, but right now, this is an actual  solution.   There are other really amazing disruptions coming, and I think this  one may have been shown at the consumer electronics show. I am not even  sure I understand all the things it does, but this, in many ways, is a  doctor visit in your pocket. It does about a dozen different things  where it can actually do a number of different tests, and it is in your  medicine cabinet.    How do we encourage this type of technology? Because, day after day,  we will have individuals coming to us and saying: We have a crisis in  the United States. We don't have enough primary care physicians.   They are absolutely right.   So, how do we help those primary care professionals? By saying we can  have some technology where it is the type of thing where you can blow  into it, you can prick your finger, or it can do this, this, this,  this, and it is incredibly accurate. And it is available to you  instantly because it is in your own home medicine cabinet.   Let me give you one. What would happen if you could have a major,  highly accurate disease detention technology, and it doesn't have to be  in your medicine cabinet, but it could be at your local CVS Pharmacy?  It turns out this technology looks like it has been perfected.   Your lungs throw off--forgive me, I am going to try to get my  technology right. Your lungs actually become part of your body that  your blood circulates completely through, I think, every couple  minutes. Your breath actually has thrown off proteins and other things  that can be detected.   I showed this a couple months ago. Some researchers, I think, are  actually working on it, an extension of that flu kazoo that can pick up  20 different types of dead cancer proteins and let you know you have  them.   Well, it turns out this technology, actually, now exists today, and  the ability of it to actually look for dozens of different types of  ailments, a number of different types of cancers. What you do is you  just breathe into it for a couple minutes.   Why aren't we running as fast as we can to make this part of our  community?   We talk about access to care. The fact of the matter is that  supercomputer you hold in your pocket you call your phone, its  algorithm, tied in with these types of sensors, whether it be the  oxygen sensor I played with last year--I am a severe asthmatic, and we  just played with it, and it was helping me dial up and, for the most  part, dial down my inhaled steroids. Now, technically, it was illegal  because it is prescribing to me, and it hadn't been approved.   From that flu kazoo I just described to you that is unreimbursable  and, ultimately, illegal because the algorithm is writing a  prescription to something like this that can do a stunning number of  diagnostics if you are just willing to breathe into it for 10 minutes,  the miracle is here.   Is this Republican or Democrat? It is neither. It is the future. But,  in so many ways, Congress has become the barrier, stopping, holding  back the technology disruptions that actually could help us crash the  price. And, instead, we seem so much more comfortable having debates  about, ``Well, who should get subsidized?'' ``Who should we finance?''  ``Who should be regulated?'' ``Who should be controlled?'' instead of,  ``Let's set people free.''   We have technology that can help you manage yourself, know what is  going on, detect blood cancers through breathing. Why aren't we running  as fast as we can to get these things to market to disrupt the price of  healthcare?   And, look, it is not a complex premise. We can make the economy grow  like crazy. We have seen the expansive effects of the tax reform and  some of the regulatory reforms. We have to get the immigration system  correct, moving more to a talent-based system. We have to do the  incentives for labor force participation. There is a whole bunch of  things we need to do, and we just know the economics there.   The hardest part is, as a society, none of that is going to matter  unless we have a disruption in the price curve of healthcare delivery.  And I am going to argue there is a path, and it is here.   Can I give you sort of a thought experiment? Should Congress have  slowed down the internet a decade ago to protect Blockbuster Video?   Think about it. If Blockbuster Video had gone out and hired an army  of lobbyists walking around the hallways here, Congress is somewhat in  the protection bracket, should we have slowed down the internet to keep  that Netflix from putting them out of business?   Of course not. That is absurd, isn't it? Yet Congress does that with  all sorts of rules, whether it be reimbursement, the cynicism toward  algorithmic health and sensors and these things that can help our  medical community, because we will often get certain lobby groups and  others who will come in the door and say: This will be really  disruptive to our business model. Can you slow it down?   And every day we slow these things down, you are crushing my little  girl's future, but you are also crushing the rest of this country  because the debt curve is crashing down on us if you actually look at  the debt that is going to come out this year.   There was a 4-month report from Treasury yesterday that basically  said, hey, receipts--and I am blessed to be on the Ways and Means  Committee--receipts. We don't call them, actually, revenues, but  receipts and tax are really healthy.   Last year, we grew over 4 percent, but we spent over 8 percent, and  then we will beat up each other, saying: ``Well, you wanted to expand  this program,'' or, ``You wanted to expand that program.''   The fact of the matter is the expansion defense, the expansion of  other programs is a fraction of that growth. Almost all that growth in  spending is demographics. It is the reality. Those of us who are baby  boomers are moving into our earned benefits and we never set aside the  money for it, so, if you can keep the promises.   Are you willing to do the combination of things--and you have got to  do them all because, it turns out, if you do the labor participation  incentives to enter and stay and get involved in the labor force, to do  that well, you actually need to be doing things over here in technology  that make it available for those who may have certain barriers.    Over here, for certain people with barriers, you have to have  regulations that actually work rationally with our brothers and sisters  who may have those barriers. It all has to come together.   Can Congress do something that is complex, because it turns out there  is no simple solution. There is a complex one, and there is a path.   And the scary part--understand, when we do the math, and this is  something I have been doing for a couple years, we still think we hit  about 95 percent of debt to GDP. My goal is just to hold us there and  not blow through that. It is possible. Can Congress become creative?   So the next one I want to go through, and this is actually sort of  fun for me. This is actually one of my older displays. It is from a  year or so ago, because I have this fascination with something they  call carbon capture.   So a couple years ago, they finally built an electric facility  outside Texas, La Porte, Texas, wherever that is. I am sure it is a  lovely place. But imagine--and there are two of them. There is a  natural gas and a coal-fired power plant, and they don't have  smokestacks.   On the natural gas one, they came up with this crazy idea. I think it  is called the Allam cycle. You blow up the natural gas, and you  actually use the carbon, the burnt, and slam that through the turbines,  and then at the other side, you cool it and capture it.                                time  1315    You go, oh, God, we haven't been doing that?   We, last year, in the Ways and Means Committee, perfected, and now we  are going to try to do it more, something they call 45Q, which is the  incentive to capture and then, over here, to sequester that  CO2. Great.  [[Page H1154]]    You get some of those who are cynical saying, well, it can't work, or  it is going to be too expensive. We are going to have a little fun with  the ``too expensive.''   The best technology we had last year was a facility, I believe, that  is going up in Canada. The Gates Foundation and others are investing in  it. Their best number was about $100 a ton. It is $100 a ton for  substantially pure carbon.   Everybody who geeks out on carbon change and those things, you know  you can do lots of things with it. You can, through a chemical process,  turn it back into clean-burning fuel. You can do what they do in Texas  and other places, which is to pump it in the ground and use it for  enhanced oil recovery. But $100 a ton was sort of our best bet.   I beg of you, if you are someone who is interested in the technology  of carbon capture, I want you to go grab your phone and look up the  news stories from last October. I want you to put this into your search  engine: MIT ambient carbon capture.   Some researchers at MIT last year had just this wonderfully elegant  breakthrough. They have a really nice video, if you are not  particularly technical, sort of showing how they did nanotubes and  electric plates, where they can power them up, power them down, power  them up, power them down. They can do this in an ambient environment,  so on the roof of your home or on top of a smokestack.   In part of the articles, if I am reading it properly, it wasn't $100  or $150 a ton. It is down to $50 a ton. Their model says it is down to  $50 a ton. You do realize that is almost the market price today?   It turns out, if you are someone who cares about the issue of  CO2 in the environment, we have just had a major  breakthrough. And how much discussion does it get? This has been since  October. How much joy have you seen in newspapers and articles, talking  about a revolutionary breakthrough? And we can be doing mining, because  we have to deal with this reality.   The United States has gotten dramatically cleaner in the last 15  years. Good. But a whole bunch of the rest of the world hasn't. Unless  we are arrogant enough that we think we are going to turn around  carbon-use policies in a bunch of the rest of the world, we are out of  our minds.   It turns out we can grow our economy; we can continue to use  hydrocarbons; and we have a technology that not only would mine our own  CO2 but would help us on everything else that is being  generated in other places in the world.   I am going to digress for just a second. This isn't that same sort of  theme. I have come here behind the microphone before and talked about  plastic in the ocean.   Before I got this crazy job, I used to love to scuba dive, and we  talk all the time about plastic in the ocean. Here in Washington, D.C.,  we do lots of virtue signaling. We made paper straws. Of course, how  much U.S. and North American plastic actually ends up in the ocean?  Substantially none. Ninety percent of the plastic in the ocean comes  from 10 rivers, 8 in Asia, 2 in Africa.   If you cared about plastic in the ocean, you would go to the 10  rivers that are 90 percent of the plastic--8 in Asia, 2 in Africa--and  you would do something. You would create a value for the plastic.   As Republicans, we are trying to do that. But it blows up some of the  folklore around here of, well, if we do paper straws in Washington,  D.C., we make an effect. Come on.   Look, I understand we live in a world where everything is political,  and the virtue signaling makes us feel better. Wouldn't you really  prefer to do something that makes a difference?   Back to this concept, a major breakthrough in how you capture carbon,  you can do it right out of the air. Now, that is one of the amazing  things in this article. It works in ambient air. It doesn't have to be  on top of a smokestack.   A couple of days ago, there is an article--one of my personal  fascinations, as those of you who claim to pay attention to this know,  is the math on methane. As you all know, a couple of years ago, we had  to recalculate methane's half-life, so a lot of the old formulas were  all wrong. Now, we think methane is about 9 years. But the accepted  ratio right now is 1 ton of methane equals 84 tons of carbon.   Okay, so the picture alongside me, because it was the best picture I  had, is a flare in remote Texas. They are doing their best to burn off  that methane. Someone just came up with the idea: Why don't we just  back up a truck, chill it, super-chill it like we do with liquefied  gas? We get a valuable commodity, and we capture all of it. And  remember the ratio 84-to-1? Well, we incentivize this.   We are already doing the 45Q to create a tax incentive to capture  carbon and sequester it or use it in some other things. Wouldn't it  make sense to do that same sort of model with methane?   We came behind these mikes a year or 2 ago and showed just the math  possibility that a major pipeline to capture methane from oil country,  just that single pipeline functioning, it got you just to the Paris  accords, slightly below.   The blowback I got was crazy. ``Oh, I don't like pipelines.'' You are  saying: ``But did you see the math that just this one thing actually  had this huge''--``but I don't like pipelines.'' We need to stop  dealing in absurdity.   It turns out, we may be able to do it without the pipeline. Now it is  a truck, backing up, chilling it, capturing it. We need to understand  things like this. If a portable LNG truck capturing the methane is a  solution, is that Republican or Democrat?   Well, in this environment right now, maybe it is Republican, because  some of my brothers and sisters on the left hate these technologies.  Sorry, that is unfair. A number of them are skeptical of technologies  that allow us to keep using hydrocarbons.   My argument is, embrace, love the science, love the technology. It  will set you free. Because these things make a difference.   We live in the time of miracles, whether it be healthcare technology  or whether it be the single-shot cure for hemophilia. You all saw the  article a couple of days ago that we think we might also have a cure  for hemophilia, not only A, but B also.   The cures, whether it be for curing people in the chronic population,  technology for our environment, or technology to crash the price of  healthcare, they are here.   You know, one of the biggest barriers to the disruption that could  help us continue to grow the economy, could help us have enough  robustness in that economy so we can keep our promises and at the same  time get a cleaner environment and healthier economy is this body and  its inability to stop the arrogance and thinking that we are so smart,  that we think we know what tomorrow's technology is.   When I first got elected, we had a family joke. ``When are the two  times in life you think you know everything?'' ``When you are 13 years  old and the day after you get elected to Congress.'' And the family  would laugh and then make fun of me.   Now that I have been here a few years, I worry. We have lots of good  people, lots of really smart people. And all day long, we are pounded  by folks who are trying to protect their business models or their  bureaucracy models.   I am begging us, we need to understand the tsunami of debt that is on  the horizon, and it turns out, technology is about to provide us  solutions that don't bankrupt us and actually provide the solution and  don't put government in charge of every aspect of our lives.   This should be a story of incredible hope and excitement. But can we  break through the politics of arrogance that we have around here and  start being willing to push the envelope of the actual solutions?   Madam Speaker, thank you for tolerating me. I appreciate it. I yield  back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 1 o'clock and 24 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Friday, February 14, 2020, at 11 a.m.  [[Page H1155]]                                ____________________
