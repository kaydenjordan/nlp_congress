 Madam Speaker, I thank my dear friend from Maryland for  his leadership. I certainly support this bill to keep our employees  whole.   But I must say, when I hear the discussion and when I heard the words  of our friend and colleague from Montana, I thought: ``Are we rewriting  history?''   This isn't about who likes President Trump or who does not. Where is  the outrage in this body? When do we finally say, ``Enough''?   We had a bill, a bipartisan bill that passed the Senate. It was ready  to pass here. The White House had said they would sign it. And because  four or five rightwing talking heads scared the President of the United  States, he pulled the plug. Democrats didn't do that. Republicans  didn't do it. He did it.   Now you are defending him, enabling him, even when he says, ``I never  said Mexico would pay for the wall,'' even though we have 212 explicit  references in the last 3 years in which he said precisely that. And  meanwhile, because of that focus, which came out of right field,  800,000 Federal employees and all American citizens are held hostage.   When do we come together and say, ``Enough''? When do we stand up for  those Federal employees who are civil servants who serve our  constituents? And when do we say this shutdown threatens the security  of the United States?   It is wrong, and we have had enough. So it is good that we are going  to keep our Federal employees whole when the shutdown ends, but let's  come together and make sure this shutdown ends, even at the risk of  taking on the President of the United States politically. In the last  analysis, can we not come together and do the right thing for the  American people.
