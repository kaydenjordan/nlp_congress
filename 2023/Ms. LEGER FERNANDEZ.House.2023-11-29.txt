 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Reschenthaler), my colleague on the Committee on  Rules, for yielding, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, once again, House Republicans are spending a week on  legislation that fails to solve many of the very real issues facing our  constituents.   Last week, when I was in my district, my constituents shared with me  their aspirations, their worries, and their vision for how to make our  communities thrive for generations. Veterans from Hobbs described how  hard it is to travel for access to healthcare and other services-- services that they have earned.   Seniors from Hobbs described the concern about paying their bills on  a fixed income and the need to reduce costs. The Lovington mayor led us  on a tour of the wastewater plant as he described the need to invest in  water infrastructure in rural communities and thanked us for doing that  and promoting such investment.   In Taos, New Mexico, ranchers and farmers working with the New Mexico  Acequia Association, which for those of you who don't know, is a  centuries-old system of providing irrigation to farmers and ranchers in  New Mexico.   They talked to me about their concerns about growing their business  amid the climate crisis that we are seeing and the drought conditions.  These are real challenges that our constituents want us to fix,  challenges that Congress has the ability and responsibility to address.   Does this rule make in order any bills to help address veterans' need  to access healthcare?   Does it make in order any bills to help seniors pay their bills?   Does it help our rural communities access rural clean water systems?   Does it help our farmers keep their heritage and grow our foods?   Nope. It doesn't.   What are we doing this week?   We have a bill that prevents the use of Federal lands to provide  temporary shelters for certain noncitizens, including migrants who are  legally applying for asylum. It is a bill that fails to address the  humanitarian crisis or security needs at our border.   Our colleagues across the aisle have consistently repeated harmful  theories, like the invasion theory, where they seek to demonize the  communities I represent and from which I come. Their talking points  simply inflame the issue rather than looking to solve it.    This is just more of the same from a majority that is unable to  govern effectively. Instead, we should pass legislation that actually  improves our immigration system and acknowledges and upholds the  dignity of immigrant communities.   There are real solutions to deal with the border. The Republican  majority just doesn't want us to vote on them on this floor.   For example, the Dream and Promise Act has vast support from  Americans, but will we see Republicans put it on the floor?   Nope.   The Farmer Workforce Modernization Act that has bipartisan support  would help agricultural communities and help farmworkers, but will we  see Republicans put it on the floor?   Nope.   We could move these bills, if only Republicans would stop blocking  them. We will also consider today a resolution to reverse a Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau rule. That rule would require lenders to  collect and report information about the small business credit  applications they receive, including geographic and demographic data,  lending decisions, and the price of credit.   We know that many rural small businesses struggle with access to  financial resources. It is important to know whether or not the banks,  especially the big banks, are serving them.   Americans, the middle class, and small businesses want somebody on  their side because they know the big banks and corporations aren't.  That is why Americans across the political spectrum overwhelmingly  support the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.   Despite the strong public support, Republicans continue to attack the  Bureau. The Democrats are on the side of small businesses when we stand  up for the Bureau and its work.   We should support initiatives to bring capital to entrepreneurs and  innovators, especially in rural America. A lot of that work happens  because of credit unions, I might add. I support efforts to address the  credit unions' concerns about the smaller entities.   A CRA, though, as proposed by the Republicans, is an overly broad and  blunt tool that prevents an agency from promulgating any regulation in  an area that it addresses.   This CRA that they have put forward would tie the hands of the  Bureau. It would prevent them from rulemaking regarding data for small  businesses, women-and minority-owned businesses.   We need access to this data to make sure that small businesses,  women- and minority-owned businesses, rural businesses have access to  capital. Investing in these small businesses is how we grow the middle  class, and that is what Democrats are focused on. How do we grow the  middle class.   Lastly, H.R. 5961 would freeze certain Iranian funds involved in the  2023 hostage deal between the U.S. and Iran. We must acknowledge, and  do acknowledge, that Iran is dangerous and a state sponsor of  terrorism. We cannot allow the terror to continue.   I must remind my Republican colleagues that the Rules Committee  already reported a rule for this bill. Their own party blocked the  House from voting on this bill when they voted down the rule on the  floor.   This week we should be debating a bill with aid for our allies,  including Israel, Ukraine, Taiwan, and others around the world, but I  guess we are not.   I guess we should not be surprised with this rule. This is just a  continuation of the chaos and closed process that has been a hallmark  of this Republican-led House. We have seen over 40 closed rules on the  floor that have blocked two-thirds of bipartisan amendments, including  blocking half of all Republican amendments.   Republican leadership clearly hasn't made good on their promise to  make the legislative process more open, inclusive, and accommodating.   This year, Republicans will have wasted nearly a month on internal  politics just to elect a Speaker--time that could have been spent  lowering costs for seniors and helping those veterans I mentioned  earlier, time that could have been spent helping our farmers and  ranchers, time that could have been spent helping to grow our middle  class.   As Republicans continue to press forward legislation that seeks to  further destroy and divide, House Democrats are working to improve the  lives of everyday people.   House Democrats are committed to putting people over politics, to do  what is right for everyday Americans; lowering costs, growing the  middle class, and defending fundamental freedoms.   As we have all year, House Democrats continue to extend the hand of  partnership to get things done for the American people, including  passing legislation that invests in working families and keeping our  Nation safe.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this rule and a ``no'' vote on  the underlying bills.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   This entire Congress, Republicans have tended to use titles for their  bills that are extremely misleading. For example, today's rule includes  the so-called Protecting our Communities from Failure to Secure the  Border Act. Interestingly, though, this bill does not actually secure  the border. In fact, it does not include any resources for States to  deal with migrants who are awaiting processing. How is that protecting  our communities? Let's invest where we need to address this issue.   Instead of addressing real problems at the border, Republicans are  bringing up this unnecessary legislation to attack vulnerable migrants  under the guise of protecting public lands. Remember, this is a public  lands bill. It came out of the Natural Resources Committee. If they  really cared about protecting public lands, they wouldn't have passed  an Interior appropriations bill out of their committee that cuts nearly  a billion dollars from the Federal land management agencies that are  tasked with protecting these public lands.   The concern really isn't about protecting public lands, and it is not  really about addressing the real immigration concerns. If they were  really, truly interested in that, they would work with us to address  the root causes of migration.   The most effective way to control the number of asylum-seekers  arriving at our ports of entry is to help them stay in their home  countries. They talk about that in some of their bills, but look at  what they say and what they do.   Let's focus on what they actually do. They have put forward  appropriations bills that actually cut funding for customs and border  officers. They cut CBP funding. They cut money for fentanyl  interdiction. That is what they actually do.   They may have bills with fancy titles and all this talk, but what  happens when it comes to what they are funding? They are not funding  with the necessary resources to address these issues.   For example, the last time we were in the Rules Committee, they were  cutting funding for the FBI, DEA, and law enforcement agencies that we  need to work on these issues. They are not supporting the kind of  cutting-edge inspection machines that we need to detect fentanyl at our  southwestern border ports of entry, like in the President's national  security supplemental request.   I asked them if they were going to support the national security  supplemental request with those provisions in it, if they were going to  support the Democratic amendments in the border package earlier this  year that would have made that bill better.   It is not a great bill. They focus on that wall. They are fixated on  that wall. It is not what we need. We have seen report after report  that it does not work. They just keep using migrants to score political  points. This is the third bill we have seen this year, but none of them  are true solutions.   If they were serious about solving the issues at our border, they  would work with us on comprehensive legislation instead of these things  that do absolutely nothing to fix the problem.   The problem isn't in New York City. It is their failure to work with  us on legislation that would solve the issue.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include  in the Record a letter of support for proposed section 1071, CFPB rule,  which highlights the benefits of collecting lending demographic data  for small farmers and farmers of color.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   This letter tells us a lot about how Democrats see the issues in  rural America, how Democrats see the issues affecting our small  businesses, our women-owned businesses, and our minority-owned  businesses. It is one of wanting to make sure that the playing field is  level, that there is transparency and fairness at the same time that we  use the market to build up thriving communities.   This is a letter that comes from ranchers, farmers, cooperatives, our  rural areas. It is signed by dozens of organizations, and they read  that the section 1071 rule is profarmer. Young, beginning, and small  farmers have consistently demanded more transparent and fair markets.   Having accurate and public data will help farmers and consumers make  better-informed financial decisions.   For some reason, the Republicans don't want to make sure that we have  access to this data. What are they hiding? If big banks aren't serving  our rural farmers, let's find that out.   This isn't just about that. This is about promarket. They say section  1071 is promarket. The data required by section 1071 will help lenders  identify unmet credit needs and expand new markets.   This is important if we are going to grow the middle class. Once  again, I was a small business owner. I had a woman-owned business. I  went and sought credit. I filled out those forms. It wasn't that hard.  I wrote down that, yes, I am a woman-owned business, and, yes, I am a  minority-owned business. I am a Latina. I am proud of it. I am from a  State capital, by the way, the oldest State capital in the United  States, which is very pro-immigrant because we know of the economic  benefits it provides.   We know that having access to this information is good for our small  businesses. It is good for rural America. Therefore, we are very much  in support of this rule, despite the fact that, once again, Republicans  want to hammer and beat up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  despite the great work it does for our consumers, the great work it  does for our small businesses, the great work it does for Americans,  which is why they support it the way they do.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to provide for consideration of a measure that  clearly states that the people's House will keep its solemn promise to  American seniors and workers. We will protect and preserve Social  Security and Medicare and fight against any cuts to these crucial  programs that so many of our constituents depend on.   Reaffirming our promise is more important than ever. Republicans on  the Budget Committee today, as we speak, are holding a hearing about  fiscal commissions that could slash Social Security and Medicare. We  cannot allow that to happen.   The top candidates for President in the Republican Party are also  calling for cuts to Social Security. The House must stand against that.  Democrats in the House will stand against that.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment into the Record, along with any extraneous material,  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Lee) to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to  the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, actually the debate around Social Security, similar to  the debate about the Consumer Protection Bureau and its regulations,  does highlight the policies that the Democrats and Republicans pursue  and who are the beneficiaries of those policies.   Let's look at Social Security and what the Republican Budget  Committee is looking at. They are looking at raising the retirement  age. Who actually pays for that?   When you raise the retirement age, it is going to be the janitors,  nurses, educators, and the people doing the hard work in our  manufacturing plants that are going to be required to work longer. They  are going to be the ones who are going to have a hard time because they  don't have additional savings like the wealthy. Right?   The wealthy aren't going to care about whether you raise the age to  67, 68, or 72 because they have the assets and they are not relying on  Social Security. It is our workers who have paid into Social Security  who have earned it and deserve it. They deserve to receive the benefits  that we promised them when they started working and paying into the  system.   What can we do to make sure that Social Security is solvent in the  future?   Well, Democrats have a bill that we introduced last year, and we  supported it this year. You make sure everybody pays--no matter how  much money you make--into the system. Right now we know that the  wealthy stop paying into the system at about $147,000.   Why doesn't everybody pay Social Security taxes on all their  earnings?   Why aren't the wealthy paying their fair share?   That is a policy difference. It is the policy distinctions that we  are focused on.   Once again, Democrats are standing with working Americans who are not  earning $200,000, $300,000, $400,000, or $1 million a year. We say you  should pay your fair share of your Social Security taxes rather than  doing what they want to do, which is gut benefits. When you raise the  Social Security age, you are gutting the benefits.   That is an example of the distinction of when you are standing with  working Americans and when your policies that you support are  increasing the middle class instead of standing with the wealthy.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I think we need to remember why we faced inflation in  the first place. We need to remember that this country and the world  faced down a pandemic that threatened to destroy our economy.   Let's go back to those dark days when we moved from the Trump  Presidency to the Biden Presidency. Our businesses were closed. Our  Main Streets were going to fall apart. Our city, local, and State  governments were worried about whether they would be able to keep  people on the payroll.   The Democrats passed the American Rescue Plan, and we did rescue the  economy indeed. I go to my working-class district because my entire  district is like that. That is my family. I come from those roots. I  speak to those people on a regular basis.   Every town I go into, I look at the number of loans, the PPP, the  Restaurant Revitalization Fund, the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant,  and they are open now. Those communities are thriving because of the  work we did. That was not the reason we saw inflation.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record an  article from the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Economic Review.    Mr. Speaker, this is an article titled: ``How  Much Have Record Corporate Profits Contributed to Recent Inflation?''   Firms raised markups to 2021 in anticipation of future cost pressures  contributing to about 60 percent. Every American knows that record  profits added to inflation. They just keep on trying to blame it on the  fact that we kept our small businesses open. That is not the case. We  made sure that people did not get thrown out of their homes.   It is the big corporations that they protect with their policies, and  they want to make sure that they can cheat on their taxes. They bring  that up every little while. He brought up issues with regard to Israel.  Well, you know, they didn't allow a clean bill to come to the floor  because they wanted to make sure that tax cheats could continue  cheating on their taxes. They wanted to cut that funding.                                time  1315    We know that those kinds of things hurt America. We know that part of  the reason for inflation was because of Putin's war, Putin's invasion  of Ukraine, and what happened to the markets from that.   On that side of the aisle, we have the Putin protectors who are  fighting back and do not want to provide any resources to Ukraine.   So, the majority should not start talking to me about inflation when  the majority's policies are continuing to add to those problems.   You might know, Mr. Speaker, that neither this Congress nor this  Presidency controls interest rates. That is the Federal Reserve. We do  not control that. The President does not control that.   I would love to see interest rates come down because they do impact  jobs. The fact that we had the lowest job growth of the Biden  administration tells you--oh, my God, you had to compare it just to the  Biden administration because the job growth has been phenomenal under  this administration. It has been phenomenal based on the policies of  what we did in the last Congress. We have added so many jobs.   We are seeing that the Inflation Reduction Act is bringing down  inflation. Inflation is lower now than it was 1 year ago. Fact-check  that. Yes, indeed, we have brought down inflation.   We are creating good manufacturing jobs. In New Mexico, we are  creating manufacturing jobs. We are now manufacturing wind turbines. We  are manufacturing solar facilities. We are manufacturing more now in  New Mexico than we have done in the past.   Those are the kinds of things that are being created with the  policies that Democrats supported and were signed into law last  Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, let me respond to the comment about not talking about  interest rates. The gentleman talked about mortgage rates, and mortgage  rates are tied to the Federal Reserve. So, once again, understanding  how our economy works and which agency and entity has control over that  is very important.   I also want to talk about the idea of who is trusted. He mentioned  some polls with regard to who is trusted on the economy. The reality is  that we are right now in the people's House. We are the Representatives  who are closest to the people and who are out there meeting with them.  This is what the Founders intended. When the Founders created the House  of Representatives, they wanted to make sure that we were a miniature  of America and that we were in constant communication.   I know that that is what we do. I know that is what my colleagues do  and what I do. We go out and talk with them. We listen to their stories  and bring them back. We decide, based on what we hear, what we are  going to prioritize.   I like the fact that Democrats, that my party, those of us on this  side of the aisle, go out to listen and come back and push for policies  that are going to lower costs, like the Inflation Reduction Act did  where we lowered the cost of prescription drugs and where we made sure  that nobody is going to pay more than $35 a month for insulin. People  have been asking for that.   For the first time, we are going to negotiate with Big Pharma to  bring down those costs where there is going to be a $2,000 out-of- pocket limit for  [[Page H5955]]  prescription drugs. These are important ways in which we are lowering  costs.    We are lowering costs by making sure that we are providing homeowners  and renters with the ability to lower their energy costs, whether that  is putting in renewable energy facilities and solar panels or  insulating homes.   Those are the kinds of things that my colleagues across the aisle, my  good friends, might not understand, like how important it is to  insulate your house. I am from where it is cold, so getting those  insulation credits is important. It lowers costs.   Because of this work that we have done, I know that there is an  aggregated poll out that points to the fact that Democrat incumbents  are trusted in the House at a rate that is so further beyond our  Republicans. They are underwater by 14 points. Their own constituents  know that they are not fighting for their economic benefit.   Nevertheless, what we have seen this year is chaos and dysfunction  take over the House under Republican leadership. While Democrats have  been ready to put people over politics and deliver for America through  bipartisan legislation, our colleagues across the aisle continue to  introduce bills like we are considering today that focus more on  culture wars and nonsolutions.   Today, we have an immigration bill that does not address the root  causes of migration, offer solutions for our broken systems, or provide  any resources to help the U.S. citizenship or immigration system or  Customs and Border Patrol address an increase in migrants.   In this bill, they might talk about a lot of things, but that is not  what this bill does. This bill does not address any of those key  issues. Instead, it restricts the Departments of the Interior and  Agriculture's ability to manage their lands. These agencies are in  charge of managing our public lands, and we need to let them do their  job.   We have a bill that fails to help our small businesses even when we  know that SBA low-interest loans have helped thousands of entrepreneurs  grow their businesses and the economy. Instead, they would seek to make  those Federal loans less transparent and would cripple the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau's ability to address disparities in  lending.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
