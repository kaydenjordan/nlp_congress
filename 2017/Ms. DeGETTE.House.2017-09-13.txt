 Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment. The gentleman from Alabama talks about the First Amendment  rights of employers, but, clearly, this statute by the D.C. Government  complies with all of the constitutional rights.   What I am concerned about here is discrimination against employees  for making their own reproductive health decisions. Apparently, that  doesn't matter to the people on the other side of the aisle: the right  of people to take birth control, to have in vitro fertilization, or  even to have an abortion.   The D.C. Council decided that was an important right, and that is why  they passed this legislation. This is why we should preserve it today.  There is absolutely no reason why we should take the rights of self- governance away from D.C., and there is absolutely no reason why we  should take the rights of women and families to exercise their legal,  constitutional healthcare decisions.   Mr. Chair, I strongly oppose this amendment, and urge a ``no'' vote.
