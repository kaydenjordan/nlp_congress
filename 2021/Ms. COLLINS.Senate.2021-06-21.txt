 Mr. President, first, let me thank my colleague from New  Hampshire, Senator Shaheen, for her extraordinary commitment and  leadership as my fellow cochair of the Senate Diabetes Caucus. We are  introducing a bill to improve access to innovative diabetes  technologies for our seniors and other Medicare beneficiaries. Our bill  would create a special task force at the Department of Health and Human  Services to examine and resolve barriers that seniors face in accessing  the latest diabetes management technologies.   New diabetes technologies, such as the artificial pancreas and  implantable continuous glucose monitoring systems, allow those who are  living with diabetes to better manage their glycemic levels, assess  needed therapy on a timely basis, and adhere better to treatment  regimes. These technological advances make diabetes easier to manage  and therefore improve the health of people with diabetes.   The market arrival of cutting-edge diabetes technologies is something  we all celebrate; however, oftentimes we are finding that patients do  not realize the full benefits because many of our Nation's seniors find  the new technologies to be difficult or impossible for them to afford.   I have heard from numerous seniors who, when transitioning from  employer-provided insurance to Medicare, were shocked to learn that the  technologies they had relied upon for years to manage their diabetes  are no longer covered because they now have lost their employer- provided insurance, which did cover these technologies, and instead are  being covered by Medicare. For example, one Mainer unfortunately had to  face the reality that Medicare's coverage denial of a particular sensor  that he needed for his insulin pump meant paying up to $8,000 out-of- pocket each year if he wants to continue with his current treatment. He  wrote:         Because I am now 65, I am denied care that was available       when I was 64.    He continued:         This approach not only puts me at risk but is quite likely       not cost effective. While the sensors are expensive, the cost       of ambulance calls and hospitalizations . . . is certainly       more.    I could not say it better. It makes no sense for this individual, who  has aged into the Medicare system, to lose coverage that he had and  relied upon and used successfully to control his diabetes.   To better support the adoption of these technologies, our bill would  require HHS to create a special task force on coverage and payment for  innovative diabetes technologies that would bring all stakeholders-- from patients to device manufacturers, to government officials and  healthcare professionals who are making coverage decisions--to the  table. The task force would identify and plan for changes in Medicare  coverage and payment policies to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries  have access to the latest treatments, to the innovations that are  currently available, as well as those that are in the pipeline. The  task force would also be tasked with developing strategies for  supporting adoption of these technologies.   This effort builds on our past advocacy to improve the day-to-day  life of individuals with diabetes. In January 2017, in response to the  bipartisan effort that Senator Shaheen and I have led, CMS first  approved the use of continuous glucose monitors. We also successfully  urged CMS last year to support the use of smartphone apps in  conjunction with continuous glucose monitors. These are proven  lifesaving devices that are relied upon by people with diabetes to  provide them with realtime measurements of their glucose levels. This  information is key to preventing costly--sometimes deadly--diabetes  complications.   While I am pleased that our advocacy has helped spur these policy  changes, I remain frustrated that too often Medicare lags behind  commercial insurers. Greater adoption of these new diabetes techniques  can help address the explosive growth in the financial and human toll  of diabetes. Diabetes accounts for an extraordinary one-in-three  dollars in Medicare spending. It is paramount that we encourage HHS to  adopt a more cost-effective and compassionate approach to treating this  chronic disease that affects more than 30 million Americans.   The Improving Medicare Beneficiary Access to Innovative Diabetes  Technologies Act encourages a proactive approach to diabetes coverage  and payment. I encourage my colleagues to support our efforts.   Again, thanks to my partner Senator Shaheen for her leadership in  this area.                            ____________________
