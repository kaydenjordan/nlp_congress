 Madam Speaker, I rise today to praise a sensational  basketball team from my district. Saint Peter's University is a small,  exceptional school in Jersey City, New Jersey.   This year, Coach Shaheen Holloway's Peacocks became the first 15th  seed to reach the Elite Eight of the men's NCAA basketball tournament.   In the first round, the Peacocks shocked the world when they upset  Kentucky, the number 2 seed and college basketball powerhouse. They did  it again when they beat Murray State and Purdue to get to the Elite  Eight.   I was honored to watch the comeback victory over Purdue in the Sweet  Sixteen. I did it as a Congressman and proud parent of two Saint  Peter's graduates, my sons, Donald III and Jack.   Saint Peter's University will be remembered as one of the most  successful teams in the NCAA tournament history, and I am extremely  proud to have it in my district.                            ____________________
