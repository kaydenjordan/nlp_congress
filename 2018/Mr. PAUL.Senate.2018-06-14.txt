 Mr. President, the Senate adopted amendment No. 2276 to  H.R. 5515 by voice vote, though I opposed this amendment and would have  voted against it. This amendment would further study the feasibility of  establishing a permanent U.S. troop presence in Poland. We should be  looking at where we can reduce our footprint abroad, not where we can  expand it. As our government continues to pile up debt, we should be  asking our NATO allies to step up and prioritize their own defense. The  more that we assume the security burden, as this amendment would do,  the less incentive these countries will have to contribute their share  toward our mutual defense.   (At the request of Mr. Durbin, the following statement was ordered to  be printed in the Record,)                            ____________________
