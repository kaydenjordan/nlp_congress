 Madam Speaker, in a SCIF in the basement of this very  building is a secret process, a process that is designed to keep the  truth from the American people. Now, it is not  [[Page H8374]]  based on firsthand comments. It is based on secondhand gossip.   And I can tell you, what I have heard for over 60 hours needs to be  heard by the American people, because ultimately this President did  nothing wrong. And we need to make sure that we send a clear message to  the rest of America that we are a transparent body, not one that is  held with secrets.   And yet here we are with Adam Schiff providing leading questions,  trying to actually get to a foregone conclusion in his mind. It is time  that we hold him accountable and the rest of this body. Open it up.  Let's be transparent. Let's send a message to the Senate, who  ultimately is going to have to be the judge and jury of this. It is  time that we put the facts on the table. The facts will exonerate our  President.                            ____________________
