 Mr. Speaker, this amendment forbids the President  from taking action that he can't take anyway. With or without this  amendment, the President cannot attack Iran, or any country, without  Congressional authorization unless it attacks us. And even then, his  powers are limited to ordering defensive actions unless Congress acts.   The attack on Soleimani in Iraq was against an enemy combatant in a  war zone that was authorized by Congress. It was not an attack on Iran.   The only practical effect of this amendment is to send a message of  irresolution to our enemies, and to take a cheap shot at the President  by implying he would do something he cannot do.   Now, the Lee amendment, coming next, repeals the AUMF that Congress  adopted when it foolishly authorized the Iraq war in 2002.   Under our Constitution, only Congress can start a war. But after  that, only the President can wage it or conduct the negotiations to end  it. You cannot unring a bell, and you cannot unstart a war. Once  unleashed, the war-making authority continues until it is terminated by  treaty or agreement.   So here are the lessons of this whole sorry saga in Iraq. Congress  should declare war only when our country is attacked. When we declare  war, we must put the full resources, resolve, attention, fury, and  might of this Nation behind it, and see it through as quickly and  decisively as possible.   And most of all, having handed the President that power, and having  sent our troops into battle, Congress must stand behind its decision,  no matter how long or hard that road may be.
