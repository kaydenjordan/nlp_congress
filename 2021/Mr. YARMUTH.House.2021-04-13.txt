Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend remarks and  insert extraneous material into the Record on H.R. 1868.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, today, the House meets on the heels of huge milestones  for our country: more than 180 million vaccine shots in Americans' arms  and more than 150 million rescue checks in Americans' bank accounts.   As the resources included in the American Rescue Plan continue to  strengthen our Nation's fight against COVID-19 and deliver critical  relief to American families, today's legislation will ensure our  healthcare providers--who have been on the front lines of this  pandemic--are supported during this difficult time.   Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress came together to provide  financial support to healthcare providers by temporarily pausing the  sequestration of the Medicare program created by the Budget Control Act  of 2011. This pause, originally enacted in the CARES Act and then  further extended in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, was  slated to expire on March 31, 2021. Today's legislation will extend the  suspension through the end of this year.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased that this bill received bipartisan  support in the Senate, and it is my hope that it will receive broad  bipartisan support in this Chamber as well.   However, I would be remiss if I did not state my disappointment that  the needed legislative fix to exclude the American Rescue Plan from the  statutory paygo scorecard was dropped from this measure.   Many of my House Republican colleagues supported this bill in its  original form, which would essentially put the American Rescue Plan on  equal footing with our other COVID relief packages and ensure it is  treated the same as the previous reconciliation bill passed by  Congress.   So while today's action is an important step, our work is not done.  Next, we must enact an additional legislative fix to prevent a separate  paygo sequester and avert painful and indiscriminate cuts to Medicare,  farm supports, social services, resources for students and individuals  with disabilities, and other programs Americans rely on.   I am committed to passing this bill today, and enacting a second  sequester fix before the end of this session of Congress. I invite all  my colleagues to join me in these important efforts.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a distinguished member of the Budget  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an  additional 30 seconds.    Madam Speaker, as the gentleman from Missouri mentioned  early on, this bill passed the Senate by a 90-2 margin, and I  anticipate it will pass the House by a significant margin as well.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  to support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
