 Madam Speaker, in 1960 my mother's life changed  dramatically forever. That was the year her father was murdered through  an act of gun violence. She was just 10 years old and my grandmother  became a widow with six children left to raise on her own.   This week marks National Gun Violence Survivors Week, where we listen  to stories like my mom's and other survivors of gun violence through  the country.   But here in Congress, we need to do more than just listen to these  stores. We need to act. Last year, the House passed commonsense,  bipartisan gun safety legislation, H.R. 8, to expand background checks.  This measure is something over 90 percent of the American public wants.   Unfortunately, it has been sitting in the Senate for almost a year  and that is unacceptable. Survivors of gun violence, victims of gun  violence, and the American people deserve a Congress who will act and  pass these gun safety bills. Enough is enough.                            ____________________
