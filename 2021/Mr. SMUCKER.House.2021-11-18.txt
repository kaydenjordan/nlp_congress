 Mr. Speaker, I hope the American people are watching  closely today because there is a fundamental question being debated,  and that is: What should the role of the Federal Government be in each  of our daily lives, and what economic system best provides for the  opportunity and well-being of the American people? That is the question  today.   Democrats believe--they said this in our hearings--that the Federal  Government should provide everything to ensure all needs are met for  middle-income Americans.   We believe in earned success. We believe in rewarding hard work. That  system, the free market system, has provided more opportunity than ever  before in the history of mankind.   Mr. Speaker, freedoms aren't taken all at once. They are taken bit by  bit by bit. This is a move toward an entirely different economic  system. It is a move toward socialism.   We know that doesn't work. Look at every country in history that has  overdelivered and overspent. It has not ended well.
