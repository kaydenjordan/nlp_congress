 Mr. President, I rise in support of the Portman  amendment. We can all agree that tax reform should help create more  good jobs and protect the good jobs we already have. I support the  Portman amendment, and I look forward to colleagues supporting my  amendment that ensures that companies that ship American jobs to  foreign countries are not eligible for tax breaks. I want to work with  my colleagues to make sure any tax reform package is good for American  workers.   Thank you, Mr. President.    Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment  I offered to address the outsourcing of American jobs. Currently,  American companies that ship jobs to foreign countries can still claim  massive tax breaks. That is wrong, and we should claw back incentives  and prohibit companies from receiving tax breaks for outsourcing jobs.   My end outsourcing amendment is common sense for taxpayers,  supporting companies that invest in American workers, not those  shipping jobs to foreign countries. I urge all of my colleagues to  support this amendment.   Mr. President, I yield back.
