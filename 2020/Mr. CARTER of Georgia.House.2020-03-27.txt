 Mr. Speaker, our country finds itself in  uncharted waters. None of us have ever experienced anything like this  before.   For the past 2 weeks, I have been at home in the First District of  Georgia visiting with individuals and with small business owners. I  have seen something I have never seen before. I have seen people who  are concerned, concerned about their health, concerned about their  future. Mr. Speaker, this is something we have to address.   I have also seen something I have never seen before either, and that  is people pulling together, people doing for each other, people caring  for each other, volunteering at food banks and volunteering at service  organizations. I have seen healthcare workers putting their own health  at risk to deliver services. I have seen the best of America as well.   Mr. Speaker, it is our opportunity here, our responsibility to help  these people, to deliver to them.   No, this is not a perfect bill. If I had the opportunity, I would  change a number of things in it, but it is what we need to do, Mr.  Speaker.   Mr. Speaker, more than anything, what we need to do is we need to  pray. We need to pray to the God of Abraham and the God of David.
