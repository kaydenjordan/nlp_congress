 BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I, like millions  of Americans, have been watching over the last 10 or 11 days, and  especially this past weekend, shaking my head and wondering just what  is happening in our country?   This is not who we are. I can't tell you the number of people that I  spoke to this weekend from all walks of life, all backgrounds, who have  said this phrase: ``I can't believe I am really seeing this in  America.''   Mr. Speaker, I can understand why, in light of Brussels, Paris, San  Bernardino, I can understand why many of my fellow Americans are  scared. I share their concern. But let's be clear: this illegal, un- American executive order signed on Friday does absolutely nothing to  protect us. It makes us less safe. It was a wonderful gift to ISIS, and  it must be repealed.                            ____________________     BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, you probably won't  be surprised to learn that I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R.  724, which would rescind President Trump's appalling refugee ban on  individuals like the young scientist in Iran who was awarded a  fellowship to study cardiovascular medicine at Harvard, but whose visa  has now been indefinitely suspended.
