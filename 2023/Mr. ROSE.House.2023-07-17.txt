 Madam Speaker, this week, House Republicans are committed  to fulfilling our Commitment to America to end President Biden's border  crisis and restore a nation that is safe.   Last month, the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives passed a  resolution condemning the use of public schools to house illegal  immigrants.  [[Page H3616]]  Now, this week, we plan to pass H.R. 3941, the Schools Not Shelters  Act, which prohibits the use of public elementary and secondary schools  and institutions of higher education to provide shelter for illegal  immigrants.   As many children across our country continue to recover from the  pandemic-era learning loss, schools should be focused on helping  students recover.   By housing illegal immigrants on school campuses, children are being  put at risk. Elected officials who endorse these plans are sending a  clear message to children and their parents that illegal immigrants and  President Biden's failure to secure the southern border matter more  than their children's education.   Now, make no mistake, President Biden's dangerous open-border  policies are at fault for this dire situation. In the first 100 days,  the President took more than 94 executive actions on immigration that  immediately signaled to the world that our borders were open for  illegal immigration and that they could count on President Biden to  hold the door open for them, even if it meant sacrificing the safety  and security of our country.   Since taking office, there have been over 5.5 million illegal  crossings of our southern border. In addition to that, approximately  1.5 million immigrants have evaded apprehension by our hardworking  Customs and Border Patrol agents.   This humanitarian crisis has gotten so bad that New York City's  Immigration and Customs Enforcement office is fully booked through  October 2032.   Had President Biden not halted construction of the southern border  wall, ended President Trump's successful remain in Mexico policy, and  concluded use of title 42, I am sure this historic crisis would not be  this disastrous. Just like we have seen with Bidenomics,  ``Bidengration'' has completely failed the American people.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, each time I meet with officials from the  Nashville International Airport, which I have the honor of representing  in Congress, topics consistently include workforce shortages and  recruitment issues.   That is why I rise today in support of H.R. 3935, the Securing Growth  and Robust Leadership in American Aviation Act. This legislation will  streamline Federal Aviation Administration operations, help grow the  aviation workforce, invest in airport infrastructure, and improve the  flying experience for millions of Americans. It will improve the  passenger experience by making key improvements to the air traffic  control system.   The aviation industry supports 11 million jobs. This bill aims to  ensure it continues to grow and flourish for years to come. It supports  programs that will attract more pilots, mechanics, and assembly  workers. It also helps ensure those folks are supported and that FAA  rules and regulations aren't getting in the way of innovation,  competition, or employee retention.                            ____________________
