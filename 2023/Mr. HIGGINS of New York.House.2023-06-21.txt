 Mr. Speaker, lung cancer is the deadliest  form of cancer in the United States, taking more lives than prostate,  colorectal, and breast cancers combined.   The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends annual  lung screenings for adults ages 50 to 80 who are at risk, but currently  just 6 percent of eligible Americans are screened each year.   That is why we are introducing the Increasing Access to Lung Cancer  Screening Act. This bipartisan bill will reduce barriers to preventive  care by requiring public and private insurance to cover annual  screenings for those who are eligible.   Early detection is our best protection against all cancer deaths, and  this legislation extends coverage for those who are at greatest risk.   I ask my colleagues to join me, along with Representatives Castor and  Fitzpatrick, in supporting this lifesaving legislation. Together we can  take another step toward ending cancer as we know it.                            ____________________
