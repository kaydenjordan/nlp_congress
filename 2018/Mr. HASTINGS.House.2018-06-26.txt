 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman, my friend from Wyoming, for  yielding me the customary 30 minutes for debate, and I will proceed to  debate the rule for H.R. 2083 and H.R. 6157.   The first measure, H.R. 2083, in my opinion, is an overly broad bill  that will lead to the needless slaughter of more than 1,000 sea lions  without addressing the serious problems facing our country's endangered  salmon stocks.   Thirteen populations of salmon and steelhead in the Columbia River  are listed under the Endangered Species Act, with their greatest threat  to extinction coming from deadbeat dams, habitat loss, and climate  change. This bill does nothing to address those issues and will not  lead to the recovery of the salmon populations.   Mr. Speaker, in a change of pace for this Republican-controlled  Congress, H.R. 6157, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for  Fiscal Year 2019, is a largely bipartisan bill. Totaling $674.6  billion, $20 billion above the fiscal year 2018 enacted level, H.R.  6157, as my colleague said, increases military pay by 2.6 percent and  funds military procurement, readiness, and research and development.   The legislation, in a break from the strategy implemented by the  Republican Trump administration, actually works to keep our commitments  to our allies and provides resources for the  [[Page H5670]]  European Reassurance Initiative to counter Russian aggression,  continues our support for Ukraine, and fulfills our obligations to  Israel with funding for the U.S.-Israel joint anti-tunneling research  technology initiative and the Israeli Missile Defense Cooperative  program.   H.R. 6157 also provides new funding for Department of Defense schools  and Historically Black Colleges, Universities, and Minority-Serving  Institutions, partnerships that are critical for preserving readiness  into the future by investing in our servicemembers today.   I was also pleased that the committee included parts of the Families  of Fallen Servicemembers First Act in this bill, which will ensure that  families of fallen servicemembers can always access the immediate death  gratuities they are entitled to, even in the event of a lapse of  government funding.   Politics should never be a factor during such an unimaginable time,  and yet that has been the case in each of the last three government  shutdowns. I commend my colleagues, Representatives Gerry Connolly and  Tom Rooney, for taking on this critically important issue.   As you can see, Mr. Speaker, this bill does a lot of good. I wish  that bipartisan legislation like this was the norm. I congratulate the  committee for working together in a bipartisan fashion to ensure that  our country's security needs are met without needlessly injecting  partisan fights into the process.   I would, however, be remiss if I did not mention the omission of any  language pertaining to the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military  Force, known colloquially as the 2001 AUMF.   We continue to give Presidents a blank check to wage war. Let me  repeat that: We continue to give Presidents--not President Trump, not  President Obama, not President Bush, not President Clinton--a blank  check to wage war. Since the 2001 AUMF was enacted, it has been cited  as the statutory authority for military actions more than 40 times in  at least 18 countries. That is 18 countries, Mr. Speaker, using an  authorization passed 17 years ago.   I and other Members, like Congresswoman Barbara Lee and Congressman  Jim McGovern, the ranking member of the Rules Committee, have been  relentless on this issue, relentless on the need for this body to take  its constitutional duties seriously and discuss how and if we will  authorize the executive branch to wage war.    In fact, last year, the Appropriations Committee adopted an amendment  by Congresswoman Lee to begin the process of repealing and replacing  the AUMF with an updated measure. In an underhanded move, the Rules  Committee stripped the provisions in an undemocratic and underhanded  way. Since then, Congress has done nothing to reassert its  constitutional authority to decide when and where to commit our troops  overseas.   I don't know why it is that this continues, and I don't know what it  is going to take for us to have a vote on a new AUMF, but I think that  the people of this great country deserve to know why House Republicans  are protecting the President's ability to wage unchecked war around the  globe. I felt the same way when President Obama was in office, as well  as previous Presidents.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to bring up Ranking Member Nadler's bill, H.R.  6135, the Keep Families Together Act, of which I am an original  cosponsor. This much-needed proposal would prohibit the Department of  Homeland Security from separating children from their families, except  in extraordinary circumstances, and limit the criminal prosecution of  asylum seekers.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and  defeat the previous question so that we may protect these innocent  children.   Mr. Speaker, I would advise my colleague that I have no further  speakers and am prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  go forward now with my closing.   Last week, we saw Republicans fail to protect Dreamers. These are  young people who, in many cases, have known no other country than the  United States. It is, like it is for you and for me, quite simply,  their home. They are, but for one piece of paper, just as American as  anyone in this room. Yet my friends across the aisle take pains to  denigrate and belittle Dreamers.                                time  1245    We witnessed Republican leadership bring anti-immigrant legislation  to the House floor that did nothing to solve the heartbreaking  situation for children and their parents on the southern border. In  fact, the bills pushed by my Republican friends would perpetuate child  detention, further tarnishing our Nation's values.   Democrats have put forward multiple bipartisan proposals to address  the need for immigration reform in our  [[Page H5671]]  country and, now, for the need to address the completely self-made  Republican crisis at our border involving the separation of infants and  toddlers from their mothers and fathers. All of them have been  dismissed out of hand.   If my Republican colleagues can move past throwing red meat to their  base and are willing to work in a serious and bipartisan manner to  address the issues in our immigration system, then know that Democrats  are ready to work with you. All you need to do is stand up to the  extreme faction in your party and finally work with us.   Let me say something else, finally, about that. The current occupant  of the White House continues to say that Democrats believe in open  borders and crime. I know I don't believe in open borders, and I know  that I have spent a career in the field of law in trying to assist, not  only my community, but here in our Congress, countless communities, to  avoid criminal elements and crime in a variety of places throughout our  country.   I don't think it is right just to make political points at the  expense of something that is so critical, and I deem it wrong that it  is said that Democrats favor open borders and crime. That is just the  farthest thing from the truth.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
