 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2,  the Secure the Border Act, which is the most comprehensive border bill  to reach the House floor in modern history.   The Biden administration's border policies have led to a national  security and humanitarian crisis at our southern border, turning every  community into a border community.   This administration's failure to secure the border has led to a  record amount of illegal drugs, both around the border and in our  communities, and has enabled human trafficking and the exploitation of  children.   Recently, law enforcement in my community announced that they have  seized enough fentanyl to kill every Floridian.   In addition to the drugs flowing into our communities, we have seen a  tragic flow of unaccompanied minors across our border, which has led  many of them to fall victim to human trafficking, abuse, and  mistreatment.   A grand jury in Florida recently uncovered alarming details about  Federal agencies losing track of more than 20,000 children, and failing  to perform background checks on minors' sponsors, again, leading to  incidents of trafficking, exploitation, and abuse. An open border is  not humanitarian. When we fail to control our borders, the drug cartels  will.   House Republicans know that border security is national security, and  that is why we must pass the Secure the Border Act. This legislation  will increase the number of Border Patrol agents, strengthen current  law to protect unaccompanied children, and bolster our border's  infrastructure.   We have a constitutional duty to secure our border and to ensure our  communities back home are kept safe. I urge my colleagues to vote  ``yes'' on this bill.
