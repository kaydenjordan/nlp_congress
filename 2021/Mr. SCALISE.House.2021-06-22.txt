 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committees on Energy and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be  discharged from further consideration of H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer  Funding for Abortion Act to codify the Hyde amendment language, and I  ask for its immediate consideration in the House.
