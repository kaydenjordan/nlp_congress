 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 23 because our  government needs the resources to go after wealthy tax cheats who  defraud the government.   Because people don't pay their taxes, the Federal Government is  cheated out of at least $400 billion each year. In fact, President  Trump's IRS Commissioner said that number could be as high as $1  trillion every year.   That significant source of revenue could go to paying our bills,  paying down our debt, and propping up the power of our purse. That is  exactly why we passed legislation last year that made significant  investments to crack down on tax cheats.   That funding will not be used for families or small businesses making  less than $400,000. Instead, it will be used to go after those who have  the wealth to pay their taxes but don't or those who can pay for armies  of accountants to get out of paying for what they should.   H.R. 23 rescinds that funding for that type of needed enforcement,  and that is why I oppose it. Our government should have the resources  necessary to ensure that it is not just the middle class that pays our  bills and pays our debt, but the wealthy tax dodgers pay their taxes,  just like play-by-the-rules, hardworking Americans.
