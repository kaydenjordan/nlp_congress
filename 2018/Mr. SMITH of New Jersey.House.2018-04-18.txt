 Mr. Speaker, next week, on April 24, we will  mark the 103rd anniversary of the infamous Armenian genocide. The date  of the commemoration marks the anniversary of Red Sunday, the night  when the Ottoman Empire Government gave the order to arrest and intern  approximately 250 Armenian intellectuals in Istanbul.   Less than 2 months after Red Sunday, the end of May 1915, the  government enacted legislation that unleashed unspeakable widespread  government-organized evictions, massacres, and deportations. As many as  1.5 million people perished. It was about the annihilation of the  Armenian people.   In September of 2000, I held the first-ever hearing on the Armenian  genocide here in Congress. Three years ago this month, I chaired  another hearing on the 100th anniversary.   At the time, I noted that the Armenian genocide is the only one of  the genocides of the 20th century in which the nation that was  decimated by genocide has been subjected to ongoing outrage of a  massive campaign of genocidal denial, openly sustained by state  authority--that would be the Turkish Government. That has to change,  and this horrible, horrible genocide needs to be recognized by our  government for what it was.                            ____________________
