 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  president of Young Harris College, Dr. Drew Van Horn.   In 2017, Dr. Van Horn was selected as the 23rd president of Young  Harris College and has been a tremendous addition to the school with  his wealth of knowledge and expertise.   Dr. Van Horn has brought more than 30 years of experience in higher  education to Young Harris College, including nine years as president of  Brevard College in North Carolina.   As a graduate of Young Harris College, and a friend of Dr. Van Horn,  I appreciate his dedication and his work on behalf of Young Harris  College. I know the entire Mountain Lion community joins me in thanking  Dr. Van Horn for his service to our beloved college.   Dr. Van Horn, we love you and appreciate you.                         Congratulating Fort Stewart     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Fort  Stewart as the winner of the Army Environmental Award for Natural  Resources Conservation for a large installation.   Located southwest of Savannah, Georgia, Fort Stewart is the largest  Army post east of the Mississippi River. Fort Stewart is home to the  3rd Infantry Division and seven species protected by the Endangered  Species Act on 284,000 acres of pine forest, wetlands, and blackwater  rivers.   The Fort's land is managed by a team tasked with balancing military  readiness and environmental stewardship. This dedicated team ensures  that conditions are set for soldiers to train and prepare for  deployment, while also managing environmental assets that include  wildlife management and cultural resource management.   The Army Environmental Award for Natural Resources Conservation  reflects the hard work of Fort Stewart's leadership, staff, and  personnel in defending not only the people of the United States, but  its environment as well.   I am proud to rise today to recognize this tremendous achievement and  commend the hard work of Fort Stewart soldiers.         Freddie's Garage and Towing Celebrates 75 Years in Business     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  75th anniversary of Freddie's Garage and Towing in Tybee Island,  Georgia.   In August of 1946, Freddie's opened on Tybee Island, Georgia.  Although Freddie's transitioned from a gas station to a garage over the  years, Freddie's continues to operate in their original location.   Residents of the Tybee Island community have trusted Freddie's  through multiple generations. For 75 years, customers are relieved to  know that Freddie's dependable service will always be there to keep  their car running.   Freddie's Garage and Towing is a perfect example of a hardworking  American business. As a small business owner for more than 30 years, I  commend the hard work and dedication that Freddie's Garage and Towing  has shown to their customers.   The team at Freddie's Garage and Towing works hard to maintain the  trust of the Tybee Island community, and I congratulate them for 75  years of success.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor Wayne Seay of Pooler, Georgia, who peacefully passed away on June  21 at the age of 81.   A lifelong resident of Pooler, Wayne attended Chatham Junior High,  graduated from Savannah High School and Georgia Southern College. He  was then drafted into the United States Army where he proudly served in  the 1st Infantry Division.   After completing his military service, he joined the faculty of  Robert W. Groves High School where he taught history and social studies  for 28 years.   Wayne was a devoted Pooler resident and was elected to the city  council where he served as mayor pro tempore. I had the honor and  privilege of serving on the Pooler City Council with Wayne Seay. He was  an outstanding member.   I also had the honor and privilege of being a former student of Mr.  Seay. I know everyone will remember his kind and gentle spirit. I am  thankful for the immense impact Wayne Seay had on the Pooler community  and on myself, and I know his legacy will remain.   My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends, and all who  knew him during this most difficult time.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the most important issue facing  our country today: the reopening of the U.S. economy.   For 16 long months, the U.S. economy has been held hostage by  government, both elected and unelected. What started as a 15-day  shutdown to allow hospitals to brace for the coming wave of COVID cases  has ballooned into over a year of shifting goalposts, evolving science,  and political power grabs.   Since the pandemic began, over 200,000 small businesses, which the  President once claimed were the backbone of the U.S. economy, have been  shuttered for good. This has left their owners jobless and futures  uncertain.   Those whose businesses did survive the long lockdowns still face  harsh restrictions. For too long and in too many cases, we have seen  restrictions on controlling how many customers they can serve, how  their employees can conduct business, and, by default, how much revenue  they can bring in.   Worse, the reopening of our economy has been prolonged even further  by the misguided attempts from the political left to provide relief.   The example I hear the most from constituents and businesses back in  George's First Congressional District is the increased unemployment  benefits. Under these expanded benefits, many Americans have been able  to receive more money not working than they did actually working. This  is a poor incentive to get people back into jobs, especially as our  economy continues to see record-high job openings.   Businesses coming out of their long hibernation will continue to  struggle to find employees as long as this benefit is in place.   There are not enough taxpayer dollars in the world to give these  businesses the relief they need, but we can remove the Federal  Government as an obstacle to returning to normalcy.   We need policies that incentivize Americans to find jobs and allow  businesses to stand on their own. Ultimately, we need to put an end to  all COVID business restrictions nationwide.   It is hard to say what the long-term impact of prolonged shutdowns  will be, but it does not take a Harvard economist to know that losing  200,000 jobs in small businesses alone does not spell good fortune.   The sooner we get Americans back to work and our economy back to full  capacity, the sooner we can return to normal or, at the very least,  stop the damage from continuing.   To borrow a quote from President Trump, we built the greatest economy  in the world, and we will do it a second time.
