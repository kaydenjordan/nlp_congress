 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4350, the  FY22 NDAA.   Our current and future warfighting capabilities are contingent on  modernizing the Department of Defense and recruiting and equipping the  military with the most effective, secure, and cutting-edge  technologies.   Our adversaries are focused on our defeat on and off the battlefield.  They are pouring money into research and development of emerging  technologies, recruiting top scientists, and stealing intellectual  property to gain a tactical edge.   This NDAA pushes the Department to accelerate innovation and  strengthen its cyber posture, a critical capability if we want to  maintain superiority in the era of great power competition.   I want to thank Ranking Member Rogers, who, because of his  leadership, fought for and gained nearly $25 billion in this bill to  boost emerging technologies and cybersecurity programs during the  markup.  [[Page H4804]]    These funds enhance areas like hypersonics, AI, and quantum computing  and make a historical investment to renovate the Department's labs and  testing facilities.   As ranking member, I am also proud of the work that we have done on  our subcommittee, the Cyber, Innovative Technologies, and Information  Systems Subcommittee led by Chairman Langevin, in this inaugural NDAA  for this subcommittee.   We included provisions to transition innovative technologies quickly  into the hands of the warfighter, to help companies bridge the valley  of death, and to implement many of the recommendations of the National  Security Commission on AI.   In the past year, we have seen landmark cyberattacks, a trend which  is likely to continue, and we must be prepared. We bolster and  strengthen the Department's information security systems and improve  sharing and analysis of cyber threat information across the Department.    Madam Speaker, I strongly support this bill and encourage my  colleagues to do the same.
