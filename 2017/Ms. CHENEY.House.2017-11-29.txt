[[Page H9479]]                                ____________________     Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 631 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 631         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 3017) to       amend the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,       and Liability Act of 1980 to reauthorize and improve the       brownfields program, and for other purposes. All points of       order against consideration of the bill are waived. An       amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the       text of Rules Committee Print 115-40 shall be considered as       adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read.       All points of order against provisions in the bill, as       amended, are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce; and (2) one       motion to recommit with or without instructions.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 3905) to       require congressional approval of any mineral withdrawal or       monument designation involving the National Forest System       lands in the State of Minnesota, to provide for the renewal       of certain mineral leases in such lands, and for other       purposes. All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. An amendment in the nature of a substitute       consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115-41 shall       be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous question shall       be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Natural Resources; (2) the further       amendment printed in the report of the Committee on Rules       accompanying this resolution, if offered by the Member       designated in the report, which shall be in order without       intervention of any point of order, shall be considered as       read, shall be separately debatable for the time specified in       the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent       and an opponent, and shall not be subject to a demand for a       division of the question; and (3) one motion to recommit with       or without instructions.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                time  1245                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 631,  which provides a closed rule for consideration of H.R. 3017,  Brownfields Enhancement, Economic Redevelopment, and Reauthorization  Act of 2017; and a structured rule for H.R. 3905, Minnesota's Economic  Rights in the Superior National Forest Act.   Mr. Speaker, brownfield refers normally to abandoned or closed  commercial or industrial properties that may be contaminated because of  their prior use. These sites often represent a tremendous amount of  untapped economic potential. However, developing that potential is  complicated by the presence of hazardous substances or contaminants.   The Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that there are more  than 50,000 brownfields in the United States. The brownfields program  has enjoyed broad bipartisan support and has been critical in  converting these vacant sites into tax-generating properties and,  eventually, well-paying jobs for American citizens.   As of May 1, 2017, the program has assessed 26,722 sites, and they  have leveraged over 124,760 jobs. On average, Mr. Speaker, over $16 is  leveraged for every EPA brownfields dollar spent, and 8.5 jobs are  leveraged per $100,000 of EPA brownfields funds.   States all over the country have benefited from this grant program.  In my home State of Wyoming, we put brownfield grants to use in cities  like Casper, Cheyenne, Sheridan, Evanston, Kemmerer, Laramie, and  Dubois.   Brownfield sites have been revitalized using these funds in places  like the Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas; development in the  neighborhoods around Danville, Illinois; and the Grijalva Park at  Santiago Creek in Orange, California.   The brownfields program has been expired, Mr. Speaker, since 2006,  and it is high time we reauthorize this critically important grant  program.   The brownfields program has enabled local communities to clean up and  repurpose vacated sites, utilizing them for meaningful economic  development, while responsibly cleaning up hazardous sites. This is an  important step in maintaining and improving what has been a  demonstrably effective program.   Mr. Speaker, the rule we consider today also provides for  consideration of a very important bill, H.R. 3905, Minnesota's Economic  Rights in the Superior National Forest Act, which was introduced by my  colleague, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer).   H.R. 3905 requires congressional approval of any mineral withdrawal  or monument designation involving the National Forest System lands in  the State of Minnesota and provides for the renewal of certain mineral  leases in those lands.   This is necessary, Mr. Speaker, because in the final hours of the  Obama administration, the administration withdrew hundreds of thousands  of acres in Minnesota from mineral development and improperly  terminated two Federal mineral leases.   The effect of this decision halted potential mining projects in  Minnesota, robbing the region of 650 direct and 1,300 indirect jobs, as  well as the tax revenue the mining operation would bring.   Mining jobs, Mr. Speaker, are good, high-paying jobs. The average  mining wage in Minnesota is roughly $25,000 a year higher than the  average wage in the State.   Coming from a State where we mine more coal than any State in the  Nation, I understand and appreciate the economic development mining  projects can bring to a region. We also understand the burden that can  be imposed by working with the Federal Government on these projects in  Wyoming.   Roughly half my State, Mr. Speaker, is comprised of Federal lands.  Receiving the appropriate authorizations to drill or mine on these  lands can be a lengthy and cumbersome process that delays projects for  many years.   Ultimately, Mr. Speaker, we must improve our Federal regulatory  process so we can better harness the vast natural resources we have in  our country, while still protecting and conserving our environment.   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I encourage support for the rule for these  important bills, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I think it is important to be clear about exactly what  H.R. 3905 does.   H.R. 3905 does not eliminate environmental requirements. In fact, it  will only allow mining as long as those strict environmental  requirements are met. What it does do is allow Minnesota itself to  advance its State and local economies.   I applaud my colleague from Massachusetts' commitment and dedication  to working together to try and come up with solutions about things  like, for example, funding the government. I will just point out that  if Democrats were, in fact, so dedicated to working with Republicans to  fund the government and to begin to come to a solution, to come to an  agreement, perhaps  [[Page H9481]]  their leadership would have shown up yesterday at the White House to  have meetings and discussions about funding the government. It is  awfully hard to claim that you are very dedicated and committed to that  concept if you don't have leaders who show up to the key meetings.   I would also point out, Mr. Speaker, my colleague has called our  bills and our process here ridiculous and extreme.                                time  1300    I can't help but note that what is truly ridiculous and extreme, Mr.  Speaker, are the massive increases in ObamaCare premiums that my  constituents all across Wyoming are now facing.   My constituents are now facing a situation, because of ObamaCare,  because of this health plan that was supposed to provide coverage for  everybody, low-cost coverage for everybody, that was supposed to  guarantee access, guarantee if you liked your doctor, you could keep  him or her, guarantee that you would be able to afford healthcare, my  constituents are now facing premiums that will bankrupt them.   They are now receiving bills that demonstrate that their premiums  next year, for example, for a retired married couple of two, the lowest  amount that they can pay under the ObamaCare Bronze Plan is $2,700 a  month. Now, that is absolutely unsustainable, and that is what is  ridiculous and extreme.   What we are doing today is making sure that we pass legislation that  reauthorizes the important brownfields program that restores rights to  the State of Minnesota.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from West Virginia  (Mr. McKinley), the sponsor of H.R. 3017.    Mr. Speaker, I would just note, in response to my friend  and colleague from Massachusetts, that if the gentleman's leaders are  so fragile that they are scared off by a tweet, then probably they need  some new leaders. And I don't suspect that his argument really is they  couldn't go to the meeting because they were scared because of a tweet.    We do need to work together to get things done. We are hard at work  doing that.   In that regard, Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Shimkus), the chairman of the Environment Subcommittee,  who oversaw this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Illinois.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H9483]]    Mr. Speaker, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have a very  tough job. They have to argue for policies that have failed and argue  for policies that we have actually had to live through the failure of  those policies over the last 8 years.   My colleague on the Rules Committee, the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. McGovern), asked us to imagine if Hillary Clinton were President,  and imagine if Barack Obama were President. Mr. Speaker, we don't have  to imagine. We lived through Barack Obama's Presidency. We know that we  would be, today, living through completely stagnant growth, a strangled  military unable to meet its commitments around the world, out-of- control Federal agencies, a Federal Government that believed it had an  obligation to run every aspect of people's lives across this country,  and, at the same time, the Federal Government telling people that they  were forced to purchase insurance they didn't want and they didn't  need.   We know that has failed. We know that the whole system that the  Democrats believed would work, in terms of bringing healthcare costs  down, fundamentally failed. You cannot force people into the insurance  pools. The concept was, if you forced the young, healthy people in, you  would drop costs down for everybody. That is not what happened.   I have sympathy for them because it is a tough job that they are  undertaking, but it is very important that we argue based on the facts  on this floor, Mr. Speaker. In fact, the tax bill that I hope will come  back from the Senate--the tax bill that we passed out of the House, and  one that we will take to conference--reduces taxes for the middle  class, reduces taxes for families all across this country, doubles the  standard deduction, and takes steps towards making real what we know to  be true, which is taxpayer dollars don't belong to the government, Mr.  Speaker, taxpayer dollars belong to the American people.   If we allow people to keep more of their own money, they will invest  that money, they will grow our economy, and they will create jobs. That  is how we are going to get this economy growing and continue the  expansion and economic growth that we have seen just since this  President came into office.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.  Lewis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Emmer), the sponsor of H.R. 3905.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gosar).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would just, once again, point out that we have  important work that we are trying to get done here, we have important  work we have got to do on behalf of the American people.   Mr. Speaker, elections have consequences, and we have an obligation  to do what our constituents sent us here to do, and that includes a  whole range of things that we have been very effective at doing,  historically effective in this body since January in terms of  deregulation, in terms of passing the repeal of ObamaCare, in terms of  moving forward on tax cuts in terms of actually passing the legislation  to cut taxes, and importantly also, Mr. Speaker, moving forward to  provide the resources that our military needs.   We all watched just over the course of the last 24 hours as the North  Koreans launched yet again another ICBM. We live in a dangerous world.  It is increasingly dangerous, historically dangerous.   Those are the issues that we are focused on as Republicans and as  Members of this House. Those are the issues that we need to focus our  attention on.   Again, I think we have grown to expect, no matter what the rule is,  no matter what the underlying bill is, we are going to hear the same  thing from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, not  addressing the substance of these issues, not addressing the substance  of the things the American people sent us here to do. I am very proud  to stand here today doing exactly that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr.  Westerman).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to thank my colleagues, Mr. McKinley and Mr. Emmer, for their  work on these important bills. I want to thank my colleague, Mr.  McGovern. I am glad to hear him say that they want to put people first.   Mr. Speaker, that is exactly what we are doing; whether we are  talking about our tax bill, which is going to put money back in  people's pockets; whether we are talking about repealing and replacing  ObamaCare, which we have passed through this House; whether we are  talking about defense spending that is going to protect the people of  this Nation.   All across Wyoming, Mr. Speaker, I know my constituents are very  grateful that we are now suddenly putting people first after years of  putting the government first. We are not doing that anymore, Mr.  Speaker.   It is true, this is the people's House. And in this House, Mr.  Speaker, we ought to always live by and remember the rules of Alexander  Hamilton: ``Here, sir, the people govern.''   In this House, Mr. Speaker, we are charged with carrying out the  obligations of the people who elected us. The bills and the rule that  we are debating today do just that. Both of these bills are absolutely  critical for spurring economic development across our country.   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of both the rule and of these  underlying bills.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 631 Offered by Mr. McGovern         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       305) to amend the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to require       the disclosure of certain tax returns by Presidents and       certain candidates for the office of the President, and for       other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be       dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the       bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided among and       controlled by the respective chairs and ranking minority       members of the Committees on Ways and Means and Oversight and       Government Reform. After general debate the bill shall be       considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At       the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the       Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with       such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and       amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit with or without       instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports       that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the       next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the       third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,       resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 305.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative  [[Page H9490]]       Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th       edition, page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the       previous question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is       generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority       Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
