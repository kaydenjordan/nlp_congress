 Madam Speaker, I rise today to commend President Trump  on the early success in getting Mexico to increase its commitment to  helping secure our common border.   There has been no shortage of doubters, perhaps even some who wished  the President would fail because he has taken an approach that hasn't  been tried before. But I thank the President for his vision and for his  commitment to securing our southern border, which has long been at  crisis levels.   We are not done, by any means--we must now ensure that Mexico honors  their commitments--but this is significant progress that we haven't  seen yet to this point.   If Mexico is true to their word, that means House Democrats are now  the only ones preventing the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement from becoming  a reality. This agreement would be extraordinarily beneficial for the  American economy, and it is time to ratify it here in this House.   I thank President Trump for applying pressure on Mexico and forcing  them to step up their efforts to secure our border and trade.                            ____________________
