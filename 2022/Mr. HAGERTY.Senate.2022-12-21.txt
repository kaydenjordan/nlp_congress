 Mr. President, last month, a Federal judge in       Washington, DC, ruled that the Department of Homeland Security could       not continue to use title 42 pandemic-related authority to expedite the       removal of aliens who enter our country illegally. That is effective as       of December 21. That is today. Although it has been temporarily halted       while the Supreme Court hears an emergency appeal, title 42 is hanging       by a thread. It is unconscionable for Congress to stand aside and do       nothing to preserve it.        Title 42 authority was initially based on the pandemic, and while I       agree that the pandemic is over, the border crisis is worse than ever.       Whether to keep effective border security policies in place should not       depend on whether there is a pandemic.        There is another epidemic plaguing our Nation, one that demands       immediate attention. Deadly fentanyl--produced with the help of the       Chinese Communist Party and smuggled across our southern border by       deadly drug cartels--has flooded our communities across America.        More than 100,000 Americans died of drug overdoses in the last 12       months alone, most of them from synthetic opioids like fentanyl. It is       the No. 1 cause of death for American adults aged 18 to 45.        The rise in fentanyl overdoses and deaths affects every State and       congressional district. It kills the young and the old, the rich and       the poor, people in cities and people in small towns alike. It is not a       partisan issue, and finding a solution should not be partisan either.        When I talk to Tennessee sheriffs, they tell me that fentanyl is       becoming more and more lethal, how a so-called bad batch can kill       dozens of people in an instant.        Once this deadly substance arrives in American communities, it is too       late. We have to stop it before it crosses our borders. That is why I       have introduced legislation that allows for the use of title 42       authority to stop the smuggling of illicit and lethal drugs like       fentanyl.        When I travelled to the border in April, Border Patrol agents told me       that cartels use waves of illegal border crossings as a cover to       transport fentanyl and other deadly narcotics. While Border Patrol       agents are focused on managing caravans and border crossers, the gap in       coverage is exploited by the smugglers. In many cases, these are well-      planned and coordinated occurrences. The agents told me that the people       don't stay at the border, and the drugs don't either.        Title 42 is the last tool Border Patrol has left to partially slow       the ongoing tidal wave of illegal crossings. Without this tool, our       Border Patrol agents will have no way to slow down the massive increase       in illegal immigration, which will get far worse as a result. Americans       will pay the price. That is why, given the potential expiration of       title 42 within hours or days, passing my legislation today is       imperative. Letting title 42 end without creating a permanent new       authority to replace it empowers drug cartels. It enables them to send       migrants across the border at strategic points, bogging down Border       Patrol agents with processing--processing that takes five times longer       without title 42. Cartels will then use the longer and more frequent       enforcement gaps to move more fentanyl across our border. We cannot       allow this to happen.        My legislation simply adds drug smuggling as an additional basis for       using title 42 authority. It is called the Stop Fentanyl Border       Crossings Act. It would allow the Secretary of Health and Human       Services to use title 42 to combat substantial dangerous drug       trafficking across the border. It would give Border Patrol a necessary       tool to stop drug traffickers.        Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Health,       Education, Labor, and Pensions be discharged from further consideration       of S. 3959, and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; I       further ask that the bill be considered read a third time and passed,       and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the       table.         Mr. President.         Mr. President, we are experiencing a tidal wave at our       southern border of illegal immigration, and that tidal wave is going to       turn into a tsunami the minute title 42 is dropped. Title 42 may be       removed at any minute, at any hour. It is on a temporary hold after       today.        More than 100,000 Americans are dying every year because of poison       from fentanyl coming across the southern border. I find it especially       disheartening that my colleagues are not willing to allow discretionary       authority to limit border crossings when necessary to combat       substantial and dangerous illicit drug smuggling. Even the Biden       administration is already preparing for a tidal wave across this       border. Yet my Democrat colleagues can't even agree on a commonsense       policy to address this glaring problem. My legislation will work       immediately to address this problem.        Border Patrol agents are now predicting daily crossings will roughly       double to 15,000 to 18,000 per day as soon as title 42 is lifted. This       is going to be truly overwhelming at our border, and the results are       predictable. More young Americans will die, and I just don't know how       bad this crisis has to get before Democrats will join me to acknowledge       it and work to stop it.        I yield the floor.
