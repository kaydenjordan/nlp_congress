 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Goodlatte, Ranking Member  Conyers, and my current new ranking member, Mr. Cicilline, for their  work on this important legislation. I further thank my colleague across  the aisle, Congressman Schneider from Illinois, for helping us manage  this.   This is a bipartisan bill that is better for having gone through the  regular legislative order. It was a pleasure to work with such  knowledgeable and professional colleagues.   In the wake of the financial crisis of 2008, Congress enacted the  Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. That  legislation was intended to address, among other things, the potential  failure of large financial institutions.   While the Dodd-Frank Act created a regulatory process for such an  event, the act states that the preferred method of resolution for a  financial institution is through the bankruptcy process.   However, the Dodd-Frank Act did not make any amendments to the  Bankruptcy Code to account for the unique characteristics of a  financial institution. The legislation before us today fills that void.   The Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act is the product of years of  study by industry, legal, and financial regulatory experts. It is also  the result of bipartisan review over the course of four separate  hearings before the Judiciary Committee.   The legislation includes several provisions that improve the ability  of a financial institution to be resolved through the bankruptcy  process. It allows for a speedy transfer of a financial firm's assets  to a newly formed company. That company would continue the firm's  operations for the benefit of its customers, employees, and creditors,  and ensure the financial stability of the marketplace.   This quick transfer is overseen by and subject to the approval of an  experienced bankruptcy judge, and includes due process protections for  parties in interest.                                time  1330    The bill also creates an explicit role in the bankruptcy process for  the key financial regulators. In addition, there are provisions that  facilitate the transfer of derivative and similarly structured  contracts to the newly formed company. This will improve the ability of  the company to continue the financial institution's operations.   Finally, the legislation recognizes the factually and legally  complicated questions presented by the resolution of a financial  institution. To that end, the bill provides that specialized bankruptcy  and appellate judges will be designated in advance to preside over  these cases.   The bankruptcy process has long been favored as the primary mechanism  for dealing with distressed and failing companies. This is due to its  impartial nature, adherence to established precedent, judicial  oversight, and grounding in the principles of due process and the rule  of law. We are here today as part of an effort to structure a  bankruptcy process that is better equipped to deal with the specific  issues raised by failing financial firms.   I want to stress again the bipartisan support that went through this  process--at the subcommittee level and at the full Committee on the  Judiciary level chaired by Chairman Goodlatte, my colleague on the  other side of the aisle who is helping us manage this and the  individuals in this House who realized what had to be done to protect  the law abiding citizens of this country from a financial disaster.   As a sponsor of the bill, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of  this important legislation.
