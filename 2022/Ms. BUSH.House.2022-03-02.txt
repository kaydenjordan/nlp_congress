 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Takano for his leadership on this  historic legislation.   Mr. Speaker, St. Louis and I rise today in support of H.R. 3967, the  Honoring our PACT Act, to expand healthcare, research, and resources  for our veterans who are far too often exposed to toxic substances,  both around the world and at home in St. Louis. This means so much to  me as a nurse, I see it all the time.   I am proud to put forward four critical amendments to this  legislation to help expand racial equity and study the military's  environmental impact through rigorous Department of Veterans Affairs  initiatives. My first two amendments ensure that VA research studies  include a broader array of demographic information, including race,  ethnicity, and disability status in gathering information on the  impacts of toxic exposure.   Our third vital amendment ensures the VA will extend reviews of known  cases of toxic exposure to military sites abroad. The Department of  Defense needs to provide concrete data about the waste and pollution we  are leaving in the nearly 750 military bases in over 80 countries  around the world.   Finally, our last amendment adds a new study to this bill to measure  the harmful health consequences of Manhattan Project waste on our  veterans and their families in St. Louis.   If you are from North St. Louis there is a good chance that at some  point in your life you have been exposed to toxic military waste like I  have. From West Lake Landfill to Coldwater Creek, toxic military  nuclear waste has been dumped in our communities, leading to rare  cancers and birth defects.   Our veterans worked with this waste and are still living with it. The  study is just one step we are taking to care for their health and  safety. I look forward to voting in support of the Honoring our PACT  Act and advancing these critical amendments that will help us to save  lives.
