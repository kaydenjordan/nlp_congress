 Madam Speaker, the U.S. Capitol has not been breached for  over 200 years, since the War of 1812--that is, until last week, when  it wasn't another country that attacked us but our own President.   President Donald Trump asked his supporters to march on the Capitol,  inciting domestic terrorism that cost five lives, including a Capitol  Police officer.   We all know, whether you say it aloud or not, Donald Trump is  responsible for inciting the attacks on our democracy, while he should  have been the one person protecting it the most. For that, he is unfit  to be President, and we must impeach him.
