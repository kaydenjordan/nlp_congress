Cori Lowe, age 31, stabbing victim.   Richard Black, age 39, gun violence.   Joseph Ramirez, age 43, gun violence.   Wray Harding, age 55, gun violence.   Aliyah Waiters, gun violence.   Marilyn Cotto Montanez, age 18, gun violence.   Guy Vanlew, Jr., age 18, gun violence.   Jeremy Logan, age 32, gun violence.   Omari Ellis, age 18, gun violence.   Warren Clahar, age 35, gun violence.   Olivia Green, age 15, fentanyl overdose.   Madam Speaker, I ask that we observe a moment of silence for the  lives lost in my district due to senseless violence.   Thank you, Madam Speaker.   Madam Speaker, the pandemic of senseless violence is not new. If you  live in a poverty-stricken community and if you are Black or Latino in  these communities, you are more susceptible to acts of senseless  violence.   When I was in high school, trying to just be a good student and play  on the football team, I ended up caught up in a situation where I was  almost shot and killed. A few months later, at a party with some  friends, just trying to go out and have a good time, I ended up in a  situation where I was almost shot and killed.   If it weren't for sheer luck, I would not be standing here as a  Member of Congress today.   Thankfully, at that time, I was able to move out of my community and  move to a suburban community where it was much less likely for me to  end up in a situation where I could be shot and killed.   I have so many friends and family members who did not have the luxury  of moving out and the privilege of moving out of their community. As a  result, they ended up dead at some very young ages, some 18, some 21,  some even younger.   Oftentimes, when we have these conversations, we point to the  perpetrators of these acts of violence and of these crimes and we  identify them as bad individuals and we say that we need law  enforcement to respond to remove those bad individuals from these  situations, and we think that that method is enough to end the violence  in these communities.   But we have invested in law enforcement for decades; the 1994 crime  bill being one example of how we have made such investments and  targeted highly violent communities. But the violence hasn't gone away,  and the violence has only been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic  that has isolated many and has also created a mental health crisis.   So I ask and I beg this Chamber to recognize that this is not just  about individual bad actors in communities. Poverty is a policy choice,  and the trauma related to poverty and the lack of opportunity in so  many of our communities will continue to lead to increases in violence  that we see in poverty-stricken communities.                                time  1030    We have to invest in education, healthcare, jobs, housing,  mentorship, and so many other programs that could literally save the  lives of our children before they ever decide to pick up a gun.   Lastly, and very quickly, we passed H.R. 8, commonsense gun reform  legislation, in the House this year, and the Senate still has not acted  on that legislation. Seventy percent of the incidents of gun violence  that take place in New York are done with guns that come from outside  of New York. So we have to move this gun legislation in the Senate.                            ____________________
