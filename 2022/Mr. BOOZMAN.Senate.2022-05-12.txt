 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the American  Ambulance Association's ``Stars of Life'' recipients from Arkansas. I  am proud to recognize these noble Americans who are always there to  help those in need.   The emergency medical technicians, paramedics, dispatchers, and other  ambulance service providers deserve applause and appreciation for their  commitment and selflessness. The ``Stars of Life'' program celebrates  the dedication, service, and heroism of ambulance professionals who  have gone beyond the call of duty on behalf of their communities and  the emergency medical services profession. This initiative honors them  and their significant contributions, while also raising awareness of  the vital role EMS personnel play in our society and healthcare  infrastructure.   I am especially proud of the six ``Stars of Life'' from Arkansas:  Devin Holland, Kenneth Jenkins, Randy Murry, Amanda Nesbitt, Alvin  Short, and Benny Ford.   Each of these individuals has devoted themselves to serving others by  providing vital 9-1-1 emergency care in their communities. These  dedicated public servants have used their skills and training for the  good of others, both on duty and off duty. They exemplify the mission  of their profession and consistently promote public health and safety.   Our State's recipients, like those throughout the country, were  nominated for this honor by their peers and administrators because of  their selflessness, commitment to the job, positive influence, and  ``service before self'' philosophy. Their work ethic and service are  described as contagious and commendable. Thousands of lives have been  touched and even saved by these Stars of Life. Their work continues to  better communities nationwide and impact emergency medical services  positively.   I am so grateful for these Arkansans, whose dedication to their  communities is admirable as they make an unquestionable difference in  the lives of those around them. They are an amazing example of heroism  and service in action, and Natural State residents are blessed to have  their help in a time of need.                            ____________________
