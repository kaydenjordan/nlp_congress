 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order       for the quorum call be rescinded.         Madam President, child sexual exploitation is one of the       most heinous and persistent crimes our country and, indeed, the world       face today.        Just yesterday, the FBI issued a national public safety alert in       response to the explosion in financial sextortion cases in which       children and teens are coerced into sending explicit images online and       then extorted for money. In the last year, more than 3,000 minors have       become victims of this crime.        I am proud of everything Congress has done and continues to do to       combat sexual exploitation--particularly of minors--in all forms,       especially human trafficking.        Just last night, the Senate unanimously passed the Abolish Human       Trafficking Reauthorization Act, which I introduced with Senator       Klobuchar. I hope we can pass another bipartisan bill today to increase       the punishment for those who exploit and recruit America's children       into the sex trade.        A 2018 survey reported that 55 percent of young sex trafficking       survivors in Texas were trafficked while at school or on school       activities. Sixty percent of trafficked adults were first groomed or       solicited for trafficking on school campuses.        Senator Klobuchar introduced the NTZ Act to increase the punishment       for human trafficking in school zones or at school-sponsored events.        Two of my fellow Texans have introduced a companion bill in the       House, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee and Congressman   Michael       McCaul. I appreciate their leadership on this legislation. It is by       conversations with Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee which have brought       us to this point.        Having passed the House, this is our last chance, I believe, for both       the Senate and the House to have cleared the bill and send it on to the       President for his signature.        The NTZ Act passed the House unanimously in September, and I hope it       can finally pass the Senate today and head to the President for his       signature.        Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on the       Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 7566, and       that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; further, that       its bill be considered read a third time and passed, and the motion to       reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.         Madam President, reserving the right to object, the       Senator from Illinois asked why can't we change this bill. Well, first       of all, this bill passed unanimously in the House. If we don't pass       this bill today, it is dead, and the Senator's objection to this       unanimous consent request will have effectively killed this legislation       for this Congress, as he knows, because we start a new Congress and we       will have to start all over from scratch.        I don't know when we decided to start outsourcing our authority as       the Congress of the United States to the Department of Justice.        The fact of the matter is, the changes that the Senator is suggesting       would basically be just to instruct the U.S. Sentencing Commission to       amend their Federal sentencing guidelines to incorporate specific       offense characteristics for any offense under this legislation. So,       basically, he has got another way to build a mousetrap that doesn't       really change anything except the fact that he will effectively have       killed this legislation this Congress, and we will have to start all       over again.        The reason why I am here today and why Congresswoman Sheila Jackson       Lee is here on the floor is because this is a problem at schools in her       legislative district, where human traffickers come and they try to       recruit teenage kids--girls, mainly--high school and younger, into the       sex trade. And we think it is appropriate that enhanced penalties       attach to these criminals who commit these terrible crimes against       children in our schools.        And, unfortunately, by deferring to the Department of Justice's       criticism--they are a part of the executive branch. We are a coequal       branch of government. It is our job to say what the law is, and it is       their job to enforce it.        So I am sorry that the Senator from Illinois believes that the       Department of Justice's ideas should prevail over those of the       collective wisdom of both branches of the Congress. Like I said, this       bill passed unanimously in the House of Representatives; but, because       of his objection, it will effectively be dead for this legislative       session. And I think it is a missed opportunity and a crying shame.        I object to his request to modify my request for unanimous consent.
