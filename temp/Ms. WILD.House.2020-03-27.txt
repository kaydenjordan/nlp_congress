 Mr. Speaker, as the representative of Pennsylvania's  Seventh district, just 1\1/2\ hours from New York City, I have a unique  perspective on this crisis.   The two world-class hospital networks in my community, the Lehigh  Valley Health Network and St. Luke's University Health Network, are  also the biggest employers in my district. They anxiously await the  spread of this disease to our front lines.   Across my community, our nurses, lab techs, PAs, physicians,  custodial, and cafeteria staff have worked tirelessly to care for every  patient. Despite their concern for their own well-being and despite  often lacking adequate gear to protect themselves, they put the most  vulnerable ahead of themselves. They are the pride of my community. The  actions of healthcare workers around the country say to us: We are all  in this together.   Our response cannot be: Fend for yourself. Now we have to do our part  and provide them with enough personal protective equipment and enough  ventilators for their patients.
