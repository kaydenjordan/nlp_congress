 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to  remember the life of Stacee Etcheber. She attended the Route 91  festival in Las Vegas on October 1.      The online version has been corrected to read: HONORING THE LIFE  OF STACEE ETCHEBER (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)
