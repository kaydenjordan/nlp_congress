 Mr. Speaker, next week we can make bold investments in our  Nation, helping families, workers, and communities across the country,  by passing the bipartisan infrastructure bill.   Everyone, no matter where you live, deserves access to modern,  dependable infrastructure and transportation, water, and so many other  efforts that improve our quality of life.   We are living off the investments our parents and grandparents made a  generation ago. As an example, in my district, in California's San  Joaquin Valley, residents in the rural community of Dos Palos were  living with an aging water infrastructure system. Last summer, in the  midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, problems with this decades-old water  treatment plant left them without clean drinking water for 3 days.  Residents and businesses suffered. That is simply unacceptable wherever  you live in America.   I was able to work with Assemblymember Adam Gray, and we were able to  help secure State and Federal funding to construct a new treatment  plant, but this piecemeal way of fixing our infrastructure is not the  way to go.   We must pass transformative pieces of legislation to rebuild our  Nation's infrastructure, for water, for transportation, broadband, and  so many another investments that are deeply and sorely needed. Making  life better for all Americans should be the priority of everyone who  serves in Congress.   The health and development of our communities and the economy depends  upon this vote. I urge your support.                            ____________________
