 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Justice in Policing  Act and to applaud Congresswoman Bass and the Congressional Black  Caucus, because Black lives matter.   All lives can't matter until Black lives matter.   I am grateful that my bill, which makes it a crime for law  enforcement officers to engage in a sexual act with anyone in their  custody or while exercising their authority, has been included in this  bill.   Why is this important? Because sexual violence is the second-most  frequently reported form of police misconduct after excessive force,  yet in many States, officers can claim consent when accused of  assaulting someone in their custody.   Yesterday I held a town hall with Dr. John Gates, who shared his  experience as being a Black man in America, how a piece of his soul  dies every time a Black man or woman dies at the hands of police, how  he fears his deep love of America is unrequited.   Four hundred years ago, Black men and women were brought to these  shores in shackles, deprived of their humanity.   Even at the beginning of our country, African Americans were only  considered to be three-fifths of a person.   Where was our humanity then and where is it now?   Racism in America did not end with the abolition of slavery,  America's original sin. It did not end with the passage of the Civil  Rights Act of 1866 or 1871 or 1957 or 1964 or 1968 or even 1991. Some  inevitably touted their passage as the final chapter in this long  struggle to cure ourselves of the poison of racism.   Our history of pursuing civil rights in this Chamber is comprised of  starts and stops, successes and failures.   Of course, passing this bill today will not end racism, but it will  further the righteous cause of not just equality, but equity in this  country.   Most Americans are not racists, but not enough of us are antiracist,  and that is where we need to be.
