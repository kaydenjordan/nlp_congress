 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                    The President's First One Hundred Days     Mr. President, reflecting on his accomplishments to date  in his administration, President Trump recently said: ``I think we've  done more than, perhaps, any President in the first 100 days.''  Throughout the campaign and since coming to office, President Trump has  repeatedly attacked politicians who are ``all talk, no action.'' It  seems to be appropriate that, now that the first 100 days have passed,  we should apply the President's standard.   Over the course of the campaign, Candidate Trump promised to replace  the ``very stupid people'' in our government who ``don't know how to  win'' with the ``greatest minds'' and the ``best people.''   He said that the Presidency was ``going to be easy'' and that the  ``jobs are coming back, folks; that's going to be easy.''   He promised a ``beautiful,'' ``terrific'' plan to provide ``such  great health care at a tiny fraction of the cost, and it's going to be  so easy.''   He promised to build a wall so fast that ``your head will spin'' and  that Mexico would pay for it. ``Just rely on me,'' he said.   He promised to be the ``greatest jobs President that God ever  created,'' to ``bring us all together,'' and to create a ``unified  Nation--a Nation of love,'' he said.   He predicted: ``We're gonna win so much that you may even get tired  of winning, and you'll say, please, please, it's too much winning, we  can't take it anymore. Mr. President, it's too much.''   He outlined that winning plan in no other place than Gettysburg last  October. There, on that hallowed ground, where Lincoln reflected on his  own ``poor power'' and wondered whether the world would little note nor  long remember what he said there, President Trump--the man who said:  ``I alone can fix it''--outlined his 100-day action plan to make  America great again and restore honesty, accountability, and change to  Washington. On that day, he promised that, on his first day, 18  different accomplishments would be achieved. He delivered just two of  those.   Over his first 100 days, he promised to introduce and fight to pass  10 major pieces of legislation. That included a bill to ``grow the  economy 4 percent per year and create at least 25 million new jobs.''  It included a bill to ``spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment  over 10 years.'' It included a bill to ``make 2- and 4-year college  more affordable'' as well as bills to ``clean up corruption in  Washington'' and ``discourage companies from laying off their  workers.''   Today, more than 100 days into the Trump Presidency, where are we?   So far, the President's ``great'' team has not yet been assembled.  There are 465 vacancies for which there are not even nominees yet. You  cannot blame that on anything going on around here. There are 465 slots  that still do not have nominees. Of the 10 pieces of legislation that  he proposed on that day in Gettysburg, he has passed zero--none.   In his first 100 days, amidst the Great Depression, FDR stabilized  the banks and put 250,000 Americans to work through a new Civilian  Conservation Corps. Ronald Reagan rallied the country behind his agenda  for taxes and spending. Facing an economic collapse--the likes of which  we had not seen since the Great Depression--Barack Obama cut taxes and  made historic investments in infrastructure, clean energy, and  education in 100 days.   Notwithstanding this history--these facts--President Trump has  repeatedly claimed in interviews and broadcasts how well the  administration has done during the first 100 days. In fact, on day 90-- he did not even need to get to 100--he said: ``No administration has  accomplished more.'' As evidence for this claim, the President referred  to the 28 bills that he has signed into law--laws to rename a VA clinic  in American Samoa, laws to make it easier to hunt bears out of  helicopters, to improve weather forecasts, to appoint members of the  Smithsonian Board of Regents. Those were in the 28 laws. Missing from  that list, however, is any legislation that fulfills a single campaign  promise that he made, including his promise to repeal ObamaCare.   In the absence of fulfilling the promises that he made at Gettysburg  and on the campaign trail, he has also taken credit for a series of  Executive orders even though, during the campaign, he railed against  President Obama for using them. Candidate Trump said: ``We have a  President that can't get anything done, so he just keeps signing  executive orders all over the place.'' In fact, history shows that  President Obama turned to Executive orders only after years of  unprecedented obstruction and after he passed legislation through this  Chamber and through the House.   President Trump turned to executive orders in the first 100 days  despite controlling both Houses of Congress. With a Republican  President, a Republican majority in the Senate, and a Republican  majority in the House, he has to revert to the very same instrument  that he was so appalled by in the hands of President Obama, and he  still has no major legislative accomplishments to show for it. That is  not fake news. That is the truth.   While we are on the subject, it bears noting, I think, that President  Obama used his Executive orders to advance rights and opportunity for  the American people. President Trump has used them to discriminate  against refugees and immigrants in an unconstitutional travel ban, to  weaken American competitiveness by reversing fuel efficiency standards  for our cars, to weaken protections for our national monuments and  endanger our economy and our environment by undoing the Clean Power  Plan.   Not only has President Trump failed to keep his promises--it is  actually worse than that--but he has actually proposed or supported  legislation that would do just the opposite of what he has promised.   Look at healthcare. I hope I am not in need of any right now. Over  the course of the campaign--I do not need to tell anybody in America  this; we all saw it--Candidate Trump attacked ObamaCare over and over.  He described it as a ``disaster'' that is ``imploding.'' So he  promised: ``On day one, we will ask Congress to immediately deliver a  full repeal of ObamaCare'' and replace it with ``something terrific.''  He pledged to ``take care of everybody,'' to champion what he called  the ``forgotten man,'' and he assured America that ``everybody's going  to be taken care of much better than they're taken care of now.''  [[Page S2707]]    More than 100 days after taking office, President Trump has not only  failed to fulfill that promise, failed to repeal ObamaCare--the House  has not yet even had a vote on it, as far as I know--but the White  House has actually helped to write--and he endorsed--a proposal that  would throw 24 million people, many of them poor and middle class  folks, off of their health insurance, while slashing $300 billion in  taxes for the top 2 percent.   That is what is in the bill that they are considering in the House  right now. That is not a healthcare bill. That is a tax cut for the  wealthiest Americans that is masquerading as a healthcare bill. That is  not the promise that he made to the people who voted for him. That is  not the promise that he made to the forgotten man. It seems that in the  first 100 days the forgotten man remains forgotten, unless by  ``forgotten'' President Trump meant millionaires who can avoid dealing  with America's health insurance system by paying cash for their medical  expenses with their having the benefit of the tax cut that President  Trump has proposed to give them.   My point--and I want to be clear about it--is not to ask the  President to fulfill these promises, most of which I opposed when he  was running. I am simply pointing out that what he has said is not what  he has done, including his promise to build a ``great, great wall on  our southern border'' and force Mexico to pay for that wall. Instead,  he asked Congress for $1.4 billion in taxpayer money to start  construction.   I was part of the Gang of Eight in the Senate that negotiated the  immigration bill--four Democrats and four Republicans--over 8 months.  We had $11 billion of border security. By the time we passed the bill  in the Senate, there was $40 billion of border security in that bill.  It was paid for, unlike a lot of stuff we do, and it was not the  taxpayers who were paying for it. It was the immigrants who were paying  for it in their fees to this country.   Why is that not a better way of doing it?   Mexico is not going to pay for it. It has said it is not going to pay  for it. He continues to say that it is going to happen, but it is just  another broken promise. Instead, he went to the taxpayers and hoped  nobody would notice that he was asking for $1.4 billion for the wall.  Fortunately, both Republicans and Democrats alike in the House of  Representatives and in the Senate rejected it--in particular, Members  of the House of Representatives who represent border States or  represent the border, who actually know what is going on down there.   I am sad to say that this inconsistent and erratic approach has  spilled over to our foreign relations. On North Korea, President Trump  bragged that the United States would easily ``solve the problem''--his  language--without China, which he called a currency manipulator and on  which, he said, everybody in Washington was soft, and he was going to  fix it. Then he sat down with Chinese President Xi for 10 minutes and  ``realized it's not so easy.''   When he was running, the President said: ``Maybe NATO will dissolve,  and that's OK.'' He called it ``obsolete.'' Then he sat down with the  NATO Secretary General and realized that it was, in fact, ``not  obsolete''--his words.   At a time when NATO faces new pressure from Russian aggression and  American troops are deployed to Eastern Europe to support our partners  and our allies in the region, including the soldiers whom I met 2 weeks  ago from Colorado's Fourth Infantry Division, they need a steady voice  and a clear vision from Washington.   We need an administration that can face reality instead of one that  spins its own. This is not a campaign anymore. This is governing.   During the campaign, Donald Trump promised: ``There will be no lies.  We will honor the American people with the truth and nothing else.''  Over its first 100 days, the administration has honored the American  people--it has been recorded--with 488 false or misleading claims,  nearly 5 a day. Some people have actually lost count. It has honored  them with 100 days of dog-and-pony shows of CEOs, campaign rallies, and  photo-ops in semi-trucks on the South Lawn. It has honored the American  people with empty theatrics where Donald Trump, the President, donates  a portion of his salary to the National Park Service, hoping no one  would notice his proposal to slash $1.4 billion in funding for the  Department of the Interior.    This administration needs a reset for the next 100 days and the next  100 after that. The President needs to focus on what the American  people need and what he said he would provide them instead of attacking  the independent judiciary and the free press and blaming ``fake  news''--his so-called fake news--in an effort to obscure a reality that  he doesn't want to deal with. He needs to focus on the next generation  instead of his daily approval ratings. He needs to focus on the future  instead of complaining about how unexpectedly hard the job is or how  great his previous life was.   And one more thing--a small thing. Candidate Trump loved to criticize  President Obama for playing golf. He tweeted about it at least 26 times  with lines like ``Can you believe that, with all the problems and  difficulties facing the U.S., President Obama spent the day playing  golf.'' Well, President Trump has spent 19 days playing golf so far-- even with all of these vacancies in this administration--more than  Presidents Obama, Bush, or Clinton. But that is not the only record he  has broken for the first 100 days, which includes an average of more  than five tweets a day, over a month he spent in this 100 days at Trump  properties, and over $20 million in taxpayer dollars to finance his  personal travel, which is on pace to exceed in his first year what the  previous administration cost the American taxpayer in eight.   A better idea than repeating this next 100 days for the 100 days that  are coming would be to actually drain the swamp, as he said during the  campaign. He could start by releasing his tax returns, which during the  campaign he falsely claimed he could not release because of a ``routine  audit.'' There was no prohibition on his doing the same thing that  every candidate in the history of America for the Presidency has done.   Now that he has put out a healthcare bill that slashes taxes by  hundreds of billions of dollars for the wealthiest Americans and  proposed tax reforms that would further deepen income inequality in  this country, the least he could do is show the ``laid-off factory  workers, and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade  deals'' what the President stands to gain and what they stand to lose  from his proposals.   While he is doing that, he should focus on dealing with Americans'  rising healthcare costs instead of trying to take health insurance away  from millions of Americans, making it harder for them to see a doctor  and take care of their families. He should focus on expanding  opportunities in our communities with investments in infrastructure and  on helping people compete in the global economy and reducing the  national debt crushing the next generation of Americans. That is why he  was elected President. To some degree, that is why all of us are here.   At the start of his first 100 days, President Trump promised in his  inaugural address that ``America will start winning again, winning like  never before.'' More than 100 days later, it is really not clear what  we have won, but it is clear what we have lost--civility in our  politics, facts in our policy, confidence in ourselves, and 100 days  that should have been used to bring this country together to confront  our great challenges.   The next 100 days must be better than the last because, as our  President once said, the American people are ``tired of being ripped  off by politicians that don't know what they're doing.'' On this, at  least, I completely agree.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.
