 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we are considering the nomination of  Congressman Mulvaney to become the Director of the Office of Management  and Budget. In the context of the review of this nomination, there has  been a lot of talk about Congressman Mulvaney being a ``straight  shooter.'' I do appreciate his courtesy meeting with me and his  participation in our Budget Committee confirmation hearing last month,  but I have to say that his 6-year record in the House of  Representatives makes it completely impossible for me to vote for him  as our Nation's chief budget officer.   He may be a straight shooter, but he shoots straight at the wrong  targets. One of them is the credit of the United States of America. In  the House of Representatives, Congressman Mulvaney repeatedly put our  economy in jeopardy by voting to let the Federal Government default on  its obligations. He had an opportunity after his nomination, when he  came before the Budget Committee, to pivot to a more mainstream and  responsible position, but he refused. In an answer to a prehearing  question he said:         I do believe that defaulting on America's debts would have       great worldwide consequences. I do not believe that breaching       the debt ceiling will automatically or inevitably lead to       that result.    Well, if you breach the debt ceiling, and if you honor the debt  ceiling law, that means that our government would not have the money to  pay all of its bills. Something has to be defaulted on or the debt  ceiling is a complete chimera.   Mr. Mulvaney's completely unsupported faith that a default on some of  our Nation's obligations might not have grave consequences ignores  basic economics, and it ignores the guidance  [[Page S1215]]  of liberal and conservative economists and experts alike, including  Douglas Holtz-Eakin, Benjamin Bernanke, Hank Paulson, Janet Yellen,  Jack Lew, and many, many others.   In fact, many of my Republican colleagues in this room were gravely  concerned about what happened if we blew through the debt ceiling, and  that we perhaps had made a bet we would be unable to pay. To put it  simply, lenders tend to charge more for riskier loans, and a borrower  that won't pay all of its bills on time is riskier than one that does.   Tom Donahue of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is not someone that I  ordinarily cite favorably here in the Senate. He is an inveterate enemy  on doing anything on climate change. He and I disagree on a great  number of issues, but even Tom Donahue noted that a small increase in  treasury rates, which would happen as the result of a default, ``would  translate into hundreds of thousands of jobs lost every year.''   A member of the self-styled ``shutdown caucus,'' Mr. Mulvaney chooses  to ignore the fact that his fiscal brinkmanship has already cost the  American people. Playing around with the debt ceiling and shutting down  the government are not free exercises. According to the Wall Street  firm Standard and Poor's, the 16-day government shutdown that the  Congressman helped orchestrate in 2013 cost the American economy $24  billion. That is shooting straight at our economy just to prove a  political point. That is not the kind of straight shooter that we need.  Of course, that doesn't even mention the unnecessary stress that the  shutdown caused for millions of government contractors who weren't sure  they would be paid. There is pain and there is damage from the reckless  decisions that Congressman Mulvaney seems to make so easily.   Congressman Mulvaney's blind faith is not limited to economics. He  disregards science too. In response to questions I asked him at the  hearing, he said he is not convinced by the evidence presented that  climate change is at least partly driven by human activity. Well, he  ought to take a little look at what is going on at his home State  university, the University of South Carolina, which has the School of  the Earth, Ocean, and Environment. It actually teaches climate change.  The University of South Carolina doesn't just believe climate change;  it teaches it. It has a faculty who are involved in teaching the  students about what is happening in our atmosphere and in our oceans as  a result of climate change.   This is not all that complicated stuff. We have known since President  Lincoln was riding around Washington in his top hat that greenhouse  gases in the atmosphere would catch heat in the atmosphere and would  warm the Earth. That was a scientist named Tyndall. This is not news;  this is 150 years old. It is simple, elemental chemistry, what happens  when you ramp up the level of CO2 in the atmosphere and how  that works in the oceans. The CO2 gets absorbed by the  oceans. The oceans, as a result of absorbing CO2, become  more acidic. What we are seeing now is the acidification of the ocean  in the experience of humankind--indeed, in probably like 100 times the  experience of humankind. You have to go back 50 years to find a similar  rate of acidification of the ocean.   Well, Mr. Mulvaney represents South Carolina. South Carolina is a  coastal State. It is an ocean State. The University of South Carolina  studies its oceans. They know ocean acidification is happening. When  the Congressman says that he is not convinced by the evidence  presented, something other than being a straight shooter is going on.   According to NASA, for instance, the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration--which, by the way, right now is driving a rover around  on the surface of the planet Mars. So can we perhaps stipulate that the  scientists at NASA know what they are talking about? No other country  in the world, no other society in human history has had the capacity to  launch from Earth a rover, fly it through space to Mars, land it safely  on that other planet, and drive it around. We can do that. NASA  scientists did that. So when NASA scientists say that ``multiple  studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals show that 97  percent or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree  climate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely due  to human activity''--so essentially all the experts agree.   His home State university, the University of South Carolina, teaches  this. They don't just listen to it, they teach it. They understand what  is going on. But Mulvaney says he is not convinced. What is it going to  take to convince him? How can you be a straight shooter when you ignore  this kind of certainty in science, particularly when around this  building you see the circling menace of the fossil fuel industry always  with its guns out, always trying to shoot down anybody who will  disagree with them, always trying to pretend that climate change isn't  real, always trying to defend a $700 billion-a-year subsidy that they  get at the expense of the rest of America? And because, thanks to  Citizens United, they have the capacity to spend enormous, unlimited  amounts of money in politics, they can spend a great deal to protect  that $700 billion in subsidies, and they do.   So we do nothing about climate change here. You can't get a  Republican to talk seriously about climate change here. The oceans are  changing off of their States, and they won't talk about climate change  here. Their universities are saying that climate change is real. Their  universities are teaching that climate change is real. And they won't  say one thing about climate change here. And this so-called straight  shooter is going to go along with that racket rather than listen to his  home State universities and to the scientists at NASA, who have put the  rover on Mars? Give me a break.   While this man claims to be a deficit hawk, I asked him if he was  ready to take on the hundreds of billions of dollars that go out the  back door of our economy in tax breaks, in wasteful tax loopholes, in  tax benefits for special interests, and he wouldn't give me a straight  answer to the question.   From his record in the House, it appears pretty clear that Mr.  Mulvaney would rather balance the budget by going after seniors, by  going after Social Security, by going after Medicare, by going after  the families who have children on Medicaid because their children have  lifetime disabilities that require Medicaid support. Those are the  targets. That is who this so-called straight shooter wants to shoot at.  But as for, say, the tax benefit that lets billionaires depreciate  their private jets faster than the airline can, oh, no, can't touch  that. As for the tax loophole that lets carried interest Wall Street  billionaires pay lower tax rates than their doormen, than their  janitors, oh, no, can't possibly touch that. As for the subsidies we  give through the Tax Code to the fossil fuel industry every year when  they are the most lucrative corporations in the history of the planet,  oh, no, we can't possibly do that. Let's go after the old folks. That  is not being a straight shooter; that is shooting at the wrong people.   Someone who is a straight shooter when it happens to agree with the  politics that they like but is a flatout denier when it doesn't, that  is not my idea of a straight shooter.   Congressman Mulvaney is possessed by conservative ideology that I  strongly believe is going to prevent him ever from working across party  lines on the budget, on health care, or on other major issues that he  will have to face at OMB. His counsel is likely to pull President Trump  further out to the extremes, which already divide this country.   And by the way, to all of those voters who voted for President Trump  because he said that he was different from all the other Republican  candidates; that he was different from the other 15 candidates because  he wasn't going to hurt Social Security and he wasn't going to hurt  Medicare; that he was different from all the others because he was  going to protect Social Security and he was going to protect Medicare-- folks, I think you were sold a bill of goods because when you look at  Congressman Price and when you look at Congressman Mulvaney and when  you look at their records, you see the records of people who have  targeted Social Security and targeted Medicare for years. They may be  straight shooters, but they have Social Security and Medicare in the  crosshairs. Those are not the right targets for us to be shooting  [[Page S1216]]  at in a tax system that is riddled with special interest loopholes and  in a country that is so divided and where the poor and the elderly are  struggling compared to the people who are at the very top, who have  basically gathered all of the economic benefit of our growth since the  great recession.   So, for all of those reasons, I will be completely unable to support  this person's confirmation. I am sorry because I would like to have  seen the President make the slightest gesture in the direction of  bipartisanship, the slightest gesture in the direction of compromise,  the slightest gesture in the direction of reasonableness, but out of  this White House, on the civilian Cabinet, we have seen nothing like  that.   It is a Cabinet that is completely controlled by rightwing ideology  and appalling special interests. Usually, the special interests are the  most dangerous and worst special interests that the agency has to  regulate. Instead of accepting that as the agency's responsibility, he  has brought that special interest in, brought the fox into the  henhouse. If there was ever a fox in the OMB henhouse to take our  Social Security folks and our Medicare folks and hurt them, it is this  Congressman.   I cannot accept his nomination. I will vote against it.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
