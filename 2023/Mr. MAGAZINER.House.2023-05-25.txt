 Madam Speaker, I rise to express my outrage at the  extreme MAGA Republicans in this House who are fighting to take food  out of the mouths of children, medicine out of the hands of seniors,  and relief out of the pockets of working people, all to fund their tax  cuts for the billionaires and corporations that fund their campaigns.   Make no mistake: That is what this entire Republican manufactured  debt crisis is about. It is not about cutting spending.   If it was about cutting spending, they would support President  Biden's plan to cut $900 billion from the deficit by negotiating with  the drug companies for Medicare and Medicaid. But, no, they don't want  to upset their Big Pharma donors.   It is not about avoiding default. If it was about avoiding default,  they would sign the discharge petition and end this whole thing today.   This is about one thing and one thing only: taking money out of the  pockets of the working people who I represent and putting it in the  pockets of the millionaires, the billionaires, and the corporations.    These reverse Robin Hoods on the Republican side who seek to steal  from the working people to benefit the rich need to stop this craziness  and end this thing today.                            ____________________
