Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on S. 881, the bill now under  consideration.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        September 16, 2020, on page H4458, the following appeared:   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5  legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include  extraneous material on S. 881, the bill now under consideration.    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I am very excited we are here today to pass S. 881,  the PROSWIFT Act, a bill that I have been working on for almost 5  years.   Space weather is the electromagnetic activity that comes from the  Sun, and it can have significant societal, economic, national security,  and health implications both here on Earth and in space.   About 5 years ago, Dr. Dan Baker from the University of Colorado  Boulder testified in front of the Science, Space, and Technology  Committee about the dangers of space weather events on the electric  grid. At that hearing, he said that had an observed July 2012 space  weather event actually hit Earth, we would ``still be picking up the  pieces.''   That testimony stuck with me, and when Senators Gary Peters and Cory  Gardner introduced the first version of this bill a few months later, I  was eager to start working on the House companion.   Over the last 4 years, the House and the Senate have been working  toward the shared goal of passing this legislation into law, but we  have had a few differences we have had to work out. I am glad we  finally worked through those differences and can send this bill to the  President's desk today.   In 2015, the Office of Science and Technology Policy pulled together  the best and brightest from within the various agencies working on  space weather to produce the National Space Weather Strategy and Action  Plan. These documents helped renew our focus on the critical research  and operational needs to improve our space weather enterprise, and OSTP  updated the strategy and action plan in 2019.   The PROSWIFT Act builds upon this work by providing the structures  needed for the continued advancement of heliophysics research,  collection of new data and observations, and improvements to our  modeling and forecasting.   This bill also, for the first time, clearly delineates the roles and  responsibilities of the key Federal agencies involved in space weather,  including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Science  Foundation, the Department of Defense, the Federal Aviation  Administration, and the United States Geological Survey, as well as the  Office of Science and Technology Policy.   Importantly, our legislation brings in new voices from the academic  community, commercial space weather sector, and space weather forecast  end-users. These communities will participate in the space weather  advisory group created in the bill as well as on a new government- academia-commercial roundtable we create to be facilitated by the  National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.   Finally, the bill also sets up formal research-to-operations and  operations-to-research mechanisms to help break down barriers between  the research community and operational forecasters by encouraging  sharing of information and requirements to improve the pipeline of new  observations, technologies, models, and forecasts.   This bill will improve our understanding of space weather and better  prepare us for its impacts on the electric power grid, communications  networks, satellite operations, and airlines. It will also help NASA  understand the radiation environment for our astronauts on the  International Space Station, on their way back to the Moon, and, most  importantly, on their journey to Mars by 2033.   We have been working on this bill for a long time now, and I want to  thank the gentleman from Alabama, Representative Mo Brooks, for his  help pushing for this bipartisan legislation. I also want to thank  Chairwoman Johnson and her staff for their support over the years,  getting us to where we are today, and Ranking Member Frank Lucas for  his support of the bill. I also want to thank my friend, Senator Gary  Peters from Michigan, who happens to be in the House Chamber today, for  all the work he and his staff have put into this effort over the years.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Oklahoma (Ms. Kendra S. Horn), my friend, the chair of the  Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics.    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Alabama for  being a good partner and really working with me and with the Senate to  refine and get this thing into an excellent product.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the following letters of  support we received for the PROSWIFT Act: a letter from the University  of Colorado at Boulder; a letter from the University Corporation for  Atmospheric Research; a letter from the American Commercial Space  Weather Association; a letter from the American Astronomical Society; a  letter from the American Geophysical Union; a letter from the  University of Michigan; a letter from the University of New Hampshire;  and a letter from the Pennsylvania State University.                                                            LASP,                                                    January 8, 2020.      Hon. Ed Perlmutter,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Perlmutter: On behalf of my colleagues       at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP)       and the University of Colorado Boulder, I write in support of       the Promoting Research and Observations of Space Weather to       Improve the Forecasting of Tomorrow Act (PROSWIFT) Act (H.R.       5260). Given the continued threat and vulnerabilities facing       our world from solar interactions with the Earth, we applaud       the bicameral and bipartisan approach Congress is taking to       address the challenges we face with respect to enhancing our       nation's space weather forecasting capabilities.  [[Page H4460]]         Throughout the Space Age, we have discovered and       accumulated a vast knowledge on the governing physical       processes of the various regions of both deep space as well       as the space surrounding near-Earth. This knowledge has       provided an opportunity to expand our reach into the solar       system and beyond, as well as increase our Earth observation       capabilities. Over time, the increased utilization of       satellites continues to have a broad reach across our       society, including within the security, public safety and       commercial realms. The data we acquire from these satellites       is vital in order to protect our national security and       economic interests, and interruptions stemming from increased       solar activity could prove detrimental in carrying out these       important functions.        As a result, the call to increase our space weather       forecasting and mitigation capabilities was amplified by the       National Academies Decadal Survey in Solar and Space Physics       in 2012, and again through the Office of Science and       Technology Policy's Space Weather Action Plan that was       released in October 2015. Through these calls, it has become       a national imperative to streamline the mechanisms designed       to help develop and maintain a forecasting system that not       only help to predict space weather events, but to respond to       them. We believe the PROSWIFT Act will provide a       collaborative framework for the federal government and its       agencies to work together alongside academic, international       and commercial space communities to advance this critical       undertaking.        An important component of space weather research and       monitoring is collaboration and cooperation among its many       stakeholders. The legislation's call for the development of a       Space Weather Government-Academic-Commercial Roundtable in       addition to a Space Weather Advisory Group will foster       collaboration among academic, commercial and space weather       end users designed to provide the federal interagency working       group with guidance from key constituent groups. In addition,       the renewed expansion of basic and multidisciplinary research       as well as the federal partnership with the National       Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine to       ``implement missions that meet the science objectives       identified in solar and space physics decadal surveys'' is a       great step forward toward increasing our nation's future       forecasting and responsive capabilities. Finally, the strong       focus on research and operational capacity within this       legislation underscores the important role academic       institutions will continue to play in addressing the needs of       federal agencies. Here at LASP (and I, daresay, across all of       CU-Boulder), we take great pride in our expertise in research       to operations and operations to research (R2O/O2R)       capabilities, and we stand ready to assist in the cooperative       model outlined in the H.R. 5260 to advance our national space       weather forecast and response capabilities.        Again, we applaud this legislation and its aim to       streamline federal efforts working in conjunction with       academic and commercial space partners in order to better       understand and predict space weather activities and their       impacts on our national interests. Thank you for your       outstanding support and leadership, and please continue to       think of us as a resource and partner going forward.            Sincerely,      Daniel N. Baker, Ph.D.,        Distinguished Professor of Planetary & Space Physics, Moog-      BRE Endowed Chair of Space Sciences, Director, Laboratory for       Atmospheric and Space Physics; Professor, Astrophysical and       Planetary Sciences; Professor, Department of Physics;       Professor, Aerospace Engineering Sciences.                                   ____                                                               UCAR,                                         Office of the President,                                                    January 8, 2020.      Hon. Ed Perlmutter,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Perlmutter: As a research organization       committed to better understanding the earth system, including       the critical role of the sun in geospace sciences, the       University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) would       like to thank you for proposing H.R. 5260--Promoting Research       and Observations of Space Weather to Improve the Forecasting       of Tomorrow Act--and voice our strong support for PROSWIFT.       H.R. 5260 will enhance the integration of existing national       efforts to understand, predict, prepare for, and mitigate       space weather and will strengthen economic and national       security as a result.        Scientists are just beginning to understand the       interactions between our sun and the Earth. Given the growing       national importance and reliance on technology, it is       critical that we expand our scientific understanding of the       interactions between the sun and Earth so that we may improve       forecasting and mitigate the effects of space weather events.       Coupled with the National Space Weather Strategy and National       Space Weather Action Plan, this legislation sets national       priorities to increase and improve space weather       observations, science, and forecasting abilities.        H.R. 5260 lays out a clear road map for the space weather       enterprise which consists of the public, private and academic       sectors, and in so doing will enable better research to       operations transitions that will benefit all communities that       rely on technology both on the ground and in space that can       be affected by these sun-driven events. The creation of the       Space Weather Advisory Group is to be lauded as an excellent       first step as it will establish the necessary linkages       between government, academia and the private sector in an       organized way that is currently done in an ad hoc fashion.       This new approach will allow Congress to be kept up to date       on the latest advances in science that are translated into       operations and will help to identify the highest priority       areas that are in need of resources in both the research and       operational realms.        Most of our understanding of space weather is based on       experience and knowledge gained over the last 30 years,       though the historical record indicates space weather events       of much greater severity have occurred within the last 150       years. Impacting airlines, GPS, and electric utilities, space       weather events in recent history resulted in economic       consequences in the tens of millions of dollars. Estimates       for damage resulting from a repeat of the worst known event       of the last 150 years range from $1-2 trillion in the first       year alone. Scientists do not know the likelihood of such an       event recurring, or even whether such an event is the worst-      case scenario. Thus, predictability of such events needs to       be the driver for all research in the space weather domain.       As part of the need to organize the research optimally to       meet this threat, and in line with input from your recent       hearing, UCAR encourages the committee to establish the       Geosciences Directorate within the National Science       Foundation (NSF) to be the lead within NSF for all space       weather research activities.        Additionally, we commend H.R. 5260 for its emphasis on       ``Sustaining Ground-Based Observational Capability'' and we       believe it is imperative to draw the distinction between       astronomy and space weather research in this regards. Ground-      based observations are less costly and are the appropriate       way to prove an observational capability and ensure risk       reduction for instruments that may later be flown in space.       Current ground-based telescopes used in astronomy are       inadequate for space weather research so this section is       vital to ensure a robust ``ground to space'' strategy.        H.R. 5260 would provide clear roles and responsibilities to       the various federal agencies responsible for understanding,       predicting, and forecasting space weather, including the       National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the       National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the       National Science Foundation (NSF), and the Department of       Defense (DOD). As these are all agencies with which we work       regularly, this clarity would enable us to pursue research       that will have the best impact on society's ability to       predict and respond to space weather events.        Again, thank you for your tireless work supporting the       science community in Colorado and across the United States.       We appreciate your efforts on this bill and many other       endeavors.            Best regards,                                      Dr. Antonio J. Busalacchi,                                   President, University Corporation      for Atmospheric Research.                                   ____                                           American Commercial Space                                             Weather Association,                                                   December 6, 2019.                                Jeff O'Neil,       Legislative Director, Office of Congressman Ed Perlmutter           (C0-07), Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. O'Neil: On behalf of the American Commercial Space       Weather Association (ACSWA), we are writing to express our       strong support for H.R. 5260, Promoting Research and       Observations of Space Weather to Improve the Forecasting of       Tomorrow (PROSWIFT) Act. The current version of the bill       highlights the growing importance of space weather across a       broad range of technology areas. We are pleased to see       references to the expanding role of the commercial sector in       addressing gaps in fundamental knowledge, providing the means       to develop and improve observational resources, enabling the       research to operations and operations to research enterprise,       and mitigating the impacts of space weather threats. ACSWA       stands ready to aid federal agencies in undertaking this       critically important enterprise.        The studies and survey mandated by the bill will be       extremely helpful to the space weather community as it       mobilizes to address the high priority science and technology       objectives that continue to drive space weather activities in       federal laboratories, academic institutions, and the private       sector. ACSWA member companies strive to continue agency and       academia close partnerships that have been established and       strengthened through the years. We fully anticipate that the       five members of the PROSWIFT Advisory Committee from the       commercial sector will ensure that ACSWA expertise, assets,       and resources will be fully integrated in the space weather       strategies emerging from the PROSWIFT-mandated actions.        ACSWA fully supports the observational priorities outlined       in the PROSWIFT bill. More specifically, ACSWA feels it is       important to continue L1 observations with a follow-on       mission while simultaneously working aggressively toward       developing an L5  [[Page H4461]]       platform. The combination of solar observations from L1 and       L5 orbits provide an unprecedented view of the disturbances       from which most space weather effects at Earth originate.       Additionally, the rapidly improving capabilities in       monitoring the ionosphere using radio occultation techniques       will address a long-standing challenge in mitigating space       weather effects on navigation and communication systems. The       data sets generated by these observations will offer many       opportunities for commercial sector companies to develop       tailored products for government and industry customers.        We note that the PROSWlFT bill provides some latitude to       federal agencies in how the commercial sector will be       involved in space weather research and operations. ACSWA       hopes that the language in the bill provides sufficient       encouragement for agencies to overcome long-standing barriers       that inhibit full cooperation and involvement with the       commercial sector, not all of which are based on fiscal       constraints. Again, the commercial sector members of the       PROSWIFT Advisory Committee will have an important role to       play in identifying strategies for taking full advantage of       the private sector in meeting space weather goals. The pilot       program removed from the earlier version of this bill would       have effectively demonstrated the merits of such strategies.       ACSWA looks forward to seeing such pilot programs implemented       by federal agencies as they strive to meet space weather       research and operational goals.        While we don't want to-jeopardize the passage of the bill,       there are additional small changes we believe could be added       to the bill to ensure that all available technologies and       processes are applied to reduce space weather hazards:        Page 7, lines 23-24 (Section 60601(d)(3)): change ``Each       Federal agency participating in the space weather . . .'' to       ``All Federal agencies participating in the space weather . .       . .''        p. 18., line 19 in section 60603(d)(2)): ``. . . airflow       imagers, spectrometers, interferometers, airborne radiation       instrumentation, and . . . .''        ACSWA agrees with the Agency changes of Page 21-22; 23-5:       ``. . . transition National Aeronautics and Space       Administration, National Science Foundation, United States       Geological Survey, and other relevant Federal agencies space       weather research findings, models, and capabilities, as       appropriate, to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric       Administration and the Department of Defense'' to:       ``transition space weather research findings, models, and       capabilities, as appropriate, from the National Aeronautics       and Space Administration, National Science Foundation, United       States Geological Survey, other relevant Federal agencies,       the academic community, and the commercial space weather       sector to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration       and the Department of Defense''        ACSWA agrees with the Agency changes of Page 22, 9-15: ``.       . . communicate National Oceanic and Atmospheric       Administration and Department of Defense operational needs of       space weather forecasters, as appropriate, to the National       Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Science       Foundation and United States Geological Survey.'' to:       ``communicate National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration       and Department of Defense operational needs of space weather       forecasters, as appropriate, to the National Aeronautics and       Space Administration, the National Science Foundation, United       States Geological Survey, other relevant Federal agencies,       the academic community, and the commercial space weather       sector.''        ACSWA appreciates all the hard work and careful thought       devoted to crafting the PROSWIFT bill. It not only provides a       tremendous boost to the entire space weather enterprise, but       also takes a huge step toward protecting the nation from       threats to technological infrastructure that is becoming ever       more susceptible to space weather disturbances. We hope that       this vital bill is quickly approved and federal agencies move       forward with the activities so carefully delineated in the       document.

Hon. Ed Perlmutter,      House of Representatives,      Washington DC.      Hon. Mo Brooks,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representatives Perlmutter and Brooks: On behalf of       the over 8,500 members of the American Astronomical Society       (AAS) and its Solar Physics Division (SPD), we write to       express our strong support for the Promoting Research and       Observations of Space Weather to Improve the Forecasting of       Tomorrow (PROSWIFT) Bill and to thank you for your leadership       on this vitally important topic. The legislation that you       have introduced in the House is comprehensive in its scope,       addressing key aspects of space weather and its significance       for national security, communications, and human and robotic       space operations in low Earth orbit and interplanetary space.        In particular, we endorse the following components of the       bill, all of which are essential to further our understanding       of the causes and effects of space weather, as well as to       advance our ability to reliably forecast space weather       events:        the recognition of the wide impact of space weather and the       concomitant call for strong cooperation between stakeholder       agencies such as NOAA, NSF, NASA, FAA, and the Departments of       Defense and the Interior through the establishment of an       interagency working group through the National Science and       Technology Council on space weather, with accountability to       Congress through the submission of pertinent reports;        the call for the formation of a space weather advisory       group with broad representation across the academic,       commercial, and non-governmental end-user communities to       identify new technologies to aid in understanding and       forecasting space weather;        the implementation of an integrated strategy that       identifies the observation capabilities necessary for near-      real-time solar and coronal mass ejection imaging and that       must be sustained beyond the lifetime of current ground-based       and space-based assets in order to maintain capability;        the development of space weather instrumentation and       competitive, peer-reviewed proposals for conducting research,       including interdisciplinary research, in subjects that       further the understanding of solar physics, space physics,       and space weather and its impacts; and        increased engagement and cooperation with the       international, academic, and commercial space weather       communities on the observational infrastructure and       scientific research necessary to advance the forecasting of       and preparation and protection from space weather phenomena.        Thank you for your attention to this timely and important       issue. The membership of the SPD, which includes the nation's       foremost experts in many of the areas addressed in this       legislation, stands ready to assist in any way it can. If       there is anything we can do, please do not hesitate to       contact us.            Sincerely,      Megan Donahue,        President, AAS.      Dale Gary,        Chair, SPD.                                   ____                                                          AGU 100,                                                    January 8, 2020.      Hon. Ed Perlmutter,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mo Brooks,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressmen Perlmutter and Brooks: On behalf of the       American Geophysical Union (AGU) and its 60,000 members, I am       writing to endorse H.R. 5260, The Promoting Research and       Observations of Space Weather to Improve the Forecasting of       Tomorrow (PROSWIFT) Act, and to thank you for crafting this       important legislation.        Space weather has the potential to inflict trillions of       dollars of damage on our economy, weaken our national       security, and alter our way of life. The National Research       Council estimates that a severe space weather event has the       potential to inflict $1-2 trillion dollars of economic and       societal damage in the first year alone and impact more than       130 million people. To recover from such an event could take       from 4-10 years. Moreover, space weather fluctuations are not       limited to rare catastrophic events but regularly impact our       society and economy. It's estimated that the average economic       impact of moderate geomagnetic events on the electric power       grid in the U.S. is $7 to $10 billion per year. Additionally,       advancing our understanding of the Sun is essential for the       United States to realize its space exploration ambitions.        Given the economic and opportunity costs associated with       space weather, we support the bill's approach of creating a       national, coordinated plan to advance our understanding of       the relationship between the Sun and Earth and to ensure the       development of new technologies and forecasting capabilities       to mitigate the threat posed by space weather. We appreciate       the bill's recognition that a partnership between industry,       academia, and federal agencies is needed to further our       understanding and capacity to address the impacts of space       weather. As a community dedicated to advancing the       understanding of Earth and space science, we applaud the       bill's intent to further scientifically informed action       towards disaster preparation, mitigation, response, and       recovery.        AGU looks forward to working with you as this legislation       advances.            With best wishes,                                           Christine W. McEntee,                                             CEO/Executive Director,                                        American Geophysical Union.

Hon. Ed Perlmutter,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Perlmutter: On behalf of the University       of Michigan Office of Research, I write to thank you for       introducing the Promoting Research and Observations of Space       Weather to Improve the Forecasting of Tomorrow (PROSWIFT) Act       (H.R. 5260).        As this legislation notes, severe space weather events       ``could have significant societal, economic, national       security, and health impacts.'' This bipartisan legislation       is essential to helping us predict and mitigate such events       that could drastically disrupt our economy and national       security.        We are pleased this legislation outlines clear roles and       responsibilities for the relevant federal agencies that are       involved with improving our understanding, prediction and       forecasting of space weather events. Importantly, PROSWIFT       recognizes the necessity of engagement and cooperation with       the academic community, among other sectors, by establishing       a Space Weather Advisory Group whose membership will be       equally comprised of a diverse stakeholder group including       the academic community. Additionally, this bill creates a       Space Weather Government-Academic-Commercial Roundtable to       facilitate advances in space weather prediction and       forecasting, among other items, which is necessary to       efficiently advance our understanding of space weather.        The University of Michigan is focused on helping to improve       the characterization, prediction, and mitigation of space       weather events. Researchers on our campus study the effects       of large solar eruptions and coronal mass ejections, and       develop high-performance computational models to describe and       predict hazardous conditions. If any of our experts on campus       can ever be a resource, please do not hesitate to reach out.        Once again, thank you for your leadership on this       legislation. We appreciate your continued commitment to       improving efforts to predict and mitigate space weather       events and we hope the full House of Representatives will       approve this legislation expeditiously.            Sincerely,                                          Rebecca Cunningham, M.D.,      Interim Vice President for Research.                                   ____                                      University of New Hampshire,                                                    January 7, 2020.      Hon. Eddie Bernice Johnson,      Chair, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Frank Lucas,      Ranking Member, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chair Johnson and Ranking Member Lucas: We are writing       on behalf of the University of New Hampshire (UNH) to voice       our strong support for the PROSWIFT Act (H.R. 5260). UNH       urges swift approval of this bipartisan legislation critical       to ensuring that the United States is equipped to predict,       mitigate, and respond to the hazards that space weather poses       to our national security and economic wellbeing.        Federal support for research and technology development is       essential to improving the Nation's space weather readiness.       Current space weather monitoring capabilities rely on an       observational infrastructure that is incapable of providing       the lead time required to undertake proper space weather       mitigation measures. We applaud the Committee's recognition       of the importance of fundamental research into the physical       processes behind space weather. Such research will enable       more sophisticated prediction capabilities and equip       decision-makers with the information and tools necessary to       avert crippling damage to our satellites, electric power       grid, and other sensitive assets that underpin our economy       and national security apparatus.        UNH is especially supportive of Sections 60603 and 60604.       The former would strengthen support for critical ground-based       and space-based space weather observational platforms while       the latter would identify specific roles and responsibilities       for research, development, and R20/02R activities at relevant       agencies such as NASA, NSF, and NOAA. Particularly important       to UNH and many of its peer institutions is the legislation's       commitment to advancing the consensus-based priorities       identified by the scientific community and articulated in the       National Academies Solar and Space Physics Decadal Survey.        We thank you for putting forward this important piece of       legislation, and we hope that UNH can serve as a resource for       you as you continue working to address the pressing issue of       space weather.            Sincerely,      Dr. Kevin Gardner,        Vice Provost for Research, University of New Hampshire.      Dr. Harlan Spence,        Director, Institute for the Study of Earth, Oceans, and       Space, University of New Hampshire.                                   ____                                                       Penn State,                                                    January 8, 2020.      Hon. Ed Perlmutter,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Perlmutter: I write to express support for H.R.       5260, the Promoting Research and Observations of Space       Weather to Improve the Forecasting of Tomorrow (PROSWIFT)       Act, and appreciation for your leadership on this legislation       that aims to improve efforts for predicting and mitigating       space weather events.        By delineating clear roles and responsibilities to federal       agencies that study and predict space weather, the       legislation will improve resources and make critical       measurement data available for the research community to       model the frequency and severity of space weather events.       This information will be helpful for monitoring space weather       events, particularly coronal mass ejections and geomagnetic       disturbances that can cause interruptions to the power grid       and in satellites, affecting critical infrastructure that is       dependent on communications technology and electricity.        With an increase in focus and attention to space weather       activities provided by this legislation, researchers with       expertise in data assimilation and big data analysis at Penn       State and around the nation can conduct risk analysis and       plan for responses to space weather events before they occur.       Penn State researchers and educators in meteorology,       geoinformatics, energy business and engineering, as well as       social science, look forward to the data opportunities made       available through this legislation.        If I or any of our experts in the College of Earth and       Mineral Sciences can be of assistance to you, please feel       free to contact my federal relations colleagues.            Sincerely,                                                       Lee R. Kump,                                                   John Leone Dean.    Madam Speaker, I also include in the Record an op-ed  from The Hill dated September 10, 2020, by Dr. Antonio Busalacchi, who  supports this bill.                      [From the Hill, Sept. 10, 2020]     Congress Needs To Finalize Spa Weather Bill as Solar Storms Pose                             Heightened Threat                         (By Antonio J. Busalacchi)         The COVID-19 pandemic has left us more dependent than ever       on advanced information and communication technologies, with       many businesses and schools relying on a range of remote       services. In this environment, building resilience to       potential threats that can disrupt society's essential daily       activities is critical.        For this reason, it is heartening to see Congress advancing       legislation to better protect the nation from solar storms       that spew millions of tons of charged matter toward Earth.       Such space weather events can distort GPS signals, scramble       satellite operations, and disable communications and power       systems, with serious consequences for our economy and armed       services--a particularly major concern as the Pentagon       prepares for future space-based conflicts.        Significant space weather events occur every decade or so       with far-reaching and destructive consequences. A powerful       solar storm in 1989 cut off power to millions of Canadians,       and major storms in 2003 affected more than half of Earth-      orbiting spacecraft. Just three years ago, solar flares       caused radio blackouts for hours during critical emergency       response efforts to approaching hurricanes in the Caribbean       and nearby regions.        A solar superstorm poses even greater risks. The so-called       Carrington Event in 1859, which ignited fires in telegraph       offices, would have catastrophic impacts on today's society,       potentially resulting in widespread damage to power grids,       communication networks, and other technologies that would       take weeks, months, or even years to repair. Even before       COVID-19 led to an increased reliance on e-based       technologies, the National Academy of Sciences estimated that       such an event could result in as much as $2 trillion in       damages--or more than 10 times the costs of Hurricane       Katrina.        Despite a growing array of advanced satellites that monitor       the sun, forecasters cannot accurately predict when a major       storm will erupt from the sun and begin its one- to four-day       journey toward Earth. Observations provide only limited       information about where the storm will hit and its potential       for damage until it is within about a half-hour of Earth.       This does not leave satellite operators and utility managers       with sufficient notice to fully shield vulnerable electronics       and power down critical hardware.        To improve its forecasting capability, the nation needs to       invest in a new generation of space- and ground-based       instruments that can provide continual measurements of       magnetic fields throughout the solar atmosphere. These       measurements would alert us to conditions that are conducive       for storms and help us determine whether an incoming storm       will penetrate our atmosphere and target certain regions on       Earth, or harmlessly glance off.        Scientists are also working toward more advanced computer       models of the sun. One of their primary goals is to stimulate       the buildup of energy in twisted magnetic fields within the       solar atmosphere, enabling forecasters to predict when the       fields will erupt and spew tons of charged particles toward       Earth.        Fortunately, Congress is starting to take action on this       important issue. The Senate last month unanimously passed       legislation to improve scientific understanding and       forecasting of space weather. The Promoting Research and       Observations of Space Weather to  [[Page H4463]]       Improve the Forecasting of Tomorrow (PROSWIFT) Act would       break down barriers between the nation's researchers and       forecasters, coordinate the efforts of key federal agencies,       and establish an integrated strategy across the federal       government to address space weather research and       observational needs.        This legislation, appropriately, has strong bipartisan       support. Sens. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) and Cory Gardner (R-      Colo.) co-sponsored the Senate bill. In the House of       Representatives, Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D-Colo.) is working with       eight co-sponsors on both sides of the aisle to advance the       measure.        With just months remaining on the calendar of the current       Congress, the House must provide the final passage of this       important legislation.        Congress needs to provide flexible funding to states to deploy         Our solar forecasting capabilities at present are       comparable to terrestrial weather prediction before the       Second World War when communities had little warning of       incoming storms. Since then, government agencies, private       companies, and university researchers have collaborated on       landmark advances in weather prediction, which have saved       countless lives, fostered economic growth, and supported       military operations.        We have now arrived at a pivotal moment in forecasting       solar storms. At a time when society is more dependent than       ever on advanced e-based technologies, the PROSWIFT Act lays       out a clear road map for bringing together expertise in       government, the private sector, and academia to forecast       these damaging events. If Congress and the administration       successfully enact the legislation, this predictive       capability will provide a critical safeguard for America's       economic competitiveness and national security, and for the       business and school technologies that we have all come to       rely upon.    Madam Speaker, just reading quickly from the op-ed as  to why we are doing this:   ``Significant space weather events occur every decade or so with far- reaching and destructive consequences. A powerful solar storm in 1989  cut off power to millions of Canadians, and major storms in 2003  affected more than half of the Earth-orbiting spacecraft. Just 3 years  ago, solar flares caused radio blackouts for hours during critical  emergency response efforts to approaching hurricanes in the Caribbean  and nearby regions.   ``A solar superstorm poses even greater risks. The so-called  Carrington Event in 1859, which ignited fires in telegraph offices,  would have catastrophic impacts on today's society, potentially  resulting in widespread damage to power grids, communication networks,  and other technologies.''   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for  supporting this legislation and for both sides of the Capitol. We have  been working on it for a long time. There has been a lot of serious  interest in this piece of legislation because of the potential for  damage that a space weather event can have.   As I said before, we have worked together on the Committee on  Science, Space and Technology and the Senate Committee on Commerce,  Science, and Transportation to advance this bill for almost 5 years.   Each iteration of the bill brought new perspectives and new ideas,  and we worked across two administrations. We put all that work together  into the bill before us today, and I, again, thank the Members and  staff who helped make this possible.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all my colleagues to vote ``aye'' on this  space weather bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from New Jersey.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4990, which I am proud  to cosponsor. This is a bipartisan bill introduced by my Science,  Space, and Technology Committee colleagues, Representatives Sherrill  and Anthony Gonzalez.   Technology in elections is necessary to provide convenience, speed,  accuracy, and accessibility. However, our country needs to modernize  this technology from time to time to ensure security, privacy,  reliability, and transparency.   For the past 20 years, the Help America Vote Act of 2002 was  instrumental in the development of voluntary voting system guidelines  and the advancement of voting technologies to improve the security and  integrity of our elections. Unfortunately, the law has not kept pace  with the rapid advances in technology.                                time  1315    H.R. 4990 authorizes activities and makes investments at the National  Institute of Standards and Technology and the National Science  Foundation to support research to help secure and modernize our  election systems. This legislation also supports critical standards  development work carried out by NIST in collaboration with the Election  Assistance Commission to improve the cybersecurity, privacy,  reliability, and interoperability of voting systems technologies.   Voting is one of our most cherished rights as Americans, and without  sacrificing security, we must make it as easy as possible for all  voters to cast their ballots this year and every year.   I thank my colleagues, Representative Mikie Sherrill and  Representative Gonzalez, for their bipartisan leadership on this bill.   H.R. 4990 will help improve the security of our elections, and I urge  all my colleagues to vote ``aye.''
