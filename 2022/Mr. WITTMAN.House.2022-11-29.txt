 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague Mr. Scott for yielding  and join him in our condolences in the passing of Donald McEachin. I  would like to thank our colleagues today for joining us in this  remembrance.   Donald was indeed an incredible leader. He was a dedicated father, a  dedicated husband, and he loved serving others. He truly was passionate  about his job. He was passionate about the people of the Fourth  District.   I got to know Donald actually from our years when we were young, when  we were in high school. We were in rival high schools in Richmond. I  met him in passing there and got to serve with him in the Virginia  General Assembly.   What an individual, a person of integrity, a person of passion,  dedicated to the people that he served. He loved being a legislator. He  loved solving problems for people. He loved interacting with people. He  loved the whole idea of giving of himself and putting others first.  That truly was what Donald was about. I know we all dealt with him  through the years, and he was a person of the utmost integrity and the  utmost passion. He really wanted to get things done.   While there were political differences among the different members of  our Virginia delegation, for Donald it was always about getting things  done, and you could always depend that Donald would be very thoughtful  and forthright with you. He was looking for solutions to problems. That  is what legislating is about. Donald was indeed the quintessential  public servant, the quintessential leader, an example for all of us in  the Virginia delegation.   It is with a heavy heart today that we mourn his passing, but let's  all remember his legacy, his legacy of service, what he has done to  uplift all of us, to make us all better as Members of this legislative  body.                            ____________________
