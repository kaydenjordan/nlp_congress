 Mr. Speaker, much like America's great comeback that  President Trump described at his State of the Union message last night,  this past Sunday, my team, the Kansas City Chiefs, had a miracle  comeback victory in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl LIV.   After 50 years, the Chiefs are once again Super Bowl champions. As a  born-and-raised Chiefs fan, watching them win the title was a dream  come true.   Of course, we all saw the game, but just before it started something  happened that you may have missed. During the singing of the national  anthem, just past the end zone, my mentor and friend, 96-year-old  Senator Bob Dole, who was seriously wounded during his service in World  War II, insisted on standing up out of his wheelchair during the  performance. And with a little help, that is exactly what he did.   In an age when people can't even agree in honoring our flag, it is  powerful to see one of our Nation's greatest heroes from our Greatest  Generation continue to show us the way.   Thank you, Senator Dole, for your patriotism and love of country.   And congratulations to my Super Bowl champions, the Kansas City  Chiefs.                           Chaos at the Iowa Caucus     Mr. Speaker, on Monday, we all saw the Iowa caucus and  the chaos that Democrats are offering--chaos, along with higher taxes  and Medicare for all that takes away the insurance that you get at your  job.   As Senate Majority Leader McConnell said yesterday, these same  Democrats who want to take over everyone's healthcare and micromanage  the entire economy couldn't even organize their own traditional Iowa  caucuses.   Contrast this to last night at the State of the Union message when  President Trump talked about the strongest economy of our lifetimes,  including record job and wage growth. We saw how the President wants to  bring us together to deliver even more results, more trade deals for  Kansas, and a safer, more secure America. You can count on me that I  will be standing beside him to help deliver those results.   The Democrats offer chaos, higher taxes, and poverty. President Trump  and the Republicans offer prosperity, hope, and security.     Creating a Program Within the VA to Give Veterans Access to Service                                    Dogs     Mr. Speaker, tonight the House will vote to pass the  PAWS for Veterans Therapy Act, which will create a program within the  VA to give veterans access to treatment by working with service dogs.   Midwest Battle Buddies is an organization based in Kansas that works  with veterans who are suffering from PTSD or other service-related  issues. The veterans are paired with a dog and attend weekly sessions  to train the dogs. Once the training is completed, the dogs become  their service dogs.   According to Chip Neumann, president of the organization, therapy  dogs provide veterans unconditional love. They do not judge their  owners when they have breakdowns from stress or external triggers and  can react and intervene if the veteran is having an episode and can  often prevent them from spiraling out of control.   There is just something wonderful about dogs, as we all know.   The training sessions also act as mini therapy sessions, as veterans  realize they are with others dealing with the same issues.   Midwest Battle Buddies has seen the possible impact service dog  therapy can have for our cherished veterans.   I look forward to passing the PAWS for Veterans Therapy Act to extend  access to service dog therapy throughout the VA, to provide the best  treatment for America's veterans.                            ____________________
