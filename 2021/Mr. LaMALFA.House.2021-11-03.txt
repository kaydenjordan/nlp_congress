 Madam Speaker, one of the many concerning provisions in  the Democrat's reconciliation bill is nationalization of our elementary  schools.   The new childcare provisions drastically expand Federal oversight of  schools, allowing the Biden administration to determine the education  standards for three- to four-year-olds, and places no limit on what  additional requirements Democrats can impose upon each States' primary  education system.   This bill also delegitimizes family and faith-based education, by  limiting funded preschool options to only facilities which teach  curriculum that the Biden administration approves of.   The Secretary of Education recently told Congress that parents were  not ``the primary stakeholder'' in ``determining educational  programming.'' Really? This means Democrats believe government knows  better than what parents think is right for their children.   Allowing the nationalization of elementary schools will further  politicize what our kids are being taught, such as divisive ideologies,  like critical race theory, or exposed to very inappropriate  instructional materials that I can't speak of here.   Madam Speaker, I cannot support a bill that would hand over more of  our powers to the government, in an era where too many freedoms have  already been relinquished.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I appreciate the time and effort by my  colleague from Illinois (Mrs. Miller), for leading the charge on this.   So what are we looking at here? Parents, their kids, they have the  perfect right to know what is going on in the schools and what the kids  will be subject to during those seven or so hours per day that we  entrust that system with our kids. Indeed, this is a covenant we have  had for many, many years.   Parents and families with the school system, with the government,  that they are going to do the things and teach our kids and treat our  kids in a way that we approve as parents during those hours a day in  those formative years, all those hours they have together that they are  not under our direct watch or supervision.   So what is this all about? The direction it is going right now is  indeed very disturbing. As we saw last night just across the river over  in Virginia, an issue has been brought to a head by two different  Governor candidates, and a lot of people going before that, to express  their views in a First Amendment fashion to their school boards that  they elect to do the job for them.   Over here in Virginia we saw a real ground swell of things that we  will be seeing a lot more of across this country. Indeed, we are seeing  it in my own district at home. People saying no to what is being forced  upon them in my own State by our Governor and a lot of health systems  on the vaccine mandate for vaccines that are really unproven still for  kids.   In information that I saw today, it says the down-sized vaccine for  5- to 11-year-olds probably doesn't really prevent anything, but it  just may lessen their symptoms if they get the virus. Well, maybe  parents would like to opt out of that. Maybe that is not something that  is good enough for their kids given the offsetting possible risks. It  comes back to: Whose kids are they?   Going back to simpler and earlier times when the first settlers of  this country came across and were settling in the West, and as the  first roughnecks and those went and set up mining and cattle and  settling in the West. Settling this Nation. They would then send for  people to operate their schools as they got married and started  families. A lot of one-room schoolhouses. I know that is not what we  have right now, and, oh, he is getting all nostalgic and all that  stuff. No.   Could you imagine that those pioneers would put up with the idea that  you are not allowed to know what is going on in your school. You are  not allowed to know the curriculum. You are not allowed to know what  school activities are going on, or the medical or health issues that  your kids are going through. Can you imagine that back then? Can you  imagine those pioneers, those settlers, those early colonials, even  just 50 years ago, can you imagine they would put up with that?   We have been lulled to sleep by allowing the system to do what it  does. Well, people are speaking out, they are fighting back, and  saying, no, we are not putting up with this anymore because the  education system has gotten away from them.   We have seen it. We saw it at the school board meetings in Virginia,  and we see it all over the country. I am seeing it my district in  northern California. They are going to these meetings and demanding to  know what it is you are teaching them.   As my colleague, Representative Miller, mentioned a little bit ago,  it is amazing to watch when the parents--which really takes some guts-- stand up publicly and read back to the board some of the content that  they are finding in the books that are in the library or even in direct  curriculum, with the explicit sexual nature of what is being said and  taught to kids at a very young age.                                time  1800    It is outrageous, and it makes everybody in the audience  uncomfortable, what is being read off there. My hat is off to those  moms and dads who are standing there in public reading these pretty  ugly things to the board so they have to face it and so they have to  deal with it.   That is putting the spotlight on what this is for many, many people  around the country. It is getting people off the sidelines and out of  their busy lives. I know it is tough. A lot of families have to do two  jobs because of high taxes and all the other demands on them these  days, but we have to come off the sidelines.   We are seeing more and more people making different choices for their  kids in schools such as charter schools and private schools, whatever  it is, because they want the best for their kid.   When you see a homeschool family, a charter school family, or private  school parents doing that, they are extra dedicated because they have  to make an extra sacrifice to make sure their kids are getting a good  education.   And what do we get in this society here of public education?   They make fun of those people. They say: Oh, those kids are awkward,  and they don't fit in.   They are some of the best-educated kids you have, Madam Speaker, and  they are the ones who are moving forward to be in leadership versus the  ones who are not given a school choice to break out of a bad situation.   Especially in our urban areas, wouldn't these inner-city families  like to have choices sometimes to alternative education instead of the  same thing from the same old standards?   So we are seeing people pushing back, fighting back, and demanding to  be heard because your children do not belong to the government. They do  not belong to the school system. They belong to you, given to you by  God, and they are your responsibility.   So you have every right to have your voice heard, not to be called a  terrorist and not to be monitored by the FBI or the Attorney General  whose family might be making money off of this or somebody else.   You have every right to speak out. So do not be cowered by the left,  by the media, and by the big school system that is trying to cower you  into not being a part of it.   You move forward, and you be strong. You demand to know and demand to  ask better for your children because they are yours. They do not belong  to the government or any education system that is supposed to be  working for all of us.   So I appreciate this Special Order hour tonight.
