 Mr. Speaker, this week, House Republicans are  moving forward with the polluters over people act.   The polluters over people act does nothing to lower energy costs for  everyday American families and will increase our deficit by $2.4  billion. Let me repeat that. It will increase the deficit by $2.4  billion.   This bill will eliminate bedrock environmental protections,  safeguarding public health, and keeping our air and water clean,  leaving Americans with higher energy costs.   Instead of tackling climate change, extreme MAGA Republicans are  focused on undoing our historic clean energy plan, which has already  created 100,000 jobs.   We need more energy production across the board.   Oil and gas workers in my district know that energy jobs can mean a  real shot at the American Dream for working families. We shouldn't have  to choose between dirty air and polluted water to meet the energy needs  of the future.   I see the consequences of pollution within my own district in Houston  as we rank eighth in the country for the highest ozone levels.   Neighbors in and around my district face respiratory problems, heart  disease, and other health issues caused by exposure to air pollution  and smog.   Constituents in my nearby neighborhoods suffer the most, often living  in the shadows of these polluting industries.   Houston is not alone. Across the country, we see the impacts of  pollution on public health. We have a responsibility to reduce  pollution. Clean air is a public health issue. We need to do more to  help our communities.   That is why I am fighting for strong, robust funding for clean air  programs and air monitoring in my district.   Instead of keeping our families and communities safe, House  Republicans are making it easier for big companies to pollute without  consequences.   While House Republicans play games and raise the deficit, House  Democrats will do everything to continue to put people over politics-- not polluters--every day to meet the real needs of the American people  because everyone deserves a good job with benefits and a shot at the  American Dream without giving up their right to breathe clean air.   It is our duty and responsibility to protect our God-given right to  clean air for ourselves and for our future generations.   We cannot afford to wait any longer.                            ____________________
