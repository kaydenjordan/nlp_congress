 Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 140, Protecting  Speech from Government Interference Act.   I thank Chairman Comer for his leadership and work to bring this  issue to the floor, and I appreciate the hard work of the House  Oversight Committee.   As promised, House Republicans have already opened the transparency  floodgates, shedding light on a slew of this administration's failures  and oversteps in their position of power, working against the American  people.   Because of this work, the House Oversight Committee has deduced that  Federal officials have been using their influence and position of  authority to censor Americans on social media platforms.   This is a blatant threat to every single American's First Amendment  rights, Mr. Chair. The Federal Government should not be able to nitpick  what speech is or isn't allowed in this country or limit citizens from  freely voicing their opinions, which includes on social media  platforms.   Our government, Mr. Chair, and, indeed, our Constitution were created  to protect those freedoms, not suppress them.   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill and prohibit  Federal employees from using their authority to influence and censor  the lawful freedom of speech.
