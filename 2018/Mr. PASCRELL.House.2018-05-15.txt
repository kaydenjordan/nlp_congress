 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Texas for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I want to associate myself with the words of Scott  Taylor, the Congressman from Virginia.   This is National Police Week. I would like to see the passage of H.  Res. 285.   As a lead Democratic sponsor of this legislation and co-chair of the  Congressional Law Enforcement Caucus, I know the importance of  enhancing and improving communication and collaboration between members  of the law enforcement community and the public they serve.   Thousands of law enforcement officers and their families have  traveled to Washington, D.C., this week to pay tribute to those who  made the ultimate sacrifice. While we give thanks every day to the men  and women serving and protecting our communities, this week is a  perfect opportunity, Mr. Speaker, to show America's law enforcement  that we have their back here in the Congress of the United States and  around the country.   Every day our Nation's law enforcement officers put their lives on  the line to protect our families, our friends, our children, our  neighbors, and our communities. The brave men and women who wear the  badge understand the dangers of their job, but they heed the call to  serve and willingly face those risks in order to create safe  communities for all of us.   Tragically, 360 names will be added to the National Law Enforcement  Officers Memorial here in Washington, D.C., this year; 129 of those  lost their lives in the line of duty last year. Every name added heard  the call to protect and serve and made the ultimate sacrifice, leaving  behind family, friends, brothers and sisters in arms, and their  communities.                                time  1630    As we remember and pay tribute for their ultimate sacrifice, we  acknowledge the dangers inherent in the job our law enforcement  officers do every day.   This resolution before us recognizes the bravery and sacrifices of  the men and women in blue. It recognizes that we must do more to  enhance and improve communication and collaboration between members of  the law enforcement community and the public they serve.   It is my hope that during this Police Week, we can come together to  honor the sacrifices made by law enforcement.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the other lead sponsors, including Congressman  Scott Taylor,  Tom O'Halleran, and the Republican co-chair of the Law  Enforcement Caucus,  David Reichert. Fourteen years we have been co- chairs. We are going to miss him when he leaves us.  [[Page H3945]]    Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Goodlatte for bringing this resolution  to the floor, and I ask for a big vote on H. Res. 285.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this  bipartisan piece of legislation, the Justice Served Act, H.R. 4854. As  the lead Democrat sponsor of this piece of legislation and co-chair of  the Congressional Law Enforcement Caucus, I want to thank Judge Carter  for authoring this bill.   Currently, funding is available through the Debbie Smith Act to  reduce the DNA rape kit backlog. However, these funds do not address  the growing backlog in the prosecution pipeline.   Unfortunately, this backlog is occurring because resources are  limited and there are not enough funds to reopen every case, even when  DNA analysis has identified a suspect. That is not acceptable.   In my home State of New Jersey, we are well familiar with this issue.  Due to a lack of resources and regulations, the extent of the untested  rape kit backlog in New Jersey is unknown. That itself is unacceptable.   Addressing the rape kit backlog would bring justice for the many rape  victims across our State and many others; victims like a 15-year-old  girl who was assaulted while working at a deli in New Jersey a few  years ago, and whose assaulter was finally brought to justice in 2013  using DNA evidence, but only after he assaulted another young woman.   As a result, many of the rapists going undetected are repeat  offenders. Countless assaults could be prevented and trauma spared if  we caught these perpetrators the first time.   And addressing the backlog can bring justice to the falsely accused  as well. Last year, we learned the story of Rodney Roberts, a New  Jersey man who was coerced by his own lawyer to plead guilty for the  kidnapping and rape of a 17-year-old girl in 1996, despite professing  his innocence.   For 10 years, Roberts appealed to have his DNA tested against the  original rape kit, but prosecutors claimed it was nowhere to be found.   Eventually, the rape kit was located and the DNA evidence cleared him  of all wrongdoing in 2014, after he served 10 years in jail.   There are too many incidents in which an untested rape kit is lost,  prosecutors do not have resources, and innocent people are harmed.   To address this funding gap, the Justice Served Act authorizes the  Debbie Smith Act to provide prosecutors with the resources and the  funds to reopen, investigate, and close cold cases.   Going forward, I look forward to working with Judge Carter to ensure  that the Debbie Smith Act is properly funded so we can keep our promise  to survivors of sexual assault.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the National District Attorneys  Association, the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, and Debbie  Smith for their support for H.R. 4854.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the Justice Served Act.
