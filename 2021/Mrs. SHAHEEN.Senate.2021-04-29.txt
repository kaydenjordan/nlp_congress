 Mr. President, I call up amendment 1461, and I want to  thank Senators Collins, Gillibrand, King, Rounds, and Peters for  cosponsoring this amendment and also thank Chairman Carper and Ranking  Member Capito for their support for the amendment.   As we all know, you can't put a price on safe drinking water, but for  too many communities and too many households in this country, costs are  a real barrier to contamination.   This bipartisan amendment will help States address pollution not just  from regulated contaminants like arsenic but also from unregulated  contaminants like PFAS. It does this by expanding an existing grant  program to help small and disadvantaged communities, not just those  defined as underserved. It would also help households with private  wells.   We have to provide more tools to ensure that all Americans have  access to clean, safe drinking water. My amendment would do just that.  I urge its adoption, and I would be very happy to have this done by  voice vote.    Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of  Senate amendment No. 1461, which I have offered to expand a key program  that helps address contaminated drinking water. But before I do, I  would like to commend Senator Duckworth, Chairman Carper, and Ranking  Member Capito for developing the bipartisan legislation currently  before the Senate, the Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure  Act. This bipartisan bill will invest more than $35 billion for water  infrastructure across the country. This can't come soon enough for  States like New Hampshire.   Like most States, New Hampshire is suffering from aging  infrastructure, much of it is between 50-100 years old. And  unfortunately, our State government and municipalities simply do not  have the ability to fully fund the hundreds of millions of dollars  needed to address the rising costs of failing infrastructure,  population growth, and changes in regulation. Communities across the  country are facing similar financial challenges.   That is why Congress must pass sweeping legislation to tackle our  Nation's water infrastructure problems, build climate-resilient  systems, and ensure that all Americans have access to clean and safe  water. The Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act is a good  first step, and I look forward to working with my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to do more.   The amendment I am offering today with Senators Collins, Gillibrand,  King, Rounds, and Peters will help more people impacted by drinking  water contaminants, including those who rely on wells. While America's  drinking water is among the safest in the world, unregulated  contaminants, such as PFAS, are increasingly being detected in drinking  water across the country. This is a problem in particular for New  Hampshire's southern cities and towns, including Merrimack,  Londonderry, Portsmouth, and Dover.   It is not just unregulated contaminants. Pollutants and known  carcinogens like arsenic, radon, iron, and manganese have been found in  New Hampshire groundwater sources at levels that threaten public  health. According to the New Hampshire Department of Environmental  Services, approximately 98,000 Granite Staters who utilize private  wells have unsafe levels of arsenic in their water.   As I have heard again and again, discovering that you have been  drinking contaminated water can produce a range of emotions, from anger  and fear to guilt. It is heartbreaking to hear stories of parents  worried about what their kids' exposure will mean for their health. I  am committed to finding every opportunity to improve this situation.  That is why I am proposing to expand a key part of the Environmental  Protection Agency's Assistance for Small and Disadvantaged Communities  Program to help States respond to water contamination in more places.   I want to make clear that States have flexibility to support a range  of projects to address contaminants including in underground sources of  drinking water, which will help households relying on well water. In  New Hampshire, a little over half of our population gets its drinking  water from public water systems that provide water from lakes, rivers,  and wells. The remainder get their water from residential wells. All of  them deserve healthy and safe drinking water. My amendment will help do  just that. And I urge my colleagues to support it.   As I said at the outset, this bill we have before us today is a good  step in addressing our water infrastructure needs, but there is more to  be done. For instance, Congress must address outstanding issues  affecting water infrastructure financing. The 2017 tax law repealed a  longstanding incentive under section 118 of the Internal Revenue Code  known as the Contributions in Aid of Construction exemption, or CIAC.  Communities across New Hampshire have been planning projects for years  that are now threatened by these tax changes. For example, the  Hampstead Area Water Company reports that it is facing a $1.5 million  tax bill on an infrastructure project aimed at providing more customers  access to clean drinking water. And what is worse, these tax increase  may be passed on to utility customers, increasing their water bills.  That is why I have filed an amendment to undo these harmful changes, so  that our Tax Code once again encourages these critical investments. I  look forward to working with my colleagues to fix this.   We must also provide increased support for water systems in small  rural communities across the country that are struggling as a result of  this pandemic. The financial impacts of COVID-19 on systems serving  10,000 people or fewer is estimated to be at least $3.6 billion. Yet no  support for small rural water and wastewater systems has been included  in COVID relief legislation to date. That is why I have joined with  Senator Tillis to introduce the Emergency Assistance for Rural Water  Systems Act, legislation that would provide critical funding to small  and rural communities during this challenging time.   Finally, we must address PFAS contamination and its effects on our  communities. As many of us know, PFAS chemicals impact drinking water  sources in and around military bases, manufacturing sites, airports,  and other places across the country due to their widespread use in  firefighting foam and consumer products. In my State of New Hampshire,  the city of Portsmouth closed a major water supply well at the former  Pease Air Force Base due to PFAS in the drinking water. And several  communities in southern New Hampshire are struggling with groundwater  PFAS contamination near the Saint-Gobain plant in Merrimack. Residents  near the Coakley Landfill Superfund site in North Hampton and Greenland  are concerned about high levels of PFAS found in nearby surface waters.   We owe it to the American families in New Hampshire and across the  country who live and work near sites contaminated by these materials to  invest at the scale necessary to fix the problem. That is why I have  championed legislation, the PFAS Testing and Treatment Act, which would  deliver robust Federal resources to support State efforts to address  PFAS through remediation and clean up. I hope to work with the chairman  and ranking member, as well as House and Senate leaders, to move this  proposal forward.   Access to safe, clean drinking water is essential. While I am only  seeking a vote on amendment No. 1461 today, I will continue to work on  all of these issues. I look forward to passage of the Drinking Water  and Wastewater Infrastructure Act and continuing to work to address  these outstanding issues in future infrastructure bills.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1461
