 Mr. President, I begin by thanking Senator Paul. He has  shown a lot of courage for standing and exposing the hypocrisy of the  Republican budget resolution.   Year after year, we have heard from our Republican colleagues that  the United States is going broke, that we have huge deficits, that we  have a $19 trillion national debt, that we have to cut Social Security,  we have to cut Medicare, we have to cut Medicaid, we have to cut  funding for education, we have to deal with the deficit.   As Senator Paul has indicated, if the Republican budget resolution  passes, the Federal deficit would more than double over the next  decade, going from $571 billion this year to over $1.3 trillion 10  years from now.   I hope all of the deficit hawks on the Republican side hear what  Senator Paul has to say and support him.   I will not support him because I understand that the cuts that he is  proposing are devastating to working families, to the elderly, to the  children, to the sick, and to the poor. They would mean massive cuts in  Medicare, Medicaid, Federal aid to education, and a variety of programs  people desperately need, so I will oppose the amendment.   All of my Republican friends who talk about the deficit year after  year, here is a vote you should cast.   Thank you.
