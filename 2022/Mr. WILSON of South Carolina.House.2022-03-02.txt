 Mr. Speaker, the State of the Union  last night was a disconnect from the reality of Biden failures. The  Wall Street Journal is correct. He missed the moment.   The paper went further to describe what Biden did not say: More  defense spending to meet the threats from autocrats? No. A new  appreciation of the contribution of fossil fuels to American and  European security? Not a word. A note that government spending  contributed to the highest inflation rate in 40 years? Nope.   I personally was disappointed that there was no mention of leaving  Americans behind in Afghanistan, 13 patriots murdered in Kabul. And now  Afghanistan is a safe haven for terrorists who can come across the open  border to attack American families.   An anxious world is looking for American leadership in a dangerous  new era. I hope the President will change course for peace through  strength.   In conclusion, God bless Ukraine. God save Ukraine. Long live  President Volodymyr Zelensky.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank Mr.   Mike  Johnson for his leadership and courage to present the truth tonight.   Madam Speaker, last Friday, I was grateful as the ranking member of  the U.S. delegation to the Organization for Security and Co-operation  in Europe to address the Parliamentary Assembly in Vienna, Austria. Our  delegation was ably led by co-chair Steve Cohen.         The bipartisan United States delegation of Democrats and       Republicans, being transatlantic with our valued European and       Indo-Pacific allies have been unintentionally united about       Putin's war of mass murder in Ukraine, violating the       principles of the Helsinki Final Act.        This emphasizes the devastating human cost of Putin's war       against the families of Ukraine, isolating Russia and Belarus       from the modern world.        This is Putin's war, as correctly identified by Der       Spiegel, the German news magazine. It is not a war in       Ukraine. It is not Russia's war. This is clearly to be       forever condemned as Putin's war. The responsibility of an       insane czar who is trying to build his power based on oil,       money, and power, betraying young Russians to death.        OSCE monitors have impartially relayed the tragic reality       of this conflict every day under often difficult and       dangerous conditions. The Putin government and its proxies       must restore the monitors' ability to fulfill their mandate.        I am personally grateful to have visited Russia a number of       times where I was so impressed by the talented citizens who       today who are being betrayed by Putin in his obsession for       oil, money, and power.        Two months ago, I visited Kyiv, and it is horrifying to       know of the attacks.    The pictures that we see here--they have been sent worldwide--this is  the road to the airport. I was so impressed when I was there in  December to see the four, six, eight, now ten lanes of boulevards  filled with cars, a very modern society with high rise buildings that  could be anywhere in America, could be anywhere in the world, in the  modern world.   Now, sadly, we see that the cars are congested there and blocked. You  have families. They have their pets with them. They have all the  property that they could possibly carry. They have children. They have  infants. They have elderly and sick persons and are trying to flee the  rocket attacks solely the responsibility of Putin.         Sadly, in Belarus, dictator Lukashenko has become a puppet       of Putin to subject Belarusians to autocracy, facilitating       Putin's illegal war on the people of Ukraine.        It is inspiring that the legal president of Belarus,       Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, would have her first loyalty to the       people of Belarus, not to the war criminal, Putin.    In conclusion, God bless Ukraine. God save Ukraine. Long live  President Volodymyr Zelensky. God bless America.
