 Mr. Speaker, yesterday we grieved for 59  Americans who were killed watching a concert and 527 people who were  injured as bullets rained down on them. As horrible as it is, it is  only an inflection point on the daily loss of life to gun violence.   We have had our grisly House ritual of expressing our heartfelt  grief, followed by a moment of silence, but the moments have extended  into years.   Families at home did not send us here for our thoughts and prayers.  No one in this Chamber was elected to tackle our country's challenges  with moments of silence.   We were elected to work together, to debate, to argue, even fight  tooth and nail about the problems Americans are facing and what we can  do to help, but that is not what we are doing here.   Even after the massacre of children and now the worst massacre by  guns in American history, our Republican leaders continue to block  debate on commonsense gun safety legislation that is  [[Page H7681]]  backed by Americans across the spectrum of political ideology.   Now we have had our moment of silence, so it is back to business as  usual: Members of Congress who call a mass shooting evil and turn  around and take cash from the gun lobby.   The leadership of this House is so enamored with silence that one of  the only policies that they will talk about is silencing guns. Why  would you endanger our police officers and families by remaining silent  on solutions to reduce gun violence and promote a bill that deregulates  silencers? There is only one explanation, and that is that the  monstrous roar of the gun lobby is drowning out the voices of families,  it is drowning out compassion, and it is drowning out common sense.   Many say there is nothing to be done. There is a falsehood that any  commonsense solution will lead directly to Americans losing their guns  and their Second Amendment rights. This is as pernicious as it is  cowardly. This is the United States Congress. Americans think that we  are strong enough to have this debate on reducing gun violence. Why  don't we?   Don't shrug off the loss of life. Don't be complicit in the daily  carnage of gun violence.   Mr. Speaker, it is time for each of us to stand up, to do our jobs,  to come together and debate solutions, and to bring them to a vote.  American families are counting on us, and they are watching.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, today I rise for Emilia.  This is her story:   Eighteen years ago, Emilia was pregnant with her second child. She  was happily married, financially secure, and eager to welcome a new  baby into her family. After Emilia's baby was diagnosed with Down  syndrome, she was even more determined to raise her baby with love and  compassion.   Imagine her devastation when, after a 20-week ultrasound, the baby  was diagnosed with fetal hydrops and a battery of tests revealed her  baby would not survive to term. Emilia made a wrenching decision to  terminate her pregnancy rather than have her baby suffer.   Emilia's hospital didn't provide abortion services, so she went to  Boston and had to pass through a wall of picketers that told her she  was a murderer.   In the waiting room, she realized every other patient had the same  story: no one was carrying a healthy baby. Every woman there was  experiencing profound loss.   Under a 20-week ban, none of these moms can make a decision for their  families with their doctors. We would make that decision for them in  Congress.   On behalf of Emilia, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 36.  We must stop the ban.
