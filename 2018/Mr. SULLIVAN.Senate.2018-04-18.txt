 Mr. President, I want to say a few words--I know a  number of my colleagues have--before I start my discussion on the very  important Coast Guard bill we are debating on the floor.  [[Page S2231]]    America lost a wonderful example of a strong woman, Mrs. Barbara  Bush, yesterday. I think the entire country and I know the whole Senate  sends its prayers and condolences to the Bush family.   If you want an example of an American citizen who represents  strength, dignity, and class, and who really served our Nation so well,  it was Barbara Bush. The thoughts and prayers of the Senate are with  the Bush family right now.                        Coast Guard Authorization Bill    Mr. President, as the Presiding Officer who sits on the Armed  Services Committee with me knows, each year this body, the Congress-- House and Senate--passes the Defense Authorization Act or the NDAA as  it is called. It is an important bill. It moves forward the policies  and authorizations of spending for the men and women serving in the  military. It can be contentious, but at the end of the day for over a  half century we have moved that bill forward each year.   We always forget one of the branches of the U.S. military--the men  and women who serve in the Coast Guard of the United States of America.  We don't always move the Coast Guard Authorization Act forward. That is  not because they are not as important as the other Members of the  military. In some ways, it is just a twist of the organization here in  Congress. The Coast Guard is under the jurisdiction of the Commerce  Committee not the Armed Services Committee and is under the executive  branch jurisdiction of the Department of Homeland Security, not the  Pentagon. It is still an incredibly important organization for all of  us, and so today we are going to vote on the Coast Guard Authorization  Act, that we should be moving every year just like we move the NDAA  because the men and women who serve in the Coast Guard are some of  America's finest citizens.   I see my colleague from Mississippi, Senator Wicker, joining me on  the floor. We have been working on this bill, the Coast Guard  Authorization Act, for about 1 year now. We faced a lot of roadblocks,  and we have moved forward on a bipartisan basis to finally get this  important bill to the floor.   As the chairman of the subcommittee in charge of the Coast Guard, I  feel it is very important to take a minute on the Senate floor to speak  about what the men and women in our Coast Guard do on a daily basis so  everybody, the people watching back home and the people in my State,  the great State of Alaska, know just how important the Coast Guard is  and how we are focusing on them.   Many people in the country know the Coast Guard as the heroic  Americans who literally come out of the sky to rescue us when we are in  trouble, particularly on the high seas. I have heard them described as  angels in helicopters with courage and dignity and strength. When they  show up, it is certainly America witnessing its very best.    Let me give just a few examples of what the Coast Guard does on a  daily basis--certainly in my State. Here are a few examples from just  the past few weeks:   In Oregon, a Coast Guard aircrew rescued four commercial fishermen  after their 54-foot fishing vessel capsized off the coast of Rockaway  Beach.   In Kauai, HI, the Coast Guard is assisting in recovery efforts  following a storm dropping more than 27 inches of rain, causing severe  flooding.   On Sunday, the Coast Guard rescued four people from the water in  Blackwater Sound near Key Largo, FL, and they rescued eight people  aboard a disabled vessel just a few days ago near Pensacola Bay Bridge,  FL.   In New York, the Coast Guard crew just medevacked a 25-year-old man  from a fishing vessel.   In my great State of Alaska, the Coast Guard is vital. Alaska has  more coastline than the rest of the country combined. Think about that.  Just in the past few weeks, there have been numerous rescues, as there  typically are in Alaska given our tough weather, including a 44-year- old man from a fishing vessel outside of Dutch Harbor, a 59-year-old  man from the waters off the Aleutian chain, and another 43-year-old man  who was stranded on the barrier islands--just in the last couple of  weeks.   Every one of these individuals--Americans--is alive today because of  the Coast Guard. They are someone's father, brother, mother, daughter.  They are someone's loved ones, and the men and women of the U.S. Coast  Guard had the courage to go out and rescue them.   All in all, in addition to numerous humanitarian and law enforcement  operations, including drug interdictions and coming to the rescue of  hundreds of migrants who were on overcrowded and unsafe vessels, the  Coast Guard is working 24/7 for us, 365 days a year. Their mission also  includes icebreaking, marine and environmental protection, port  security, international crisis response--the response to hurricanes  that so many Americans saw over the last several months--and readiness  to support Department of Defense operations, as they are the fifth  branch of the U.S. military. Sometimes we forget that.   So this bill that we are debating right now and that we are going to  be voting on in a little bit here on the Senate floor is the bill that  sets the policies, the spending authorization, and the readiness  standards for the entire U.S. Coast Guard. It is enormously important,  and I believe it should pass in a bipartisan way--the way it passed out  of the Commerce Committee--with a strong vote from Senators,  Republicans and Democrats, on both sides of the aisle.   The Coast Guard Authorization Act also contains many important items  for our fishermen, fisheries, maritime industries, maritime unions, and  maritime workers. Let me give some important examples.   Included in this legislation is language to permanently fix issues  that have plagued our fishermen and our commercial vessel owners and  operators in the maritime industry and the workers in that industry for  decades. We have an opportunity here to make good policy--again,  bipartisan policy--that we have been debating for years in the  Congress.   Currently, our fishing fleets and vessel owners and operators are  forced to comply with a patchwork of burdensome Federal and State  regulations for ballast water and incidental discharges.   Let me start by talking about the incidental discharges. If you are a  commercial fisherman on a vessel and you catch some fish and you want  to hose off your deck because you have fish parts where you may have  gutted and headed fish--let's face it, the fishing industry can be a  bit messy--under current law, believe it or not, you have to get  permission from the EPA to do this. You need a permit, and if you don't  have one, you can face a fine. OK, think about that. You have taken a  fish out of the water. You have processed it. You are hosing down your  deck. It has some fish guts on it. For the fish parts to go back into  the ocean, you need a permit. Yes, everybody in the country thinks this  is ridiculous, and it is. It creates inefficiencies, adds business  costs, inhibits economic prosperity in States like mine, certainly, and  it kills jobs.   Most fishermen--most fishing vessels--are small business owners. They  are the ultimate small business owners. They take risks. They work  hard. They create and produce a great product, such as wild Alaska  salmon. Yet we are regulating them with these kinds of inefficient  regulations that nobody supports. It is just another burden that we put  on the men and women who are actually trying to make a living and  create economic opportunities for others. So this bill, which has  strong bipartisan support, does away with that because it makes no  sense.    Another provision in this bill tries to cut through a patchwork of  burdensome State regulations for vessel ballast water. Currently,  ballast water is regulated under both the Coast Guard and the EPA--dual  regulations. That is trouble enough. They each have separate and  inconsistent and sometimes directly conflicting sets of Federal  requirements, and then you layer on State requirements too.   Let me give an example. You are a commercial vessel owner/operator  going up the full length of the Mississippi River. Right now, not only  must you comply with the inconsistent Coast Guard and EPA requirements,  but you also have to comply with different and separate requirements  from Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas. Again,  it makes no sense. There are 25 States regulating  [[Page S2232]]  ballast water under separate, inconsistent, and often directly  conflicting sets of requirements. This cripples not only the American  economy but also the hard-working men and women of our country who work  in the maritime industry.   By the way, it makes it more likely that invasive species--a very  real and serious issue--will accidentally be introduced because there  is such a conflicting patchwork of regulations. I am very aware of the  invasive species issues that plague different States. There are a lot  of concerns we have heard, and certainly we have addressed it in this  bill--from the Great Lakes.   If the current patchwork system worked, well, I think a number of us  would be supportive, but it simply doesn't work. It is not working at  all, and it is only getting worse. This confusing array of requirements  will only continue to grow, confusing vessel owners and operators and  their workers and making it literally almost impossible to comply. The  EPA says one thing, the Coast Guard says another thing, and 25  different States say 25 different other things.   One person who knows this issue very well is the current Commandant  of the Coast Guard, Admiral Zukunft. Just yesterday, he told the House  Appropriations Committee that ``it makes sense to have one entity''  regulating vessels--at very high standards but one entity. ``I really  put myself in the shoes of a mariner,'' he said, talking about how  difficult it is with the current system. ``Competing entities doing the  enforcement operations'' is not working. He said that the Coast Guard  understands the issue best, understands the mariners, and also,  importantly, understands the technology.   Even the EPA has said that the rules developed by the Coast Guard,  which knows this issue best, will work for them because our bill  requires concurrence with the EPA. Under the legislation that we are  debating right now in the Senate, you cannot set a standard unless the  EPA concurs, which is important. They essentially have a veto over  this, but they know that the Agency that is best suited to regulate  moving vessels on the water is not their Agency--the professional staff  of the EPA have said that--it is the Coast Guard, which is where we put  the regulatory authority in this bill.   Further, under the bill, States have the authority to enforce the  Federal regulations regarding ballast water and incidental discharge.  So the States still have a lot of power and authority on the  enforcement side in this bill.   This confusing patchwork of regulations only diminishes the overall  effectiveness of U.S. efforts to meet the high environmental standards  that we all want. We need strong, uniform, national standards to keep  our waters clean and to defend against invasive species, and we also  need these standards so the workers and the people in this industry--a  huge industry for America--can go and do their job.   The good news here is that we have been working on this issue for at  least the past 3 years that I have been in the Senate, but we have  really been working on it for decades. For the most part, we have had  strong bipartisan support to get this bill done. Let me give some  examples.   There are 23 Members from both sides of the aisle who have  cosponsored these vessel incidental discharge provisions that I am  talking about--23 cosponsors. Many more signed on to a letter of  support for this, Democrats and Republicans.   This bill has been voted out of committee several times. It has  strong bipartisan support--including when the Democrats were in control  of the Senate a couple years ago. We all worked diligently to make sure  we addressed all the issues and concerns raised by many Members, and we  even got some longtime opponents to come over and support this bill,  again through the great work of my colleague from Mississippi. Let me  give another example of that.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  a letter of support from a very broad-based group of unions, workers,  small businesses, maritime operators, and fishermen.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                     April 16, 2018.        Dear Senator: We are writing to express our strong support       for Title VIII of S. 1129, the Coast Guard Authorization Act       of 2017, the bipartisan Vessel Incidental Discharge Act       (VIDA). Our organizations represent U.S. and international       vessel owners and operators; fishing vessel, passenger vessel       and charterboat operators; labor unions; marine terminals and       port authorities national business organizations; and       industries that rely on maritime shipping to transport       essential cargoes in domestic and international commerce.        VIDA is the product of bipartisan leadership and       negotiation to construct a framework that will protect our       waterways, foster efficient and cost-effective maritime       commerce, and maintain appropriate roles for the Coast Guard,       EPA and states. It is imperative that this legislation be       enacted without further delay. We respectfully urge you to       support the motion to proceed, cloture and final passage of       S.1129.        VIDA, which currently has 24 bipartisan Senate cosponsors       and 37 bipartisan House cosponsors, would eliminate a       regulatory burden hindering interstate and international       commerce by replacing a patchwork of federal and state       regulations with uniform national standards for the       regulation of ballast water and other discharges incidental       to normal vessel operations. The bill would also maintain       protective measures jointly undertaken by industry and       federal agencies to reduce the movement of invasive species       on the navigable waterways.        Without VIDA, commercial vessel owners will spend millions       of dollars installing onboard equipment to comply with Coast       Guard and EPA requirements, but still be at risk of fines and       penalties for violating state requirements that cannot be met       by existing technology. This overlapping patchwork of federal       and state regulations kills jobs, undermines the efficiency       of maritime transportation, increases business costs, and       places mariners at risk of civil and criminal prosecution. It       also delays investments in treatment technology that will       strengthen environmental protection.        VIDA would provide vessel owners and mariners with a       predictable and transparent regulatory structure in which       vessel incidental discharges are regulated and enforced by       the U.S. Coast Guard, using as its baseline the ballast water       discharge standard that EPA's Science Advisory Board has       determined to be the most stringent currently achievable. The       bill will ensure the installation of high-performing       technologies on commercial vessels, and allows for       improvements in the national standard as technology improves.       VIDA also preserves the ability of states to enforce the       federal ballast water discharge standard, petition for a       higher standard, work with Coast Guard to develop best       management practices, and regulate recreational vessels       operating in their waters.        VIDA will also permanently exempt fishing vessels and       vessels under 79 feet from EPA's National Pollutant Discharge       Elimination System permit program. These vessels have been       operating under a series of temporary exemptions enacted by       Congress. Permanent relief is needed for the operators of       these vessels, as long-term regulatory certainty is needed       for the operators of large commercial vessels.        VIDA will strengthen protections for America's waterways,       provide a stable regulatory structure for interstate and       international maritime commerce, and eliminate needlessly       duplicative regulatory programs. Please support passage of       the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2017.

Mr. President, I won't go into it. I have seen a lot of  these kinds of letters supporting legislation, but I have rarely seen a  letter that is pages and pages long--steelworkers, International Union  of Operating Engineers, Juneau Charter Boat Operators Association,  International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, Eastern  Lake Erie Charterboat Association. This letter supporting the Coast  Guard bill has many different groups supporting it, and that is why  there has been so much strong bipartisan support.    Mr. President, I will be glad to yield.    That is correct.    That is correct.   We actually made literally dozens of changes over the last several  months  [[Page S2234]]  to accommodate almost every single Senator that had requested a change  to address some of their issues. We have made numerous changes to this  bill, for Republicans and Democrats, to make sure we have strong  bipartisan support, and we are certainly hoping that the changes we  made for so many Senators who have been supportive of the bill will now  lead a strong bipartisan vote here in a little bit.    They have not only expressed strong support but have  cosponsored this legislation.    I thank the Senator from Mississippi for his very kind  words. This has been a team effort. We have been working together.  Democrats have been working with us. My colleagues from Florida, from  Pennsylvania--we have all been down here talking about this. I know  there are going to be strong votes in favor.   I do want to mention that the minority leader was just on the floor,  and he ended his remarks that he just made a couple of minutes ago  about how it is really important for the Senate to get back to  bipartisan accomplishments that help the American worker. He just said  that. Well, my colleague from New York, I couldn't agree more. That is  what this bill is.   I am going to mention one other thing before I actually do my  presiding time. I appreciate the Presiding Officer giving me a few  additional minutes before I get in the Chair.   We have been dealing with this issue. Some have raised the issue that  they are concerned about what the vessel incidental discharge  provisions in this bill that I just talked about could do to the  environment. I am from the great State of Alaska. We have the most  pristine, beautiful environment in the world, and the cleanest water in  the world. We want to keep it that way. I am all about that.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this document be  submitted in the Record called ``The Vessel Incidental Discharge Act:  Good for the Environment--Good for Business.''   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  The Vessel Incidental Discharge Act: Good for the Environment--Good for                                  Business         The Vessel Incidental Discharge Act, or ``VIDA,'' would       require the Coast Guard and the EPA to establish uniform,       national standards for the treatment and management of       ballast water and other discharges incidental to the normal       operation of vessels. Treatment of ballast water is an       important safeguard against the introduction of aquatic       invasive species. The bill would establish an initial ballast       water treatment standard equivalent to the Coast Guard and       EPA's current standards--the most stringent standard current       technology can achieve. For incidental discharges other than       ballast water (such as deck runoff, anchor effluent, etc),       the bill would require the establishment of best management       practices within two years of the date of enactment of the       Act.                              MYTHS VERSUS FACTS         Myth #1: The bill lowers the environmental standards for       ballast water.        FACT: The new standards and requirements would be required       to be based upon the best available technology economically       achievable (BATEA), and would ramp up over time as new, more       advanced technology becomes available. Specifically, the bill       incorporates the Clean Water Act's BATEA regulatory regime to       establish its uniform standards and revise them to be more       stringent over time.        Myth #2: The current regulatory regime works.        FACT: Today, the Coast Guard, EPA, and 25 states are       regulating ballast water under separate, inconsistent, and       sometimes directly conflicting sets of requirements. This not       only cripples the American economy, but also makes it more       likely that invasive species will accidentally be introduced.        Myth #3: The EPA has the expertise to enforce ballast water       standards.        FACT: The Coast Guard is the United States' premier       maritime law enforcement service. It currently enforces       ballast water standards through vessel inspections, not the       EPA. However, the service cannot do a thorough and robust job       because of the current patchwork and contradictory regulatory       regime. This bill gives the Coast Guard the clarity and       authority it needs to do a good job.        Myth #4: There is no science behind the new national       standards.        FACT: This bill sets a current federal ballast water       discharge standard, which the EPA's Science Advisory Board       deemed the most stringent currently achievable. Moreover,       when ramping up those standards, the Coast Guard, in       consultation with the EPA, will set the new standard based on       sound science and the best available technology economically       achievable.        Myth #5: The bill undermines a States' ability to regulate       ballast water.        FACT: The bill ensures that States will be able to enforce       Federal requirements and, importantly, that States will be       able to set future standards and best practices though an       exhaustive petitioning process.        As an example, both the Coast Guard and EPA require a       ballast water management system (BWMS) aboard a vessel       covered by their regulations. On the one hand, the Coast       Guard's regulations generally require that a BWMS be type-      approved by the Coast Guard. In the case of a manufacturer       whose BWMS has been approved by a foreign regulatory       authority pursuant to Convention standards, that manufacturer       may request a Coast Guard determination that its BWMS       qualifies as an Alternate Management System (AMS). On the       other hand, the EPA's Vessel General Permit (VGP) requires       only that a BWMS ``has been shown to be effective by testing       conducted by an independent third party laboratory, test       facility or test organization.'' Although a BWMS approved by       the Coast Guard is deemed by the VGP to comply with its       effectiveness requirement, a BWMS may also be tested and       found effective under the VGP by another ``laboratory, test       facility, or test organization,'' even though it has not been       approved by the Coast Guard. Thus a BWMS could end up being       installed on a vessel in compliance with the VGP, yet not       comply with Coast Guard regulations.        On top of this duplicative, inconsistent, and confusing       Federal regime, subjecting vessels to NPDES has opened the       door for States to establish their own varying standards and       requirements for vessel discharges. California, Michigan,       Minnesota, Ohio, Oregon, and Washington are among those that       already have promulgated their own ballast water management       requirements that also apply to commercial vessels navigating       in State waters. In 2006, the State of California enacted a       ballast water treatment standard at the recommendation of the       California State Lands Commission (CSLC) that requires less       than 0.01 living organisms measuring between 10 and 50       micrometers per milliliter of ballast water discharged (1000       times the IMO D-2 standard) and requires zero detectable       living organisms greater than 50 micrometers per milliliter       of ballast water discharged. However, the State has continued       to delay implementation of its requirement that vessel owner/      operators install BWMS that meet these standards because no       BWMS are available that meet California's treatment       standards. In the CSLC staff's words: More specifically,       shipboard ballast water treatment systems cannot be       considered available to meet the California performance       standards because: 1) no ballast water treatment system has       demonstrated efficacy for all of the California performance       standards based on the best available data, 2) there are no       suitable methods/technology to analyze ballast water samples       to determine treatment system efficacy for some of the       California performance standards, and 3) a lack of sampling/      compliance protocols precludes the ability of the Commission       to make a conclusive determination about the availability of       shipboard ballast water treatment systems to meet the       California performance standards.        In all, 25 States have certified the VGP subject to       additional requirements The compliance challenges posed by       this situation are staggering. As an example, a commercial       vessel owner/operator transiting the full length of the       Mississippi River is required to comply not only with       applicable Coast Guard requirements under NANPCA/NISA and the       EPA's VGP requirements, but also with varying additional VGP       permit requirements imposed by the States of Minnesota,       Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, and Arkansas. This       confusing array of requirements  [[Page S2235]]       will only continue to grow, confusing vessel owner/operators       seeking in good faith to comply, confounding law enforcement       authorities, unnecessarily impeding maritime commerce, and,       most importantly, diminishing the overall effectiveness of       U.S. efforts to combat aquatic invasive species. Strong,       uniform national standards are necessary to effectively       defend against invasive species brought to the United States       in ballast water. The Vessel Incidental Discharge Act would       require the Secretary of the department in which the Coast       Guard is operating (Secretary), in consultation with the       Administrator of the EPA (Administrator), to establish and       implement enforceable, uniform, national standards and       requirements for the regulation of ballast water discharges       and other discharges incidental to the normal operation of       vessels. The new standards and requirements would be required       to be based upon the best available technology economically       achievable, and would generally supersede the current jumble       of Federal and State incidental discharge requirements.       However, States would retain authority to enforce the new       requirements in their waters.--Minority Staff, Senate       Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.     This document has myths versus facts on what people are  saying that this bill could do, and then it gives you the facts. I am  not going to read each one, but if we have to have a debate on it, I  certainly will read each one. It is really important to see this wasn't  created by Senator Wicker or me. If you look at the author of this, it  was the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation--our  committee--written by the minority staff. What does that mean?   This is a Democratic staff under the minority and the Ranking Member  on the committee saying that all the things you are hearing about how  this is going to be bad are not true. Those are myths. These are the  facts. These are our Democratic colleagues rebutting some of the people  now looking to maybe not vote for this.   I ask all of my colleagues who are on the fence to take a look at  this really well-produced myths-versus-facts sheet that was produced by  our Democratic colleagues on the Commerce Committee because, again, it  goes to what Senator Wicker was talking about--that this is a very  strong bipartisan bill that we have been working on for months or  really years. This has passed out of committee, I think, six different  times with strong bipartisan support, including when the Democrats were  chairing the committee.   I want to say to all of my colleagues that it is not just what is in  this bill on the VIDA provision, or the discharge provision.   The bill is about the Coast Guard, the men and women serving in the  Coast Guard. Every year, as I mentioned, we pass the NDAA, which is  great--Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines--but we always forget about the  Coast Guard, and we shouldn't be doing that. They are heroic young men  and women. We can send a bipartisan signal today that we care about  them. We are recognizing the heroic work you do for this country and  the lives you save every day. We have your back.   I urge all of my colleagues, particularly my colleagues who know this  issue, who have voted for this bill to come out of committee many  times--there are well over 60 of us--to vote yes on this important bill  when it comes to the floor in a few minutes.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President. I would like to say a few words about a  [[Page S2259]]  former member of my staff, Mike Fleagle, who has recently left my  office and, unfortunately for Alaska, accepted a job in Colorado.   Mike was one of the very first people to join my team when I took  office in 2014. I lured Mike away from his great job as the facilities  maintenance supervisor for Alaska's largest city and was honored that  he wanted to join me in serving our fellow Alaskans.   When you meet Mike, it doesn't take long to see the thoughtfulness  and kindness by which he lives his life and treats others. He has a  can-do attitude and an incredible knowledge base for so many important  issues for Alaskans: aviation, rural affairs, transportation, energy,  and subsistence. He brought to our office a trove of knowledge about  hunting and fishing that he obtained in his 14 years of experience as  chairman and member of Alaska's Board of Game and the Federal  Subsistence Board, in addition to being a lifelong outdoorsman.   Mike was a true pleasure to have on the team. He loves Alaska and  that always showed in the excellent quality of his work. Mike loves to  hunt, fish, and hike, and he loves his family and is a devoted husband  and father.   We will miss Mike very much, and I am very grateful for the time he  spent in my office helping Alaskans.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about  Kate O'Connor, a former member of my staff who recently left to pursue  another opportunity in public service.   She is now working at the National Telecommunications and Information  Administration, where she will continue her focus on telecommunications  and information policy.   Kate was one of the first staffers I hired after being sworn in to  the Senate in January 2015.   She started as a legislative correspondent and was integral in  establishing and managing our constituent correspondence system. Her  talent, work ethic, and interest in Alaska elevated her to a  legislative assistant, where she oversaw issues related to the  Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, as well as education  and healthcare.   Kate understood firsthand the unique challenges Alaska faces,  particularly in regard to broadband deployment and reliable internet  access. She played a critical role in helping to usher an Alaska  specific plan through the FCC, a plan that will help bridge the digital  divide by bringing more advanced broadband services to rural Alaska.   It was during her time at the University of Chicago, where she was  pursuing a bachelor's of arts in public policy from the university,  when she ventured north to my great State of Alaska for an internship  in Juneau.   She fell in love with my State, as so many people do, and I am  confident that she will go on to be a great ambassador for Alaska.   Kate's positive attitude, her work ethic, and her love for Alaska  will definitely be missed. I wish her all the best.                            ____________________
