 Mr. President, there is an error in the way this bill  is drafted. There are a lot of entities that want to be able to engage  in the process of working against recidivism and make sure we can  actually help those individuals who are in our prisons go through the  process. Some of those are faith-based groups. The definition that is  in this bill would preclude a lot of faith-based groups from being  engaged. We want to open this up to everyone.   The Trinity Lutheran case in the Supreme Court said that the  government should be neutral to any entity, whether they are secular or  sacred, that the government treats them all the same. This is not about  proselytizing; this is about allowing groups that want to engage and  serve those in the prison populations and work against recidivism in  the future to do that. This technical correction allows that, and I  think it is a wise thing to do.   I thank the sponsors for allowing this to go forward and for this  correction to be made.   I am glad to yield back.
