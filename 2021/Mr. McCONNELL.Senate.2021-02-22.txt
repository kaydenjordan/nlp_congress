 Madam President, families across Kentucky are  recovering from a week of punishing winter weather. As many as 154,000  Kentuckians lost heat and power, particularly across the eastern parts  of the Commonwealth. Treacherous road conditions and fallen power lines  made it a challenge to get help to those in need. Over the weekend, we  learned that multiple lives were tragically lost in the aftermath of  these storms, but as they always do, Kentuckians sprang into action.   Electric co-op linemen, first responders, and the Kentucky National  Guard worked around the clock to clear debris and to restore power.  Crews set up warming shelters and performed countless wellness checks.  Churches, local businesses, and citizens distributed food, blankets,  and other supplies.   So we are grateful for those who joined the response to help their  neighbors and to help them stay safe.   Unfortunately, while temperatures are climbing above freezing,  thousands remain without power. My staff and I continue to stay in  close contact with local and State officials. Along with the rest of  the Kentucky delegation, we are focused and ready to help in the  recovery.    Mr. President, for nearly 50 years, Steve Gilmore has  been making his mark on the city of Ashland. As an educator, a parks  commissioner, and finally as a mayor, his contributions to northeastern  Kentucky have shaped a legacy anyone could be proud of. Today, I would  like to recognize this incredible public servant and wish him well as  he begins a richly deserved retirement.   Steve got his start in public service at 29 as a member of the local  parks board. In the following years, he led the renewal of Ashland's  public spaces, pushed for the repainting of its iconic bridges, and  helped champion a major renovation of the riverfront. In 1978,  [[Page S761]]  Steve made his first run for the city commission. Time and again, the  people of Ashland put their trust in him. In 2002, Steve became the  city's mayor. He made history soon after as the first Ashland mayoral  candidate ever to run unopposed.   I would like to mention one of Steve's accomplishments in particular.  Over the years, Ashland has taken tremendous advantage of its geography  and scenic beauty on the banks of the Ohio River. I had the opportunity  to work with Steve about a decade ago to revitalize downtown Ashland  and to make a dramatic investment into its river heritage. With more  than $10 million in Federal funding I brought to the project, Steve and  his team created an impressive new venue right on the water. Now, the  Veterans Riverfront Park is a center for recreation and entertainment  across the region. I am especially proud of their decision to dedicate  the park to the men and women who sacrificed to protect our country.   Steve ended his first stretch as mayor with remarkable success. Then,  he took on a new challenge as superintendent of Ashland Schools. He  accepted the responsibility to keep making a difference for his city  not just today, but for years into the future. Thousands of students  and graduates continue to benefit from his leadership.   When it came time to close the book on his career as an educator,  Steve knew he had more to give to his beloved city. In 2016, he was  reelected to the mayor's office. With a team of city commissioners and  devoted public servants, Steve began once again steering the community  toward growth. He continued renovating the face of Ashland and making  it a destination for visitors and employers.   Steve plans for a retirement filled with spending more time with his  family doing the things they love. Perhaps he will take a few more  trips down to the river along the newly dedicated ``Steve Gilmore  Way.'' He has certainly earned it. On behalf of the Senate, I would  like to express my thanks to Steve for his decades of service and  leadership in Kentucky.                            ____________________
