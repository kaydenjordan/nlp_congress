 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 619, the COVID-19 Origins Act  of 2023. Along with my colleague, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Turner),  I plan to support this legislation, and I urge the House to pass it.  Let me stop now to compliment Chairman Turner on the efforts he has  made narrowly to bring this bill to the floor, but more generally, to  make sure that the Intelligence Committee operates in the thoughtful,  constructive, and bipartisan manner which it must operate in if we are  to protect this Nation's national security.   The COVID-19 pandemic has taken the lives of more than 1.1 million  Americans, and millions more have died worldwide. The American people  want to know as much as we can determine about where this pandemic  started and critically how we can be ready for the next deadly disease,  which will come.   Determining the precise origins of a pandemic disease with high  confidence is challenging under the best of circumstances. In this  case, our already difficult task is that much harder because COVID  originated in China.   At every juncture, the PRC Government has obfuscated and obstructed  legitimate inquiries and investigations into the origins of the  disease. China's approach has been deeply irresponsible and dangerous  to global public health.   It is against that backdrop that in 2021 President Biden ordered a  90-day sprint by the intelligence community to analyze the origins of  the virus. In  [[Page H1256]]  August of 2021, the IC completed its initial work, and a few months  later, a declassified version of its findings was made public.   In short, the intelligence community agencies could not come to an  agreement on whether the virus originated from a lab accident or from  natural exposure. Some individual agencies did reach a judgment--a  narrow judgment--about which path was more likely, but they could not  do so with high confidence simply because we don't have enough reliable  information to draw those conclusions. There is a version of the IC's  classified assessment that is available to all Members through the  House Security Office.   Around 18 months after the completion of the IC assessment, not much  has changed. The intelligence community remains focused on this  question, and I hope that we will have a breakthrough that will allow  us to answer these questions once and for all, but today we are not  there yet.   I believe that the IC should make as much public as they can,  consistent with the overriding need to protect sources and methods.  Transparency is a critical element of our democracy. The factual  grounding of the IC's analysis can be an antidote to the speculation,  the rumor, and the theories that grow in the absence of good  information.    It is important to note that the bill provides the authority to make  redactions to protect sources and methods for a good reason, and  neither the chairman nor I would be supporting the bill if that were  not true. I trust the intelligence community and the administration  will lean forward in making public as much new information as possible  without endangering our ability to collect and analyze on these issues  going forward.   Now, I would mention two important things before I recognize other  speakers on my side:   First, the pandemic, which is really what is at stake here. Whether  COVID-19 originated from a lab leak or natural transmission at a wet  market, the next pandemic disease could originate from either source,  and it could come from anywhere.   In 2022, the Intelligence Committee released a declassified report  looking at how the intelligence community responded to COVID-19 and  made recommendations for how we can be better prepared for the next  pandemic disease, wherever it may come from.   Overall, the report recommended that the intelligence community  increase resources for global health security and medical intelligence,  and that it needs to move away from a culture that views health  security as a lesser priority than so-called traditional hard national  security threats; evidence the fact that it was this that killed over a  million Americans.   Furthermore, we need to promote complementary efforts between the  public health and intelligence communities. Public health professionals  and their counterparts in the IC must work hand-in-hand if we want to  maximize the odds of identifying a novel disease at the earliest  possible stage and if we want to give ourselves the best chance of  determining the novel disease's origins.   Let me turn briefly to another important thing that is really at  stake here. Madam Speaker, democracy is rooted in the idea that the  people govern, that it is their right to determine their own political  destiny. With that right comes an obligation that we don't talk about  or think about nearly enough, and that obligation is to be thoughtful,  informed critical thinkers about the issues of the day.   That is not who we are today. Today, we have elevated--because of our  political polarization, we have elevated confirmation bias to a secular  religion. Even in this conversation about the origins of the  coronavirus, what you believe is indicative of where you stand on the  political spectrum.   For reasons I don't understand, some of our colleagues and many  Americans are running around with a theory that somehow buttresses  their political legitimacy. Maybe you do that with UFOs, maybe you want  to believe that there are aliens at Roswell or whatever you want to  believe; that is pretty harmless. But when we are talking about a  pandemic or something as serious as a disease that could kill a million  Americans, that is not okay, and we have to remember our obligation to  be thoughtful critical thinkers. We cannot let our political hopes  override the obligations we have to be thinkers.   Madam Speaker, I tell my colleagues, the chairman and I have seen all  of the classified information on this, and we don't know--we don't know  the origins of the COVID pandemic. Whatever is ultimately declassified,  I would hope that my colleagues and the American people would approach  that information with the intellectual humility that we need to  approach something as serious as a pandemic and how we behave as  citizens in democracy.   We don't know.   We need to think about whether we want confirmation bias. Our  tendency to select just those facts which support our preexisting  positions interfere with our duty as critical thinkers in a democracy.   At the end of the day, the American people will get the system of  government that they deserve, and if we don't get back to being humble  about what we know to being critical thinkers, our democracy will be at  risk.   I close with a quote from a great Connecticut writer and humorist,  Mark Twain. He said: ``It ain't what you don't know that gets you into  trouble. It is what you know for sure that just ain't so.''   I am going to join my chairman in supporting this bill, and I hope it  passes in overwhelming bipartisan fashion. I hope we take that  information and use it for constructive purposes in the service of  saving lives and buttressing our democracy.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Bera), a member of the Select Committee on the  Coronavirus Pandemic.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, we were doing pretty well there, but behind the  discussion of ducks were some pretty aggressive accusations of lying of  American Government officials, dishonesty, attributions of motives,  which is really what I am and I think what we are all trying to avoid  here.                                time  0945    I will say it again. As profoundly frustrating as it is, we just  don't know. We are entitled to have theories. We are citizens, after  all. We shouldn't be so certain in those theories that we are willing  to impugn the character and motives of other Americans, especially if  those Americans are in positions of responsibility that need to be  trusted in the next pandemic. So I will leave that there.   I do want to characterize and substantiate my rather frustrating  observation that we just don't know--with what the intelligence  community believes is the latest assessment on the origins--again, I  understand this is frustrating, but facts are important.   Here it is, and this is a publicly available document: Four  intelligence community elements and the National Intelligence Council  assess, with low confidence, that the virus was likely caused by  natural exposure to animals infected with it.   One IC element assesses, with moderate confidence, that the first  human infection most likely was the result of a laboratory-associated  incident.   Then analysts at three IC elements remain unable to coalesce around  either explanation.  [[Page H1259]]    That is a profoundly frustrating picture of organizations whose  aggregate budget is tens of billions of dollars, who draw on all kinds  of expertise, and yes, who are fallible, like any human institutions  are. That is where they are and, sadly, that aggregates to, we just  don't know.   We are entitled to speculate. We are entitled to have theories. I  would just urge caution about impugning people's motives, impugning  their character based on those theories which are necessarily rooted in  uncertainty.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I will reiterate my support for this bill and my gratitude to the  chairman and the Republican majority for moving it quickly.   This bill, fundamentally, is about something we haven't talked a lot  about today, which is transparency. Transparency is a cornerstone of  our democracy because without transparency, the American people can't  make the decisions that they need to make responsibly as citizens of a  democracy.   I am sorry that today we heard a little bit of accusations that the  truth was hidden from the American people; that taxpayer funds were  misused; that Dr. Fauci had a motive to cover himself; that there was  government censorship. There is not one iota of evidence for any of  that.   When we say those things without evidence, what we do is we reduce  the American people's faith in their government and, eventually, when  their faith in their government is reduced to nothing, we lose our  democracy, or we see people breaking windows downstairs to get into the  government's Chambers because it has been so discredited.   But I am going to set that aside right now because this is an  important, bipartisan effort to bring transparency around something  that is going to be pretty frustrating for the American people because  no matter what is declassified, it won't be dispositive about the  origins of the coronavirus.   This is a really important first step. I hope it will clear up some  of the speculation, some of the rumors that are out there; and it is  emblematic of something that the chairman and I care a lot about, which  is, that unless there is a really good reason to keep something  classified, the American people are responsible enough to have that  information.   I thank again Chairman Turner for his work on this issue, for his  commitment to bipartisanship.   Madam Speaker, I urge support from the whole House for S. 619, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
