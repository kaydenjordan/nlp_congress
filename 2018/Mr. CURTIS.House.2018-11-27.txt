 Mr. Speaker, in Utah, wildfires are disastrous events  that don't just cause property damage. They can substantially disrupt  the lives of families and have, unfortunately, become far too common in  the West.   Last month, Mayor Ellis of Elk Ridge reached out to me with a  remarkable story from his community. In September, the Bald Mountain  fire threatened Elk Ridge, nearly claiming countless homes. However,  instead of burning into the sea, the fire suddenly halted, stayed  behind the mountain, and spared the community.   Mayor Ellis told me that after this remarkable event, many locals  began to refer to the peak as ``Miracle Mountain.'' He then asked if we  could commemorate this event by naming the mountain, and I happily took  up the task.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to sponsor legislation, the Miracle Mountain  Designation Act, supported by the entire Utah House delegation and  Governor Herbert to name this mountain ``Miracle Mountain.''   Mr. Speaker, I hope this bill, once passed, will memorialize an event  of great significance in this community.                            ____________________
