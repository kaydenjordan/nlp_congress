 Mr. Speaker, the first week of October marks the  celebration of an organization very near and dear to my parents'  hearts, as well as many friends. It is National 4-H Week. It is a time  to reflect on the importance of youth development and mentoring within  our communities. 4-H was founded to be focused on youth within rural  and agricultural areas. It teaches essential skills and the importance  of community service.   Today, 4-H has evolved into a global network covering over 50  countries. As the Nation's largest youth leadership organization, 4-H  exemplifies the kind of learning, engagement, and leadership that is  needed in our country. Their many programs focus on health, science,  agriculture, and citizenship in a positive mentoring environment. The  experience teaches young people leadership lessons, as well as the  value of practical skills and hands-on learning.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, for the past 25 years, I have had the  privilege of delivering over 5,000 babies. I am absolutely convinced  that babies can feel pain at 14 weeks. At 16 weeks, they can recognize  their mom's voice, their brother's voice, and their sister's voice.   Once or twice a year, I have been in that delivery room and have been  forced to deliver a very premature baby, a 22-week or a 24-week baby.  We are doing everything we can to save the life of that baby, calling  in pediatricians and anesthesia people, doing everything heroically  possible.   How can we live in a world where we are trying to save that baby's  life in one room, and just down the road there are people killing that  baby, tearing it apart limb by limb and decapitating it? What type of a  world do we live in these days? How can both of those situations exist  in this same country?   We have to ban these late-term abortions.
