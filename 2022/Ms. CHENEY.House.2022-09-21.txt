 Madam Speaker, I want to begin by thanking the  gentlewoman from California, Chairwoman Lofgren, for her work on this  bill. The chairwoman and I certainly have our disagreements on issues,  but there is no one I respect more in this body for their diligence,  for their commitment, for their expertise, for their commitment to our  Constitution, to her constituents, and to this country. It has been a  real pleasure working with her, as well as the staff of the House  Administration Committee. I particularly thank my counsel on the  January 6th Select Committee, Joe Maher, for his tremendous work on  this bill.   This bill has benefited from a wide range of input from  constitutional experts, including many conservative constitutional  experts, jurists, and scholars who worked with us on this bill. Their  input has been invaluable.   I also want to praise those in the Senate who have been working hard  on their version of Electoral Count Act reform. Our bill builds on what  they have already put forth.   Commentary from conservatives on our bill has been exceptionally  positive. Here are a few examples.   Judge Luttig, a widely respected conservative legal expert, wrote  that our bill was ``masterfully drafted'' to ensure we never have  another day anything like January 6 and to avert other future efforts  to overturn our Nation's democratic elections.   The Wall Street Journal editorial board offered a range of positive  comments, including explaining that the House bill would make it harder  for ``partisans in Congress who want to get C-Span-famous to lodge  phony electoral college objections'' or for them to raise objections on  the House floor because ``somebody had a funny feeling about the vote  totals in west southeastern Pennsylvania.''   The conservative Cato Institute said this: ``In some respects,'' this  bill is ``more conservative and originalist'' than the existing Senate  bill.   Conservative commentator Quin Hillyer said in the Washington Examiner  that the House bill adds to the work already done by the Senate and  ``fills in almost all gaps with admirable and sensible specificity.''   There are many other examples from conservative commentators, as  well. Madam Speaker, I urge my Republican colleagues to read those  articles and editorials in full.   If your aim is to prevent future efforts to steal elections, I would  respectfully suggest that conservatives should support this bill. If  instead your aim is to leave open the door for elections to be stolen  in the future, you might decide not to support this or any other bill  to address the Electoral Count Act.   January 6, contrary to what my colleague from Illinois just said, was  not ``democracy in action.'' Our oath of office is to support and  defend the Constitution, which provides the method by which we elect  our President. Legal challenges are not improper, but Donald Trump's  refusal to abide by the rulings of the courts certainly was.   In our system of government, elections in the States determine who is  the President. Our bill does not change that. This bill will prevent  Congress from illegally choosing the President itself.   As we detailed in our January 6 hearings, a Federal judge has  reviewed evidence submitted by the January 6th Select Committee and  concluded that former President Trump likely violated two criminal  statutes when he pressured Vice President Pence to reject legitimate  State electoral votes in our joint session. That is what Vice President  Pence called ``un-American.''   In our hearings, we have demonstrated that President Trump knew  specifically that what he was doing was illegal, but he did it anyway.  President Trump's conduct was illegal under the existing Electoral  Count Act, and it would be illegal under this new bill, as well.   Our bill reaffirms what the Constitution and existing law make plain:  The  [[Page H8040]]  Vice President has no authority or discretion to reject official State  electoral slates. It also makes clear that if Members of Congress have  any right to object to electoral slates, those grounds are limited to  the explicit constitutional requirements for candidate and elector  eligibility and the 12th Amendment's explicit requirements for elector  balloting.    Under our system of elections, Governors must transmit lawful  election results to Congress. If they fail to fulfill that duty, our  bill provides that candidates for the Presidency should be able to sue  in Federal court to ensure that Congress receives a State's lawful  certification.   Finally, our bill makes clear that the rules governing an election  cannot be changed retroactively. The Constitution assigns an important  duty to State legislatures to determine the manner in which the States  appoint their electors. This must not be read to allow State  legislators to change the rules retroactively to alter the outcome.    Madam Speaker, this bill will preserve the rule of law  for all future Presidential elections by ensuring that self-interested  politicians cannot steal from the people the guarantee that our  government derives its power from the consent of the governed.   Madam Speaker, I urge passage of this bill.    Madam Speaker, I am struck listening to my colleagues  today on both sides of the aisle. The concept that I think we have to  make sure we never lose sight of is that some things have to matter,  and we, as individuals, determine whether or not our institutions  survive.   We have heard consistently since January 6--actually, in the weeks  just after January 6, we were in agreement. But shortly after that, we  began to  [[Page H8045]]  hear excuses about what had happened. We began to hear people defending  the indefensible.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to recognize that when you defend  the indefensible, slowly but surely, you chip away at the great  foundations of this Republic. You chip away at those very things that  we are sworn to protect.   This bill is an excellent bill. This bill is a bill that will help to  protect the rule of law. This bill is a bill that will help to ensure  that future elections cannot be stolen. This bill will ensure that, in  the future, the United States Congress is very clear that we have a  very limited number of objections that can be made, if any can be made  at all, and those are strictly limited to those outlined in the  Constitution.                                time  1600    This bill is a very important and crucial bill to ensure that what  happened on January 6 never happens again.   It saddens me, Madam Speaker, that my colleagues on this side of the  aisle continue to play politics. I can tell you that is not what we are  doing on the January 6th Committee. My colleagues ought to watch the  hearings on the January 6th Committee. We have been very clear in terms  of putting forward what happened and in terms of putting forth former- President Trump's responsibility and role in every aspect of the attack  that happened that day.   Contrary, again, to the assertions my friend and colleague from  Illinois made previously, what happened on January 6 was not the normal  functioning of our democracy. President Trump had every right to bring  those cases in court, but he did not have the right, and it was a  fundamental violation of his oath of office, to refuse to abide by the  rulings of the court.   Madam Speaker, we are a Nation of laws, not of men. I urge my  colleagues to pass this bill. It is a very good bill.
