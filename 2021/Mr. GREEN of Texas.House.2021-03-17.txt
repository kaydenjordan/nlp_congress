 Madam Speaker, and still I rise. I rise today in  strong support of this legislation because it includes trans women.  Some of the most brutal, horrific crimes created in the minds of people  have been perpetrated upon trans women.   Madam Speaker, this legislation protects them, as it protects all  women. I support it and I encourage my colleagues to do so as well.
