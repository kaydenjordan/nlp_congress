 Mr. Speaker, I rise today during National  Police Week to remember all members of law enforcement who have given  their lives to protect and serve others.   The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial here in Washington,  D.C., displays the names of law enforcement officers who have fallen in  the line of duty, dating back to 1791.   One of the names added this year was Lieutenant Aaron Allan of the  Southport Police Department, the first police officer from the  Department to be killed in the line of duty. When responding to an  overturned vehicle last summer, Lieutenant Allan was shot and killed by  the driver of the vehicle he was trying to assist.   Sadly, we already know an officer who will also be listed in the  memorial next year with Lieutenant Allan's name: Boone County Sheriff's  Deputy Jacob Pickett.   Last night, I joined members of the Indiana Concerns of Police  Survivors, COPS, who are the spouses, children, and parents of fallen  police officers. These people selflessly work to provide resources to  people like them: families who have also experienced the pain of losing  their loved ones in the line of duty. These volunteers help people cope  with tragedy and loss and are incredibly strong and inspiring members  of our communities.   Today, may we honor the valor and commitment of our fallen heroes and  support those who are missing their loved ones.                            ____________________
