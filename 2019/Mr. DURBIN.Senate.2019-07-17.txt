Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday marked the passing of a giant in  American law. Justice John Paul Stevens passed away at the age of 99. I  just bought his most recent book. The subtitle of it is ``My First 94  Years.''   Justice Stevens was a favorite, born and raised in the city of  Chicago. He was a lifelong Cubs fan. He was in the crowd of Wrigley  Field as a very young man in 1932, on October 1, during a World Series  game, when Babe Ruth made the famous called shot--hitting a home run  over the fence.   He attended the University of Chicago and Northwestern School of Law.  Naturally, he graduated at the top of his class. In between, he served  as lieutenant commander of the U.S. Navy during World War II and was  awarded the Bronze Star.   After law school and a clerkship with Supreme Court Justice Wiley  Rutledge, John Paul Stevens became an accomplished attorney in Chicago,  leading to his nomination to the Seventh Circuit in 1970. In 1975, he  was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Gerald Ford and  confirmed by the Senate 98 to 0. Judge Stevens served on the Supreme  Court for nearly 35 years, bringing to the Court his midwestern blend  of brilliance, courtesy, and humility.   He leaves behind an enormous legacy. He was committed to safeguarding  the rights and liberties protected by the Constitution, and he  cherished the importance of the Judiciary as an ``impartial guardian of  the rule of law.'' Those were his words in his famous Bush v. Gore  dissent, where he said that judging of the Court as an ``impartial  guardian of the rule of law'' was at stake in that majority opinion.   He was respectful at all times and respected by his colleagues at all  times, and by litigants, and by the American people.   When he retired in 2010, at the age of 90, he was the third longest  tenured Justice in the history of the Supreme Court. He was the last  living Justice to have served in World War II.   I want to extend my sympathy to Justice Stevens' family, including  his surviving daughters, Elizabeth and Susan, his 9 grandchildren and  13 great-grandchildren.   Today we bid farewell to a giant, and we thank Justice Stevens for  his decades of service to this country and for his profound  contribution to American law.    This opioid epidemic wasn't started by some runaway  virus. They were decisions made by real people to flood America's towns  and streets with ``a blizzard of prescriptions,'' as Richard Sackler of  Purdue Pharma put it in his own words. In fact, the pharmaceutical  industry in the United States produced 14 billion opioid pills in 2016  alone--enough opioid pills for every adult in America to have a 3-week  supply of opioids. Who would approve the production of 14 billion  opioid pills in 1 year, 2016? It turned out it was your government. The  Drug Enforcement Administration of the United States of America is  responsible for determining and basically giving a license for the  production of a specific amount of opioid pills allowed to be  distributed to the market each year.   It is the Drug Enforcement Administration--of all agencies--that  establishes annual production quotas for opioids that are, effectively,  the gatekeepers for pharma. Pharma, of course, wants to produce as much  as possible in order to sell as much as possible. The Drug Enforcement  Administration is supposed to draw the line. Yet, for all of these  years, while we have faced this epidemic, our government--the Drug  Enforcement Administration--has been increasing the production quotas  each year for opioid pills.   Between 1993 and 2015, the Drug Enforcement Administration allowed  the production of oxycodone to increase in America 39 times--from 3\1/ 2\ tons of opioids in 1993 to 151 tons of opioids in 2015. It is the  same story for hydrocodone, which increased twelvefold, and for  fentanyl, which increased twenty-fivefold.   I pressed those in the Drug Enforcement Administration on this issue.  I asked them how they could possibly approve of these ever-increasing  quotas while America faced this epidemic. How did they reconcile their  decision to flood America with these drugs at a time in which they were  being abused and when addiction was leading to death all across our  country?   Last year, I passed bipartisan legislation. I and Senator John  Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, gave those at the Drug  Enforcement Administration more authority to set commonsense production  levels. It is hard to believe we had to do that--to actually bring to  their attention that they were authorizing the production of opioid  pills for an America that was facing the worst opioid epidemic in its  history.   Previously, those at the Drug Enforcement Administration could only  look at what pharma asked for when it determined quotas. In other  words, they believed, officially, that they had statutory blinders by  which they couldn't even consider the impact of pharma's annual request  for production. So Senator Kennedy and I, on a bipartisan basis,  changed the law to require the Drug Enforcement Administration to  consider abuse, overdose deaths, and the impact on public health.   Finally, between 2016 and 2019, the Drug Enforcement Administration  has lowered opioid quotas by an average of 46 percent. No longer can  Big Pharma get away with producing this sheer volume of painkillers.  The Drug Enforcement Administration will soon be proposing its 2020  quotas, and I will soon be sending it a letter and will urge it to use  its new authority, which we put in this new law that I passed with  Senator Kennedy, to continue reining in Big Pharma's insatiable demand.   Think about that. While we are going through this opioid epidemic,  pharma--made up of the people who make the pills--is coming to  Washington, to the Drug Enforcement Administration, and is getting  permission each year to produce billions of opioid pills to be sold in  the United States--enough for every adult American to have a 3-week  opioid prescription.   Incidentally, 2 years ago, the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention sent out a notice to doctors. It read that only in the most  extraordinary cases should one prescribe a drug to last for more than 3  days--only in the most extraordinary cases. Then watch them carefully  because, in a short period of time, addiction begins. Three days?  Pharma was asking for a production of opioid pills so that each adult  American could buy 3 weeks' worth of pills, and the Drug Enforcement  Administration was complicit.   To hold all stakeholders accountable, major legal challenges have  been brought against the pharmaceutical industry for its role in  deceptive promotion and all of the suffering and deaths that have  resulted. Over 1,600 lawsuits from States, counties, cities, and  victims have been consolidated into one Federal case in Cleveland, OH.   This reminds me of another public health scourge we confronted when  Americans suffered the consequences of misleading marketing and false  information about the health risks of tobacco. It took the 1998 Tobacco  Master Settlement Agreement to finally hold major manufacturers of  tobacco responsible for their actions--that of cigarettes that hook  adults and youth to lifetimes of addiction and death.   That settlement was estimated to provide States with $246 billion  over 25 years ago. Sadly, only a tiny fraction of that amount--only 8  percent of the settlement--was actually dedicated to tobacco's  prevention and cessation. Instead, $145 billion from the tobacco  settlement has gone to fill State budgets and pet projects--roads,  bridges, stadiums, even a tobacco museum.   Should today's opioid litigation result in large monetary settlements  from the pharmaceutical companies and their distributors, it will be  essential that this funding be dedicated to legitimate public health  efforts so as to respond to the current epidemic and prevent the next  one.   In the city of Chicago, near an area known as Greektown, there is a  drug rehab facility that I have visited many  [[Page S4885]]  times. It is called Haymarket. It was started many years ago by a  Catholic priest who took on a ministry that nobody else wanted. He was  the one who prowled every night along skid row and helped those who  were addicted to drugs and alcohol turn their lives around. He started  this Haymarket House as a refuge for them in an attempt to get them  some help in escaping their addictions and being rehabbed.   Can you imagine what it is like today?   Today, sadly, he is gone, but they continue the Haymarket House.  Imagine what they face in trying to deal with a combination of  addiction to drugs and alcohol and mental illness on top of it. They  are dramatically understaffed. They don't have the necessary bed space  for people who need a helping hand--for folks who realize they need a  helping hand.   Should there be a successful outcome of this Cleveland lawsuit,  wouldn't it be best if some of the resources would be dedicated to  places just like that all over the United States?   I can tell you, in the city of Chicago, there are many more options  than there are in the more sparsely populated downstate areas from  which I hail. There are some counties in which people wait 6 months-- once they have realized their need for help--for any kind of treatment  whatsoever, and then they have to travel great distances for that to  happen.   Senator Sherrod Brown and I recently wrote an opinion piece that was  published in the Cleveland Plain Dealer. I confess publicly that I hope  those who are party to this lawsuit in Cleveland will read it, which is  where the consolidated court case is taking place. In it, we outlined  what we thought should happen if we were to have any input in a  settlement agreement.   We need to make sure that the money is spent for addiction;  treatment; medication; residential and community treatment services;  mental health counseling, which is a necessary adjunct to this effort;  building on a behavioral health workforce and naloxone distribution;  and addressing childhood trauma, which is often the root of addiction.    Wouldn't it be great if there were to be a settlement here that would  be dedicated to ending this drug epidemic, turning lives around, and  saving people from addiction and death?   The diversion of tobacco's settlement money should be a cautionary  tale that guides our efforts to heal from the opioid epidemic. If Big  Pharma is held to account for fueling this crisis, its restitution  should be devoted to helping our Nation heal.   This chart shows the dramatic increase in the production of two of  the most popular opioid products. I will never be able to explain how  the agency of the U.S. Federal Government, which is dedicated to  protecting us from drug crime and drug addiction, ended up authorizing  these enormous quotas of the production of opioid pills. Yet we know  what happened. In tiny Hardin County in southern Illinois, as well as  on the streets of Chicago, they were flooded with opioid pills. When  the opioid pills became too expensive, they turned to a cheaper  alternative--heroin. Heroin was then being laced with fentanyl, and we  have today this deadly epidemic that is almost out of control.   I can't understand what pharma was thinking except for its just  looking at the profits and the bottom line that would justify the  production of that level of opioid pills into the United States of  America. All I can promise is that a number of us--myself included-- will be holding the Drug Enforcement Administration accountable in  order to make certain that this is not duplicated again in the years to  come.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
