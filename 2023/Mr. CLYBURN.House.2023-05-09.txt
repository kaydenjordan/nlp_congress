 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me  this time.   Mr. Speaker, earlier this evening, we gathered on this floor to  observe a moment of silence. We have been doing that quite a bit over  the last several years, but it seems to me that it is time for us to  take some action on something that is very important to the American  people.   This week, our Nation is collectively mourning the senseless murder  of eight people at the hands of a white supremacist, a neo-Nazi shooter  in Allen, Texas. In the days since, we have heard gut-wrenching stories  of pain and devastation, like 6-year-old William Cho, who lost his  entire family in the massacre, and the deaths of sisters Daniela and  Sofia Mendoza, 11 and 8, who were both in elementary school.   Then there is Steven Spainhouer, an everyday citizen who tried to  administer aid after the tragedy. I watched him on television this  week, and he was very vivid.   If my memory serves, he is a former police officer, and he talked  about how he felt when he turned over a body to remove a child from  underneath its dead mother's body.   This tragedy comes nearly 1 year after the lives of 19 children and 2  teachers were taken in Uvalde, Texas, and just a few weeks before the  8-year anniversary of the mass shooting perpetrated by another white  supremacist at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina.   We have taken some important steps in response to these tragedies. I  have reintroduced my bill to close the deadly Charleston loophole that  allowed the Mother Emanuel AME Church shooter to obtain a gun. Because  of his record, he should not have been able to get a gun.   Because this Congress has refused to close this loophole, which says  if you can't complete the background check in 3 days, irrespective of  your background, irrespective of whether or not you are eligible to  have a gun, if, for any reason, that background check is not completed  in 3 days, you can still get the gun. That is silly.   We have no idea why that young man's information was keyed in wrong.  Did he intentionally give the wrong information, or did West Columbia  get confused with Columbia? They found the problem, but it was too  late. It was more than 3 days. He already had the gun, and nine of my  constituents lost their lives because of that loophole.   We refuse to say we will close it. That makes no sense.    We enacted the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to require enhanced  background checks for people under 21, provide protection for victims  of domestic violence, and institute criminal offenses for Federal and  State straw purchasing and gun trafficking and some significant  investments in mental health treatment.   In a shocking and long-overdue turn of events, Texas Republicans, on  Monday, unexpectedly allowed a bill that would raise the purchase age  for semiautomatic rifles from 18 to 21 to advance out of a Texas House  committee. I am very pleased to see that, but I am wondering what will  happen when that bill gets to the floor.   Raising the age to purchase a gun made for war from 18 to 21, that,  to me, tells it all--to allow a teenager that we would not allow to  walk into a restaurant and order an alcoholic beverage but will be  allowed to purchase a weapon of war.   For all of our progress, more must be done.   There have been over 200 mass shootings this year alone. I think we  all know the definition of a mass shooting is four or more injuries,  irrespective of whether or not they are fatal.   In 2019 and 2020, we didn't reach this grim milestone until late  June. Between 2016 and 2018, the country passed 200 mass shootings in  late July. Two years ago, late June; 2 years before that, late July;  this year, early May. What will it be next year? This epidemic is  growing more and more deadly with each passing year.   My Democratic colleagues understand the weight of these tragedies and  are prepared to advance the legislation needed to protect our  communities.   To our colleagues across the aisle and in the Senate, I say silence  gives consent. For us to remain silent on this issue is to give consent  to these tragedies.   It is not enough to denounce the actions of mass shooters and offer  thoughts and prayers in tweets and on cable news. My colleagues on the  other side's refusal to join House Democrats in advancing serious gun  violence prevention measures signifies that your silence and your  consent represent your feelings.   Legislative actions such as closing the Charleston loophole,  strengthening red flag laws, and getting weapons of war off our streets  would not prohibit law-abiding citizens from purchasing a gun.   For the life of me, I cannot understand why it is that all of us can  readily agree that there should be a limit on the First Amendment of  the United States that protects speech but no limit on the Second  Amendment of the United States Constitution that authorizes the  possession of firearms.   Nobody wants to take anybody's guns away. We are trying to take  measures that will keep guns out of the hands of hateful people like  these white supremacists who are killing people because they don't like  their skin color, people who are mentally ill who have had all kinds of  fantasies that are killing people because we do not have the intestinal  fortitude to put constraints on their abilities to purchase these guns.   These policies, which have broad support among the American people,  would save lives without infringing on anybody's Second Amendment  rights.   Mr. Speaker, I implore my Republican colleagues and the Senate to  join us in taking a stand to protect our communities. This epidemic  will not end until we act.
