 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the rule and the  underlying bills. January 6 was an unprecedented event that exposed the  real threat to the beating heart of our democracy: our Capitol and all  of us who work in it.   Shortly after the insurrection, I expressed the need to form a 9/11- style commission, not only to get to the bottom of this and who was  responsible for it, but also to ensure that it never happens again.  This is exactly what these bills do, Madam Speaker.   The security of our Capitol and our democracy is not a partisan  issue. However, the other side of the aisle has attempted to turn this  into a sideshow, Madam Speaker, into a circus. I submit to you that the  attempted murder of our Vice President, the attempted murder of our  Speaker, and the attempted murder of any one of us is not a sideshow,  it is not a circus, it is a real threat to everyone across this great  land.   Taken together, these two critical bills will help us finally recover  from the January 6 insurrection. We must ensure that these sacred Halls  will never again be overrun by racist thugs against our democracy.
