 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  reauthorizing the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting  Program, known as MIECHV, which the House is expected to consider later  today.   Proudly, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was one of the earliest  adopters of evidence-based State policies and has utilized MIECHV to  aid more than 4,000 families statewide. MIECHV-supported home visiting  programs are widely embraced on both sides of the aisle. The programs  have a proven record of success, and they support the Nation's most  vulnerable families during a critical and crucial time in their  children's development.   Parents truly are the children's first teachers, and the results  speak for themselves. MIECHV helps improve maternal and newborn health.  It reduces child injuries, abuse, and neglect. It improves school  readiness and achievement. It reduces crime and domestic violence. It  improves family economic self-sufficiency.   Mr. Speaker, during the home visiting process, nurses, social  workers, educators, and other trained professionals form relationships  with the expectant parents and visit with them until their child has  completed his or her first year of school. This model of care empowers  parents to make healthy decisions that positively impact their child's  health, well-being, and learning development.   In Pennsylvania, MIECHV's funds support four evidence-based home  visiting models. These include Early Head Start, Healthy Families  America, Nurse-Family Partnership, and Parents as Teachers. MIECHV  funding plays a critical role in helping increase the availability of  these services to more and more families across the Commonwealth of  Pennsylvania.   Scientific research has supported claims that these services  positively impact health, education, and employment outcomes for  children while reducing criminal justice costs, instances of child  abuse, and independence on public assistance.   These services can also play a key role in helping to support infants  and mothers struggling with addiction. Pennsylvania has a long history  of evidence-based home visiting programs because they are a proven way  to strengthen families and improve the lives of children.   For these reasons, I look forward to supporting H.R. 2824, the  Increasing Opportunity and Success for Children and Parents through  Evidence-Based Home Visiting Act, when it comes to the House floor this  afternoon.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to do the same.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, Sunday marked a special  kind of Mother's Day: Gold Star Mother's Day. Since 1936, the Nation  has observed Gold Star Mother's Day on the last Sunday in September.  The President humbly proclaimed Gold Star Mother's and Families' Day  this Sunday, September 24.   Our Gold Star Mothers should be honored and offered respect and  gratitude for their personal sacrifice. Gold Star Mother's Day is  intended to pay tribute to women who have experienced tremendous  personal loss on behalf of our country.   Mr. Speaker, our Gold Star Mothers serve as a strength and  inspiration for this country. They are part of an exclusive group, one  that no one ever hopes to belong to. One can hardly imagine the deep  pain and anguish that a mother experiences when losing a child,  particularly in military action.   May we always honor the Gold Star Mothers of America for their  courage, their strength, and their sacrifice. They bear their cross  with honor. The memory of their children lives on not only in their  hearts, but in the heart of this Nation.                            ____________________
