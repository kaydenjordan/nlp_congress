 Madam Speaker, concerned parents have a God-given right  to make decisions for their child's best interests, not the Federal  Government, the Biden administration, or teachers' unions.   Yet, Education Secretary Cardona colluded with private parties to get  the FBI to investigate concerned parents and worked with the National  School Boards Association to brand the concerned parents involved as  domestic terrorists.  [[Page H230]]    In the infamous letter which the Secretary solicited from the  National School Boards Association, he suggested using the PATRIOT Act  and that the FBI should begin investigating concerned parents at school  board meetings. The letter had nothing to do with curriculum. The topic  was how to vilify and target parents that disagreed with the narrative.   Secretary Cardona has repeatedly denied involvement in the letter,  but recently released documents have exposed the truth. These actions  show a clear pattern that puts politics over the interests of the  parents and especially their children and their education.   Parents are right to be concerned about their kids being taught  radical ideologies or being exposed to inappropriate materials. Every  parent in the Nation, regardless of ideology, should be alarmed that  the Federal Government is trying to strip away their rights and use  these underhanded methods to try to silence them.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. Johnson. I  appreciate this Special Order.   Of course, this week does mark the first year of the Biden  administration. Unfortunately, it was one of unprecedented crisis.  Indeed, it is a target-rich environment for us to talk about here  tonight.   Democrats have controlled the executive branch and both Chambers of  Congress, allowing them to pass, so far, $2 trillion out of their $9  trillion plans. This act has also caused the highest inflation in  decades, hitting the middle-class and lower income class hardest in  this country.   This year, under Democrat leadership, Americans are paying more for  just about everything, from housing, clothes, food, and gas--especially  in energy. On the way to the airport in California, it was $5-plus,  $5.39 at one place. Incredible.   In the dead of winter, people are seeing the cost of heating their  homes skyrocket. When you stop all sorts of development of energy in  this country, you are not going to have the supply. That sends a signal  to the whole market to raise prices, including the Biden administration  telling OPEC overseas to go ahead and send us more while cutting off  our own pipelines and further development on Federal lands. This, of  course, ripples through everything else in costs.   In my real life as a farmer, we are going to see our costs of  energy--whether it is diesel fuel, gasoline, fertilizer--skyrocket.  That is either going to have to be passed along to the consumer at the  store or farmers go broke in this country. Small business owners face  the same thing.   Everything is going up--more in costs, vaccine mandates, less  employees. I mean, I wish we could paint a brighter picture and not  have it appear to be a partisan one. It really isn't partisan. It is  about having success as a country.   Unfortunately, the Biden administration doesn't seem to have a clue  what that success would look like. Indeed, they are chasing their own  mandates, putting us in a terrible position as a people and for the  economy going forward. They need to change their thinking, or the  voters need to change them out.
