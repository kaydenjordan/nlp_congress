 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution  1224, I call up the bill (H.R. 8294) to amend the National  Apprenticeship Act and expand the national apprenticeship system to  include apprenticeships, youth apprenticeships, and pre-apprenticeship  registered under such Act, to promote the furtherance of labor  standards necessary to safeguard the welfare of apprentices, and for  other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 8294, the National  Apprenticeship Act of 2020.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 8294, the National  Apprenticeship Act of 2020.   Our economy continues to permanently lose jobs due to the COVID-19  pandemic. In fact, it is estimated that 7 million of those who lose  jobs during the pandemic will not return to those jobs.   Congress has a responsibility to help workers not only find jobs, but  also prepare them for long-term employment. Expanding the registered  apprenticeship system, our most successful workforce development  initiative, is the proven solution we need.   Each year, hundreds of thousands of workers count on registered  apprenticeships to learn in-demand skills, earn wages that grow along  with those skills, and receive nationally recognized credentials that  lead to rewarding careers. Registered apprenticeships are also so  successful that 94 percent of apprentices are employed upon completion  and earn an average starting wage of more than $70,000 a year.   Despite the growing demand for apprenticeship opportunities, Congress  has not reauthorized the National Apprenticeship Act since it was first  passed in 1937.   The legislation before us will invest $3.5 billion in our  apprenticeship system; ensures consistency and quality across programs;  increases opportunities for diverse groups of workers who have not  traditionally been included; and expands registered apprenticeships in  emerging sectors, such as healthcare, finance, and technology.   This investment alone would create approximately 1 million  apprenticeships, pre-apprenticeships, and youth apprenticeships, and it  would yield roughly $10.6 billion in benefits to taxpayers through  higher tax revenues and decreased spending on social safety net  programs.   Construction trades and their industry partners have long proven that  the registered apprenticeship model works. It is long past time that we  expand registered apprenticeship opportunities to benefit workers  across other industries and across the country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                   Washington, DC, November 5, 2020.      Hon. Robert C. ``Bobby'' Scott,      Chairman, Committee on Education and Labor,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Scott: This is to advise you that the       Committee on the Judiciary has now had an opportunity to       review the provisions in H.R. 8294, the National       Apprenticeship Act of 2020, that fall within our Rule X       jurisdiction. I appreciate your consulting with us on those       provisions. The Judiciary Committee has no objection to your       including them in the bill for consideration on the House       floor, and to expedite that consideration is willing to waive       sequential referral, with the understanding that we do not       thereby waive any future jurisdictional claim over those       provisions or their subject matters.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.            Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Education and Labor,                                   Washington, DC, November 5, 2020.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler: In reference to your letter of       November 5, 2020, I write to confirm our mutual understanding       regarding H.R. 8294, the ``National Apprenticeship Act of       2020.''        I appreciate the Committee on the Judiciary's waiver of       consideration of H.R. 8294 as specified in your letter. I       acknowledge that the waiver was granted only to expedite       floor consideration of H.R. 8294 and does not in any way       waive or diminish the Committee on the Judiciary's       jurisdictional interests over this or similar legislation.        I would be pleased to include our exchange of letters on       this matter in the committee report for H.R. 8294 and in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill       to memorialize our joint understanding.        Again, thank you for your assistance with this matter.            Very truly yours,                                         Robert C. ``Bobby'' Scott,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the House majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Davis), chair of the Subcommittee on  Higher Education and Workforce Investment and the lead sponsor of the  legislation we are considering today.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to  the gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Adams), the chair of the  Subcommittee on Workforce Protections.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds  to the gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Norcross), a graduate of a registered  apprenticeship program himself and a member of the Committee on  Education and Labor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds  to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, could you advise us how much time  is remaining on both sides.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Mrs. Hayes), a member of the Committee on  Education and Labor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Suozzi).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), a senior member of the Committee on  Appropriations.  [[Page H5972]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Wild), a member of the Education and  Labor Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, could you advise how much time is  remaining on both sides.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from the Northern Mariana Islands (Mr. Sablan), who is the chairman of  the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary  Education.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Mrs. Trahan), who is a member of the  Committee on Education and Labor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. McBath), who is a member of the  Committee on Education and Labor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, while I am disappointed that some of my Republican  colleagues now appear to be opposed to some parts of the National  Apprenticeship Act of 2020, I still remain hopeful that we can come  together to pass this critical legislation.   All of us agree that Congress must prioritize investing in  apprenticeship opportunities. That is why the committee members on both  sides of the aisle spent months working in good faith toward a  bipartisan proposal.   The tried-and-true registered apprenticeship programs funded in this  bill provide valuable credentials that are nationally recognized. We  have heard about the new, untried program, the IRAP, industry- recognized apprenticeship programs. Unfortunately, those programs do  not create valuable credentials and are not nationally recognized.   Our work on this is even more important now, considering the  significant work we have to do because of the COVID-19 pandemic.   Mr. Speaker, as we often have a strong voice in support of  apprenticeship programs, the National Apprenticeship Act of 2020 offers  us a real opportunity to actually match our words with action.   Mr. Speaker, I hope that today we can set our politics aside and make  the investment in registered apprenticeships, pre-apprenticeships, and  youth apprenticeships that our economy needs and our workers deserve.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Davis) for  her steadfast leadership on this legislation, and I urge my colleagues  to support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters from the United  Association of Union Plumbers and Pipe Fitters, the National Electrical  Contractors Association, and Third Way in support of the legislation.         We write to urge the strong support and swift passage of       H.R. 8294, the National Apprenticeship Act of 2020. This bill       would protect and expand union apprenticeship opportunities       and codify the Office of Apprenticeship, helping to       strengthen Registered Apprenticeships and protect the more       than 359,000 men and women of the United Association of Union       Plumbers and Pipefitters (UA), and union members everywhere,       from unscrupulous contractors looking to cut corners.        It is no secret that the safest, most highly-skilled, and       most cost-effective workers come from Registered       Apprenticeships like that of the United Association. We are       immensely proud of the robust investments--more than $275       million annually--that the UA makes in training and       apprenticeship programs to ensure our members are the most       highly-trained and most highly-skilled craftspeople in the       world. On the jobsite, that translates to not only fewer       accidents and injuries, but more projects of the highest       standard completed on time and on budget.        H.R. 8294 makes crucial changes to the Registered       Apprenticeship program and sets firm standards for pre-      apprenticeship programs, which have exponentially grown over       the last several years; no longer can exploitative       contractors prop up pre-apprenticeship programs without       having clear and defined pathways into a Registered       Apprenticeship program. Further, H.R. 8294 adds statutory       protections and enshrines the Office of Apprenticeship into       law, which will result in established funding streams that       ensure the necessary oversight of the program and expand       technical assistance to help Registered Apprenticeship       opportunities reach new sectors. In addition, this bill       strengthens the National Advisory Committee on       Apprenticeship, meaning practitioners of Registered       Apprenticeships in both industry and labor are given a voice       to offer recommendations to further strengthen the program.        Our members clearly understand the ramifications of any       proposed changes to our apprenticeship programs and       standards. That is why this bill to reauthorize the National       Apprenticeship Act and codify protections and funding sources       for Registered Apprenticeships is critical for our members.       We urge you to support this bill and ensure that the Building       Trades Registered Apprenticeships remain the Gold Standard of       the construction industry.        As always, feel free to reach out with any questions. The       entire UA stands ready to assist in any way possible.            Best,      Russ Breckenridge,        United Association of Union Plumbers & Pipefitters,       Legislative and Political Affairs.      Calla Brown,        United Association of Union Plumbers & Pipefitters,       Legislative and Political Affairs.                                                National Electrical                                         Contractors Association,                                                  November 17, 2020.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the nearly 4,000-member       companies of the National Electrical Contractors Association       (NECA) and the $171 billion industry that brings power.       light, and communication technology to communities across the       U.S. I write to you in strong support of H.R. 8294, the       ``National Apprenticeship Act of 2020,'' which would work to       strengthen the time-tested apprenticeship model that has       sustained the level of excellence our contractors exhibit.        For over 70 years, our electrical industry apprenticeship       program, a joint labor/management venture between NECA and       the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, has       allowed participants the opportunity to learn a skilled trade       in the electrical industry while receiving fair wages, health       care, and retirement benefits. With the combination of both       on the job training (8,000 hours), classroom learning (900       hours), and remote virtual labs, our apprenticeship model       offers the highest quality instruction at minimal cost to the       apprentice or the Federal Government while producing the       nation's finest electricians.        Even with this model firmly in place, more must be done. As       our nation continues to grapple with the effects of the       ongoing pandemic, our contractors find themselves in       continuous need of more skilled workers to help rebuild this       nation. NECA believes this legislation is a step in the right       direction towards fulfilling this need. H.R. 8294 would work       to bring greater funding to proven program models, expand the       standards approval process, and bridge the gaps between       apprenticeship programs and the secondary/postsecondary       education system.        We at NECA look forward to monitoring the floor debate on       this topic and encourage your support for H.R. 8294, the       ``National Apprenticeship Act of 2020.'' Thank you for your       consideration.            Sincerely,                                         Marco A. Giamberardino,                                                     Vice President,                                     Government and Public Affairs.                                                       Third Way,                                  Washington, DC, November 19, 2020.      Hon. Bobby Scott,      House Committee on Education and Labor,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Scott: We are pleased to see that the       National Apprenticeship Act of 2020 is receiving a vote this       week on the House floor. With millions of Americans out of       work due to the COVID--0919 pandemic, it is vital that       policymakers work toward an inclusive economic recovery.       That's why we encourage House lawmakers to pass the National       Apprenticeship Act of 2020, which would provide a much-needed       revamp of the nation's registered apprenticeship system.       Apprenticeships can play a key role in our economic recovery       and help people regain their footing in the job market.        Through your leadership, the National Apprenticeship Act of       2020 would take important steps to bolster apprenticeships       across the country. It would broaden economic opportunity by       expanding apprenticeships to women, people of color, and       people facing barriers to employment. The legislation would       help small and medium-sized businesses create apprenticeship       programs. Further, it would modernize our nation's       apprenticeship system by expanding apprenticeships in growing       fields like information technology, advanced manufacturing,       and health care.        The bill would also expand apprenticeships in part by       relying on intermediaries, or apprenticeship hubs, which       would bring together employers, education providers, unions,       and other organizations in each state that will work in       concert to expand apprenticeships. This is an approach Third       Way has long advocated for, and we're thrilled that it's a       key part of this legislation.        Through the National Apprenticeship Act of 2020, this       country can promote apprenticeships as a key tool in our       economic recovery and ensure everyone has pathways to in-      demand, good-paying careers. We thank you,  [[Page H5977]]       Chairwoman Susan Davis, and House Education and Labor       Committee Democrats for their leadership on this legislation       and urge Members to support it.            Sincerely,                                                Gabriel Horwitz,                                              Senior Vice President,                                                         Third Way.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Pursuant to section 3 of House Resolution  1224, I rise to offer amendments en bloc No. 1.    Mr. Speaker, these amendments generally ensure  accessibility for those with disabilities, increase equity, and  increase opportunities. They are not controversial, and I would hope  they would be accepted.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Horsford), who actually ran a program in  Nevada to increase job skills.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Beyer), the chair of the Joint Economic Committee.    Mr. Speaker, as I indicated--and several have  spoken on their amendments--I would hope that we would adopt the  amendment en bloc, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to section 3 of House  Resolution 1224, I rise to offer amendments en bloc No. 2.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   These are expected to be noncontroversial. The amendments generally  expand the industries to be affected by the opportunities for  apprenticeships and adds veterans service organizations as partner  organizations.   I hope that we would adopt these, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Washington (Mr. Kilmer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to  the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Kilmer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Lamb).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from the Northern Mariana Islands (Mr. Sablan).    Mr. Speaker, I support the three amendments en  bloc. I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, along with these  three amendments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
