 Mr. Speaker, I rise to strongly support H.R.  3462, the SBA Cyber Awareness Act, which I introduced with  Representative Jason Crow to improve cybersecurity and transparency at  the Small Business Administration.   The SBA provided a record number of services during the COVID-19  pandemic to provide a lifeline to small businesses in need. But with  that, the SBA also saw issues with their IT capabilities being able to  keep up and safely store applicants' personal information.   We must ensure entrepreneurs can safely access resources available to  them and have confidence that the SBA has the tools to keep their  information safe from cyberattacks. Our bill will do exactly that.   Additionally, H.R. 3462 safeguards our supply chain by protecting  SBA's IT components from the CCP's malign influence.   Mr. Speaker, I thank all of my colleagues who helped to pass this  bill.                            ____________________
