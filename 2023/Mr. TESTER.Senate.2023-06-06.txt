 Mr. President, today I would like to honor the  life and service of a distinguished Montanan and U.S. Army Special  Forces veteran: the late Jeremy Jones.   A native son of Montana, Jeremy was born and raised in Whitefish, MT.  He was an American hero who spent the majority of his adult life  risking his life to serve this country. As a troop sergeant major with  1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta, Jeremy served in more  than a dozen combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan over the course of an  almost 30-year career in the Army and Joint Special Operations Command.  He received numerous combat medals and citations for his extraordinary  service and sacrifice in that time, including three Bronze Stars.   After retiring honorably from the Army, Jeremy transitioned to  civilian life in North Carolina where he gave back to his community,  had good friends, and was an avid fisherman and golfer. He was a  critical member of the Knowmadics team, where he worked on programs to  protect warfighters and train the next generation of cyber  professionals. Most importantly, he was a loving father to his children  Bobby and Jess.   On May 14, 2023, Jeremy passed away at the age of 44. Today, it is my  honor to commemorate his service and legacy. We owe Jeremy a debt of  gratitude that can never be fully repaid. Raising the flag over the  U.S. Capitol in his honor is just a small token of our deep  appreciation for his service and valor.   On behalf of myself and a grateful nation, I commend Mr. Jeremy Jones  and extend our deepest appreciation to him and his family. His legacy  will continue to be felt by warfighters for years to come, and he will  be sorely missed.                            ____________________
