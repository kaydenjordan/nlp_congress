 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to strongly and fervently  denounce hate crimes in any form anywhere in America.   Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, this country has witnessed  a shocking rise in hate crimes against Asians and Asian Americans.  Between the onset of the pandemic to the end of last year, there have  been over 2,800 reported incidents of racism and discrimination against  Asian Americans.   In New York City, an Asian woman was waiting in line at a bakery when  she was brutally pushed to the ground, hitting her head. On the New  York City subway, racial slurs have been uttered toward Asian riders  and seniors have been physically attacked. In fact, in 2020, the NYPD  reported that 10 percent of all bias attacks were targeted towards  Asians. That is a ninefold increase over the incidents probed in 2019.   I am proud to represent New York City's Chinatown on the lower east  side of Manhattan and Brooklyn's Chinatown around 8th Avenue in Sunset  Park.   On February 12, I joined so many others in welcoming in the Lunar New  Year, the Year of the Ox. But this year, a dark undercurrent and  collective anxiety around the rise in violence dampened the  celebrations.    It goes without saying that my constituents and every one of our  constituents ought to be able to go to work, walk to the grocery store,  or ride public transportation without fear of a bigoted and even  dangerous attack.   Mr. Speaker, this is not who we are as a nation. We do not let  xenophobia, racism, and violence run rampant on our streets, in our  cities, in our hearts. No. We take pride in our diversity. We  understand that what brings us together is far greater than what  divides us. And we need to bring justice to all the victims of these  heinous crimes.   I am glad that in New York City, our mayor has created the Asian Hate  Crime Task Force, and I encourage other cities and localities to take  similar action.   We also need a sustained Federal presence to combat and prevent hate  crimes. That is why in the past I have introduced legislation to  allocate $50 million in Federal funds to help prevent, track, and  prosecute hate crimes and assist victims. I look forward to  reintroducing this bill.   I was also proud to cosponsor my colleague, Representative Grace  Meng's, resolution to denounce the anti-Asian sentiment that has  occurred since the outbreak of the coronavirus.   Every one of us, everyone, has a responsibility to condemn and speak  out against these attacks.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, nearly half of all LGBTQ people in  America lack protections from discrimination in employment, education,  housing, public accommodations, and credit. This is an abject failure  to recognize the humanity and dignity in all of us. And, as I have  spoken on before as the chairwoman of the House Small Business  Committee, discrimination is bad for business. That is why we need the  Equality Act.   We also need to recognize the mental health impacts of failing to  treat all people equally under the law. Discrimination is linked to  increased levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. Until all are  equal in the eyes of the law, we are allowing bigotry to silence and  shame.   So, today, I am voting ``yes'' for all those who have been made less  by their government's failure to protect them. I am voting ``yes'' for  the nearly 2 million LGBTQ youth who are counting on us. I see you, and  I welcome you in my heart.
