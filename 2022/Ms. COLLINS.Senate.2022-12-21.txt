 Madam President, the Senate is on the verge of enacting       legislation included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act that would       remedy the deep structural problems with our system of certifying and       counting the electoral votes for President and Vice President.        These unfortunate flaws are codified in the 1887 Electoral Count Act,       which guides the implementation of part of the Presidential election       process included in our Constitution. This archaic law, vaguely written       in the inaccessible language of a different era, was intended to       restrain Congress; but in practice, it has had the unintended effect of       creating ambiguities that could potentially be used to expand the role       of Congress and the Vice President in ways that are contrary to the       Constitution.        Despite its defects, this law was not an issue for more than a       century because of the restraint of the people who exercise the       serious, but limited, constitutional responsibility of counting the       electoral votes. Vice Presidents and Congress sustained the will of the       people, even when they did not like the result.        It took the violent breach of the Capitol on January 6, 2021, to       really shine a spotlight on the urgent need for reforming this law.       Earlier this year, I, along with a dedicated bipartisan group of our       colleagues, set out to craft legislation to reform and modernize the       Electoral Count Act. Our bipartisan group worked day and night over the       period of several months to reach a bipartisan consensus on a series of       reforms that will prevent this outdated law from being used to       undermine future Presidential elections.        I am pleased that our legislation, the Electoral Count Reform and       Presidential Transition Improvement Act, is included in the bill before       us. This bill is the result of countless hours of deliberations by       members of our working group. Cosponsored by 39 Senators, our bill       enjoys broad bipartisan support and was reported favorably by the       Senate Rules Committee by a vote of 14 to 1 after an excellent hearing       at which the committee members heard from a wide range of       constitutional experts.        I want to express my gratitude to my friend and partner in this       effort, Senator Joe Manchin, and to all the members of our group for       their work to craft this legislation. Specifically, Senators Romney,       Shaheen, Portman, Sinema, Murkowski, Warner, Tillis, Murphy, Capito,       Cardin, Young, Coons, and Sasse have dedicated countless hours to this       effort.        I also want to recognize Senators Klobuchar and Blunt. They are the       leaders of the Senate Rules Committee. They provided their advice and       counsel throughout this process and shepherded the bill through their       committee.        Leaders McConnell and Schumer cosponsored our bill and trusted us to       undertake this vital task.        I want to thank all of the cosponsors, as well as Representatives       Gottheimer and Upton, who introduced a companion bill in the House of       Representatives.        In developing our bill, we also consulted with several election       experts and legal scholars whose analysis helped shape the bill. Our       bill would replace the ambiguous provisions of this 19th century law       with clear procedures that maintain appropriate state and Federal roles       in selecting the President and Vice President as set forth in the       Constitution. It will also ensure that the electoral votes tallied by       Congress accurately reflect each State's public vote.        There are a number of important reforms included in our bill. Let me       take just a moment to highlight a few of them.        First, our bill reasserts that the constitutional role of the Vice       President in counting the electoral votes is strictly and solely       ministerial. The idea that any Vice President would have the power to       unilaterally accept, reject, or change electoral votes or halt their       counting is antithetical to our Constitution and basic democratic       principles.            [[Page S9731]]              Second, our bill raises the threshold to lodge an objection to       electors to at least one-fifth of the duly chosen and sworn Members of       the House and the Senate. Currently, it takes only a single Member in       each body to object to an elector or a slate of electors. I would note       that in four of the past six Presidential elections, this objection       process has been abused, with members of both parties raising frivolous       objections to electoral votes. By raising that threshold from one       Member of each body to 20 percent of each body, we can do away with the       completely frivolous objections, while ensuring that serious concerns       are still heard.        Third, our legislation would ensure that Congress can identify a       single conclusive slate of electors by clearly identifying a single       State official who is responsible for certifying a State's electors,       requiring Congress to defer to the slates of electors submitted by a       State pursuant to the judgment of State or Federal courts and by       providing Presidential candidates with an expedited judicial review of       Federal claims related to a State's certificate of electors.        Let me be clear that this does not create a new cause of action.       Instead, what this provision will do is ensure a prompt adjudication of       disputes.        To help promote the orderly transfer of power, our bill also includes       clear guidelines for when eligible Presidential candidates may receive       Federal resources to support their transition into office. I       particularly want to thank Senators Portman, Coons, and Sasse for their       hard work on this portion of the bill.        Nothing is more essential to the survival of a democracy than an       orderly transfer of power. And there is nothing more essential to that       orderly transfer of power than clear rules for affecting it. Our bill       provides those clear rules.        I urge my colleagues to support this historic legislation and I thank       all who are involved to bringing us to this reality.        I yield the floor.        I suggest the absence of a quorum.         Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order       for the quorum call be rescinded.         Madam President, seeing no one seeking the floor at the       moment, I would like to rise today to thank my valued colleague and       dear friend Rob Portman for his outstanding contributions to our       Nation.        Rob's 12 years in the Senate tell only a part of the story of his       remarkable record of public service that extends three decades. Under       President George H. W. Bush, he served as Legislative Affairs Director       and Associate White House Counsel.        He was then elected to the House of Representatives seven times from       Ohio's Second District. In 2005, Rob left Congress to serve in the       administration of President George W. Bush, first as U.S. Trade       Representative and later as Director of the Office of Management and       Budget.        In each of those roles, Rob established a well-deserved reputation as       a problem-solver, focused on practical results rather than political       advantage.        He is a leader who treats his colleagues with respect, and he has the       highest regard for the constituents he serves.        In the Senate, Rob continued to advance many of the issues that he       championed in the House. These included ending sex trafficking through       the internet, pushing for fair trade policies that support U.S.       manufacturers, improving workforce development programs, protecting our       national parks, and promoting energy conservation.        Rob Portman has been a remarkably successful legislator. During his       Senate tenure, he has introduced more than 240 bills, including 200       bipartisan measures. Under Democratic and Republican Presidents, more       than 150 of his legislative proposals have been signed into law.        One of those laws is transforming the lives of those who are       struggling with addiction. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery       Act, enacted in 2016, has significantly increased medication-assisted       treatment for opioid use and was a monumental leap forward in our       ongoing work to boost resources to address this public health crisis       and bring hope, recovery, and healing to individuals and communities       that have been devastated by the opioid epidemic.        Rob has also led bipartisan efforts for decades to pass historic       reforms to strengthen the private retirement system to ensure that       Americans have the resources that they need to save for retirement.        His efforts have helped retirement savings to increase from $11.3       trillion in 2001 to $29.1 trillion in 2022. And he continues that       effort knowing that we still have a troubling gap in the amount of       money that people will need for a comfortable retirement versus what       they have saved.        I am proud to have partnered with Rob on many of these initiatives.       One in particular that stands out in my memory is our work together to       develop and pass the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.        We were among a group of 10 Senators--5 Republicans and 5 Democrats--      who were resolved to break through the partisan gridlock and deliver       this long-overdue victory to the American people.        After months of working night and day, our bipartisan negotiations       resulted in a truly transformational package for our country that is       the most significant investment in infrastructure since the       establishment of the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s. We would       not have been successful without Rob's leadership.        On top of his many legislative accomplishments, Rob has always backed       a strong national defense and has been an outspoken champion for       freedom around the world. For the past 2 years, he has been a leading       voice in supporting the people of Ukraine against the unprovoked and       brutal Russian invasion that began 300 days ago.        Rob is also a champion of democracy and liberty here at home. He has       been a strong ally in our bipartisan work on the bill I just discussed,       and that is the modernization and reform of the Electoral Count Act of       1887.        He is also an original cosponsor of the Respect for Marriage Act,       which has enshrined marriage equality for the purposes of Federal law       and provides additional legal protections to ensure religious liberty       as well.        When Rob announced that he would not seek reelection, he said this:                   ``We live in an increasingly polarized country where            members of both parties are being pushed further to the right            and further to the left, and that means too few people are            actively looking to find common ground. This is not a new            phenomenon, of course, but a problem that has gotten worse            over the past few decades.''              I would say to my friend and my colleague Rob that one of his most       enduring legacies will be the example he has set of bringing our       country together, of bringing the Members of this body together to       address the many challenges we face.        It has been an honor to serve with my friend Rob Portman, and I look       forward to the many contributions he will continue to make in this next       chapter of his life.        I wish him, his wife Jane, and all of their wonderful family all the       best in the years to come.         Madam President, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of       Fiscal Year 2023 includes the reforms of the Electoral Count Reform and       Presidential Transition Improvement Act, a bill I coauthored with       Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia. This bipartisan legislation has       39 cosponsors, including Senate Leaders Chuck Schumer and Mitch       McConnell and Senate Rules Committee Chairman Amy Klobuchar and Ranking       Member Roy Blunt. The bill was favorably reported out of the Senate       Rules Committee by a vote of 14-1.        The Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement       Act would reform and modernize the outdated Electoral Count Act of 1887       to ensure that electoral votes tallied by Congress accurately reflect       each State's vote for President. In addition to my prior remarks about       the reforms this bill makes to the Electoral Count Act, it is important       that the Congressional Record reflect the purposes and intended       implementation of these reforms, which were made by a bipartisan       working group of Senators led by me and Senator Manchin. Our       legislation amends title 3, United States Code, to reform the Electoral       Count Act of 1887, and amends the Presidential Transition Act of 1963.       Title I of the bill, described in the following analysis, contains the       Electoral Count Reform Act.        Sec. 101. Short Title. This section designates the name of the bill       as the ``Electoral Count Reform Act of 2022.''        Sec. 102. Time for Appointing Electors. This section streamlines       section 1 of title 3, United States Code, requiring that the electors       of President and Vice President be appointed in each State on election       day, in accordance with the laws of the State enacted prior to that       date. The phrase ``in accordance with the laws of the State enacted       prior to election day'' forecloses any opportunity that a subsequent       day could be selected for choosing a State's electors or taking other       post hoc actions.        This section also repeals section 2 of title 3, often referred to as       the ``failed election'' provision, which states that ``[w]henever any       State has held an election for the purpose of choosing electors, and       has failed to make a choice on the day prescribed by law, the electors       may be appointed on a subsequent day in such a manner as the       legislature of such State may direct.'' The phrase ``failed to make a       choice'' is not defined in law. Since its enactment in 1845, this       provision has never been used, and it was a source of uncertainty       during the Presidential elections of 2000 and 2020. In striking this       provision, our legislation ensures that Congress does not authorize any       State to declare an election ``failed'' when the outcome is       undesirable.        The authors of this bill recognize that there may be exceedingly rare       circumstances in which a State may truly be unable to conduct its       election on the day designated by law. Such rare circumstances are       understood to include catastrophic natural disasters, terrorist       attacks, or similar calamities. The definition of election day in the       new legislation allows a State to modify the period of voting in a       popular election ``as necessitated by force majeure events that are       extraordinary and catastrophic, as provided under laws of the State       enacted prior to such day.'' Such circumstances are so rare that they       have yet to arise in our Nation's history, thus this provision was       included with the understanding that such an event requiring its use       would be unprecedented in nature.        This provision contains several Federal restrictions: No. 1, the       events must be necessitated by force majeure events that are       extraordinary and catastrophic, No. 2, the processes for modifying the       period of election must be established by the State prior to election            [[Page S9766]]            day, No. 3, and the remedy is limited to modifying the period of the       election, not delaying or cancelling an election. This provision       constrains the discretion of States while also providing flexibility to       respond to extraordinary and catastrophic election emergencies. This       provision does not permit the legislative appointment of new electors       after election day.        Sec. 103. Clarification with Respect to Vacancies in Electoral       College. This section clarifies that States may only fill elector       vacancies pursuant to laws enacted prior to election day.        Sec. 104. Certificate of Ascertainment of Appointment of Electors.       This section updates existing provisions to ensure that Congress can       identify a single, conclusive slate of electors submitted by each State       in a timely manner.        This section reforms and modernizes sections of the Electoral Count       Act to ensure Congress receives timely and accurate certificates of       ascertainment for each State. It requires each state's executive to       issue a certificate of ascertainment of appointment of electors no       later than 6 days before the meeting of electors and to transmit the       certificate to the Archivist of the United States and several       duplicate-original certificates to the State's appointed electors. Each       State's executive must issue a certificate of ascertainment pursuant to       the laws of such State. This section maintains that existing duty in       the underlying law and reiterates that State executives must issue       these certificates pursuant to State law in effect prior to election       day.        The reason for this amendment is because the underlying law, section       5 of title 3, establishes a presumption of conclusiveness of a State's       appointment of electors if the State meets what has been called the       ``safe harbor'' deadline, which is 6 days before the meeting of the       electors. This safe harbor provision has never been used by Congress to       accomplish its duties under the 12th Amendment. It is an outdated and       impracticable provision intended to help resolve a remote scenario in       which multiple slates of electors are received from a State.        The Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Act defines       ``executive'' of a State to mean ``the Governor of the State . . .       except when the laws or constitution of a State in effect as of       election day expressly require a different State executive to perform       the duties identified'' under the Electoral Count Act. This provision       is intended to resolve any ambiguity in the meaning of ``executive''       under current law and to ensure that Congress can identify a single       State official with the responsibility for identifying his or her       State's electors to Congress. In the absence of unequivocal statutory       or constitutional provisions assigning these responsibilities to a       different State executive official, enacted prior to election day, the       Governor shall have this responsibility.        During bipartisan discussions about this legislation, Senators       debated concerns about the prospect that a State's executive might take       deliberate actions to controvert or delay the issuance of the       certificate of ascertainment required under the Electoral Count Act.       That is why this section of the bill provides an expedited process in       Federal court for aggrieved Presidential or Vice Presidential       candidates to address such an unprecedented action, which could include       a State's executive failing to issue or transmit a certificate of       ascertainment prior to the specified deadline, or issuing or       transmitting a certificate of ascertainment that does not reflect the       State's accurate slate of electors.        The venue and expedited procedure provisions specified in subsection       5(d) of the bill do not establish a federal cause of action or provide       independent standing or jurisdiction to adjudicate legal claims       concerning the certificates of ascertainment. The provisions only       provide expedited procedures to resolve Federal claims that may arise       under existing law. The scope of these provisions is deliberately       narrow, intending only to ensure swift Federal judicial review of the       final act of the State in appointing its electors, which is the       issuance and transmission of a certificate of ascertainment.       Understanding that these provisions are intended to address a narrow       and, to date, unprecedented range of circumstances and claims that will       require limited, if any, fact finding by the judiciary, this section       provides no more than 6 days from the established statutory deadline       for the issuance of a certificate of ascertainment to resolve such       disputes. More than 6 days may be available to resolve such a claim if       a State executive issues a certificate of ascertainment in advance of       the statutory deadline, which may be permitted or required under State       law and frequently occurs.        A rule of construction ensures that these provisions related to       Federal court processes may not be construed to preempt or displace any       existing state or federal cause of action. This section therefore does       not affect any current process to resolve disputes involving a State's       election, such as recounts, election contests, or audits, nor does it       restrict any available judicial challenges related to the election       under State or Federal law.        Finally, this section requires, for purposes of the counting of       electoral votes at the joint session of Congress, that a certificate of       ascertainment issued pursuant to this section be treated as conclusive       in Congress. If any certificate of ascertainment is required to be       issued or revised by State or Federal judicial relief granted prior to       the date of the meeting of electors, that certificate shall replace and       supersede any other certificates. This is intended to provide clear       parameters to Congress for identifying each State's single, conclusive       slate of electors, and to ensure each certificate's accuracy.        To further aid in the identification of each State's conclusive       certificate of ascertainment, this section adds a requirement that the       certificate provided by each State's executive include at least one       security feature, as determined by the State. Such features may include       raised seals, watermarks, microprinted lines, or other security       features in common use on official documents. Pursuant to guidance       issued by the Archivist of the United States in advance of Presidential       elections, State officials should communicate the security features       that the State will use on its certificates of ascertainment in advance       to the Archivist.        Sec. 105. Duties of the Archivist. This section amends section 6 of       title 3 to restate the duties of the Archivist of the United States       with respect to the certificates of ascertainment of appointment of       electors received from each State.        Sec. 106. Meeting of Electors. This section establishes the time of       the meeting of electors in each State as the first Tuesday after the       second Wednesday in December, 1 day later than the date designated in       the underling law. Further, it makes technical amendments to section 10       of title 3 to ensure consistency of terms.        Sec. 107. Transmission of Certificates of Votes. This section       streamlines the requirements related to the transmittal of electoral       votes to various officials, and it requires all of the certificates to       be transmitted at the same time.        Sec. 108. Failure of Certificate of Votes to Reach Recipients. This       section makes technical and conforming amendments to provisions of the       underlying law related to instances when certificates do not reach the       intended recipients. This section also repeals the messenger's penalty       codified at section 14 of title 3 if the Archivist of the United States       does not receive the electoral votes by a specified date.        Sec. 109. Clarifications Relating to Counting Electoral Votes. This       section modernizes provisions of section 15 of title 3 related to the       counting procedures used by the joint session of Congress.        As amended by the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition       and Improvement Act, section 15(b) reaffirms that the role of the       President of the Senate in the joint session of Congress is ministerial       in nature, and that the President of the Senate has no power to solely       determine, accept, reject, or otherwise adjudicate or resolve disputes       over the proper certificate of ascertainment, the validity of electors,       or the votes of electors. This provision is not intended to change the       role of the President of the Senate at the joint session. Rather, it       reaffirms the broad, consensus view of the President of the Senate's       role under article II and the 12th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution       in the counting of electoral votes by Congress.        The section increases the threshold required to raise an objection to       an            [[Page S9767]]            elector or slate of electors during the joint session to one-fifth of       the Members of the Senate and House of Representatives duly chosen and       sworn. This amends the underlying law, which requires only one Member       from both chambers to lodge an objection. As amended, this higher       threshold mirrors the threshold found in section 5, clause 3 of article       I of the Constitution, which requires one-fifth of those present to       request that the yeas and nays entered on the Journal of the Chamber.       This higher threshold was chosen to ensure that any objection to a       State's electors enjoys broad support in Congress, thereby preventing       frivolous objections that unnecessarily interrupt Congress' duties. The       threshold is also not insurmountably high so as to prevent objections       that may warrant further debate and resolution.        The section retains the grounds for objection in the underlying law,       which may be made if electors of a State are ``not lawfully certified''       under a proper certificate of ascertainment or if the vote of one or       more electors ``has not been regularly given.'' During bipartisan       discussion about these grounds, Senators considered whether or not       these long-standing grounds were overly vague in light of recent abuses       in joint sessions of Congress. The bipartisan group considered that       there is historical and constitutional scholarship on the meaning of       these phrases, which were better understood when the Electoral Count       Act was enacted in 1887.        These grounds for objection were analyzed during a Senate Rules and       Administration Committee hearing on August 3, 2022. Professor Derek       Muller of the University of Iowa College of Law, who is a national       authority on the constitutional history and appropriate reading of the       grounds for objections under the Electoral Count Act, testified that       the phrase ``not lawfully certified'' limits the objection to ensuring       that the requirements of section 5 of the Electoral Count Act have been       met.        Professor Muller further testified that ``regularly given'' is       understood to limit the scope of the objection, citing his own       scholarship and that of other legal schools on the issue. In a law       journal article titled ``Electoral Votes Regularly Given'' (55 Ga. L.       Rev. 1529 (2021)), Professor Muller noted an academic's view of the       meaning of regularly given from 1888: `` . . . the two Houses cannot       reject the return on account of fraud or defect in the election of the       electors or in the determination of a controversy thereof, but may do       so on account of irregular action on the part of the electors       themselves in giving their votes for President and Vice-President.''       Thus, regularly given is relatively narrow in scope and generally       refers to post-appointment problems or controversies. This could       contemplate an instance when an elector cast a vote for a       constitutionally ineligible candidate for President or Vice President;       an elector cast an electoral vote at the wrong time or in the wrong       place; or in the wrong form and manner as specified under law; or the       electors' vote is the product of duress, bribery, or corruption.        The other reforms made by this legislation, including increasing the       required objection threshold and ensuring a single, conclusive slate of       electors in each State subject to State or Federal judicial review,       will make it harder for members of Congress to offer frivolous       objections.        As amended by this bill, subsection 15(e)(2) of the Electoral Count       Act clarifies how many votes constitute the denominator for purposes of       determining the majority of electoral votes. The Twelfth Amendment of       the U.S. Constitution provides that ``the person having the greatest       number of votes for President, shall be the President, if such number       be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed.'' In the rare       historical instances in which there has been a problem with or       objection to an electoral vote, Congress's past precedent is unclear       and contradictory. The provision of the Electoral Count Reform and       Presidential Transition Improvement Act states that if a State fails to       appoint all of the electors it is entitled to receive, or if it has not       validly appointed electors under State law and Congress votes to reject       those electoral votes on that basis, then those electors are not       ``appointed'' for purposes of the Twelfth Amendment and the denominator       is to be reduced.        Sec. 110. Rules Related to Joint Meeting. This section makes       technical amendments to section 17 of the Electoral Count Act,       including clarifying that when the two Chambers separate to resolve an       objection, all objections or other questions raised related to a given       State's electors must be addressed within the 2-hour limit and       specifies that any appeals or other questions relating to any rulings       made by the Presiding Officer at the joint session must be resolved by       votes of the two Chambers separately.        Sec. 111. Severability. This section adds severability provisions to       the Electoral Count Act should a court rule provisions of the law       unconstitutional.        We have before us an historic opportunity to modernize and strengthen       our system of certifying and counting the electoral votes for President       and Vice President. The events of January 6, 2021, reminded us that       nothing is more essential to the survival of a democracy than the       orderly transfer of power. There is nothing more essential to the       orderly transfer of power than clear rules for effecting it. I am proud       that Congress has seized this opportunity to enact these sensible and       much-needed reforms.                                      ____________________
