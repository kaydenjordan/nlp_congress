 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Law Enforcement  Appreciation Day, a day we set aside to thank those who risk their  lives to protect our communities nationwide.   These men and women are the hidden heroes of our country, and they  deserve our respect and our gratitude. When they put on their badge and  kiss their family good-bye each day, these officers have no certainty  that they will return home safely. They willingly face that risk to  keep the rest of us safe.   This past year, 135 law enforcement officers made the ultimate  sacrifice. One of those courageous individuals was our own Officer Scot  Fitzgerald, who lost his life serving on duty with the South  Jacksonville Police Department, located in my district.   Last night, throughout the Capitol, blue lights were lit to honor our  heroes in blue. In my office, we lit our blue candle in remembrance of  fallen Officer Scot Fitzgerald.   In 2016, more officers lost their lives on duty than in any of the  previous 5 years. Let us show our admiration and appreciation to the  sworn law enforcement officers across the State of Illinois and the  900,000 who serve and face danger in the United States every day. Not  just this week, but throughout the year, we need to honor our law  enforcement officials.                            ____________________
