 Mr. Speaker, according to the Aspen Institute,  from 1996 to 2008, the percentages of American workers receiving  employer-sponsored training, on-the-job training, as it were, has  fallen by 40 percent.   With a growing skills gap, and American businesses unable to fill 6.3  million jobs due to a lack of qualified candidates, it is imperative  that Congress incentivizes investments in worker training. That is why  I introduced the Investing in American Workers Act last Friday.   This forward-thinking legislation provides a 20 percent tax credit to  small and midsized companies that increase their investments in worker  training over a given year. Eligible programs include apprenticeships,  specialized community college courses, and those offered by employers  or industry associations. This is a win-win for American employers and  employees, helping American companies compete globally and helping  workers obtain higher wages and long-term job security.   Our workforce is the foundation of our economy, and we cannot ignore  the consequences of failing, as a country, to invest in American  workers.                            ____________________
