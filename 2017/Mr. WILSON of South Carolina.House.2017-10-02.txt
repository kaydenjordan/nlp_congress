 Mr. Speaker, our thoughts and prayers  are with the families impacted by the massacre in Las Vegas. We are  blessed with courageous law enforcement.   I am extremely grateful to the South Carolina National Guard for  sending nearly 150 engineer soldiers to assist Puerto Rico in relief  efforts after Hurricane Maria. This was a devastating storm for the  people of Puerto Rico, and they have been in our thoughts and prayers  each and every day.   These dedicated soldiers are part of a multi-State engineer task  force with North Carolina, Louisiana, and New York Army National  Guards. They will be assisting in clearing roads, debris, and working  to reach areas that have been deemed unreachable due to the storm. They  will also work on restoring infrastructure.   As a veteran of the South Carolina Army National Guard and the father  of three sons who have served in the Guard, I am grateful that our  State is able to assist the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico in their time  of need. On my visits to San Juan, I have been very impressed by its  dynamic citizens.   I am very appreciative of the leadership of South Carolina Adjutant  General Robert Livingston, the experienced South Carolina Army National  Guard members, as well as the leadership of Governor Henry McMaster.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forgot  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
