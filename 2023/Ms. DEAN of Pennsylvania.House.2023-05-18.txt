 Mr. Speaker, this past weekend, families  across the country, including my own, celebrated Mother's Day. Many of  us honor the extraordinary women in our  [[Page H2432]]  lives with a call, brunch, or flowers. These are all lovely gestures.   If you ask a mom what she wants for Mother's Day, there is a good  chance she will say peace of mind. A call doesn't give a mother time  off from work to recover from childbirth and bond with her newborn.  Brunch won't provide mental or physical healthcare. Flowers won't  babysit or teach our children the alphabet.   This Chamber must do more for moms. What they need are:   Paid family leave to close the gender wage gap;   Access to basic women's healthcare;   Closing the coverage gap and eradicating bias from medicine to save  the lives of women, especially Black women;   Quality, affordable childcare;   Universal pre-K to give our generation a strong educational  foundation; and   Peace of mind that their child will not be blown away by gun  violence.   Mr. Speaker, mothers are telling us what they need. I hope by next  Mother's Day we listen.                            ____________________
