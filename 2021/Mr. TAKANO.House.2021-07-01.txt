 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate a constituent  and dear friend, Andy Melendrez, on his retirement from the Riverside  City Council.   Mr. Melendrez has served as a council member for Ward 2 for four  consecutive terms. During his first term as council member, he focused  on enforcing public safety.   He has also always been a strong advocate for Riverside's youth. Mr.  Melendrez brought the first youth opera program to the Cesar Chavez  Community Center-Bobby Bonds Park and other social service programs for  youth that would provide them with mentoring, workforce development  training, and other opportunities to improve their lives.   Mr. Melendrez's dedication to improving the lives of families in  Riverside is admirable. There is no doubt of his dedication and  commitment to public service.   Riverside was lucky to have him as a local leader, and I wish him the  best in his retirement from the city council.                            ____________________
