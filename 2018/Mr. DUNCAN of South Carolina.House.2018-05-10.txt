 Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Shimkus  for his work on this legislation.   I have long been an advocate for nuclear waste policy like this for  Yucca Mountain.   Since 1982, when the Nuclear Waste Policy Act was created, ratepayers  in this Nation have paid, as part of their utility bill, over $40  billion. In South Carolina, that means ratepayers have paid $1.3  billion for the construction and operation of what we now know as Yucca  Mountain.   Currently, in South Carolina, there are over 4,500 tons of spent  nuclear fuel in temporary storage from commercial reactors. At the  Savannah River Site, we have both research and military nuclear waste  sitting in vitrified glass ready to go to a long-term repository.  [[Page H3894]]    The law of the land, passed in 1992, is for Yucca Mountain to be a  long-term repository for this Nation's waste. It is time to move  forward and give the ratepayers--not the taxpayers, but the  ratepayers--what they paid for, and this legislation moves in the right  direction.    Mr. Chairman, I look forward to my colleagues supporting this  bipartisan legislation.
