 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I take this time to urge my colleagues to  support S. 316. I congratulate and thank Senators Kaine and Young for  their leadership on this issue. It will give us an opportunity to  finally repeal the 1991 and the 2002 authorizations for the use of  military force in regard to Iraq.   We are not at war with Iraq, and we have seen--particularly with the  use of the 2001 authorization for the use of military force, which was  centered on Afghanistan--that it can be used by administrations well  beyond the intent of Congress. So it is our congressional  responsibility to remove these authorizations and to finally repeal  them.   I want to make it clear: I voted against both of the Iraq  authorizations when I was in the House of Representatives in 1991 and  2002. The 2002, particularly, was passed by false pretenses. It was  passed because of the belief that Iraq was involved in the attack on  our country on September 11 when, in fact, they were not. It was based  on the fact that they had weapons of mass destruction that could be  used against U.S. interests, and that was also false.    Today, the U.S. forces in Iraq are there by the invitation of the  government. There is no need for Congress to authorize the use of  military force in regard to Iraq. If there are any issues in regard to  protecting U.S. interests that may fall within Iraq that would require  the use by the President of the military, he has that authority under  article II of the Constitution, and he also has the authority given to  him by the War Powers Act to utilize that process if, in fact, it is  needed.   It is Congress's responsibility to declare war, clearly, in the  Constitution of the United States. It is our responsibility to  authorize when our men and women should be put in harm's way. We have a  responsibility to make sure that the authorizations for the use of that  force are in compliance with our security needs. And, clearly, we need  to eliminate the authorizations that we passed in 1991 and 2002, and we  are going to have the opportunity to do that.   It is very important that we pass those bills. As I said earlier, it  could be used by a future administration, by a President, to go well  beyond the intent of Congress. Maybe 5 or 10 years from now, a creative  use of that authorization could be used to introduce troops clearly  against the intent of Congress.   Now, why do I say that? Because it has happened before. Let me give  you a case in point. The 2001 authorization for the use of military  force, which was passed shortly after the attack on our country on  September 11, 2001, was aimed at going after the organizations in  Afghanistan that were partly responsible for the attack on our country.   Let me, if I might, read into the Record the 2001 authorization for  use of military force because I think Members of the Senate and  certainly the public would be very surprised to see the specific  language that was used in 2001 and how it has been misused by four  administrations.   It states ``That the President is authorized to use all necessary and  appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he  determines  [[Page S920]]  planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that  occurred on September 11, 2001.''   That is the language of the AUMF. Yet we have seen that being used  now by four Presidents far beyond the intent of Congress. They are  using them in countries and against organizations that didn't even  exist in 2001. It has been used in Yemen and Somalia, far from  Afghanistan. Presidents have used the 2001 authorization in places and  against organizations that we never imagined 22 years ago.   Now, I have heard some of my colleagues say: Well, these are  affiliates of organizations that existed in 2001. Well, the concept of  affiliate is nowhere in the authorization for use of military force  that Congress passed. It was used by legal counsel and administrations  to justify the use of force.   It is our responsibility to give that authority, and we didn't. Yet  Presidents are using this to justify the use of force. Presidents have  used the 2001 authorization in places and against organizations never  imagined by Congress. The notice under the War Powers Act has been  given to over 20 countries using the 2001 authorization, and military  activities have been used well beyond Afghanistan under that  authority--in Iraq, Syria, Libya, Yemen, Somalia, and Niger--never  intended by Congress.   Congress needs to pass S. 316. Let me make that clear. We need to get  this bill passed to take off the books the Iraq authorizations that we  have, and then we need to repeal and replace the 2001 AUMF. It is our  responsibility.   President Biden agrees. Let me just quote from the President's  statement in support of S. 316. He says:         Furthermore, President Biden remains committed to working       with Congress to ensure that the outdated authorizations for       the use of military force are replaced with a narrow and       specific framework more appropriate to protecting Americans       from modern terrorist threats. Toward that end, the       Administration will ensure that Congress has a clear and       thorough understanding of the effect of any such action and       of the threats facing U.S. forces, personnel, and interests       around the world.    Chairman Menendez has also indicated and Senator Kaine has also  indicated and understand that we first must pass S. 316, and then we  need to take up the 2001 authorization for a repeal and replacement. I  will introduce legislation in the very near future that does exactly  that, that gives us the opportunity to carry out our responsibilities.  I have done this in previous Congresses. It will sunset the 2001  authorization with enough lead time for the administration and Congress  to pass, as President Biden has said, a narrow and specific framework  more appropriate to protecting Americans from modern terrorist threats.  That is our responsibility to do that.   We must take action on all fronts: Repeal the authorization that was  passed in 1991 and 2002 related to Iraq and then move with dispatch to  repeal and replace the 2001 authorization that was aimed mainly toward  Afghanistan.   With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
