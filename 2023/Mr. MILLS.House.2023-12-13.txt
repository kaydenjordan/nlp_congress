 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, this amendment prohibits schools from  participating in the school lunch program under the act from purchasing  or offering milk produced by Chinese state-owned enterprises that may  be operating here within the United States or elsewhere.   As many of us know, in 2008, the melamine scandal exposed systemic  corruption and disregard for the safety standards within China's own  dairy industry. This scandal resulted in the death of six infants and  sickened thousands more, highlighting the devastating consequences of  lax regulations and unethical practices.   The evidence is clear: These enterprises pose a serious threat to our  consumers' health, our economic security, and our national interests.  We can't allow CCP enterprises to export their dangerous practices to  our school lunches.  [[Page H6905]]    This is an issue of maintaining American control of critical supply  chains. Chinese state-owned enterprises have no business being in our  schools.   Florida is one of the largest cattle producers in America, and there  is no way I will allow producers in my State to be compromised by the  CCP or the PRC. If we fail to act, we risk losing our family farms and  jeopardizing the livelihoods of thousands of Americans.   This is not about trade isolationism; it is about protecting our  children in schools from unsafe products, ensuring fair competition for  American producers, and safeguarding our national security.   The potential consequences of inaction are simply too great for me to  ignore. The quality and safety of food that we provide to our children  is paramount, and we cannot compromise on these standards. We must be  vigilant about our source and production practices of the products that  are present in our educational institutions and safeguard them from  adversaries that do not share our same interests.                                time  1500    By prohibiting schools from purchasing or offering milk produced by  China's state-owned enterprises operating in the United States and  elsewhere, we aim to send a clear message about our commitment to  health and the safety of our children.   Last year, over 30 million schoolchildren relied on school lunches  for their nutrition. We have seen how the CCP has approached other  industries, and we cannot allow such an important sector to become  vulnerable in a time of crisis.   Therefore, I urge you to join me in preventing the CCP-supported  entities from infiltrating school lunches and a key American supply  chain. This is a necessary step to protect the health and well-being of  our citizens, safeguard our economy, and defend our national interests.  Let us send a clear message that we will prioritize the safety and  security of our Nation's schoolchildren above all else.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, it is interesting, and I understand that  facts, for whatever reason, seem to sink in a lot slower on the left  than they do in America's party, so I will say this once more.   In 2008, the melamine scandal exposed systemic corruption and  disregard for our complete safety in milk and other dairy products  produced by China, so it is interesting that the gentleman says they  are not actually weakening anything when they had infants and children  by the thousands who died or were sickened by their actual production  capacity capabilities or incapabilities.   Again, facts are a very finicky thing. They oftentimes slowly leak in  on the left, but you can't dispute that China's production of dairy has  been less safe and less put under the regulations of rigorous streams  than they do in American production with the FDA.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
