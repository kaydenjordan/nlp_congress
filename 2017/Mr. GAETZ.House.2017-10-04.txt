 Mr. Chairman, as one of the youngest Members of Congress,  I feel an obligation not only to my district but to my generation.  Right now in America, we are midway through the greatest wave of  generational theft in all of human history.   The budget offered by the Congressional Black Caucus takes the  problems of Washington and makes all of them worse by doubling down on  deficit spending and irresponsible financial decisions.   Mr. Chairman, I tell my constituents I am on two of the scariest  committees in Congress--Armed Services and Budget--because on the Armed  Services Committee, I see every day that our adversaries are closing  the capability gap. They are able to do more while, after 8 years of  the Obama administration, our military has been left in shambles. This  budget does nothing to rebuild the military. It leaves our troops on  the battlefield without the tools they need to win, and it is  absolutely shameful.   Mr. Chairman, when we look at the budget today, we absolutely have to  get back on a path of fiscal discipline. This budget, however, doesn't  do that. It punishes American workers and American businesses with new  taxes and more taxes.   It pours billions into the failed experiment of ObamaCare. To take  things a step further, it would promote a healthcare system that is a  single-payer system. Not only will this bankrupt our Nation, it will  bankrupt hardworking Americans.   How much would premiums go up under a State-run single-payer system?  $1,000 a month? $2,000? Of course, taxes would increase, too. The same  families in this system would see enormous challenges meeting their  needs because they would be funding irresponsible spending in  Washington.   So beyond making our citizens sick and poor, this budget would gut  our defense, weaken our military, and put more Americans in danger.  Everyone here knows that the threats we face are serious: ISIS,  Hezbollah, North Korea, and regional instability and volatility across  the Middle East. Yet, bizarrely, this budget cuts funding for the  global war on terror.   Under President Obama, readiness fell to the lowest levels in a  century, GDP growth sputtered, the quality of healthcare for the middle  class got worse, and our debt skyrocketed. These are not policies we  should repeat, and certainly not policies we should expand.   Instead, let's vote for the Republican budget that has the greatest  reduction in entitlement spending since Newt Gingrich was Speaker of  the House and can actually restore the great promise of the American  Dream.                                time  1900
