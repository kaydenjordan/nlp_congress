 Madam Chair, because of the force of labor unions,  American workers have higher wages and workplaces that are fairer and  safer. And we can thank labor unions for things like employee health  coverage, the end of child labor, and a 40-hour work week.   To counter the power of collective bargaining, some in corporate  America have struck back by harassing union organizers, denying  information to employees, and using independent contractors.   That is why I am voting for the Protecting the Right to Organize Act  of 2019, to defend and secure our labor unions, the champions of the  American workers. I urge support of this amendment and the bill.
