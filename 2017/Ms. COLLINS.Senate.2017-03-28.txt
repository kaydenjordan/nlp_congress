Mr. President, confirming a Supreme Court nominee is one  of the Senate's most significant constitutional responsibilities. I  come  [[Page S2021]]  to the floor today to announce that I shall cast my vote for Judge Neil  Gorsuch to be a Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. In making my  decision, I evaluated Judge Gorsuch's qualifications, experience,  integrity, and temperament. I questioned him for more than an hour in a  meeting in my office, evaluated his record, spoke with people who know  him personally, and reviewed the Judiciary Committee's extensive  hearing record. While I have not agreed with every decision Judge  Gorsuch has made, my conclusion is that he is eminently well qualified  to serve on our Nation's highest Court.   Judge Gorsuch has sterling academic and legal credentials. In 2006,  the Senate confirmed this outstanding nominee by a voice vote to his  current position on the U.S. Court of Appeals. A rollcall vote was  neither requested nor required.   Judge Gorsuch's ability as a legal scholar and judge has earned him  the respect of members of the bar. The American Bar Association  Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary has unanimously given him  its highest possible rating of ``well qualified.'' President Obama's  former Acting Solicitor General testified before the Judiciary  Committee in support of Judge Gorsuch, praising him as fair, decent,  and committed to judicial independence.   I have also received a letter signed by 49 prominent Maine attorneys  with diverse political views, urging support for Judge Gorsuch's  nomination. They wrote:         Gorsuch's judicial record demonstrates his remarkable       intelligence, his keen ability to discern and resolve the       central issues at dispute in a legal proceeding . . . and his       dedication to the rule of law rather than personal       predilections. His judicial record also confirms that he is       committed to upholding the Constitution, enforcing the       statutes enacted by Congress, and restraining overreach by       the executive branch.    In my view, these are precisely the qualities that a Supreme Court  Justice should embody.   I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record  following my remarks.   Our personal discussion allowed me to assess the judge's philosophy  and character. I told him that it was important to me that the  judiciary remain an independent check on the other two branches of  government as envisioned by our Founders. Therefore, I asked him  specifically whether anyone in the administration had asked him how he  would rule or sought any commitment from him on any issue. He was  unequivocal that no one in the administration had asked him for such  promises or to prejudge any issue that could come before him. He went  on to say that the day a nominee answered how he would rule on a matter  before it was heard or promised to overturn a legal precedent, that  would be the end of an independent judiciary.   During the Judiciary Committee hearings, when Senator Lindsey Graham  asked him a similar question about whether he was asked to make  commitments about particular cases or precedents, he gave the same  answer. In fact, Judge Gorsuch notably said that if someone had asked  for such a commitment, he would have left the room because it would  never be appropriate for a judge to make such a commitment, whether  asked to do so by the White House or a U.S. Senator.   Neil Gorsuch is not a judge who brings his personal views on any  policy issues into the courtroom. If it can be said that Judge Gorsuch  would bring a philosophy to the Supreme Court, it would be his respect  for the rule of law and his belief that no one is above the law,  including any President or any Senator.   I am convinced that Judge Gorsuch does not rule according to his  personal views, but rather follows the facts and the law wherever they  lead him, even if he is personally unhappy with the result. To  paraphrase his answer to one of my questions about putting aside his  personal views, he said that a judge who is happy with all of his  rulings is likely not a good judge.   The reverence that Judge Gorsuch holds for the separation of powers,  which is at the core of our American democracy, was also evident in our  discussion. As he reiterated throughout his confirmation hearing, the  duty to write the laws lies with Congress, not with the courts and not  with the executive branch. Members of this body should welcome his deep  respect for that fundamental principle.   Judge Gorsuch's record demonstrates that he is well within the  mainstream of judicial thought. He has joined in more than 2,700  opinions, 97 percent of which were unanimously decided, and he sided  with the majority 99 percent of the time.   I asked Judge Gorsuch how he approaches legal precedents. I asked him  if it would be sufficient to overturn a long-established precedent if  five current Justices believed that a previous decision was wrongly  decided. He responded: ``Emphatically no.'' And that, to me, is the  right approach. He said a good judge always starts with precedent and  presumes that the precedent is correct.   During his Judiciary Committee hearing, Judge Gorsuch described  precedent as ``the anchor of the law'' and ``the starting place for a  judge.'' He has also coauthored a book on legal precedent with 12 other  distinguished judges, for which Justice Stephen Breyer wrote the  introduction.   Now, there has been considerable discussion over the course of this  nomination process about the proper role of the courts in our  constitutional system of government. It is also important for us to  consider the roles that the executive and legislative branches play in  the nomination process.   Under the Constitution, the President has wide discretion when it  comes to nominations to the Supreme Court. The Senate's role is not to  ask, Is this the person whom I would have chosen to sit on the bench?  Rather, the Senate is charged with evaluating each nominee's  qualifications for serving on the Court.    I have heard opponents of this nominee criticize him for a variety of  reasons, including his methodology and charges that he is somehow  extreme or outside of the mainstream. But I have not heard one Senator  suggest that Judge Gorsuch lacks the intellectual ability, academic  credentials, integrity, temperament or experience to serve on the U.S.  Supreme Court. Yet it is exactly those characteristics that the Senate  should be evaluating when exercising its advice and consent duty.   This is especially true when Senators contemplate taking the extreme  step of filibustering a Supreme Court nomination. As you well know,  unfortunately, it has become Senate practice of late to filibuster  almost every question before this body simply as a matter of course.  But that would be a serious mistake in this case, and it would further  erode the ability of this great institution to function. In 2005, when  the Senate was mired in debate over how to proceed on judicial  nominations, a bipartisan group of 14 Senators proposed a simple and  reasonable standard. That group--of which I am proud to have been a  part--declared that for Federal court nominations a Senator should only  support a filibuster in the case of extraordinary circumstances.   Since coming to the Senate, I have voted to confirm four Justices to  the Supreme Court. Two were nominated by a Democratic President, and  two were nominated by a Republican President. Each was confirmed: Chief  Justice Roberts by a vote of 78 to 22, Justice Alito by a vote of 58 to  42, Justice Sotomayor by a vote of 68 to 31, and Justice Kagan by a  vote of 63 to 37.   Before I became a Senator, this body confirmed Justice Kennedy, 97 to  0; Justice Scalia, 98 to 0; Justice Thomas, 52 to 48; Justice Ginsburg,  96 to 3; and Justice Breyer, 87 to 9.   Note that two of the current members of the Supreme Court were  confirmed by fewer than 60 votes, but consistent with the standard that  we established in 2005, neither one was filibustered.   Even Robert Bork, whose contentious confirmation hearings are said to  have been the turning point in the Senate's treatment of Supreme Court  nominations, was rejected by a simple failure to secure a majority of  votes--42 yeas to 58 nays--not by a Senate filibuster. In fact, the  filibuster has been used successfully only once in modern history to  block a Supreme Court nomination. That was an attempt to elevate  Justice Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice in 1968, nearly half a century  ago. In that case, Justice Fortas ended up withdrawing under an ethical  cloud.  [[Page S2022]]    The result of the votes on Justice Alito's nomination are also  illuminating. In 2006 Senators voted to invoke cloture by a vote of 75  to 25. That is considerably more Senators than those who ultimately  voted to confirm him, which was accomplished by a vote of 58 to 42.  Here again, Senators proceeded to a ``yes'' or ``no'' vote on the  nomination.   Let me be clear. I do believe strongly that it is appropriate for the  Senate to use its advice and consent power to examine nominations  carefully or even to defeat them. In fact, I have voted against  judicial nominees of three Presidents. But playing politics with  judicial nominees is profoundly damaging to the Senate's reputation and  stature. It politicizes our judicial nomination process and threatens  the independence of our courts, which are supposed to be above partisan  politics. Perhaps most importantly, it undermines the public's  confidence in the judiciary.   Since the Founders protected against the exertion of political  influence on sitting Justices, the temptation to do everything in one's  power to pick nominees with the right views is understandably very  strong. But the more political Supreme Court appointments become, the  more likely it is that Americans will question the extent to which the  rule of law is being followed. It erodes confidence in the fair and  impartial system of justice, and it cultivates a suspicion that judges  are imposing their personal ideology.   The Senate has the responsibility to safeguard our Nation against a  politicized judiciary. The Senate should resist the temptation to  filibuster a Supreme Court nominee who is unquestionably qualified, the  temptation to abandon the traditions of comity and cooperation, and the  temptation to further erode the separation of powers by insisting on  judicial litmus tests. It is time for the Senate to rise above  partisanship and to allow each and every Senator to cast an up-or-down  vote on this nominee.   This nomination deserves to move forward, as the dozens of  distinguished Maine attorneys who wrote to me in support of his  nomination said:         In sum, during his tenure on the U.S. Court of Appeals,       Judge Gorsuch distinguished himself as a judge who follows       the law with no regard for politics or outside influence. We       could not ask for more in an associate Justice.    I agree, and I look forward to the confirmation of Judge Neil Gorsuch  to be a Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                     March 23, 2017.      Re: Nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch.       Hon. Susan M. Collins,      U.S. Senator, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.      Hon. Angus S. King,      U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.        Dear Senators Collins and King: The undersigned Maine       attorneys respectfully request that you support the       confirmation of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch as Associate Justice of       the United States Supreme Court.        Our practices are varied by geography, practice area, size       of firm, and type of clients we represent. We also hold a       diverse set of political views. Nonetheless, we agree that       Judge Gorsuch is exceptionally well qualified to join the       Supreme Court.        As members of the Maine legal community, we have an       interest in the nomination of Judge Gorsuch. While most of us       will never have the opportunity to appear before the United       States Supreme Court, each of us has a strong interest in       supporting the confirmation of highly qualified jurists who       will maintain the Supreme Court's commitment to the rule of       law. The precedents established by the Supreme Court affect       each of us and the fellow Mainers whom we serve as our       clients.        As you have surely found during the nomination process,       Judge Gorsuch is eminently qualified to serve as Associate       Justice. His qualifications were recently confirmed by the       American Bar Association, which rated him as ``well       qualified,'' its highest rating. Judge Gorsuch's judicial       record demonstrates his remarkable intelligence, his keen       ability to discern and resolve the central issues at dispute       in a legal proceeding, his notably clear and concise writing       style, and his dedication to the rule of law rather than       personal predilections. His judicial record also confirms       that he is committed to upholding the Constitution, enforcing       the statutes enacted by Congress, and restraining overreach       by the Executive Branch. He voted with the majority in 98       percent of the cases he heard on the Tenth Circuit, and was       frequently joined by judges appointed by Democratic       Presidents. Seven of his opinions have been affirmed by the       Supreme Court--four unanimously--and none reversed.        In sum, during his tenure on the U.S. Court of Appeals,       Judge Gorsuch distinguished himself as a judge who follows       the law with no regard for politics or outside influence. We       could not ask for more in an Associate Justice and we ask for       your strong support of him and vote of confirmation.            Sincerely,        John J. Aromando; Brett D. Baber; Shawn K. Bell; Daniel J.       Bernier; Fred W. Bopp III; Timothy J. Bryant; Aaron D.       Chadbourne; John W. Chapman; Michael J. Cianchette; Roger A.       Clement, Jr.; Randy J.

The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The Senator from Missouri.
