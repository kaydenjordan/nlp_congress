 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the memory  of my former colleague and State representative Edith Warren, who  passed away this past weekend at the age of 86.   Miss Edith's journey from a tobacco farm in Edgecombe County led to a  remarkable life of achievements and service. She shattered glass  ceilings. Miss Edith became the first woman to serve as a full-time  principal in the Pitt County school system, the first woman elected as  a Pitt County Commissioner, and the first woman to represent North  Carolina House District 8.   I had the privilege of working alongside Miss Edith and enjoyed every  bit of it, including her delicious cakes.   It was her 14-year tenure in the North Carolina House of  Representatives that further solidified her legacy. She was a champion  for eastern North Carolina education, and our beloved East Carolina  University.   Miss Edith's legacy will live on through her extraordinary  contributions.   Mr. Speaker, I extend my deepest condolences to her family.                            ____________________
