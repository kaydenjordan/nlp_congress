 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her  remarks.)    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, the LGBTQ  community cannot wait any longer for their full rights and equal  protection to be guaranteed across this country.   We must pass H.R. 5, the Equality Act.   Only 29 States have laws explicitly barring discrimination based on  sexual orientation in employment, housing, and public accommodations.  Only 20 States have these protections for gender identity. That is  unacceptable.   Being able to be your true self should not depend on where you live.  Your protections and equal rights should not depend on where you live.   All LGBTQ Americans deserve nothing less than full rights and equal  protection under the law, and that is exactly what the Equality Act  will do.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this historic  civil rights bill to guarantee full equality for all. It will be on the  floor later.                            ____________________
