 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a veterinary  clinic and dedicated doctor in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, both doing  their part to protect the health of service dogs in our community.   Service dogs greatly assist members of our community in innumerable  ways, providing companionship, helping individuals with special needs,  and serving as therapy dogs.   Recognizing their importance, Dr. Martha Low of the Center for Animal  Referral and Emergency Services, also known as CARES, is offering free  eye exams to service dogs. These critical exams protect the eyesight of  these animals and allow them to work in nursing homes, schools, and  other facilities where their services are needed.   I extend my sincerest appreciation to CARES and to Dr. Low. Organized  by the American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists, Dr. Low is one  of over 300 doctors who perform this work throughout the United States.  We are so grateful for all their work and their service to our  community.               Recognizing the Dominic Liples Scholarship Fund     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an extraordinary  family and community from Bucks County, Pennsylvania, that is working  to make our community a better place.   Earlier this month, Ciarlo Liples threw out the first pitch at the  baseball game between Central Bucks West and Pennridge high schools.  Ciarlo is the brother of Dominic Liples, an 8-year-old boy who  tragically succumbed to brain cancer in 2016.   Ciarlo and his family have since developed a close bond with the CB  West team and our entire community. The Liples family has turned their  tragedy and grief into strength.   Working with this team, the family helped establish the Dominic  Liples Scholarship Fund to award the senior baseball player who  represents Dominic's positive attitude and ability.   I applaud the Central Bucks High School West team. We wish them all  continued success this season.   I would also like to extend all our gratitude to the Liples family  and give Ciarlo and his parents, Ken and Kira, our heartfelt thanks on  behalf of everybody in our community.                       Recognizing Bowen's Barber Shop     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a small  business in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, for helping kids in our  community.   Bowen's Barber Shop in Newtown recently teamed up with the Bucks  County Intermediate Unit to give five young men with special needs  haircuts for their prom. In addition to their haircuts, these students  got the ability to interact and independently communicate with their  barber, giving them real-world experience and confidence.   Bowen's has been a longstanding, respected business in Newtown, and I  appreciate their contributions to our community.   I thank the owner of Bowen's, Tracey Bowen, for her generosity.   I would also like to extend my gratitude to Merri Kurman and the  Bucks County Intermediate Unit transition program for their work in  empowering individuals with special needs.   Our community thanks each and every one of these individuals and  organizations.                            ____________________
