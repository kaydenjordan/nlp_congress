 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to salute the Universal Health  Care Action Network, also known as UHCAN, for their energy and advocacy  to protect the Affordable Care Act.   I was honored to join UHCAN in a town hall where we presented our  message to men, women, families, and children from across central Ohio  who were eager to organize. Do you know why? To save the health care  for more than 22 million newly insured Americans, including nearly 1  million Ohioans, who gained coverage under the Affordable Care Act.   We heard personal stories, stories from Laura, Mindy, Rachel, and  Kevin Rhodes--who was my guest at the joint session of Congress right  here--on how the Affordable Care Act was saving their lives.   Mr. Speaker, yet, here we are tomorrow, on the seventh anniversary of  the Affordable Care Act, preparing to repeal and replace it with  Republican care; legislation which would push 24 million Americans off  their healthcare coverage, and give massive tax breaks to 400  superwealthy families, while the rest of us, we pay more for less.   Mr. Speaker, I join my constituents and Americans across the country  who oppose Republican care. Join me tomorrow and say ``no.''                            ____________________
