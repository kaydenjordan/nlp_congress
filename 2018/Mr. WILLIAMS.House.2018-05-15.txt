 Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this time to  recognize National Police Week, as well as National Peace Officers  Memorial Day.   This week allows us to take the time to honor local, State, and  Federal officers who have died or have been disabled in the line of  duty. This week is an opportunity to pay tribute to the important men  and women who have served our country and put our lives in front of  their own.   In 2017, 129 officers made the ultimate sacrifice. Of that, one of  them lived in the 25th District of Texas that I represent.   Mr. Speaker, I would like everyone to know the name of Deputy Mark  Gregory Deibold of the Tarrant County Constable's Office, Precinct 5.  Mark's watch ended on Thursday, September 7, 2017. This hero served his  community, State, and country well, and he is more than deserving of  our praise and recognition.   Thank you for your service, Mark.   May God bless this hero's family.   God bless the United States of America.   In God We Trust.                            ____________________
