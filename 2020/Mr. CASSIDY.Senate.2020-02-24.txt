 Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the  CEO and president of One Acadiana, 1A, Troy Wayman, and the entire 1A  organization for the distinguished honor of becoming an accredited  economic development organization, AEDO. 1A has joined the ranks of  only 66 economic groups in the world to earn the AEDO standing.   In 2015, the Greater Lafayette Chamber of Commerce's board of  directors ventured out to create an organization that would embody its  longstanding mission--to be the leading force in the improvement of the  business environment as well as the economic health and development of  the region. Over the last 5 years, 1A has grown to more than 800  investors, members, and partners while serving the 9-parish Acadiana  region. After a yearlong process, 1A was recognized and was awarded as  an AEDO, cementing its place among the best of the best in the  industry.   Being honored and recognized by the International Economic  Development Council, IEDC, as an AEDO speaks volumes to who they are as  an organization. The dedication and passion that drives these members  is a testament to their organization and speaks volumes to all of  Louisiana. Congratulations, One Acadiana, on becoming an AEDO. I look  forward to witnessing what the future holds for 1A and the entire  Acadiana region.                            ____________________
