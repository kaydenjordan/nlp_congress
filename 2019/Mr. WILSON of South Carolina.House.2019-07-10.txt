 Madam Speaker, in a climate of endless  negative attacks, it is refreshing to read ``President Trump Is  Delivering'' by the respected national columnist Star Parker in the  Aiken Standard on June 24.   She has correctly identified success as being three criteria, the  Constitution, Christianity, and capitalism.   ``On all three fronts, Donald Trump is making America great again.  The Supreme Court now has a solid conservative majority,'' with the  environment friendly to Christian values to restore respect for life  and family.   Regarding the third C, Harvard economist Robert Barro estimates that  the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act added almost a third over the average  GDP growth rate in the Obama years.   ``Optimism among the Nation's small businesses is surging, according  to the recent National Federation of Independent Business Small  Business Optimism Index,'' with record-low unemployment among Hispanics  and African Americans.   ``President Trump's courage to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of  Israel has changed the face of the Middle East . . . for the better.''   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Georgia for yielding this time. I appreciate his leadership.    H.R. 553, the Military Surviving Spouses Equity Act, is a bipartisan  bill with over 365 cosponsors. In fact, it is rare that a bill garners  this many cosponsors and was amongst the first to reach the new  threshold for mandatory consideration under the Consensus Calendar. I  am grateful that colleagues on both sides of the aisle support this  legislation to repeal the ``widow's tax.''   Thank you to all of the surviving spouses and advocates who have  worked diligently and tirelessly on this legislation. The bill would  have been eligible for a vote this Friday.   Instead, Democratic leadership has decided to specifically bar this  bill from independent consideration and include it in the flawed,  partisan NDAA. In fact, the rule for the NDAA specifically states:         Rule XV of the Consensus Calendar shall not apply with       respect to H.R. 553.    Democratic leadership has essentially said, if the NDAA does not  pass, the widow's tax doesn't pass.   Further, leadership has put this bill at risk of the conference with  the Senate. Democratic leadership knows that it is not included in the  Senate's version of the NDAA, and I am disappointed with the other  side.   I even offered a bipartisan amendment with Chairman John Yarmuth to  have this legislation be included in the NDAA, but they did not make  that amendment in order. Instead, Democrats placed their own amendment  in a partisan rule and are forcing the stand-alone bill to be barred  from the Consensus Calendar.   This is partisan politics at its worst. This is heartbreaking for the  65,000 military widows who have worked tirelessly and very effectively  to mobilize support behind the bill.   At the peak of their hopes that this bill would pass the United  States House of Representatives this week, leadership now has put the  bill in jeopardy. Instead of supporting our military and the military  families, including those who have died and sacrificed for this  country, the majority has chosen to violate their own rules and put the  bill in jeopardy. This tactic cheapens the efforts of these military  widows by turning their real-world plight into a partisan tactic.   A stand-alone bill in the Senate with over 365 House cosponsors would  have had a better chance of passing and sent a clear and overwhelming  message of support to these widows. Instead, we will be sending this  over in a partisan bill, almost ensuring its demise in the Senate. This  is a disservice to the widows who deserve better.   I am grateful for Ranking Member Tom Cole, who argued against making  H.R. 553 as part of this self-executing rule. He is right that this  shortcuts the process and is politics at its worse.   Our team followed the rules the Democrats set forth to have this  overwhelmingly bipartisan piece of legislation set for a vote, and they  decided to play partisan politics and remove it. Further, the Rules  Committee failed to notify my staff and even failed to notify the  community that would be most directly impacted by their actions: the  widows who have worked tirelessly to generate support for H.R. 553.   The community, inspired by veterans service organizations, gave all,  and this Congress can't even follow its own rules. It is sad how the  majority has undermined this important bill in the manner they have  done.   Barring this bill from independent consideration is outright wrong,  and I ask that each of my Democratic and Republican colleagues think  long and hard about the implications of this parliamentary gimmick.
