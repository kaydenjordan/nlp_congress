 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the  package of en bloc amendments. These amendments continue to go down a  path that is partisan and unnecessary.   I also strongly oppose the underlying bill, H.R. 1, the so-called For  the People Act.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 1 would retract the hard work that States such as  Oklahoma have done to improve our election laws.   When I served in the Oklahoma State Legislature, we implemented  requirements to ensure the security of our elections in our State.  However, H.R. 1 includes a Federal mandate that would take away the  ability of States to oversee and manage their own elections.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from Paul Ziriax, the  secretary of the Oklahoma State Election Board, in which he raises  serious concerns that H.R. 1 would supersede most of Oklahoma's  election laws.                                  Oklahoma State Election Board,                               Oklahoma City, OK, February 25, 2021.      Hon. Jim Inhofe, United States Senator.      Hon. James Lankford, United States Senator.      Hon. Kevin Hern, United States Representative, District 1.      Hon. Markwayne Mullin, United States Representative, District         2.      Hon. Frank Lucas, United States Representative, District 3.      Hon. Tom Cole, United States Representative, District 4.      Hon. Stephanie Bice, United States Representative, District         5.        To the Honorable Members of the Oklahoma Congressional       Delegation: As Oklahoma's chief election official, I am       writing to make you aware of my concerns regarding H.R. 1, as       introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives, and its U.S.       Senate companion, S. 1.        H.R. 1's election administration component would result in       an unnecessary federal takeover of election administration       policy across the nation. One sponsor's stated goal of this       legislation is to ``overcome rampant voter suppression''--yet       I have seen no evidence of such rampant ``suppression'' here       in our state.        H.R. 1 would supersede most of Oklahoma's election       administration and election integrity laws, making our       elections less secure, more complicated to administer, and       much more expensive to conduct. Although H.R. 1 claims to       only apply to ``federal'' elections, almost all elections       here could be affected because Oklahoma's state and county       elections are held on the same dates as federal elections.        Although the concerns with H.R. 1 are too numerous to       provide an exhaustive list in this letter, there are some       fairly amazing levels of micromanagement of elections in this       legislation: from requiring ``self-sealing'' return       envelopes, to setting the number of days of ``early'' voting,       to mandating that new state voting systems be capable of       ``ranked choice'' elections, to dictating how close voting       locations must be to public transportation stops.        H.R. 1 is incompatible with many of Oklahoma's existing       state laws. For example, Oklahoma law requires that federal       elections must be certified one week after the date of the       election. But H.R. 1 disregards such deadlines, requiring       absentee ballots to be accepted and counted 10 days after       Election Day--which is three days after the state must       certify the election results.        This legislation takes direct aim at Oklahoma's existing       election integrity laws, making it virtually impossible for       election officials to verify the identity of in-person and       mail absentee voters, requiring states to allow untrackable       absentee ballot harvesting, mandating voter registration by       telephone, and making it nearly impossible to prevent double       voting by allowing voters to vote anywhere in the state       whether they are registered to vote at that location or not.       In an H.R. 1 world, Oklahoma election officials would have no       means to reassure the electorate that an election is fraud-      free.        Other provisions will add great uncertainty to elections in       Oklahoma, such as the requirement that tribal leaders can       determine certain voting locations on tribal land--which       given the recent U.S. Supreme Court's McGirt decision, might       be interpreted as most of the State of Oklahoma.        Finally, H.R. 1 does not include realistic timelines for       implementing its election administration changes. By our       estimation, implementing even a few of its major provisions       might take years--yet H.R. 1 demands that dozens of major new       election administration policies and technologies be put in       place in time for the 2022 elections. This is setting up       election officials for failure, and I fear that many       experienced election administrators in our state may quit or       retire rather than attempting the near-impossible task of       implementing the provisions of H.R. 1 should it become law.        There are legitimate disagreements about election policies.       In fact, most states have very different election procedures.       This is by design. Under the Constitution and our federal       system of government, it is the responsibility of State       Legislatures to determine the time, manner and place of       elections. Congress should not attempt to implement a one-      size-fits-all set of election rules for the states. For this       reason, it seems likely that the enactment of H.R. 1 would       almost certainty lead to costly and lengthy litigation.        If you or your staff would like to discuss this issue       further, please feel free to contact me. Thank you.            Sincerely,                                            Paul Ziriax, Secretary,                                     Oklahoma State Election Board.    Madam Speaker, the Constitution is clear that  [[Page H996]]  States prescribe the time, places, and manner of holding elections.   While the majority claims that this is a bill to reform our political  system, the reality is that the changes in this bill would likely lead  to a greater incidence of voter fraud and would deprive States of the  right to oversee the administration of their own elections.
