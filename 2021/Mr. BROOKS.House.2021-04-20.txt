 Madam Speaker, earlier this month, employees at Amazon's  Bessemer, Alabama, fulfillment facility rejected unionization by a  1,798-738 vote. That is a monumental 70 percent against unions to a  meager 30 percent for unions.   Bam. That kind of vote sends a powerful anti-union, pro-liberty  message to America and the world.   I applaud Amazon's Bessemer employees for rejecting unionization  attempts by out-of-state agitators, from the President to Hollywood  actors and on down. A primary reason why Amazon chose to locate nearly  6,000 good-paying jobs in Alabama is Alabama's nonunion reputation.   Alabama maintains that reputation after Bessemer's overwhelming anti- union vote, thus ensuring even more companies will relocate even more  good-paying jobs from union States up north into Alabama.   Alabama is a right-to-work State.   What does ``right to work'' mean?   Right-to-work laws protect citizens from being forced against their  will to join a union, pay union dues, and subject themselves to union  bosses.   Alabama's right-to-work status gives Alabama a strong economic  advantage over forced union States. For example, 69 percent of jobs  reshored from overseas back into America between 2010 and 2019 have  gone to right-to-work States. U.S. Commerce Department data, adjusted  for cost-of-living differences, revealed that 2019's manufacturing job  pay in right-to-work States averaged $83,000 per employee, $4,000 more  than in forced union States. That is a big difference in pay.   According to Bureau of Labor Statistics data, right-to-work States'  overall job growth was a robust 11 percent over the past decade versus  a meager 2.4 percent in forced union States. When that data is limited  to manufacturing jobs only, right-to-work States, over the past decade,  enjoyed a very good 9.1 percent increase in manufacturing jobs while  forced union States had a horrible two-tenths of 1 percent cut in  manufacturing jobs.   Better yet, 2018 Census data reveals that after-tax mean income per  household, after cost-of-living adjustment, was $64,572 in right-to- work States versus $60,244 in forced union States. That is, on average,  $4,328 more real, adjusted for cost of living, income per capita in  right-to-work versus union States. That is a huge difference.   So, Madam Speaker, the economic data clearly proves that right-to- work laws benefit workers. Consistent with that economic prosperity and  desire for  [[Page H1963]]  freedom and liberty--after all, no one likes being told what they can  and cannot do--74 percent of Americas say they support right-to-work  laws, according to a recent Gallup Poll.   Despite overwhelming American support for right-to-work laws,  dictatorial Socialists in March rammed through the House a bill that  repeals all right-to-work laws in America. Worse yet, dictatorial  Socialists seek to use President Biden's infrastructure bill to slip in  a provision that repeals all right-to-work laws in America.   I hope neither of these terrible dictatorial bills ever reaches  President Biden's desk. Certainly, I will vote against them and I will  vote for freedom, liberty, and protection of America's right-to-work  laws.   Madam Speaker, America would be stronger if more States would enact  right-to-work laws. I encourage citizens and elected officials to  promote right-to-work laws, freedom of choice, and the freedom and  liberty right-to-work laws represent.                            ____________________
