 Mr. President, I rise today in tribute to the late  Thomas Hugh Seymour for his service to the Occupational Safety and  Health Administration and the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights.   Mr. Seymour's illustrious career spanned two decades as the OCWR Fire  Protection Engineer and Safety and Health consulting expert. His  journey was marked by the highest levels of dedication, expertise, and  passion for workplace safety, and his work has helped to save lives.  Prior to his role at OCWR, Mr. Seymour had a distinguished career at  OSHA, where he ascended to the position of Deputy Director for the  Directorate of Safety Standards Programs. During his tenure at OSHA,  Mr. Seymour played an instrumental role in shaping and drafting  critical safety standards that have since become integral to  safeguarding workplaces nationwide. He was an advocate for safer  working conditions and a guardian of fire safety. This year, Mr.  Seymour received a posthumous Safety Advocate Award from the Office of  Congressional Workplace Rights and National Safety Council.   I offer my heartfelt gratitude to Mr. Seymour's family for his  service and also recognize all the distinguished recipients of the  Office of Congressional Workplace Rights' 2023 Safety Recognition  Awards. May their dedication continue to guide us as we strive to  create workplaces that are safe and accessible.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to  a dedicated public servant and champion of our agricultural community,  Jeremy Criss. With over 30 years of unwavering service to Montgomery  County, Mr. Criss has proven himself to be an indispensable asset not  only to his community but also to the State of Maryland as a tireless  advocate for our farmers.   What sets Mr. Criss apart is not just his deep understanding of what  our farmers do but, more importantly, why they do it. He has always  recognized that agriculture is not just an occupation; it is a way of  life, a vital pillar of our society. As the director of agricultural  services for Montgomery County, MD, Mr. Criss's commitment to the  betterment of our society through agriculture has been nothing short of  exceptional.   Under Mr. Criss's leadership, the Montgomery County Office of  Agriculture has been a beacon of support for farmers, offering  invaluable resources and guidance, allowing our agricultural community  not only to survive but also to thrive. Mr. Criss's personal commitment  to the cause of agriculture is evident to anyone who knows him. He has  not only been a director but also a friend and mentor to many in our  farming community, offering guidance and a listening ear during both  good times and challenging ones. His kindness and unwavering support  have made him a beloved figure among our farmers and greater community,  and his absence will be keenly felt.   I commend Mr. Criss for the invaluable contributions he has made to  our agricultural community. His legacy is one of dedication, passion,  and a deep love for the land and the people who work it. Montgomery  County, the State of Maryland, and our farmers are stronger today  because of Mr. Criss, and I congratulate him and wish him a well- earned, enjoyable, and fulfilling retirement.                            ____________________
