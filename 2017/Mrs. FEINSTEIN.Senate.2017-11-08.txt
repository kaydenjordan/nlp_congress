 Mr. President, for the last month, in the wake of the  tragedy in Las Vegas, I have been asking my colleagues to show some  courage, stand up to the gun lobby, and take weapons of war off of our  streets.   Now, we have all had to bear witness to another tragedy. Three days  ago, in Sutherland Springs, Texas, a single person armed with an  assault rifle murdered 26 people and left another 20 injured. This  gunman walked into a church and opened fire on peaceful churchgoers,  including children as young as 18-months old. A helpless toddler who  barely learned to walk. Eight members of a single family were also  lost. Eight.   The shooter had 15 magazine clips of ammunition--almost 450 rounds-- and used all of them. Ask yourself: how would you feel in those  moments, with hundreds of bullets flying around and not knowing whether  you will live or die, or whether you will be able to protect your  child? Think about those children--terrified, witnessing their families  being shot while in a place of worship. It is time that we ask what  this says about us as a country. And what does this say about us to the  rest of the world.   In 1996, after a mass shooting where a gunman opened fire on tourists  at the sea side in Port Arthur, killing 35 people, Australia acted  swiftly. Twelve days later, Australia's government enacted sweeping gun  control measures. Since then, there has not been a single mass shooting  in that country since. Mass shootings in America, however, have become  common place. It is no longer a matter of if, but when, another one  will happen.   If there are now mass shootings in churches, where are we safe  anymore? Not concerts, not schools, not holiday parties. Just a month  ago, we experienced the worst mass shooting in our nation's history in  Las Vegas. A gunman opened fire with multiple semi-automatic assault  rifles that he had legally transformed into automatic weapons, killing  more than fifty people and leaving more than 500 wounded. Among the  victims were mothers, fathers, brothers, and sisters.   There was Kelsey Meadows, 28 years old, who after graduating from the  University of California, Fresno, returned to her hometown of Taft,  California to be a substitute teacher at her alma mater, Taft Union  High School. She was described by the high school principal as ``smart,  compassionate, and kind'' with a ``sweet spirit and a love for  children.'' Her entire family and community was completely devastated.  Kelsey could have been any of us attending that concert. My own  daughter told me after the Las Vegas shooting that she was supposed to  be in the city that evening, but her plans had to change. It was only a  little more than a year before the Las Vegas shooting that we  experienced what had then been the worst mass shooting in our nation's  history.   That was when 49 people who were enjoying an evening of dancing with  friends and loved ones were massacred in Orlando. Victims in Orlando  included 22-year old Luis Velma who was working at Universal Studios on  a Harry Potter ride. There was also Eddie Justice, a 30-year old  accountant who texted his mother from the shooting, telling her:  ``Mommy I love you.'' ``In club they shooting.'' ``He has us.''   I encourage every member of this chamber to imagine receiving those  text messages from their son or daughter.   And just six months before that, 14 people were killed and more than  20 injured in San Bernardino, California at a work holiday party.   Among the victims was a father of six. A mother of three. A woman who  was eight when she and her mother left Vietnam for a better life in  America. The youngest victim was 26, and the oldest was 60.   The list goes on and on. Eight murdered at the Umpqua Community  College in Roseburg, Oregon. A police officer and two innocent citizens  brutally murdered by a man with an AK-47 style weapon in Colorado  Springs. In 2013, 12 people fatally shot at the Navy Yard, less than  two miles from where I stand today. And on December 14, 2012, 20  children had their lives taken at Sandy Hook Elementary School.  Children.   Once again, I encourage every member of this body to imagine dropping  their young child off at elementary school this morning, only to learn  a few hours later that a gunman walked into that school and tried to  kill as many people as possible. That is something we could have  prevented. But we did not. Instead, we have made it easier for those  with mental health issues to get guns. I often remember Sandy Hook and  think about how we let these families down. We failed them. And sadly,  the mass shootings have continued to get worse in terms of frequency  and lives lost. And I will not sit by while these killings continue.   That is why today I am joining with my colleagues to reintroduce  legislation to prohibit the sale, transfer, manufacture, and  importation of assault weapons and large capacity ammunition feeding  devices that can accept more than ten rounds. I will keep doing this.  This legislation must constantly be before this body until it is  enacted. Every member must make a decision whether to stand up or let  the National Rifle Association win again.   This legislation is not perfect. But it is part of the solution. We  must start with reducing the supply of the weapons of war that are used  to take the lives of our loved ones.   The deadly assault weapons used by the attackers in each of the  devastating shootings I have mentioned would have been banned under the  Assault Weapons Ban bill that I am introducing today. The new  legislation is based off of legislation we previously introduced  following the horrific attack committed against young school  [[Page S7119]]  children in Newtown, Connecticut. It will provide much needed fixes to  the law to keep our communities safer, while also protecting the rights  of lawful gun owners.   Back when we enacted the 1994 legislation, that law prohibited  semiautomatic weapons with a detachable magazine and at least two  military characteristics. The bill we are introducing today tightens  this test to prohibit semiautomatic rifles, handguns, and shotguns that  can accept a detachable magazine and have one military characteristic.  This is the standard employed in my home state of California--and it  works.   Based on the 10 years of experience from the 1994 law, we learned  that the ``two-characteristic'' test was too easy to ``work around'': a  manufacturer could simply remove one of the characteristics, and the  firearm was legal. The bill we are introducing today will close that  loophole. The bill also prohibits ``bullet buttons'', a feature that  certain manufacturers developed to evade restrictions on detachable  ammunition magazines. In San Bernardino, the assault rifles originally  contained ``bullet buttons'' for their magazine clips--which enabled  them to avoid California's assault weapons ban. Our bill contains  language to close this loophole.   This bill also prohibits ``bump-fire stocks'', which, as we saw in  Las Vegas, allows individuals to convert semi-automatic rifles to  function like a machine gun.   Other changes to the 1994 bill include updating the list of  specifically-named military-style firearms that are prohibited, to  account for new models developed since 1994; prohibiting semiautomatic  rifles and handguns with a fixed magazine that can accept more than 10  rounds; adding a ban on the importation of assault weapons and large- capacity magazines; and eliminating the 10-year sunset that allowed the  original law to expire. Importantly, our legislation also prohibits  large-capacity ammunition feeding devices capable of accepting more  than 10 rounds.   Now, let me tell you what the bill will not do.   It will not affect hunting or sporting firearms. Instead, the bill  protects hunters and sportsmen by exempting 2,258 firearms used for  hunting or sporting purposes and exempting antique, manually-operated,  and permanently disabled weapons. The bill protects the rights of  existing gun owners by grandfathering weapons legally possessed on the  date of enactment. The bill also imposes a safe storage requirement for  grandfathered firearms to ensure they don't get into the hands of  people who would be prohibited from possessing them.   While the bill permits the continued possession of high-capacity  ammunition magazines that are legally possessed on the date of  enactment, it would ban the future transfer of these magazines.   Finally, the bill allows local jurisdictions to use existing federal  Byrne JAG grant money to support voluntary buy-back programs for  grandfathered assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition feeding  devices.   Opponents charge that this legislation impinges upon rights protected  by the Second Amendment. I disagree.   The Supreme Court expressly held in District of Columbia v. Heller  that ``the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited.''  The Court made it clear that reasonable regulations are allowable under  the Constitution.   This bill is simply establishing reasonable regulations for what  types of weapons may be sold and used--individuals should not own a  nuclear weapon, they should not own a rocket launcher, and they should  not own a military-style assault weapon.   In fact, a number of courts have considered challenges to assault  weapons bans. To date, every court that has considered a ban on assault  weapons or large capacity magazines has upheld the law as reasonable.   In fact, the D.C. Circuit, the Second Circuit, the Fourth Circuit,  the Seventh Circuit, the Ninth Circuit, as well as a number of federal  district courts have all upheld laws like the one we are proposing.   Importantly, the Supreme Court let stand the ruling out of the  Seventh Circuit upholding a local ban on assault weapons and high  capacity magazines from the City of Highland Park, Illinois.   Mr. President, I believe very strongly that the most important duty  that government has to its citizens is to protect the nation and the  safety of its people.   When 26 churchgoers are killed in cold blood with their loved ones in  a Baptist Church on a Sunday morning, we fail them by not making sure  that they can worship in peace.   When 58 people attending a concert in Las Vegas lose their lives  because a madman was able to use laws on the books to make his semi- automatic rifle into a machinegun, all of those who sit in this chamber  have failed them.   When 14 people are gunned down during a holiday party by those with  assault rifles that let off 65-75 rounds within minutes, our government  has failed them.   When 20 elementary school children are slaughtered by an assault  weapon, America has failed them.   The firearms used in these massacres are weapons of war. Let me say  it as plainly as I can: weapons of war do not belong on our streets, in  our churches, in our schools, in our malls, in our theaters, or in our  workplaces.   Now, I am under no illusions--I know that the gun lobby has a  stranglehold on this building. I know we got 40 votes in 2013, and I  know Republicans control the Senate today. But I also know this was  hard-fought in 1994, and we prevailed--with Republican support--and it  was a bipartisan vote. I still believe that, at some point, Americans  will come together and realize that we can be a nation that protects  its people from the savagery of these weapons.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I thank the chair, and I  yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, for the last month, in the wake of the  tragedy in Las Vegas, I have been asking my colleagues to show some  courage, stand up to the gun lobby, and take weapons of war off of our  streets.
