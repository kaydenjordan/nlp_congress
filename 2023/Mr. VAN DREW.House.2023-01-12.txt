 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for yielding. We  are proud of you, and I look forward to working with you.   You guys have got to be kidding me. Seriously?   You were in control. You had the House. You had the Senate. You had  the Presidency. If you thought there were any good bills or good ideas  to stop this or bills that were better than anything we are  putting forward, why didn't you do them? You had the control.    You didn't need us for a whole lot of other things. You voted and  rammed through things that we didn't want, rammed things through that  were radical, and yet, this commonsense type of legislation, nothing  happened. You can't be serious. That is a bad argument.   Since there has been one-party rule in Washington--Democratic rule-- Republicans were forced to watch President Biden drain more than 250  million barrels, nearly 40 percent--40 percent--of our petroleum  reserve. This puts our national security at risk. It puts the American  people at risk.   For our military, what will they do if they need the petroleum  reserve?   For Americans, what will they do when natural disasters strike, and  their town needs the petroleum reserve?   For our rescue and emergency personnel, what will they do if they  need the petroleum reserve?   Why would anyone ever vote against this bill?   Maybe if you want to lower gas prices temporarily for political gain,  you would oppose this bill.   Make a choice. Do what is right. Vote for this bill.
