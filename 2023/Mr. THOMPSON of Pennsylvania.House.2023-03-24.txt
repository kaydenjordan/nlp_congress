 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the St. Marys Area Middle School Team Renaissance Club whose Mini-THON  event raised a record $18,281 for the fight against childhood cancer in  March.   Inspired by Penn State's THON, the daylong event took place during  the school day and included hourly themes such as beach, carnival, and  glow hours.   The event included numerous events for students and staff, including  cornhole, bingo, karaoke, a photo booth, and the student favorite,  ``Silly String Your Principal Challenge.''   Although students at St. Marys Area Middle School have demonstrated  their dedication and generosity through the Mini-THON for many years  now, this year's event was even more special since local toddler Reggie  Housley is currently battling leukemia.   Proceeds from the Mini-THON will benefit Four Diamonds, a Hershey- based organization that pays 100 percent of noncovered medical expenses  for childhood cancer patients at Penn State Health Children's Hospital.   I commend the St. Marys Area Middle School Team Renaissance Club for  the extraordinary success of their Mini-THON and the entire St. Marys  community for their kindness and generosity in the fight against  childhood cancer.                            ____________________
