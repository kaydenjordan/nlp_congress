 Madam Speaker, dammit, I am going to miss my friend Don  Young. My other close friend, Representative Higgins and I, we sat next  to him pretty much every single day for nearly the last 6 years, and I  can tell everybody that for every story that you have heard about bears  and bear traps and snowshoeing and dog sledding and Iditarods and  eagles and hunting and everything else that you heard about him, there  are a dozen stories that you have not heard but you wish you heard.  They were that good.   He was resilient. He was a mountain of a man, as you have heard from  everybody. He was a fearless friend, and the only thing that he loved  more than his country and his State of Alaska was his family and his  wife, Anne, and that all encompassed just one of the most incredible  men I have ever had the honor of knowing.    My friend, Don Young, we are going to miss you, and may you rest in  peace, my friend.
