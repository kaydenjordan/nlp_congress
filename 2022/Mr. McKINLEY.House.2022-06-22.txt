 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of en bloc No. 2,  which includes an amendment to report, track, and take action on  suspicious orders.   While the COVID-19 pandemic raged through our population and  dominated the headlines, the opioid epidemic exploded exponentially,  silently claiming the lives of tens of thousands of Americans every  year. Recent CDC data shows that the overdose death rate for last year  was over 103,000 citizens.   In 2017, the Energy and Commerce Committee conducted a comprehensive  bipartisan investigation into opioid dumping in West Virginia.  Outrageous details came to light, exposing how drug shipments in rural  West Virginia went unconstrained. For example, over 2 million opioids  were sent to a little town of 3,000 people.   Another example: Even after a distributor found numerous red flags  during his site visit, nearly 1.5 million doses of opioids were still  shipped to a single pharmacy in Kermit, West Virginia, with a  population of 406.   The report that was filed by the Energy and Commerce Committee  details failures on the part of both DEA and the distributors to  identify and halt suspicious orders. Distributors felt they didn't have  the authority to halt suspicious orders and could have been subject to  lawsuits.    As recommended in the report, this amendment not only requires the  distributors to report suspicious orders but also to investigate the  situation and decline to fill the order if it is warranted.   American communities deserve to be treated better. This influx of  illegal drugs must be stopped, and this amendment is a step in the  right direction.   Madam Speaker, I urge Members to adopt this amendment.
