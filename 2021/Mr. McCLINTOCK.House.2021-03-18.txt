 Mr. Speaker, last year, we finally achieved  operational control of our southern border for the first time in  decades. The Trump administration had made it clear that our border  would be enforced, and illegal immigration dropped dramatically.   That all ended on January 20, when Joe Biden issued executive orders  to stop deporting illegal immigrants, abandon the border wall, admit  anyone claiming to be under 18, and rescinding the Remain in Mexico  policy for asylum claims. That message has been heard loud and clear.   The Border Patrol reported more than 100,000 encounters in February  alone. Think about that. That is the entire population of South Bend,  Indiana, or Green Bay, Wisconsin, in a single month, and it is getting  worse.   We are way beyond the debate over whether this is a border crisis.  The question now is whether we have a border at all.   What is the Democrats' response? This bill promises a path to  citizenship not only for 700,000 DACA recipients but millions more who  illegally arrived prior to January 1, were under 19 when they arrived,  and have only committed two misdemeanors.   How do they prove they qualify, Mr. Speaker? Under this bill, it  means having a friend vouch for you.   Now, we all sympathize with those illegally brought here as young  children years ago, and more than 200 Republicans supported legislation  in the 115th Congress to give them legal status. But it included  measures that secured our border and enforced our laws to discourage  another generation of young people being brought here exactly as we are  seeing unfold today.   Why are so many children being placed in the hands of Mexican  criminal cartels and forced to suffer the 2,000-mile trail of terror to  our border? Because it works.   Mr. Speaker, this bill proves the Mexican crime cartels are right:  You will be admitted into our country and need only wait for the next  amnesty.    Madam Speaker, it was no accident that when we  finally won control of the border and cut the flow of low-wage labor,  Americans saw the strongest wage growth in 40 years, the lowest  unemployment rate in 50 years, and the lowest poverty rate in 60 years.  For the first time in decades, the wage gap between rich and poor  narrowed.   Now, this bill extends amnesty, green cards, and a path to  citizenship to somewhere between 1 and 2\1/2\ million illegal  immigrants now working in agriculture and their families in a manner  that will depress wages, not just in agriculture, but in every field of  the economy for years to come.   Madam Speaker, if you obeyed the law and came here legally to work,  then you cannot qualify as a certified agricultural worker. You must  have come here illegally, and you must have worked here illegally for  at least 1,035 hours in the last 2 years. That is about 13 40-hour  workweeks a year. You get legal status for yourself and your family for  the next 5\1/2\ years. You can get indefinite extensions as long as you  work in agriculture 575 hours or about 14 weeks a year. If you do this  for between 4 and 8 years and you get a green card, then your family  gets green cards and you are on a 5-year path to citizenship. The green  cards give you the right to work in direct competition with American  workers in any sector of the economy.   Madam Speaker, let me emphasize that if you came here legally and  worked the same hours, then you are out of luck. If you obeyed the  laws, well, you are just a schmuck.   It utterly escapes me how America's working families are helped by  flooding the labor market with millions of low-wage workers under this  program. As these workers get green cards, they are sure to move from  agriculture to high-paying jobs, ensuring a continuous need for new  agricultural workers to replace them.   Between the two immigration bills today, somewhere north of 4 million  illegal immigrants will qualify for amnesty, legal employment, and a  path to citizenship as a reward for breaking our laws.   Is it any wonder that our Border Patrol is now completely overwhelmed  as millions of economic refugees rush our border in expectation of the  same rewards?   This bill would bring a tragic end to the blue-collar economic boom  that President Trump proudly announced on this floor just a year ago.  Here is the real tragedy: During the Trump blue-collar boom, the  poorest Americans were making the greatest gains, and it is precisely  these American families who will be the most harmed by these amnesty  bills.   Trump had their back. Biden is on their backs.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Arizona (Mr. Biggs).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Roy).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Texas an  additional 30 seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Hice).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I can assure the gentlewoman from Texas that we are outraged by the  fact that this administration's policies and pronouncements have  encouraged thousands upon thousands of children to be placed on that  trail of terror in the hands of Mexican criminal cartels and brought  here on the expectation of admission, an expectation that this  administration is fulfilling.   I must also assure the gentlewoman that this certainly is an amnesty  bill. It allows anyone who is here illegally, who can claim to have  worked the equivalent of 13 40-hour weeks over 2 years, legal status,  amnesty. The documentation can be as little as having a friend vouch  for them.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas.    Madam Speaker, reclaiming my time.   This only applies to illegal aliens. If you are legally here, obeying  our laws, you are out of luck with this bill. What this bill says is,  if you are here illegally and can have a friend vouch for you that you  worked 1,000 hours over the last 2 years in agriculture--again, that is  the equivalent of 13 40-hour weeks--you get legal status.   This is one of the many reasons why we are seeing this response from  around the world now flooding our southern border.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Indiana (Mrs. Spartz).    Madam Speaker, no one disputes that this bill is a  huge windfall to big agriculture. The problem is that it comes at the  expense of American workers.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman  from Wisconsin (Mr. Tiffany).    Will the gentleman yield?    Not this session, no.    Madam Speaker, I would remind this Speaker that Cesar  Chavez was one of the most outspoken adversaries to illegal  immigration, precisely because he knew what that did to depress the  wages of the legal immigrants that he represented through the United  Farm Workers.   I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson),  the ranking member of the Committee on Agriculture.    I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California  (Mr. LaMalfa).    Madam Speaker, I would just point out, the last 30  seconds was on the time of the gentleman from New York. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Davidson).    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs. Fischbach).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire of my friend from  California if she has any additional speakers?    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Just yesterday, the Secretary of Homeland Security told the Homeland  Security Committee that the border is secure. The Secretary said the  border is secure, despite saying only 1 day earlier that the Department  of Homeland Security is on pace to encounter more individuals on the  southwest border than we have in the last 20 years.   He said the border is secure, despite a 590 percent increase in the  number of family units crossing the border in the first 6 weeks of the  Biden administration.   He said the border is secure, despite Customs and Border Protection  referring over 7,300 unaccompanied alien minors to the Department of  Health and Human Services during the month of February. That is the  highest number of referrals in any February in the history of the  program.                                time  1530    He said the border is secure despite the Biden administration's plan  to use the Dallas Convention Center to house thousands of the  unaccompanied minors who the cartels have smuggled across the border.   No matter what Secretary Mayorkas says, the fact is the border is not  secure, and it is not secure because of President Biden's dangerous  immigration policies.   We know that when foreign nationals think they can easily get into  the U.S. and be rewarded with legal status, which is what this bill  does, they flood the border.   We are watching that happen before our eyes. Aliens are flooding the  border in response to the President's rhetoric and policies and in  response to the promises of additional rewards made through bills like  this.   Talk of amnesty fuels border crossings. That is a fact.   This bill grants amnesty and a special path to U.S. citizenship to at  least 1 million farmworkers currently in the United States. I have seen  estimates that go up to 2\1/2\ million--nobody really knows--as well as  to their spouses and children.   This bill allows aliens to get green cards even if they illegally  reentered the U.S., committed immigration fraud, voted illegally in a  Federal or State election, or have two serious misdemeanor convictions.   The supporters of this bill claim that illegal aliens who get green  cards must work in agriculture. However, the bill includes broad waiver  authority that allows those who did not complete all the work  requirements because of weather conditions or COVID or if the alien was  fired, among other situations, to still get a green card.   Those legalized under this bill would, from the outset, compete  directly for jobs with Americans. Nothing in this bill prevents those  who get employment authorization during the initial process from  working in nonagricultural labor sectors. And of course, once they and  their family members get a green card, as provided under this  legislation, they are free to work wherever they want.   This bill sends a powerful message and an invitation to those who  cross our borders illegally that they can expect to be rewarded with  legal status and, ultimately, green cards and an expedited path to  citizenship.   But far worse than that, it floods our market with low-wage labor at  a time when Americans are struggling to recover from the devastating  lockdowns that have crushed the dreams of so many working families.  [[Page H1558]]    I will end as I began. The people who were most helped by the  economic expansion that we saw were working-class Americans because the  Trump administration got control of our borders and stemmed the flow of  this illegal labor.   They made the greatest gains during the expansion; they have been the  most harmed during the lockdowns; and this adds to their burdens and  woes by ensuring that the market for their skills and labor will remain  stagnant for a decade to come.   Please don't do this to those good Americans in this perilous time  for our country.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
