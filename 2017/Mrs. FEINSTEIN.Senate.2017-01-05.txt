 Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the  Desert Protection and Recreation Act of 2017.   This bill, a decade in the making, charts a commonsense path forward  for the California desert. The goal is simple: to manage California's  fragile desert resources in a sustainable and comprehensive manner.   This bill provides something for everyone that appreciates the  national treasure that is the California desert. That this bill  provides something for everyone is a result of the painstaking effort  to build consensus among the array of groups that use the desert,  including: environmental groups; Federal, State, and local governments;  the off-road community; cattle ranchers; mining interests; and energy  companies and California's public utility companies.   As I will further describe later, the bill preserves 230,000 acres of  wilderness and another 44,000 acres of national park land, each  unrivaled for their unique natural landscapes. The bill also safeguards  77 miles of free-flowing rivers and the abundant life and rich  biodiversity these rivers and streams often support.   Importantly, the bill provides certainty to off-road enthusiasts,  establishing 142,000 acres of permanent off-highway recreation areas--a  first for the Nation. I made a commitment to off-roaders to enact the  entire bill, not just parts of the bill. I hope to fulfill that  promise.   The efforts to protect the desert are a long time coming. This effort  first began with the original California Desert Protection Act, signed  into law more than twenty years ago.   Picking up where my predecessors left off, I introduced that bill  only three months after I was sworn in as a senator. Through hard work  and perseverance, we were able to pass that law on the last day of the  103rd Congress, and President Clinton signed the bill into law in  October 1994.   The original Desert Protection Act was a crowning achievement for  desert conservation, establishing 69 new Wilderness areas, creating the  Mojave National Preserve, and converting Death Valley and Joshua Tree  National Monuments into National Parks. All told, we were able to  protect, or increase protections for, about 9.6 million acres.   It continues to attract millions of tourists to southern California,  which is a boon for the economy.   It has ensured that these enduring landscapes will be preserved for  future generations.   Since we passed the 1994 desert conservation bill, we've tried to  build on this legacy of conservation. After years of collaboration with  an array of stakeholders, we introduced new legislation in 2009.   The goal of that bill was simple: to help manage California's desert  resources through a comprehensive approach that balanced conservation,  recreation, energy production, among other needs.   After years of work, including two hearings in the Senate, we reached  a major milestone this past February, when President Obama designated  three new national monuments in the California desert: Castle  Mountains, Mojave Trails, and Sand to Snow.   Those monuments, based on the legislation I had introduced, created  one of the world's largest desert reserves, encompassing nearly 1.8  million acres of America's public lands.   Those monuments connect vital wildlife corridors and habitats,  preserve cultural resources, and establish an important buffer to the  inevitable changes climate change will usher in for these fragile  desert ecosystems.   While the newly-designated desert monuments formed a cornerstone for  future desert protection, our work is not complete. That is why I am  introducing this legislation today.   While I supported President Obama's decision to create three national  monuments in the Mojave Desert, his authority under the Antiquities Act  did not allow him to include the many other valuable provisions in the  original legislation.   Our intention has always been to balance the many uses of the desert  through legislation, and that remains the case today. That is why I  reintroduced that legislation immediately following the President's  designation, and that is why I am introducing a bill again today: to  make the rest of the provisions a reality.   The legislation I am introducing today therefore includes all of the  provisions the President was not able to enact through executive action  under the Antiquities Act.   These negotiated provisions--which represent our best attempt to  achieve consensus among desert stakeholders--deserve to become law.   That legislation includes many additional conservation areas and  provides permanent protection for five Off-Highway Recreation Areas  covering approximately 142,000 acres. Off-roaders were a vital part of  the coalition we put together, and unfortunately those lands could not  be designated under executive action. Off-roaders deserve certainty  about their future use of the land, just as there is now certainty for  conservation purposes. I gave them my word that I would fight for them,  and I intend to do so again in this new Congress.   This bill would also expand wilderness areas in the desert, by  designating five additional wilderness areas that cover 230,000 acres  of land near Fort Irwin.   The bill would ensure clean and free-flowing rivers, through the  designation of 77 miles of rivers as Wild and Scenic Rivers; add to our  national parks, by expanding Death Valley National Park Wilderness by  39,000 acres and Joshua Tree National Park by 4,500 acres; expand  National Scenic Areas, by adding  [[Page S115]]  18,610 acres to the Alabama Hills National Scenic Area in Inyo County;  and protect 81,000 acres of land in San Bernardino and Imperial County,  and requires the Department of the Interior to protect petroglyphs and  other cultural resources important to the surrounding tribes and  communities.   Lastly, the bill will facilitate renewable energy development in a  way that protects delicate habitat.   I want to highlight some of the key provisions of this legislation:   By designating five new wilderness areas, this bill protects fragile  desert ecosystems across 230,000 acres of wilderness near Fort Irwin.  This includes 88,000 acres of Avawatz Mountains, 8,000-acre Great Falls  Basin Wilderness, the 80,000-acre Soda Mountains Wilderness, and the  32,500-acre Death Valley Wilderness.   The desert's sweeping desert vistas and rugged mountain terrain not  only provide for a truly remarkable backcountry experience, but also  provide vital refuge for everything from bighorn sheep and desert  tortoises to Joshua Trees and Native American artifacts.   This bill is more than just wilderness, however. It also designates  four new Wild and Scenic Rivers, totaling 77 miles in length. These  beautiful waterways, carved through the heart of the arid desert, are  Deep Creek and the Whitewater River in and near the San Bernardino  National Forest, as well as the Amargosa River and Surprise Canyon  Creek near Death Valley National Park.   The bill also releases 126,000 acres of land from their existing  wilderness study area designation in response to requests from local  government and recreation users. This will allow the land to be made  available for other purposes, including recreational off-highway  vehicle use on designated routes.   We must also take into account another use of the desert land:  renewable energy. I believe that we can honor our commitment to  conservation while fulfilling California's pledge to develop a clean  energy portfolio.   Balancing conservation, development and other uses is possible, we  just need to come up with the right solutions. Thankfully, some of  these compromises are already in place.   By April 2009, solar and wind companies had proposed 28 projects to  be included in the Mojave Trails National Monument, including sites on  former Catellus lands intended for permanent conservation. I visited  some of those sites at the time, including one particularly beautiful  area known as the Broadwell Valley, where thousands of acres of  pristine lands were proposed for development. Seeing it first hand, I  quickly came to the conclusion that those lands were simply not the  right place for renewable energy development.   Since then, 26 of the 28 applications have been withdrawn. This is  due in part to the state and federal governments' efforts to develop  and finalize the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan--an  ambitious effort to comprehensively manage renewable energy,  conservation, and recreation on 22.5 million acres of California  desert.   By working with our state to develop this Plan, the federal  government has shown it can be an effective partner in the State's  efforts to combat climate change, all while protecting the magnificent,  yet fragile, California desert landscape.   The bill also makes use of about 370,000 acres of isolated, unusable  parcels of State lands spread across the California desert. These small  isolated parcels of State land in wilderness, national parks and  monuments would be exchanged for Federal lands elsewhere that could  potentially provide the State with viable sites for renewable energy  development, off-highway vehicle recreation, or other commercial  purposes.   This blueprint will help identify pristine lands that warrant  protection and direct energy projects elsewhere.   This is a fair balancing of priorities, and I think it provides a  clear path forward.   I strongly urge my colleagues to take a good look at this  legislation. I hope they understand that the many stakeholders involved  have made their voices heard.   As you can see, there are many diverse interests in California's  desert lands, an it is not easy to bring them all into agreement. But  after years of painstaking efforts, they have reached agreement on this  bill.   Desert conservation has never been a partisan issue. Over the years,  legislators have come together across party lines to preserve this  great piece of land.   Given our past success, I am hopeful this Congress will take this  legislation up and move it forward. Most importantly, I hope this body  recognizes the simple fact that desert conservation has never been a  partisan issue.   Over the years, legislators have come together across party lines to  preserve this great piece of land. It's the right thing to do.                                  ______                                         By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself and Mr. Sullivan):   S. 49.
