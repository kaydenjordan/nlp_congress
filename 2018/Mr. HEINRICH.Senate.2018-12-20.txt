 Mr. President, it is an honor to recognize Bobby  ``Buckhorn Bob'' Olguin for his decades of serving the best green chile  cheeseburgers in the State of New Mexico.   Over the years, the Buckhorn Tavern in San Antonio became one of my  favorite places to stop by and grab a bite to eat while driving through  the State or after hunting trips with my sons Carter and Micah.   The Buckhorn earned international acclaim in multiple food and travel  publications for its delicious burgers. When Food Network celebrity  chef Bobby Flay tried to take on Bobby Olguin in a grilling competition  in 2009, the winner was never in doubt. However, the real magic in  going to the Buckhorn was not just in the burgers; it was Bobby's  friendly conversations and the kindness he showed every single person  who walked in his door.   After beating cancer, Bobby rightly wants to spend more time with his  wife, children, and grandchildren. I am grateful that Bobby is healthy,  and I wish him and his family all the best as they start this new stage  in life. But speaking for myself, and many other New Mexicans, I am  sure going to miss those burgers.                            ____________________
