 Mr. Chairman, I don't know if I can live up to those  words, but I certainly appreciate them.   I was the ranking member on this committee, and I was chair at one  point. We have had this bill over the years. It is indeed a monkey  wrench or a monkey in the wrench, as John McCain might have said. It  will mess up the entire system that we have of Congress passing laws,  delegating, giving the executive the ability to enact them in ways that  make them functional and appropriate and come up with the details that  the Congress does not have enough expertise to do.   The other side refers constantly to people that prepare these rules-- which take many, many years and have much, much input--as bureaucrats,  as if it is some type of pejorative. Bureaucrats are government  employees who have expertise in certain areas and who study an area and  become so much more expert than we are on the subject that they can  come up with fine-tuned laws that are checked and balanced to make sure  that the laws are implemented in the way that Congress intends. If  Congress doesn't like it, Congress can pass a bill by both House and  Senate to repeal it. We have already got that possibility.   Under this unique approach, either one of the houses of Congress can  stop a regulation, a rule from going into effect because both Houses  would have to approve a rule and the President would have to sign it  before it could go into effect. That gives one House the ability to  veto, basically, an executive action.   It is the executive in our system that has the power to veto acts of  the legislature and not vice versa. We can pass laws in a bicameral  spirit, which is what our Constitution has, when the House and the  Senate agree. But neither House, independently, is given any power to  veto laws or legislation. This would break that and, I believe, be  unconstitutional. That is why I oppose H.R. 26, the Regulations from  the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2017.   Indeed, the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act is most appropriate  this year as we start, because in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020, we are,  indeed, going to have an executive in need of scrutiny. So I thank the  Republicans for naming this bill appropriately because we are, indeed,  in the times of an Executive in need of scrutiny.   We need scrutiny over income tax returns that have been hidden from  the public that might disclose conflicts of interest or loans from  characters that might be considered oligarchs and have some type of an  influence over our foreign policy and our domestic.   We need an Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act that deals with these  conflicts, with income taxes that haven't been released, with  businesses in the District where people could go to hotels and curry  favor with the Executive.   Indeed, we do have an Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act, so I  appreciate the well-named bill that the Republicans have brought us and  the awareness that, through this bill, they have seen that we need some  concern about the Executive coming because he certainly needs scrutiny.                                time  1500    This bill, though, is the worst of corporate special interest because  it will give corporate special interests the opportunity to override  rules that take effect unless both Houses pass them. It is difficult  enough for this House and the Senate to get legislation passed in the  days that we often give to legislation, but to have both Houses have to  agree, in which case if you can't, it is, in essence, a pocket veto,  and it doesn't even have to be scheduled for a  [[Page H127]]  vote because the House would have to positively pass and the Senate  positively pass. So if the Speaker doesn't want to do it, the Speaker  can pocket veto the regulation. It doesn't even have to be scheduled.   This is not draining the swamp. It will heighten the influence of  corporate lobbyists in Congress where they can come to the Speaker and  ask that agency rules they don't like that might protect the lives of  children because they are regulations dealing with toys that seem to  possibly be defective, or automobiles where they need safety devices,  or other consumer protections that interfere with business interests-- business is good and important, but sometimes businesses do things that  are injurious to the public.   To give this opportunity to stop rules and regulations from going  into effect that protect the public is wrong. It was suggested maybe it  will help the economy, but at what cost? What is one life worth--or  several lives--if lives are lost because safety regulations are not  approved by this House and the Senate, or one or the other, and then  don't go into effect? As I mentioned, this is seriously  constitutionally defective.    Mr. Chairman, the ranking member mentioned Justice Scalia.  I will mention Chief Justice John Roberts who criticized nearly  identical legislation in the 1980s when he was a White House lawyer  because it would ``hobble agency rulemaking by requiring affirmative  congressional assent to all major rules'' such that it would ``seem to  impose excessive burdens on regulatory agencies.'' That was John  Roberts.   Some of the underlying facts given were about the economy. No matter  what you say, President Obama has been effective on the economy. We  saved the housing market. We saved this country from the Great  Recession. We brought about recovery. That is not something we should  disparage but we should praise. The stock market has gone up to record  highs. Unemployment is down. Jobs are up. The automobile industry has  been saved.   I ask Members to reject this bill because it is unconstitutional. It  will cost lives of American citizens because safety regulations won't  be passed.
