 Madam Speaker, recently, Cecilia Rouse, the chair of the  White House Council of Economic Advisers, was trying to explain away  the challenges that runaway inflation presents to most American  households, and she said, ``Most American household balance sheets are  strong and can provide some cushion for rising prices.''   I was shocked to hear these remarks coming from one of the  President's top economic policy advisers. Madam Speaker, most  Americans, in fact, do not have a cushion for rising prices. A recent  survey found that 56 percent of Americans cannot cover a $1,000  emergency expense from their savings.   That is why I led a letter demanding that Chair Rouse apologizes to  the millions of Americans struggling with skyrocketing prices due to  the failed economic policies of the Biden administration. I include  this letter for the Record.                                        House of Representatives,                                      Washington, DC, June 15, 2022.      Dr. Cecilia Rouse,      Chair, White House Council of Economic Advisers, Washington,           DC.        Dear Chair Rouse: We write today to express our outrage       toward your recent comments during an online event hosted by       the Center for American Progress. At the event, you stated,       in part ``. . . most household balance sheets are strong and       can provide some cushion for rising prices . . .'' As Chair       of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, we are       astounded at your failure to recognize that most Americans       actually lack any sort of cushion for the hardships they must       endure as a result of the Biden Administration's failed       economic policies.        A recent survey found that 56 percent of Americans cannot       cover a $1,000 emergency expense with their savings. We would       not expect this to come as a surprise to you, one of the most       senior economic officials in the Biden Administration. It is       offensive to the millions of Americans fighting to fill their       gas tanks, having to remove items from their shopping carts       at the grocery store check-out line, and struggling to pay       their rising rents to pretend that households have an       imaginary cushion to deal with these historic price increases       caused in no small part by runaway deficit spending.        Considering President Biden's approval ratings have dipped       below 40 percent, perhaps it is comments like these that lead       Americans to believe that his administration is completely       out of touch with the everyday struggles of millions of       American families. We encourage you to travel to gas stations       and grocery stores across the country to ask hard-working       Americans whether they have enough ``cushion'' to offset this       record inflation. In fact, each of us invites you to visit       our respective districts to speak with our constituents,       where you will find most of them do not have such a cushion.        Alarmingly, you followed your comment by stating ``. . . I       understand rising prices are painful, I understand that . .       .'' Despite these claims, you clearly do not understand the       full impact of rising prices because of your mistaken belief       that most Americans have the ability to absorb the pain from       rapidly increasing prices for goods and services they need       each day with essentially inconsequential negative effects to       their quality of life due to some mythical financial       ``cushion'' you think most Americans enjoy. We ask you to       publicly apologize to the millions of Americans struggling       with skyrocketing prices and record inflation for these       insensitive and inaccurate remarks.        Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.    Madam Speaker, if remarks like these are reflective of the  advice being given to the President of the United States, it is no  wonder that they continue to enact policies completely out of touch  with the American people.                               Gas Tax Holiday     Madam Speaker, if you were on a drive through middle  Tennessee right now and needed to fill up, let's say, a 2015 Ford F- 150, you would pay about $120. A gas tax holiday would take fewer than  $5 off that bill.   Yet, this is the latest Band-Aid solution being tossed around by the  Biden administration. President Biden has already depleted our  Strategic Petroleum Reserve to its lowest point in 35 years, weakening  national security while doing little or nothing to lower gas prices.   While every dollar certainly counts, saving only $5 out of every $120  from a gas tax holiday will not make much of a difference in our  personal budgets, but it will have a crushing effect on our ability to  pay for the Federal highway system.   Instead of kneecapping our Nation's infrastructure, the President  should immediately approve the more than 4,000 pending applications for  drilling and end the freeze on oil and gas leases, yet President Biden  refuses.   The key to getting prices down is simple: reestablish the energy  independence President Trump created.   President Biden simply must do better.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, more than 7 weeks ago, we woke up to  headlines that the Supreme Court of the United States would likely  overturn Roe v. Wade. I believe the leaker broke Federal law in an  effort to change the outcome of the High Court's ruling.   We have seen protests outside Justices' homes. In Associate Justice  Brett Kavanaugh's case, we have seen an assassination plot. We have  also seen more than a dozen attacks on pro-life organizations across  the country, including vandalism, destruction of property, and even  firebombing.   This is why I joined more than 100 House Republicans in a letter  urging the Department of Justice to investigate these attacks. They not  only deserve to be a top priority for the DOJ, but we believe they  should be investigated as instances of domestic terrorism.   We must make it clear that we are a Nation of laws, never mob rule.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding tonight.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to address another devastating record set  on President Biden's watch, this time along our southern border.  Numbers released last week from U.S. Customs and Border Protection tell  us there were more migrant encounters in May of this year than any  month on record. May was also the fourth straight month of encounters  reaching more than 200,000.   Here are the numbers: 239,416 total encounters. That is up 32 percent  from May of last year, and nearly 10 times the number of encounters  during the same month in 2020. Twenty-five percent of migrants were  repeat offenders, meaning they have been deported or arrested before.  Agents also reported 20 percent more unaccompanied minors crossing the  border compared to just April of this year.   This continues to be a national security and humanitarian crisis, and  it is only getting worse.   And if you can believe it, the numbers could actually be much worse.  Had it not been for a Federal judge delaying the Biden administration's  plan to end title 42, who knows how many people would have crossed into  our country illegally?   Title 42 is a critical tool for our already overwhelmed Border Patrol  agents. Yet, the Biden Justice Department continues to fight for the  administration's dangerous, reckless, open border policies by appealing  that judge's decision.   Since President Biden took office, more than 700,000 people have  avoided law enforcement and made their way into our country. We really  don't know who these people are. Agents stopped at least 50 people on  the terrorist screening database in just a 9-month period.   This begs the questions: Out of those who evaded law enforcement,  those 700,000, how many could potentially be on the terrorist watch  list?   Where are those people?   What are their intentions?   How will they impact the lives of American citizens?   Republicans may sound like a broken record when it comes to the  border, but we wouldn't have to talk about it so much if it were not  for the broken policies of President Biden and his DHS Secretary  Mayorkas. They simply must do better.
