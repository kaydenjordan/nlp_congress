 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of the  resolution (H. Res. 21) calling on Vice President Michael R. Pence to  convene and mobilize the principal officers of the executive  departments of the Cabinet to activate section 4 of the 25th Amendment  to declare President Donald J. Trump incapable of executing the duties  of his office and to immediately exercise powers as acting President,  and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.
