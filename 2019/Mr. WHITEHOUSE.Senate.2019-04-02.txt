 Mr. President, I am here for my usual climate speech.  The Presiding Officer has seen this increasingly battered poster many  times before.   We have had an interesting period in the Senate recently with respect  to climate change, and I would like to take a moment to comment on it.  Before I do that, I think it is important to kind of frame the backdrop  of what is going on and why this matters.   This is the measurement of carbon dioxide levels on Earth. This goes  back 400,000 years--no agriculture, no wheel, a long, long time ago. We  see, over time, this recurring pattern in which CO2 levels  stay between 180 and 300 ppm. You can go back and people can see that  these are--there are temperature shifts that correlate with these  CO2 levels.   We know this--I saw Senator Brown from Ohio here. We know this  because people have gone out--including two scientists from Ohio State.  They have gone out to glaciers in the farthest and highest reaches of  the planet, and they have drilled out cores of ice that go back tens of  hundreds of thousands of years, and they are able to figure out, from  the characteristics of the ice of that period, what the CO2  concentrations were--that and a lot of other data as well. This is very  well scientifically established.   It is a little bit hard to see because it gets lost in the 0 year  line, but this is what has happened. This is the highest level ever  right there--highest historic CO2 level. We shot up to here.  We are actually over 400 ppm, and the range was 180 to 300. Do the  math. Between 300 and 180, that is 120 ppm range, and now we are  almost, by that full range, out of that range. That is an extraordinary  anomaly in the entire history of the species--in fact, before our  species.   So the idea that this has all happened before, that the climate is  always changing, that is factual and scientific nonsense. Anybody who  says that is either uninformed or should be ashamed of themselves  because it is not always changing up to 400-plus ppm. It just isn't. We  have no experience of that ever.   We do know that as these CO2 levels go up, the planet  warms. We have known that since Abraham Lincoln was President. When  Abraham Lincoln was riding around here in his top hat, scientists had  begun to understand about greenhouse gases and what that did. So there  is nothing new in this. The science is totally established, and this is  unprecedented in human history and before.   Here is where it comes home to roost for me. This is a map of the  northern part of my State. This is the lower tip of our capital city,  Providence. Over here is Bristol and Warren. Here is Warwick. This is  Narragansett Bay. This is the top of Prudence Island. Here is the Mount  Hope Bay. If you can see, all the parts that you see here as blue, all  of that is now land. All of that is now land.   It has people's homes on it. It has people's businesses on it. It has  some of our public recreation facilities on it. It is all predicted to  disappear by the end of this century if we don't get our hands around  this climate change problem. We don't have until the end of the century  to stop it because like a giant oil tanker, you can put all engines in  reverse, you can shut off engines, it is still going to have a lot of  carry because of the momentum that has built up. This, where we are  right now, is going to create effects for a long time. We have way less  until the end of the century to act. The newest studies say we have  about 12 years, if we really want to get ahead of this.    There has been some interesting stuff said on the Senate floor  recently. Tell it to the people whose homes are going to be gone. This  isn't just a political debate. There are lives, there are people's  homes, and there are people's businesses that are at stake.   We had a big appearance by 13 Republican Senators led by the majority  leader, and they all came to the Senate floor to make fun of the Green  New Deal or at least the Koch brothers' phony cartoon version of the  Green New Deal. Out of the 13, 12 mentioned a fanciful $93 trillion  cost that the Koch brothers have come up with. So basically the purpose  was to come to the floor, make fun of the Green New Deal, and pretend  it is going to cost $93 trillion.   Very few could even use the word ``climate change.'' Imagine that.  There were 13 Republican Senators coming to the floor to talk about  climate change, and all they want to do is make fun of the Green New  Deal, mock it, pretend it is going to cost $93 trillion, and then go  away as if these people's homes didn't matter and as if this weren't  serious to people who are looking at this.   The news report that I have just seen on the $93 trillion says this:         When it comes to the $93 trillion estimate for the Green       New Deal, created by its critics, the answer is found in a       network of interlinked groups: a think tank, its political       arm and a super political action committee. Add a web of       secret donors, and eager lawmakers--    The 13 of them--       and you have the blurry outlines of an echo chamber that       propels an unverified claim into the orbit of Washington       politics.    I am sure that is all good fun, but this is pretty serious, from my  point of view. It actually got worse after that. A Senator from Utah  came to the floor with a lot of jokes about rocket launchers,  velociraptors, tauntauns, and 20-foot seahorses carrying Aquaman  around.   By the way, if you are looking at having your constituents' homes  disappear underwater, jokes about Aquaman are not funny, not funny at  all. Train seahorses--give me a break--jokes about cows.   ``Critics,'' he said, ``will chastise me for not taking climate  change seriously.'' Well, yes, I am here to do exactly that because it  is darn serious to most everybody and particularly to my home State. So  jokes about Sharknados just--I would say this: You might disagree with  me about climate change, and you might not want to do anything about  climate change, but, by God, I think if there is one thing we owe each  other in this body, it is sincerity, and to come to the floor with an  insincere bill that is designed to fail is demeaning to the whole body.  To come to the floor and make jokes, when our own national scientific  agencies are warning of these harms about all of this, it is just  fundamentally wrong.   Let me talk about the Senator's home State a little bit because one  of the things I have done is paid my colleagues the sincere compliment  of going to many of their States to look into what is going on with  climate change. Let me review what I have said about Utah because I  went there.   What I have learned--I gave a speech before I went in based on  research that I did. I gave another speech when I came out based on  what I heard in Utah. Going in, I knew the average temperature had  already increased 2 full degrees Fahrenheit in parts of Utah. The 2  degrees centigrade we are  [[Page S2207]]  worried about for the globe, it is already there in Utah. There are  actually spots in Utah where the temperature has risen as much as 4.5  degrees Fahrenheit.   There are significant trends in river and stream flooding and also  the highest drying trend in rivers and streams in Southern Utah as the  system comes unhinged. Lake Powell in Utah, when I was ready to leave,  was about half full, which is kind of a big deal because Salt Lake City  gets 80 percent of its water supply from snowpack in the Uinta and  Wasatch Mountains.   Local predictions were that water managers in Utah would no longer be  able to depend on the historic data about snow melt and river flow  because the change is so complete that the old data isn't germane any  longer. There have been wildfire studies led by Dr. Philip Dennison of  the University of Utah connecting climate change to the wildfires that  take place out there. In fact, Utah State has entire courses of study  teaching students about climate change--how to predict it and how to  fight back. Utah State has its own climate action plan. It has an  active climate center. The University of Utah has an active  sustainability center. Students and researchers work there to address  climate change. Each year, the University of Utah publishes an annual  report on climate change. I am sure that is all just so amusing to my  colleague from Utah.   Mayors are engaged in Utah, including the mayor then of Salt Lake  City. Mayor Ralph Becker took first place in the Mayors Climate  Protection Center rankings. I can only imagine how amusing that was for  the senior Senator from Utah to yuck it up about that.   His ski areas--Alta, Canyons, Deer Crest, Deer Valley, and Park  City--all signed the BICEP coalition's Climate Declaration in support  of taking national action on climate change. I bet that really cracked  him up.   The Park City Foundation in Utah was predicting a local temperature  increase of 6.8 degrees Fahrenheit by 2075, which they said would cause  a total loss of snowpack in the lower Park City resort area. It kind of  takes the fun out of skiing when there is no snow in Park City.   A retired pediatrician named David Folland, who is the coleader of  Salt Lake Citizens Climate Lobby, wrote there is an actual solution:  ``Placing a fee on carbon sources and returning the proceeds to  households would create jobs, build the economy, improve public health,  and help stabilize the climate.'' I hope my colleague from Utah has a  chance to go talk to this retired pediatrician and hear from him just  how amusing all of this climate change stuff is.   Republican Presidential candidate John Huntsman, who has served Utah  as Governor, wrote a New York Times op-ed piece back then titled ``The  G.O.P. Can't Ignore Climate Change.'' Well, it is getting to the point  where we are pushing them enough. They can't ignore it so much. Their  fallback, I guess, is to make fun of it. That is really, really  helpful.   Here is what he wrote:         The fact is that the planet is warming, and failing to deal       with this reality will leave us vulnerable and possibly       worse. Hedging against risk--    He said--       is an enduring theme of conservative thought.    An enduring theme of conservative thought, up until it bumps up  against the enduring theme of Republican fundraising from the fossil  fuel industry.   So then I went out there and had a chance to meet with the folks from  the Utah ski industry. During the last season, they told me they had  nearly 4\1/2\ million skiers and snowboarders and that almost 1 in 10  jobs in Utah is in tourism. They market themselves as having what they  call the Greatest Snow on Earth, and they pointed out that according to  the EPA, average temperatures had already risen 2 full degrees  Fahrenheit there over the past 100 years.   I visited with Ski Utah and with a group of professional skiers from  the group, Protect Our Winters, who want to see the mountaintops and  the ski slopes that give them their recreation and give them their  living, in many cases, protected and saved. The scientists at the  University of Utah, including meteorologists Leigh Sturges and John  Horel, were predicting that there would be more rain and less snow at  major Utah ski resorts under different climate change scenarios. Rain  at a ski resort is not a good thing, and with this many jobs in Utah,  you would think somebody from the Utah Senate delegation might be  willing to take this seriously and work in good faith toward a  solution.   Ski Utah's 14 resorts would certainly like that. They got together  and sent a letter last year to the Governor of Utah asking the State to  take action on climate change. Salt Lake City's letter went out too.  Salt Lake City's drinking water, 70 percent comes from snowpack melt.  When the snowpack goes away, so does that captured supply of water  serving the city.   The State, when I was there, was experiencing abnormally dry  conditions. I went out to the Great Salt Lake Shorelands Preserve that  was run by The Nature Conservancy. You go out there, and you walk on  boards over the marsh because, you know, it is marsh. It is wet. It is  spongy. It is hard to walk through. Not then. It was dry as a bone. We  were walking over it, but there was absolutely dry soil underneath.   The Salt Lake itself has shrunk. The lake's volume has fallen by  nearly half since Utah's early pioneers reached its shores in 1847. The  lake's surface is down 11 feet. That has left roughly half of the  former lake bed dry and exposed. The Salt Lake, for which Salt Lake  City is named, is drying up. I guess that is another reason for a lot  of yucks here on the Senate floor from the senior Senator from Utah.   There is a bird--I know here in Mammoth Hall, where we care mostly  about big interests and big money, it may seem ridiculous to talk about  a bird. There is a bird called Wilson's phalarope. It flies a 3,000- mile migration from the Patagonian lowlands up to the Great Salt Lake.  As the Great Salt Lake shrinks, it is going to find that it doesn't  have a destination. It is going to be a little like the red knot flying  from Brazil straight through to Delaware. Imagine how long taking an  airplane flight from Brazil to Delaware would be. Now imagine you are a  bird that is about this high, and you have to fly all that way yourself  in a straight shot. They do that. Here is this wonderful Wilson's  phalarope, and its lake is drying up.   All that dust from the dried-up lake bed is now a contaminant,  compromising air quality in Salt Lake City, which now gets an ``F''  from the American Lung Association for both ozone and particulates. The  Salt Lake City mayor then was Jackie Biskupski. She had pledged to  transition the city to 100 percent renewable energy sources by 2032.   I will tell you, I met with scientists from Brigham Young, Utah  State, and the University of Utah, and there was no doubt about climate  change. There was nobody yucking it up about climate change. There were  no jokes about tauntauns and Aquaman. This is something they take very  seriously. It is entitled to be taken very seriously.   I will close by referring to some of the comments I found over the  weekend from members and in some cases leaders of the Mormon Church,  the Church of Latter-day Saints. Here is the official statement by  Mormon Women for Ethical Government on Environmental Stewardship and  Climate Change:         The consequences of maintaining the status quo of carbon       emissions and the resulting rate of global temperature change       are dire and include major shifts in patterns of weather,       fire, and hydrology; large-scale impacts on biodiversity; and       disruption to human systems, including agriculture and food       supplies, migration, national security, and economies. . . .       We urge governments, institutions, and businesses to boldly       mobilize in pursuit of creative and radical strategies that       will effectively curb climate change and dramatically reduce       carbon emissions.    I urge the Senator from Utah to read that and to listen to those  constituents.   G. Michael Alder wrote--I guess in the Ensign on an LDS Church  website--``about the environmental damage caused by such man-made  problems as acid rain, excessive carbon dioxide and other chemicals in  the atmosphere, deforestation, and the pollution of our oceans, lakes,  and streams,'' saying that ``as a result, serious, mostly unintended  changes are taking place in the  [[Page S2208]]  air, water, and land around us. . . . The evidence is mounting that we  are doing ourselves and our mortal home serious damage. . . . A  continued increase in carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere,  produced by our vast consumption of oil, coal, and other fossil fuels,  appears to be responsible for a general increase in temperature  worldwide. . . . That increase threatens possible major changes in  climate around the world, potentially causing drought in some areas and  greater rainfall in others. . . . The studies showed that the greatest  global temperature increase has taken place in the last decade. Carbon  dioxide and trace gases produced by our industrial societies were  considered to be the cause.''   Well, they are. In fact, they are unanimously considered to be the  cause by the responsible science community.   The last thing I will read is an address given by Elder Steven E.  Snow of the Seventy of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  during a panel discussion that occurred Wednesday October 10, 2018, at  Utah State University.   He begins by agreeing with his mountain fellow Utahans about Utah's  fresh powder snow, calling it, again, the ``greatest snow on earth,''  at least according to Utah's license plates.   He goes on to say:         It causes me much grief when I look outside my window and       see a hazy inversion or when I hear consistent reports of       Utah's poor air quality. I am concerned for the families       affected by wildfires and for the schoolchildren forced to       stay indoors because of smoky skies.    No jokes. He is concerned.   He goes on:         Algal blooms are breaking out in Utah's lakes. We are       experiencing unusually dry seasons and record-breaking warm       winters.    He cites another church leader, President Dallin Oaks, and quotes  him:         These are challenging times, filled with big worries: wars       and rumors of wars, possible epidemics of infectious       diseases, droughts, floods, and global warming.    He goes on to say, quoting a commentary on MormonNewsroom.org, that  ``the creation groans under the weight of recklessness and  indulgence.''   Here is the sentence that stuck with me: ``Climate change is real,  and it's our responsibility as stewards to do what we can to limit the  damage done to God's creation.''   Making jokes about that will not limit the damage we are now doing to  God's creation.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
