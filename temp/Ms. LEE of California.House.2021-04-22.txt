 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R.  51, the Washington, D.C. Admission Act. I thank Delegate Eleanor Holmes  Norton for her tireless campaign for full democratic representation for  the residents of our nation's capital. Without her leadership and  grassroots advocacy, it is hard to believe  [[Page H2081]]  that we would be on the floor today considering D.C. statehood again. I  also want to thank Chairwoman Maloney and the Speaker for working to  get this bill to the floor.   The late Hilda Mason, former D.C. councilmember, a giant in D.C.  politics, and impassioned champion for the disadvantaged brought me  into the fight for D.C. statehood. Her courage and steadfast  determination to ensure D.C. residents have full democratic  representation should be an inspiration to us all.   The revolution that led to the creation of our democracy began with  calls of ``No taxation without representation'' and yet we have over  700,000 people--taxpayers--nearly half of whom are African American-- routinely disenfranchised.   Historically, the District of Colombia has been home to one of the  largest African American populations in the nation. After Emancipation,  thousands of African Americans migrated from the segregated South to  benefit from better employment opportunities, better educational  institution, and more access to civic and political life.   It is a disgrace that the District, a symbol of our nation's promise  of equality, is denied the right to self-government and full  representation in Congress.   To correct this injustice, we must pass H.R. 51.
