 Madam Speaker, our colleague on the other side of the aisle  asked: Who the hell are we to be here speaking on this legislation and  passing this legislation?   Well, Madam Speaker, we are the Representatives of the people of this  country.   Madam Speaker, the most conservative estimates show that we have lost  54 million children to abortion since 1973. In a nation founded upon  principles that recognize the dignity of every human life, we should  not tolerate this extermination of innocent lives.                                time  1245    The majority of Americans recognize this tragedy for what it is, and  there is consensus among them that they do not want their tax dollars  paying for a practice they sincerely oppose, and we are their  representatives.   Since 1976, the Hyde amendment has been included in relevant  appropriations bills to prohibit Federal funding of abortions. Each  year it has been consistently renewed and supported by congressional  majorities and Presidents of both parties.   Estimates from the Congressional Budget Office indicate that the Hyde  amendment has prevented hundreds of thousands of abortions each year.  That means millions of Americans are alive today because of the Hyde  amendment. After 40 years, it is time for this lifesaving amendment to  become permanent law.   H.R. 7, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance  Full Disclosure Act, makes the Hyde amendment and other current  abortion funding prohibitions permanent and government-wide. This  commonsense measure restores a longstanding agreement that protects the  unborn and prevents taxpayers from being forced to finance thousands of  elective abortions.   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote to respect our  Nation's consensus on abortion funding and affirm life by voting in  favor of this rule and H.R. 7.   Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy).
