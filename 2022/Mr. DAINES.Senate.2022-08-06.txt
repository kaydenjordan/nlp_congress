 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  amendments be considered as one amendment, No. 5487: No. 5425, Mr.  Daines; No. 5361, Ms. Ernst; No. 5360, Mrs. Fischer; No. 5224, Mr.  Portman; No. 5411, Mr. Barrasso; and No. 5454, Ms. Murkowski. I further  ask that there be 2 minutes of debate, equally divided, on each  division prior to the vote.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S4198, August 6, 2022, first column, the following  appears: Mrs. Fischer; No. 5224, Mr. Portman; No. 5411, Mr.  Lankford; and No. 5454,      The online Record has been corrected to read: Mrs. Fischer; No.  5224, Mr. Portman; No. 5411, Mr. Barrasso; and No. 5454,    ========================= END NOTE =========================       Mr. President, my amendment would strike the anti-energy  provisions that snuck into this bill behind closed doors.   This partisan bill before us has a slew of provisions that raises  royalty rates, fees, rents, and taxes that hurt our small oil and gas  producers in America the most. By the way, it is those small oil and  gas producers that produce over 80 percent of our supply. I guarantee  you, if there is a rebuttal, they will talk about Big Oil, but this is  not Big Oil; 80 percent is from the small guys. These producers don't  have the ability to absorb the large increases from the government, so  if you raise prices for energy producers, you raise energy prices for  Americans.   It is not that complicated. If you want lower gas prices, vote yes.
