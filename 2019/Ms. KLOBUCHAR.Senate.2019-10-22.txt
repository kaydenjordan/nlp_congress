 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to urge the  Senate to take action on election security legislation immediately.   It has been 1,005 days since Russia attacked our elections in 2016,  and we have yet to pass any kind of comprehensive election security  reform. The next major elections are just 378 days away, so the clock  is ticking. We must take action now to secure our elections from  foreign threats.   Let's review what happened.   In 2016, Russia invaded our democracy. They didn't use bombs, jets,  or tanks. Instead, they spent years planning a cyber mission to  undermine the foundation of our democratic system. This mission has  been called ``sweeping'' and ``systematic'' by many, including Special  Counsel Mueller. Our military and intelligence officials from both  Democratic and Republican administrations, as well as Special Counsel  Mueller, made clear and confirmed over and over again that Russia  launched sophisticated and targeted cyber attacks that were authorized  by President Putin. This includes former Director Coats, President  Trump's former intelligence head; Director Wray, the head of the FBI;  and the head of Homeland Security. One by one, officials in the Trump  administration have confirmed that this happened.   What exactly did Russia do? They conducted research and  reconnaissance against election networks in every single State. We used  to think it was just 21 States, but this year, the FBI and the  Department of Homeland Security under the Trump administration issued a  report that confirmed that all 50 States were targeted.   Russia was successful in hacking into databases in Illinois. The  Chicago board of elections reported that names, addresses, birth dates,  and other sensitive information on thousands of registered voters were  exposed. Russia launched cyber attacks against U.S. companies that made  the software we use to vote, and they tried to hack into the email of  local officials who have elections in their purview.   Investigations are ongoing, but we know Russia hacked into election  systems in the Presiding Officer's home  [[Page S5936]]  State of Florida. Senator Rubio has publicly confirmed that Russian  hackers not only accessed voting systems in Florida but were in a  position to change voter rolls.   These are just the attacks on our election infrastructure.   So we should look at it this way: No. 1, they tried to get into the  infrastructure. No. 2, we know they spread propaganda about things. One  of the main ways they did that was through social media. This month,  the Senate Intelligence Committee released a bipartisan report  detailing Russia's widespread social media campaign to spread  disinformation and divide our country. Remember, you have hacking into  things at the local level and at the State levels, and then you have  this disinformation campaign. These are two things with the same  intent--to interfere in our democracy.   Think about what I just described. A foreign country attacked our  democracy in multiple ways. Our military leaders and law enforcement  officials all say that Russia hasn't paid a sufficient price for the  attack, so they are now ``emboldened,'' in the words of former Director  Dan Coats--a former Republican Senator--in continuing efforts to  undermine our political system.   Congress hasn't passed a law--aside from providing election equipment  funding with no strings attached--to address the problem. This isn't  just wrong; this is legislative malpractice. We have a common set of  facts about what happened. Now we need commonsense solutions to make  sure it doesn't happen again.   This week, a number of us are coming to the floor to urge the  Republican leader to bring election security legislation to a vote.  That must happen, but much more must happen as well.   Today, I am going to focus on the need to improve transparency and  accountability for online platforms like Facebook and Twitter, but  before I turn to that, I would like to take a moment to describe why it  is imperative that we update our election infrastructure.   Right now, the majority of States rely on electronic voting systems  that are at least 10 years old. In 2020, voters in eight States will  cast their ballots on machines with no paper trail, so there will be no  reliable record to go back and audit the election results. So if  something goes wrong, if they hack in, there will be no paper ballots  to back up what actually happened. Problems for that State or that  county? Yes. Well, how about problems for our national Presidential  election?   By the way, am I telling any secrets? No. Russia knows exactly which  States and counties don't have backup paper ballots.   Sixteen States have no statewide audit requirement to confirm the  results of the election. These statistics are alarming because experts  agree that paper ballots and audits are the baseline of what we need to  secure our election system.   FBI Director Wray recently testified in the Senate. I asked him  whether he thinks having things like paper ballots makes sense in the  event that Russia--or any other foreign country, for that matter-- decides to go at us again. He said, yes, that would be a good thing.  Maybe we should think of listening to the head of the FBI and figure  out what we can do to make this better. Even the President has  expressed his support for paper ballots. But I think we need more than  words; I think we need action. We need this body to say to those  States: It is time to get your act together now and get those backup  paper ballots.   I have introduced multiple pieces of legislation--some of them  bipartisan--that would secure our election by requiring paper ballots,  mandating postelection audits, and modernizing our election  infrastructure. One of those bills, the Secure Election Act, is  cosponsored by my colleague Senator Lankford and also by the head of  the Intelligence Committee, Senator Burr, and Senator Warner, the  ranking member, as well as Senator Graham, the chair of the Judiciary  Committee, and Senator Harris is also a cosponsor. In spite of all of  these leaders being on this bill, it was blocked last year by Senator  McConnell, who made calls, along with the White House general counsel,  to Republican Senators asking them not to support the bill. This is  wrong.   I am glad that my colleagues Senators Wyden and Durbin will be coming  to the floor this week urging the Senate to take up the bills, such as  the bills I introduced, the SAFE Act and the Election Security Act,  that would modernize our election infrastructure.   Remember, Russia didn't just try to hack into our elections system;  they also launched an extended and sophisticated information war  designed to divide our country and destroy America's confidence in our  political system. Russia also knew that our social media platforms  would be easily exploited for that purpose.    I am going to ask unanimous consent to pass this bill, which is a  bipartisan bill that I lead along with Senator Graham, the Republican  chair of the Judiciary Committee, and that is also cosponsored by  Senator Warner, the ranking leader on the Intelligence Committee.   Why are we doing this bill about the social media platforms? Well,  the place where Russia was most successful in undermining our democracy  was right there in front of you on your Facebook page. We know that  some of the brightest minds in our country built remarkable platforms  where people can share information, like Twitter, Google, and Facebook.  Unfortunately, these platforms failed to build adequate protections  against the bad guys, kind of like building a bank but not putting any  locks on the doors, and our democracy is worse because of it.   Our social media platforms are not well regulated. In fact, they are  hardly regulated at all and are ripe for exploitation. Countries like  Russia, Iran, North Korea, and China are taking advantage of that as we  speak.   The Senate Intelligence Committee, led by Chairman Burr and Vice  Chairman Warner, recently released its second report on Russian  interference in the 2016 election. This wasn't a partisan report. No  one could call it that at all.   The first report details attacks and threats to election  infrastructure. This second report details the sophisticated  disinformation campaign Russia used to pit Americans against each  other, and the committee found that Russia's targeting of the 2016 U.S.  Presidential election was ``part of a broader, sophisticated, and  ongoing information warfare campaign designed to sow discord in  American politics and society.'' The report notes that Russia conducted  ``a vastly more complex and strategic assault on the United States than  was initially understood.''   What did they do? They hired trolls. They hired buildings full of  people to go online and pretend to be Americans and then submit things  and buy things and buy ads that ended up on your Facebook pages and  your Twitter feed. Russia specifically focused on hot-button issues and  used falsified stories and memes to foster distrust of our democratic  institutions. So maybe they would target a conservative person and put  up a bunch of things that would make that person mad, but they were  fake or maybe they would target a liberal person, and they would put up  a bunch of ads about rallies and about things like that which were  actually fake.   They targeted African-Americans more than any other group through  individual posts, location targeting, Facebook pages, Instagram  accounts, and Twitter. Their internet research agency focused on  stoking divisions around race.   One of my best examples is an ad that they bought in rubles. Facebook  let them buy it in rubles. It was an ad that we didn't even see until  months after the election. It had an innocent woman's face on it. I  know because she called our office later when it came out in Judiciary.  She was just a woman. They found her face--an African-American woman-- and put it on the ad. The ad reads: Why wait in line on election day?  You can text your vote for Hillary Clinton. They gave the text number.  That is a lie. It is more than a lie. It is a crime. They are trying to  suppress people's votes and make them not go vote, and instead, text to  a fake number. That is a crime. People have gone to jail for simply  jamming the lines on election day. That is what this is. It is a high- tech version of a crime. No one was prosecuted because we didn't even  know the ad existed that was targeting African-American Facebook pages  in  [[Page S5937]]  swing States until way after the election. They could do the same thing  on the conservative side of the aisle.   That is why I am simply asking for some solution, because one time it  is going to be one side, and the next time it will be the other. Why  would the people in this Chamber let this go on? Why would we do that?  We have sworn and taken an oath--an obligation--to stand up for our  country. That is what this is about.   It continues. Intelligence officials are once again sounding the  alarm that adversaries are using social media to undermine the upcoming  elections. Just yesterday, Facebook announced that it removed a network  of Russian-backed accounts posing as locals weighing in on political  issues in swing States. It never ends. Russia has a playbook, and they  are using it to attack us. We have to stop them. How do we do that?  Well, I have a very good solution. It is not the only solution. There  are a lot of other bills we can do too.   But this is called the Honest Ads Act, which I am leading with  Senator Graham. I want to thank Senator Warner for all the work he did  on this bill as well. The goal is simple: Bring our laws into the 21st  century to ensure that voters know who is paying to influence our  political system. Right now, the political ads that are sold on TV,  radio, and newspapers are disclosed so that the public knows what they  are. They are actually kept in an archive so campaigns and reporters  can go over and see what they are. They can actually figure out what  this ad is and why somebody was putting this ad against me. I believe  in the competitiveness of our election system, and if you disclose  things, then, you are going to get more information about what is wrong  with those things.   The ads also have to say who paid for them. That is why you see those  little disclaimers at the bottom or you see elected officials or their  challengers saying who paid for this ad: My name is this; I paid for  this ad. That is what that is.   Guess what. If those things go on radio, TV, or newspaper, you have  to follow all those rules. If they end up on Facebook or Twitter or  another large social media platform, there are no rules in play. Sure,  a few of those companies right now are voluntarily disclosing it, but  there are no actual rules in place about how it should be done.   When I asked them why they wouldn't favor the bill, some of them have  since changed their minds and do favor it, but when I asked at the  beginning, they said they couldn't figure out what an issue of Federal  legislative importance is. That is what the standard is. It is about  candidate ads and the issue ads that you see on TV that bug you all the  time. When asked about ads and why they couldn't do it, they said they  couldn't figure out what that was. I said: Really? My radio station in  Deep River Falls, MN, can figure it out. These are some of the biggest  companies in the world. Please tell me you don't have the expertise to  figure that out.   That is why it is important that we pass this bill. It is about issue  ads, and it is also about candidate ads. All it does is this. As we  look at where the money is going to go in advertising, in the last 2016  Presidential election, $1.4 billion was spent online on these kinds of  ads. It is supposed to go to $3 billion or $4 billion in 2020, and  there are no rules of the road. It is not only unfair, but it is  criminal if this continues.   It is so easy to do. This is something we could fix right away. This  is why John McCain led this bill with me. When we introduced it, he  said:         I have long fought to increase transparency and end the       corrupting influence of special interests in political       campaigns, and I am confident the Honest Ads Act will       modernize existing law to safeguard the integrity of our       election system.    This Congress, as I mentioned, Senator Graham took his place. It is  time to get this done. There are many other bills that I will come back  and discuss in the next few weeks that would help on foreign influence  in our elections, but, today, I want to focus on this one because  election security is national security, and it is well past time that  we take action. The American people should expect nothing less from us.  We should be able to get this done.                      Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1356    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Rules  and Administration be discharged from further consideration of S. 1356  and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; further, that  the bill be considered read a third time and passed and the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    I appreciate the words from my colleague from South  Dakota. I point out that the act is a bipartisan bill, with the other  cosponsor being the Republican chair of the Judiciary Committee, and I  think we should be focused on election security instead of protecting  these social media companies. I think we should be protecting the  American people.   We need to be a united front. I appreciate his words, and I look  forward to working with him to get this bill to the floor.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
