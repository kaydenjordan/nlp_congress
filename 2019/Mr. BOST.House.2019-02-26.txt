 Madam Speaker, I have run a small business, and I know that  any organization needs long-term certainty. No organization can  successfully operate under a revolving door of short-term leaders,  especially not one tasked with caring for America's heroes.  Unfortunately, this is what is happening at our Nation's VA centers.   Almost 20 VA medical centers, nationwide, currently lack a permanent  director. Some of these facilities have not been staffed by a permanent  director in almost 2 years. Instead, these facilities are managed by  short-term directors who stay on the job for just a few months.   There is just not a lot you can do in a few months. It is not nearly  long enough to review operations, recommend improvements, and see these  reforms brought through to an end. That is why I introduced bipartisan  legislation with Mr. Costa from California that put an end to this  revolving door. Our bill pushes the VA to hire permanent directors at  all VA medical centers--no more interim directors.   We all want a VA system that can complete its mission to care for  those who shall have borne the battle. Having consistent leadership is  the least we can do for our Nation's heroes.                        Assault on the First Amendment     Madam Speaker, I say to the people of southern Illinois and  this country: Your constitutional rights are under assault. If you are  a law-abiding gun owner, a sportsman, you need to pay attention.   This week, the House Democrats will bring a bill to the floor that  will restrict your freedoms and do little to reduce gun violence.   As a father and a grandfather, I want to reduce gun violence as much  as anyone, but we have to be smart. We can't get roped into scoring  political points. That is why I worked with my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle last year on a measure which is now law to increase  security for our kids in the schools. But the gun control bill being  considered this week makes it harder for law-abiding citizens to defend  themselves and others against criminals who have guns.   We need to enforce the laws already on the books, not limit the  rights of law-abiding citizens who want to protect their families.                            ____________________
