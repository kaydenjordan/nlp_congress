 Mr. Speaker, last month, I had the  pleasure of hosting U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue for a  dairy and agriculture summit in Pennsylvania's 15th District at Mount  Aloysius College in Cresson, Pennsylvania.   Joining the Secretary and I was Gary Groves, Executive Director of  the USDA Pennsylvania Farm Service  [[Page H7871]]  Agency; Russell Redding, Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture  secretary; and my colleagues Representative   John Joyce and  Representative Fred Keller, among others.   The purpose of the event was to learn from our farm families about  what is working, what is not, and where they need support the most. It  was a privilege to host so many hardworking dairy farmers and to learn  from their experiences.   It is important that there are resources available to help the dairy  industry strengthen and grow. At the summit, we discussed these  resources, like the USDA's new Dairy Margin Coverage Program. Programs  like these are strengthening the safety net for farm families  everywhere nationwide.   This revamped, voluntary program is one of the many tools available  to dairy farmers around the Nation that offers more options, more  flexibility, and a better return on investment.   Our Nation's farmers are always working hard. Owning and operating a  farm is a 24/7, 365-day-a-year job. No matter where you are from, a  strong agricultural industry benefits each and every one of our lives.   Of course, the hard work of these men and women would be lost without  strong market opportunities. We must do more to expand opportunities  for American dairy products, both domestically and internationally.   That means making pending trade agreements like the USMCA a reality  by bringing it to a vote in the immediate future because Pennsylvania  deserves freer markets, fairer trade, and increased economic  opportunity.   As the Commonwealth's number one industry, the importance of a strong  agricultural sector cannot be overstated. As the largest sector of the  Pennsylvania agricultural industry, dairy production remains critical.   USMCA brings good news for dairy farmers in Pennsylvania and across  the country, thanks to the elimination of Canada's class 6 and class 7  dairy pricing, which has unfairly limited our export potential.   Our agricultural industry, particularly our dairy farmers, are the  backbone of Pennsylvania's economy, and their success directly impacts  the well-being of the Commonwealth.   Passing USMCA is long overdue. It is time to signal to our Nation's  farmers, manufacturers, small business owners, and two closest trade  partners that we are serious about securing a bright future for  American exports.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  and congratulate DiamondBack Truck Covers, a truck bed cover company in  Philipsburg, Pennsylvania. DiamondBack was recently awarded the Small  Business Administration's Pennsylvania Small Business of the Year  Award.   I had the pleasure of traveling back to Philipsburg to present  DiamondBack founders Ethan Wendle and Matthew Chverchko with a  commendation for this award. Ethan and Matt were also recognized as the  SBA Persons of the Year for Pennsylvania.   Ethan and Matt met at Pennsylvania State University. What started out  as an engineering class project has turned into a flourishing business.   I am particularly proud that Ethan and Matt chose to plant roots in  Philipsburg. This sort of commitment to our local communities is  breathing new life into small town USA. It is companies like  DiamondBack that are helping small towns bounce back.   The decision to manufacture, market, sell, and ship from Philipsburg  is an investment in Pennsylvania's future, in local communities and  businesses, and in the people who call the Commonwealth home.                            ____________________
