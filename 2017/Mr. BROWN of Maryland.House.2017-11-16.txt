 Mr. Speaker, the American people do not  support the GOP tax plan being considered today.   After promising a simple and fair tax system, Republicans offer a  complicated mess. Their tax plan picks winners: the rich, and big  corporations, getting nearly $1 trillion in tax cuts. They create  losers, like teachers, seniors, students, people with disabilities, and  working families who will pay more.   This GOP tax scam also targets our Nation's veterans. More than  300,000 veterans have benefited from the work opportunity tax credit,  most of whom served after 9/11. Yet this bill eliminates the tax credit  and abandons our servicemembers when they return home and transition to  civilian life.   Today, one of every three veterans is underemployed, and 1.8 million  veterans are stuck in low-wage jobs. Every single veteran should be  able to get a family-supporting job at home after serving our Nation.  This tax bill asks our veterans and their families to again sacrifice,  this time so billionaires and big corporations get a huge tax cut.   Mr. Speaker, veterans deserve a better deal and so do American  working families.                            ____________________
