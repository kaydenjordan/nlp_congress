 Mr. President, I am honored to be cochairing the  Entrepreneurship Caucus with the Senator from South Carolina. He is  right that there are some great examples of people who want to get  businesses started and who want to pursue their dreams, and we need to  highlight those because we have a lot of people who right now have some  great new ideas. If we are going to continue to be a country that is an  incubator for those ideas, then, we have to promote those ideas and  allow those people to follow their dreams.  [[Page S2409]]
