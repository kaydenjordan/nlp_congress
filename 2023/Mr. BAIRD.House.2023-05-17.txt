 Madam Speaker, this National Police Week, we pause to  recognize the brave men and women in blue who are committed to keeping  our communities safe, and we remember those who lost their lives in the  line of duty.   Our Nation is blessed to have the bravest and most professional  police officers in the world. This week gives us the ability not only  to recognize their commitment to preserving peace and saving lives, but  it gives us the chance to assess what we can do in Congress to help  support them and to make their lives a bit easier as they protect our  communities.   I may be biased, but I believe west central Indiana has some of the  finest law enforcement officers in the country, and I am fortunate to  have an open line of communication with them to identify issues that  require Federal solutions.   Sheriff Myers in Morgan County has been instrumental in helping craft  my bill, the PART Act, which gives law enforcement officials the tools  they need to hold thieves accountable for catalytic converter theft.  This may seem like a relatively small problem, but you ask any law  enforcement official in your district, and they will tell you that  skyrocketing catalytic converter thefts are taking up a lot of their  time and resources that could be used for a better purpose.   This is an easy and bipartisan way for us to support our law  enforcement officials, and I would encourage my colleagues to consider  helping me get this bill across the finish line so we can unburden some  of our law enforcement.    To close, I just want to say this to the men and women in blue who  have dedicated their lives to protecting others: Thank you for your  service and thank you for keeping us safe.
