 Madam Speaker, today is State of the Union day, and it  is an opportunity for the Nation to hear from the President on the  progress we have been making and the challenges that lie ahead.   One thing I am looking forward to is hearing about how the Tax Cuts  and Jobs Act and the regulatory reforms we have seen over the past year  are causing our economy to roar back to life, creating more jobs and  putting more money in people's pockets.   Fifty-five years ago, President Kennedy delivered a State of the  Union that recognized the power of tax cuts that put money back into  the private sector. Talking about the economy, President Kennedy said:  ``To achieve these greater gains, one step, above all, is essential . .  . a substantial reduction and revision in Federal income taxes.''   I am glad President Trump and Congress have followed President  Kennedy's and President Reagan's model. The economic revival happening  today is not only lifting incomes, it is what is going to generate the  tax revenues that will help us meet the challenges that lie ahead. That  is something for all Americans to celebrate.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill.   I have said it before and I will say it again:   Last summer, the House passed all 12 appropriations bills before the  2018 fiscal year started on October 1. In those bills, we appropriated  the funds necessary to equip our servicemembers with the resources they  need to defend this country in the face of threats from North Korea,  China, Russia, al-Qaida,  [[Page H724]]  ISIS, Iran, and cyber threats, just to name a few.   Yet our servicemembers have been routinely denied access to these  resources as Senate Democrats have been holding back the full funding  of our armed services. In doing so, they ask our servicemembers to go  into battle with aging equipment and insufficient resources, risking  their lives to defend America. Just 10 days ago, we had another  helicopter accident and we lost two pilots who were in an Apache.   Our men and women in uniform haven't even had a modest pay raise in a  very long time. It is time to deliver on this commitment.   Mr. Speaker, we have the opportunity at times to visit our troops  overseas. I had the opportunity at the end of last year to look into  the young faces of our men and women over there. They are expecting us  to do this.   I would like to remind my colleagues across the aisle that our  adversaries are on the move. Russia and China are expansionists now.  North Korea and Iran fire off ballistic missiles at our allies,  destabilizing those regions. There is no doubt that our inaction only  emboldens them.   Mr. Speaker, we must rebuild our military before it is too late. The  choice is easy: we either deter our enemies through superior strength,  or we risk greater conflict by demonstrating weakness.   Let me be clear: what we spend on our defenses should not be a  function of any other program. It should be a function of the threats  our Nation faces and what we owe our servicemembers in the field.   Mr. Speaker, I implore my colleagues across the aisle to fund our  military today.
