 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the  Republican's pay-more-for-less healthcare plan.   I often repeat the 1966 observation of Martin Luther King, Jr., that,  of all the inequalities that exist, the injustice in health care is the  most egregious and inhumane.   On the day it was passed, I observed that the Affordable Care Act is  the Civil Rights Act of the 21st century. Repealing the Affordable Care  Act would be inhumane and put egregious forms of discrimination back  into our healthcare delivery system.   My Republican colleagues and President Trump have promised more  coverage and less cost for everyone. However, this plan would allow all  States to eliminate essential health benefits, such as maternity and  newborn coverage, prescription drugs, hospitalization, emergency  coverage, and mental health services. It would also allow States to tax  older Americans five times more than younger Americans.   Republicans are reneging on their promise to protect Americans with  preexisting conditions. Without essential health benefits standards,  protections for those with preexisting conditions will exist in name  only.   Repeal of the essential health benefits would drive a race to the  bottom, with insurers dropping coverage for everything from  chemotherapy to high-cost drugs.   It would precipitate a proliferation of junk policies that have  historically plagued unsuspecting low-income communities for years.  People with preexisting conditions who need these and other costly  services would not be able to find the coverage they need at any price,  much less an affordable one. We took a giant step away from this with  the ACA, but this Republican bill takes us back to that era where  people with preexisting conditions are left in the cold.   Adding money to a State slush fund is not a solution. Repealing the  ACA would, once again, institutionalize inhumanity and egregiousness.                                time  1330
