 Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt about it, wokeness is  destroying America. The proof is all around us. It has managed to seep  into our schools, businesses, publications, and nearly every other nook  and cranny of our great society. Even our military is prioritizing  diversity and inclusion over strength and readiness.   Schools are teaching critical race theory and revisionist history  over truth and fact, brainwashing our kids with a leftist doctrine on  what to think instead of how to think and formulate ideas for  themselves.   Agendas to defund and demonize police officers are hindering police  departments' ability to hire new personnel and to protect their  communities.   Radical climate change policies are decimating our energy sector. The  foolish push for electric vehicles is increasing our dependency on an  enemy like Communist China.    Liberal judges are refusing to prosecute violent criminals and  enabling this tsunami of a crime wave that is washing over our Nation.   The continued exploitation of programs like humanitarian parole is  worsening the border crisis and allowing millions of illegal aliens to  enter the country on the taxpayers' dime and making it more likely that  we will be hit with another terrorist attack like 9/11, or even worse.  The list goes on.   The fact remains that the left's woke policies plague our Nation, and  we must find a remedy before the damage done becomes permanent.   By using common sense--and merely putting American interests first-- many of the policies in the two appropriations bills that are currently  being debated and voted on this week work to eliminate these woke and  disastrous policies. Unsurprisingly, my Democrat colleagues across the  aisle strongly oppose these commonsense policies and changes.   The American people know better. No longer should we fund the Wuhan  lab responsible for unleashing COVID-19 into the world. No longer  should we allow those with ties to the Communist Chinese Party, Russia,  North Korea, or Iran to purchase U.S. farmland.   No longer should Federal funds be used by the Defense Department to  enforce critical race theory and other DEI policies and sidetracking  our military from its primary mission to destroy our enemies and keep  us free.   These are just a few of the ways that House Republicans are  prioritizing the Nation's needs over a political agenda that throws  merit and ability out the window.                                time  1915    We must remain steadfast in our mission to loosen this disastrous  grip that wokeness has had on America for far too long. Our national  security, our food security, our energy security, our overall  sovereignty, and our national survival depend on it.
