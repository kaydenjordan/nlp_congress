 Mr. President, I want to address this body and talk  about an issue that we do not talk about enough--the deficit. It is an  issue that, for whatever reason, we have stopped talking about in  Washington, DC. We talk about tax policy, which we should. We talk  about disaster relief areas, which we should. We talk about healthcare  policy, which we should, and a lot of other things. We have stopped  talking about the debt and deficit, and I think that is a mistake for  us.   You see, after 2011, the trend moved from a high point. Deficit  spending that year was $1.3 trillion--overspending in a single year.  After that point, the deficit went down a little bit each year until  2015. In 2016 our deficit number--that is a single year of  overspending--started going back up. It went up in 2016, and it went up  again in 2017. It is turning in the wrong direction. As you will recall  and as many people in this body will recall, deficits were a major  topic for us starting in 2010. Each year, Congress was trying to find  ways to be able to reduce the deficit. That does not seem to be the  issue anymore.   What I bring is a set of solutions and a set of ideas. How do we get  out of this? Are there bipartisan solutions to actually deal with  deficit overspending? There are priority things that we need to spend  money on, and we should spend money on those things. Yet, as to the  things that are nonessential for us and on which we might all find some  way to agree that there is a better way to be able to spend our  dollars, we should.   So this week I have produced our third annual ``Federal Fumbles''  book. We call it ``100 ways the Federal Government has dropped the  ball.'' None of these should be all that controversial, though we will  not agree with all of them. But there are simple ways to look at what  the Federal Government is doing, what it is not doing, where we are  spending, where we are overspending, and where additional oversight is  needed. There is no problem in this country that can't be solved, and,  certainly, our deficit is an issue that can be solved. We just have to  commit to each of us making the decision that this is actually  important and that we are going to try to resolve this to try to get us  back toward balance.   I have lumped all of these issues from this book back into a whole  series of different process things because each one of the 100 things  that we identify is not just a stand-alone; it is part of a bigger  problem. So I have put them together into budget process reforms and  grant process reforms, which allow for more transparency in how  decisions are made and as to what decisions have been made. I would  say, as well, that there are Senate rule changes that are going to be  needed to be able to resolve any of these issues. We put together these  four big blocks to be able to ask: What are we actually dealing with?  Let me just give you a couple of ideas.   If we are going to actually deal with some of the budget issues, we  are going to have to actually deal with the budget process. We are not  going to get a better product until we get a better process. Since  1974, the Budget Act has only worked four times, and every year the  American people have asked over and over: What just happened? How  [[Page S7342]]  come we are back in this budget fight? How come it is at the end of the  year? How come this is not resolved? Because we have a bad process-- that is why. Our process is not constitutional. It is the product of a  law that was put in the Budget Act. We need to be able to change that,  and I think there are some basic ways to be able to resolve that.   I would like to do budgeting and appropriations every 2 years. That  would give us more time to be able to do more oversight, and that would  give us more time for floor debate on it to be able to walk through  this. There are multiple other areas that need to be resolved, like  aligning our committees and other things that need to be done if we are  actually going to get budget work done. In the meantime, we need to be  able to push through what we can with the greatest efficiency, but,  long term, we are going to have to fix the broken process that we have.   We should fix the grant-making process. There has been a lot of  pressure to be able to move dollars toward grants because now we have  put more and more restrictions on contracting. Because there are very  few restrictions on grants, a lot of agencies are now spending more on  grants than they are on contracting, and they are pushing dollars out  the door with there being very little supervision.   We have to work on transparency. I am ashamed to say that for 6 years  I have pushed on a very simple bill called the Taxpayers Right-To-Know  Act. It passed unanimously in the House in 2 different years. It came  over to the Senate, and it got tied up. The Taxpayers Right-To-Know Act  is very simple. It asks every agency to list everything that it does.  What a shocking thing it would be to actually know everything that  every agency does--to be able to see what it does, what it spends on  it, how many employees it allocates to it, and how many people it  serves.   Every business in America can give a list of everything that it does  except for the Federal Government. We cannot. We should. It would give  the opportunity for agency heads to find out, before they start a  program, and to know if someone else already does it in the Federal  Government. I have talked to multiple agency individuals now, under two  different Presidents, who have said that they have started a program,  gotten it developed, committed people to it, and then a couple of  months or years later determined that somebody else was already doing  it. Even our agency folks do not know what the other agencies are  doing. This should be a simple, straightforward solution to be able to  help our agencies and to be able to help all of us have greater  supervision over the budget.   The fourth thing is dealing with Senate rule changes. If we do not  solve the issue of our nominations, we will never be able to get actual  legislation on the floor and get back to debate again. We have stopped  debating on major bills. We have stopped debating on small bills.  Because it takes so much time, it is easier to just not do it at all.  That is not what the American people sent us here to do. When we say  that the Senate cannot debate a topic, no one can believe it. That rule  doesn't get better based on inactivity. It gets better when we actually  fix the basic problem that we have, and that is getting us back to  debate and solving the nomination process. Let's actually get this  resolved.    In saying all of that, all of the things that are in this book this  year are things that I and my staff and my team--and Derek Osborn, who  has led in all of the compilation of this on my team--have put  together. We have put together this basic package to say: Here are 100  items. Quite frankly, I would hope that all 100 Senators could go  through budget areas and that everybody could find 100 items and could  identify them and say: Let's compare our lists and then ask: What are  we going to do to be able to deal with the debt and deficit? How are we  going to deal with some of the spending and inefficiencies of the  Federal Government? We would probably have 100 different lists, but I  would bet that, of the 100 different lists, we would find a lot of  common ground, and we would actually start to solve some things.   What type of things did we find on our list this year? Let me give  you some examples.   The National Science Foundation did a grant this past year to study  the effects and how things are going for refugees in Iceland. Now, I am  sure that the country of Iceland would like to know how it is going for  their refugees, and maybe even the U.N. would like to know, but I am a  little stunned that the National Science Foundation used American tax  dollars to study refugees in Iceland.   The National Endowment for the Arts did a grant this past year to  help pay for a local community theater in New Hampshire in its  performance of ``Doggie Hamlet.'' ``Doggie Hamlet'' is an outdoor  presentation in which a group of people yells and sings around a group  of sheep and sheep dogs. I have watched the performance, and I think it  is fine if the folks of New Hampshire want to do that performance. I am  just not sure why the people of Oklahoma are being forced through their  Federal tax dollars to pay for the production of ``Doggie Hamlet.''   Last year, the Department of Defense moved some equipment into Kuwait  to be able to give it to the Iraqi army. So $1 billion worth of  equipment was moved into Kuwait to give it to the Iraqi army--Humvees,  small arms, mortars. All of that is fine, as we were helping to equip  the Iraqi army to allow them to be able to defend themselves. The  problem is that we lost track of them somewhere between Kuwait and  Iraq, and the DOD doesn't know what happened to $1 billion of equipment  after it was delivered to Kuwait.   The IRS has had multiple issues that we have tried to identify in  different segments of this. One is that several years ago we noticed  that the IRS was rehiring employees whom it had fired--the employees  who were not paying their income taxes but were working for the IRS or  the employees who were using their positions to spy on other Americans  and pull up their tax information just because of their own interests.  It is a fireable offense at the IRS--and it should be--to violate an  American's privacy. The problem is that the IRS has started rehiring  those same people right back. I don't know many companies that fire  somebody and then later decide they are going to change their minds and  rehire him, but, apparently, the IRS has become proficient at that. We  identified it several years ago. The IRS said it would stop it. We did  a check on that last year, and guess what. The IRS is still doing it-- rehiring the employees it has fired, some of them even with their files  that are stamped ``do not hire.'' The IRS hired them anyway. We have to  be able to stop that.   The IRS also did a study, through a program that it has, to be able  to research tax compliance--not of changing tax rules, just of how  people are complying with the tax rules and evaluating: Are they paying  the correct amount of tax? Quite frankly, our tax system is so  incredibly complicated that it is hard to be able to track what is the  right amount, but the IRS should be able to look at it and determine  whether someone is paying the right amount based on those figures. The  IRS has developed some programs to be able to recommend, but the  problem is that it has not implemented those programs. Over $400  billion of taxes has never been collected by the IRS because it has not  implemented the recommendations that it has in front of it already.   The IRS has also had an issue that we are trying to deal with, along  with several other entities by the way: Who is alive and who is not  alive? You see, the Social Security Administration keeps track of  something called the Death Master File. It sounds wonderful; doesn't  it? The Death Master File basically says who has passed away in America  and what Social Security number is not functional anymore. The IRS is  not fully implementing that list and, at times, it is still sending  checks to people who died years ago. Then, some fraudulent people take  a Social Security number from someone who has passed away and file a  return on that Social Security number in January or February, and the  IRS sends them a check simply because it has not listed that this  person has passed away and that the Social Security number is not  active. Yet the IRS is not the only one.   We also identified in the SNAP program--what some people call the  food stamp program--that there are thousands of retailers who are using  these  [[Page S7343]]  false Social Security numbers from people who have passed away. Last  year, $2.6 billion was sent out to SNAP retailers based on the Social  Security numbers of the people who had passed away or on the numbers  that are not operable. Those are things that are fixable. There is $2.6  billion of fraud that is in the system.   We have asked the question about immigration, and immigration has  been an important topic here. We talk about immigration as well and not  just of the financial portion of it but of the fumble portion of things  that are actually going wrong in immigration currently. A lot of  folks--and some folks even in this body--say: If we will just enforce  the law as it exists and build a fence, we will be fine. The problem is  that 66 percent of the people who are in the country illegally came  into the country legally, with a legal visa, but they overstayed the  visas. They never left.   After 9/11, the 9/11 Commission said that one of the major aspects in  dealing with immigration was to do an entry-exit visa system so that we  would know who they were when people came in, and we would also know  when they left. That was a recommendation from the 9/11 Commission, but  it has still not been done a decade and a half later.   If we are going to deal with immigration, one of the key things that  we have to have is not just a wall or a fence or some sort of barrier.  We also have to deal with when people come in and when they leave under  legal visa systems. I have heard comments about hiring more Border  Patrol folks and more ICE folks. That is OK, fine. I am good with that,  actually, but here is the problem. With the current system that is set  up, it takes over 450 days to hire one person as a Border Patrol person  because the process is so convoluted--450 days. What if you would like  to apply for a job and you wouldn't hear back about it for a year and a  half--450 days?    What about if we are going to add more immigration attorneys? We have  a half-million-person backlog in our immigration courts right now. What  if we were to hire more judges for that process? Great idea. Guess how  long it takes to hire more judges in the immigration court? It takes  742 days right now to be able to hire a judge to add to the immigration  courts. Our problems are not just in immigration. There are structural  problems in the Federal Government right now in hiring, oversight, and  in managing the reports.   I mentioned the IRS's not implementing one of the reports they have.  There is also an issue with some other agencies that will put on the  back of Federal vehicles their phone number with this question: How is  my driving? What a great idea that is for a Federal vehicle. The  problem is that when we looked at it, we found out that the agencies  never actually read the reports that came in. If people called in and  said that this particular car number is driving crazy, no one is  actually looking at it. It is the fear that Americans have that no one  is really listening to them in the Federal Government.   Claire McCaskill and I just worked to be able to pass something in  this body to try to deal with solving this basic question: Can agencies  ask: How am I doing?   When most of us get a rental car or a hotel room online, we will get  an email after we check out of the room or stop using the rental car  asking: How is our service? How can we improve?   Do you know that Federal agencies can't do that or that it has become  so complicated that they can't produce a three-question e-survey to  send out to people saying: How are we doing in Social Security  disability? How are we doing in the Veterans' Administration? How are  we doing in our HUD assistance to you? The reason for that is the  Paperwork Reduction Act, of all things. An old law that was supposed to  help us is actually now in the way, now in the modern age, of our  trying to do basic surveys. We need to be able to resolve that. That is  something this body can lead on to be able to change.   There are a lot of things we want to be able to identify and to say  that we can do better. This is our list. Quite frankly, this is our to- do list for the next year, just as the previous two volumes have been.  We have seen some things that we have been able to accomplish over the  last couple of years from previous ``Federal Fumbles'' books, but we  can't get started on them until we actually identify them and say: That  is a problem. How are we going to fix it? Our simple question for the  rest of this body is this: Here is our list; what is yours? What are  the things we are working on? What are the issues that we are actually  going to get done and solve for the American people? What are the crazy  stories and things we are wasting money on? If we only identified it  and said: Let's stop that, we could and would. Let's do it together.   There is no reason that reducing the deficit should have to be an  issue that has become a partisan issue. Deficits and the growing debt  affect every single American. So let's work on it together, and let's  stop finding ways to not work on it and find areas of common ground  where we can work on it.   Let's fix inefficiencies in Federal Government hiring. Let's fix  inefficiencies in our system. We have a tremendous number of great  Federal employees who are all around the country and who work extremely  hard for the American people every day and do great work, but they are  trapped in a system that slows them down, that prevents them from being  as efficient as they would like to be. Let's help them out by fixing  the broken things that are in these agencies and systems. Let's set  them free to be able to serve people the way they want to be able to  serve people.   There are things we can do. Let's get busy doing it. If you are  interested in knowing more about ``Federal Fumbles'' go to our website  at lankford.senate.gov. We will send a copy over. We will send you a  link to our website because it is cheaper and we will not have to print  it off, and you can look at it online.   The issue of the day is this: Let's find out what your list is; we  have started ours.   With that, I yield the floor.
