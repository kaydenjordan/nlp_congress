 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and  fellow North Carolinian, Mr. Budd.   From San Francisco to my district in Mecklenburg County, North  Carolina, cities across the country are declaring themselves sanctuary  cities. The term sounds peaceful, but the results are exactly the  opposite.   For example, North Carolina sheriffs in a few urban counties released  over 500 illegal aliens last year, who were convicted or accused of  serious crimes, including domestic violence, indecency with a child,  even rape, and murder.   Rather than hand over these vicious criminals to the Federal  authorities, sanctuary cities and counties release them into your  community to prey on you and your family.   What is the purpose of this policy? Clearly, it is not public safety.  Nor is it for the protection of immigrant communities; indeed, they are  the most victimized by these predators. Rather, it is meant to serve a  national liberal agenda that prizes open borders over community safety.   Across the Nation, we were horrified to learn last year about a 92- year-old woman brutally raped and murdered at the hands of an  individual who should have never been released--whom ICE asked to hold.   So, the increasing breakdown in the relationship between Federal and  local authorities isn't just theoretically dangerous.   Further, sanctuary policies put dedicated law enforcement officers at  risk. When criminals are released, despite an ICE detainer, ICE has a  statutory responsibility to collect them. Rather than have a secure  transfer, ICE must go into the community to track down the individual  for an uncontrolled arrest.   Ironically, if the situation turns violent, the very local police who  arrested the alien the first time will be there to back up ICE.   To hold these jurisdictions to account, I was proud to sign on to the  Justice for Victims of Sanctuary Cities Act, which would allow victims  of crimes committed by individuals released under sanctuary city  policies, or their survivors, to sue sanctuary jurisdictions.   For example, in the New York City case, the woman's family would be  able to sue the local government for allowing the release of her  killer, who should have been safely in ICE custody.   Often, cities and towns claim immunity from being sued like this,  denying victims' rights. This bill would allow communities to maintain  that practice, but not at the expense of American taxpayers.   I have heard across the aisle that sanctuary cities only release  individuals who pose no community harm. If you believe that, you should  have no issue with this bill because those who are released won't  endanger the community, and no one would ever be enabled to sue.   I, however, believe we must take this threat seriously and impose  concrete costs to communities who refuse to follow the law.   I am proud to support this bill introduced by my friend, Congressman  Budd, and urge my colleagues to do the same.                                time  1645
