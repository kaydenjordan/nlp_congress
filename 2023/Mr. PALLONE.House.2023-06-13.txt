 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak in strong opposition to H.R. 1615. This  bill is an attempt to deliberately mislead the American people into  thinking that they are at risk of losing their gas stoves.    Let me be emphatically clear. The Consumer Product Safety Commission  is not banning gas stoves. The idea that anyone is coming into American  homes to remove gas stoves is ridiculous. They are not banning gas  stoves.   These facts have not stopped supporters of this bill from touting  this false narrative to scare consumers and proposing legislation, like  this bill, that will have detrimental impacts on our constituents'  health and safety.   By limiting the tools that the CPSC can use to protect consumers,  H.R. 1615 puts politics over people and consumer safety. It puts  slogans over science-based policy decisionmaking.   The CPSC is an independent Federal agency with a long history of  identifying and protecting children and adults from a wide range of  products that are hazardous or that pose a risk of serious injury or  death. The CPSC carries out its mission in numerous ways. It  investigates safety allegations and recalls dangerous products to keep  them off the market. It also works with industry to develop voluntary  product safety standards. It issues and enforces standards for  hazardous products so that it can ensure that these products are not  dangerous for consumers.   In recent years, the CPSC has removed hazardous infant sleeping  products. It has adapted corded window coverings to protect children  from strangulation. It has worked with industry to reduce the risk of  fires from hoverboards and scooters.   The CPSC's work saves life by protecting consumers--in many  instances, children--from dangerous products, but H.R. 1615 will  prevent the CPSC from doing its job.   Last December, the agency issued a recall of a gas stove product that  was found to be a serious risk of injury or death from carbon monoxide  poisoning. The agency was doing its job in recalling a dangerous  product, but H.R. 1615 would prohibit the agency from using its  rulemaking authority to ban such hazardous products, which could  endanger the lives of any American who has that dangerous product in  their home.   If you think about this, what you are basically saying is that this  agency that protects our safety and health is just basically going to  be emasculated and can't do its job. What possible help is that? Why  would you do such a thing?   Each and every American benefits from the work done by the CPSC, and  it would be unconscionable to weaken the Commission's authority.   This bill sets, in my opinion, a dangerous precedent, Mr. Chair, of  stifling scientific investigation into health hazards and limiting the  agency's authority to keep our children safe. Instead of taking actions  to limit the agency's authority, we should encourage their work to  explore allegations that consumer products put our children's health  and safety at risk.   We should give the agency all the tools that they need, not eliminate  the tools they currently have, to address health and safety risks as  they arise.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 1615. We must  protect the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the authority to  protect the health and safety of all Americans, but particularly our  children.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1600     Mr. Chair, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), the ranking member of our  Innovation, Data, and Commerce Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I listened to my colleague from North Dakota, who I respect a great  deal, but he specifically said, and I wrote it down, that this  legislation would prohibit the Consumer Product Safety Commission from  regulating gas stoves as a hazardous product.   Now, you listened to my colleague from Illinois, Ms. Schakowsky, who  said that from a practical point of view, how does that make sense?  [[Page H2847]]    This is the agency that is charged with basically looking at these  products to see if they are hazardous, if they are unsafe for kids, if  they are going to cause serious injury or death.   Now, one person, one commissioner has made some statements suggesting  that he might be interested in banning gas stoves. I don't know all the  details, but I understand that there is one commissioner that keeps  being quoted.   First of all, this Commission has five members. There is one vacancy.  Because one commissioner says that and doesn't have the power to  effectuate it because he is only one person, you are then going to tell  me that we should now take this sort of hatchet approach or severe  approach of saying, well, then, because one commissioner thinks that,  therefore, we should say that this commission cannot regulate gas  stoves as a hazardous product?    Frankly, that is like cutting off your leg because you decide that  there is some threat or something. It makes no sense to me.   We have the chairman of the Commission who actually used to work for  the Energy and Commerce Committee; Chairman Hoehn-Saric.   He has been crystal clear and has stated publicly that the Consumer  Product Safety Commission is not conducting a rulemaking to ban gas  stoves.   Now, I use the analogy as a Member of Congress. I am one out of what,  435? I don't have the authority to say that because I want something  done that that is what is going to happen--or even if there were 10 or  20 of us that said that; right?   As a single Member of Congress, I don't have the unilateral authority  to decide what action the House of Representatives is going to take.   By the same token, one single member of the CPSC does not get to  decide what action that body will take, and suggesting otherwise is  just not accurate.   Even if he said that--and I believe he said that he might want to ban  them--why would you then say, now we are going to put a pox on the  whole Commission and say that they don't have the authority to look at  hazards and tell me whether or not certain stoves would be dangerous?   I just think it is really contrary to protection of people's health  and safety to take this kind of action just because one member of the  Commission suggested it, but that is what you do.   Again, I would urge that we be practical about this, and let's not  just take a hatchet to this Commission and this agency that over the  years has protected us in so many ways from faulty products.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I don't know about these celebrity stoves and Hollywood. You can  bring up all of this if you want, but the bottom line is, this  legislation doesn't guarantee that anybody gets to use their gas stove.   If a town in California or a State wants to prohibit it, they are  still free to do so. Let's not give the impression that somehow this  legislation is going to prohibit towns or States or any kind of  municipality from prohibiting gas stoves if they want to do so.   What this legislation says is that an agency that is basically told  by Congress to protect us from hazardous utilities, hazardous  equipment, and hazardous activity is going to be hamstrung so they  can't protect us. That is all you are doing here.   Let's be honest. You are not doing anything else. I think it is  outrageous to say that if this agency finds out that there is something  that is going to kill kids or cause them to be poisoned, that they  can't do their job.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The gentleman keeps saying that this administration is banning gas  stoves. That is simply not the case. Plus, he is talking about  efficiency standards. This legislation is not about efficiency  standards. This legislation is about saying that the Consumer Product  Safety Commission cannot research and make decisions about hazards and  whether a particular gas stove is hazardous to people's health or might  explode. It is not about efficiency standards.   Certainly we are not talking about saying that you have to move  toward an electric stove as opposed to a gas stove. It just bothers me,  Mr. Chair, that the other side continues to talk about banning gas  stoves, about moving toward electric stoves, about efficiency  standards. This is not what this bill is about. This is not what the  Consumer Product Safety Commission is about.   Mr. Chair, again, I would urge opposition because the gentleman is  not talking about this legislation.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Again, I have to speak out against the misinformation that is being  promulgated on the other side. It is simply wrong to argue, as the  previous speaker did, that genuine concerns about the health effects of  gas stove emissions are in any way tied to President Biden's clean  energy agenda.   The Consumer Product Safety Commission is an independent Federal  agency that is tasked solely with protecting consumers, and especially  children, from consumer products that pose an unreasonable risk of  injury or death.   The work of the Consumer Product Safety Commission has nothing to do  with the Biden administration's clean energy policies, whether you  agree with his policies or not, and we shouldn't let Republicans' fear  of protecting our environment baselessly restrict CPSC's tools to  protect America's children and their families' health and safety.    I could just read the bill that Mr. Armstrong, the gentleman from  North Dakota, said before, this bill says that the Commission cannot  regulate gas stoves as a hazardous product or to impose or enforce any  consumer product safety net standard on gas stoves. It has nothing to  do with the environment. It is all about safety, so why do you talk  about these other things?   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H2849]]         Mr. Chair, is the gentleman closing or prepared to  close? I have no additional speakers at this time. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I have to very much disagree with what the sponsor, Mr.  Armstrong, just said. I read section 3 to say that the Consumer Product  Safety Commission would not be able to ``impose or enforce any consumer  product safety standard or rule on gas stoves under [such sections]  that would otherwise result in a prohibition on the use or sale of gas  stoves.''   Mr. Chair, he could argue that that doesn't say that they can't adopt  a safety standard, but the way this is written, it is quite clear that  if they adopt a safety standard that has any possibility of leading to  a ban of some type of gas stove, they wouldn't be allowed to do it.   The majority is really putting a straitjacket on the Commission by  saying that if it does research or any kind of rulemaking or standard  that says that this is hazardous, because that could ultimately lead to  a particular type of gas stove being banned, then the Commission is not  allowed to do it.   I understand what he is saying, but I disagree. I think the way this  rule reads, if I were the Chair of the Commission, I would read this to  say that I can't do research, can't adopt the standard, and can't adopt  anything that would impose a safety standard because if I do that, then  it might lead somehow to the banning of gas stoves.   Mr. Chair, he is kind of being a little cute and loose with this by  suggesting that this just says they can't outright ban stoves. It says  they can't adopt a safety standard.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I keep listening to the speakers on the other side. First  of all, the Consumer Product Safety Commission has not come up with any  rule. Not only have they said they are not going to ban gas stoves, but  this bill doesn't address any rule that they have come up with in  regard to gas stoves. It simply says that they cannot regulate gas  stoves by looking at potential hazards that might kill people or hurt  children.    When I, as a consumer, go to the store and buy something--most people  think that if they buy a gas stove, somebody locally or at the State  level or in Washington has looked at that thing to see whether it is  hazardous and is going to blow up and explode in my face.   What the Republicans are saying is: No, you can't do that. You can't  look at this to see whether it is safe, whether it is going to explode,  or whether it is going to be hazardous to my kids. You can't do that.   You are basically getting rid of what people expect. People expect,  in my opinion--at least my constituents expect--that when they go buy  something that could potentially be hazardous, someone has reviewed it  to see if it is hazardous so it doesn't explode in their face and blow  up their house.   What I am hearing from my constituents when I went home this weekend  is that they are sick and tired of the Republicans coming to the House  floor with misinformation and misleading ideas. They would like us to  do something to help them, whatever the issue is, to actually do  something that is meaningful to them.                                time  1645    This bill is nothing more than some kind of scare tactic by House  Republicans to mislead the American public.   Lastly, Republicans were unable to muster enough votes to move  forward and debate this bill. It is no surprise because the bill is  terrible. At the time, a handful of my Republican colleagues  acknowledged that this bill is just a messaging bill, and it has no  chance of becoming law.   One Member of this body went so far as to say on the Republican side:  Is it really a loss that we aren't passing anything? Haven't we had  enough bills like this one that puts politics over policy and scare  tactics over substance?   This body should be focused on passing meaningful legislation that  works to protect the health and safety of children, their families, and  consumers, and not undermining the work of an expert agency like the  Consumer Product Safety Commission.   Don't keep coming to the floor and saying that this is about clean  energy, or this is about grills or something else. It is strictly about  saying that this agency, which has the job to protect people from  hazardous substances, cannot do that in the case of gas stoves.   I think it is pretty outrageous that my friends are saying that there  isn't going to be a Federal agency that can do that because I know that  when I go to the store and when my residents and my constituents go to  the store, they would like to think that somebody is looking at this  stuff to see whether it is going to explode in their face, and the  other side is saying: No, that is not something that they can do.   I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1640, the so-called  Save Our Gas Stoves Act. This is a Republican messaging bill designed  to deliberately mislead the American people about gas stoves.   Let's set the record straight with a little reality. The Biden  administration is not, and I repeat, not banning gas stoves. This is  nothing but a political stunt.   House Republicans continue to put politics over people. With this  bill today, they are once again putting polluters over people.   H.R. 1640 is designed to prevent the Department of Energy from  finalizing a recently proposed energy efficiency standard for electric  and gas stoves and cooktops that would lower energy bills, improve  Americans' health, and cut pollution.   DOE energy efficiency standards are extremely popular. A recent poll  found that three out of five Americans support stricter energy  efficiency standards for appliances and buildings.   The proposed DOE rule that Republicans are trying to prevent from  moving forward is a commonsense standard. The claim that 96 percent of  gas stoves on the market don't meet the proposed DOE standard is just  not true. Mr. Chair, 50 percent of the market already meets the  proposed standard, including all entry-level models.   More importantly, the proposed standard only applies to new gas  stoves manufactured and sold 3 years after the rule is finalized. That  would give manufacturers more than enough time to meet these new  standards. There is simply no reason for this proposed rule to be  controversial.   No one is saying you can't keep your gas stove. No one is saying you  don't have a choice. No one is saying you have to move to electric  stoves. This is all misinformation.   Rather than acknowledging the facts, Republicans are instead  employing their usual scare tactics, putting politics over people.   Despite what you hear from my Republican colleagues today, the DOE  rule does not ban gas stoves, does not remove gas stoves from homes,  and does not prevent anyone from putting a gas stove in their home.   This rule only applies to new stoves, and, as I said, manufacturers  have 3 years to meet the standard.   Mr. Chair, I am sorry I have to keep repeating it, but I know the  other side keeps repeating the misinformation.   All this means is that if a consumer goes to buy a new gas stove in 3  years, it will be more energy efficient and cheaper to operate. That is  a win for consumers, our health, and our ongoing fight to combat the  worsening climate crisis.   Mr. Chair, to make it worse, Republicans are not just going after  this energy efficiency standard. Since the bill does not include a  sunset clause, it could forever limit the Department of Energy from  taking substantive action to improve energy efficiency of cooktops.  This is just another way Republicans are continuing to prop up their  polluter friends.   This bill as well as the REINS Act, which is on the floor later this  evening, show that Republicans are skeptical of everything agencies do,  including all rulemakings and regulations.   Republicans think that they can do the math, conduct the analysis,  and reach conclusions better than the subject matter experts at our  Federal agencies. That is not how our government works. We hire agency  experts to make the best decisions and do their jobs best. The  Department of Energy rulemaking process is detailed and well  researched, with ample opportunity for public engagement.   Commonsense energy efficiency standards save everyday Americans money  and reduce emissions. These standards are popular, and cooktops that  meet the standard are already available on the market.   Republicans claim to care about energy prices, but this Republican  bill prohibits the Department of Energy from finalizing a rule that can  save consumers up to $1.7 billion.                                time  1830    Mr. Chair, H.R. 1640 should be rejected so that the Department of  Energy can proceed with its commonsense energy efficiency standards.   Mr. Chair, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes), who is a member of the committee.     Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Kamlager-Dove).    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Mrs. McClellan).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle love to claim that they  support lower energy costs, but the fact is that this bill will  increase costs for consumers. As a result of appliance efficiency  standards in effect today, the average American household saves roughly  $500 annually on utility bills, and this bill blocks an efficiency  standard that will save consumers up to $1.7 billion. This will  specifically impact low- and moderate-income households that spend more  of their money on energy bills.   I also think it is ironic that Republicans have cited the American  Gas Association's strong support for this bill. AGA is an association  of gas utilities that make more money when consumers use more gas.  Should we be surprised that they oppose a standard that makes gas  stoves more efficient and affordable?   This bill is nothing but a handout to the fossil fuel industry, and  that would drive prices higher for Americans. Mr. Chair, I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I take a moment to draw attention to a fundamental  difference between the Democrats and our friends across the aisle.   Over the last few years, Democrats enacted $4.5 billion to help  Americans with their home energy bills and replace appliances, $4.5  billion for energy efficiency retrofits, and historic funding for  weatherization and low-income energy assistance, including a record $6  billion for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program in last  year's omnibus spending bill.   All this funding goes to Americans' pocket to help them lower their  energy bills during a time of increasing climate threats, turbulent  fossil fuel prices, and economic challenges caused by the pandemic and  the war in Ukraine.   Democrats have worked hard to help Americans pay the energy bills.  Republicans, on the other hand, are working hard for their fossil fuel  friends.   While Democrats advocate the energy efficient standards that lower  bills, Republicans try to chip away at the Department of Energy's  conservation work. While Democrats defend families and try to ensure  indoor appliances don't emit harmful pollutants, Republicans push bills  endorsed by the American Gas Association, bills that ensure gas stoves  use more energy than they really need.   So let me be clear. Democrats are advocating for everyday Americans,  and Republicans are advocating for their fossil fuel friends.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Barragan), a member of the Committee on Energy and  Commerce.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I would just take a moment to bring us back to the real  world. Earlier this week, the administration issued its statement of  administration policy, that is the Biden administration's official  views on this bill, and I have to report that the administration does  not view this bill favorably.   Despite what our Republican colleagues are saying today, the  administration makes clear that in the real world, this bill would  ``deny the American people the savings that come with having more  efficient, new appliances on the market.''   The administration is right. This bill is not about freedom. I keep  hearing that a lot on the other side. It is not about choice--they keep  mentioning that--or about saving gas stoves, because we are not banning  it. It is about taking away the freedom of Americans to save money to  buy new, efficient appliances.   The bill's authors do not believe in the essentially American  innovation that has brought consumers a cumulative $2 trillion in  savings since DOE first issued efficiency standards.   Now, let me say, our committee, the Committee on Energy and Commerce,  prides ourselves on being the committee of innovation, of invention, of  doing things better. I come from a district in Menlo Park and in  Edison, New Jersey, where Thomas Edison invented the light bulb, the  motion picture, and so many different things.   We should be proud of the fact that we are trying to do things  differently, more efficiently, more innovatively. I listen to my  colleagues on the other side. For a Republican Party that claims that  it wants to let Americans make their own individual choices, this  doesn't seem like much of a choice at all.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. In  closing, let me just say that this is the second bill that came up  today dealing with gas stoves. If there is one message that I really  want to give to my colleagues, and urge them to vote against this bill,  as well as the previous one, is that we are not banning gas stoves. I  don't know how many times I can say that. The administration, the  Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Department of Energy, all of  them had made clear over and over again that we are not banning gas  stoves.   What we are doing in this case with this bill is to try to provide  more energy efficiency, which has been something that the Department of  Energy has done for years. We have given them the authority and urged  them to deal with and come up with more efficient appliances, whether  it is gas stoves, electric stoves, cooktops, whatever it happens to be.  So why not let them do that? Why keep saying that we are banning gas  stoves when we are not? Why keep suggesting that somehow eliminating  the Department of Energy's ability to adopt more efficiency standards  for these appliances is not a good thing? It saves money. It makes  sense.   I heard my colleagues on the other side talk about the middle class,  about working people. Working people want to save money. They want more  efficiency. Overwhelmingly, polls show that they believe that  appliances should be more efficient.   I think that when people buy things and go to the appliance store or  to the supermarket, or wherever they are  [[Page H2862]]  buying appliances, they not only expect that those appliances are safe  and safe for themselves and for their kids, but they also think that  the Federal Government is trying to do things to make things more  efficient. There is no reason why we shouldn't.   For those reasons, I would ask my colleagues to vote to oppose this  bill.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, let me say that I am happy to see that the  gentleman from Michigan admits that the Department of Energy is not  banning gas stoves. I keep saying it, but he did say that they are not  banning them, at least not yet, he said.   I want to stress that the efficiency standards in the Department of  Energy rule, again, don't go into effect until 3 years after the rule  is finalized. Even though my colleagues keep saying that we are banning  gas stoves and talk about the efficiency standards and how they have to  get rid of them with this legislation, keep in mind that these  efficiency standards don't even go into effect for another 3 years  after the rule is adopted.   Again, we are not banning gas stoves, just talking about efficiency  standards.   There is also the claim that has been put out there by the  Republicans that 96 percent of gas stoves on the market today don't  meet the proposed DOE standard, and that is just not true. The  statistic that is mentioned by our colleagues on the other side is a  specific test of high-end models that the Department of Energy  anticipated would not meet the standard, meaning one of the tests  conducted by DOE was deliberately designed to focus on models that  would need upgrades to meet the standard. This test was not designed to  represent the whole market.    According to DOE, and you can look at what they have put out, about  half of the market already meets the proposed energy conservation  standard, including all entry-level models at this time.   Again, you can keep your gas stove. We are talking about efficiency  standards in 3 years, not now.   As to the amendment before us, which I oppose, it amends the Energy  Policy and Conservation Act with vague language that would likely be  impossible to implement.   Additionally, this amendment is clearly designed to target  environmental and clean energy groups. If this amendment is adopted,  and if H.R. 1640 becomes law, it would slow down the Department of  Energy rulemaking process and create additional burdens to adopting  energy conservation standards.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to recognize that this amendment is  pure Republican messaging and would hinder climate action. I urge my  colleagues to vote against the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   There are many problems with the Save Our Gas Stoves Act. One of the  biggest issues, in my opinion, is that this bill not only prevents the  Department of Energy from finalizing a commonsense proposed efficiency  standard, but it also limits future DOE rulemaking.   H.R. 1640 includes Congressional Review Act style language blocking  ``any substantially similar rule.'' This is designed to ensnare future  related rules in a messy legal and linguistic trap.   This language provides no clarity on what a substantially similar  rule means and could hamstring the Department of Energy on future  cooktop and stove efficiency standards.   The bill also amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to limit  and complicate future Department of Energy rulemaking on cooktops and  gas stoves. The bill imposes an additional hurdle in the DOE rulemaking  process and could impact future cooktop standards, regardless of fuel  type.   If this bill becomes law, it will negatively impact the Department of  Energy's ability to issue effective energy conservation standards  related to cooktops and stoves going forward. This would also  significantly impact DOE's ability to reduce energy bills and slash  carbon emissions.   My amendment to H.R. 1640 strikes these harmful and open-ended  provisions from the bill and limits the application of the bill only to  the current proposed Department of Energy standard.   While I still strongly oppose blocking the current rule, it is  critical that we not impede future Department of Energy action.   I urge all my colleagues to support this important amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Let me just say I find it incredible that the Republicans want to  just take away all ability of the Department of Energy to deal with  efficiency standards not only for gas stoves, for electric stoves-- remember, that this rule doesn't just apply to gas stoves or cooktops.  It applies to electric stoves, as well.   Any fair reading of this legislation makes it clear, in my opinion,  that not only are they banning and overturning this bill but  overturning anything else that is within the sphere of efficiency for  cooktops, whether they be gas stoves or electric stoves or anything of  that nature.   Again, I think it is a huge overreach. I, of course, oppose the  underlying bill as well, but it is a huge overreach to say that the  Department of Energy can't deal with this efficiency issue when it  comes to stoves of whatever type in the future because that is what  their job is--to deal with these efficiency standards, and they have  been doing it very effectively to save money and to be innovative.   Mr. Chairman, for those reasons, I would ask for support of my  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
