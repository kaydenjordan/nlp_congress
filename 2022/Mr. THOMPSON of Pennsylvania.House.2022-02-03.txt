 Madam Speaker, yesterday was a big day  in the 15th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.   Early in the morning, tens of thousands of spectators gathered at  Gobbler's Knob in Jefferson County to await the weather prediction from  Pennsylvania's most famous groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil.   For over 120 years, our furry friend has been predicting our winter  weather. This tradition stems from Pennsylvania's strong German  heritage. Legend has it that if Phil sees his shadow, it is an omen of  6 more weeks of winter. If not, we know spring is just around the  corner.   Groundhog Day is an unusual event full of traditions and  celebrations. Crowds begin to gather the night before and wake Phil up  by chanting his name in the early hours of the morning on February 2.  As our weather predictor extraordinaire emerges from his burrow, the  Punxsutawney Groundhog Club Inner Circle president translates Phil's  prediction and relays the message to the crowd.   Records of our meteorologist rodent date back to 1887, with the first  story appearing in the Punxsutawney Spirit. In the years since, Phil  has predicted a longer winter 105 times and an early spring only 20  times.   Our seer of seers saw his shadow, thus predicting 6 more weeks of  cold and snowy weather.   Madam Speaker, let's keep those winter layers close by. Happy  Groundhog Day.                            ____________________
