 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise because the healthcare of millions  of Nevadans and tens of millions of Americans is in danger. Their  healthcare is in danger because, in just a few weeks, the Supreme Court  will consider a case that could overturn the Affordable Care Act  completely. This means that the next Supreme Court Justice will decide  whether individuals with preexisting conditions could, once again, be  denied healthcare coverage.   The fact is, this administration has tried for years to overturn the  Affordable Care Act. First, it attempted to repeal the ACA through  legislation. It failed repeatedly because Congress and the American  people do not support its schemes to take away our healthcare. Then it  changed its strategy and is trying to use the Court to dismantle our  Nation's healthcare system.   Now, with an election just 1 week away, the Senate Republicans are  scrambling to confirm a new Supreme Court Justice in order to tip the  balance of the Court in favor of their lawsuit that aims to destroy the  Affordable Care Act. Rather than waiting for the outcome of the  election, which is already underway, and follow the precedent that they  themselves established in 2016, the McConnell rule, my Republican  colleagues are rushing to put Judge Amy Coney Barrett on the Bench.   Not only does Judge Barrett support the President's position on  dismantling our Nation's healthcare law, but, if confirmed, she could  very well be the deciding vote to undo the Affordable Care Act and take  healthcare away from millions of Americans. Judge Barrett's hostility  toward the Affordable Care Act is on the record, and we have seen a  long and extensive paper trail outlining her opposition to the ACA. Her  past comments, well, they paint a bleak picture of what the Affordable  Care Act's future would look like with a Justice Barrett on the Bench.   To put it simply, this administration's attempt to use the Court to  take away Americans' health insurance and raise the cost of care,  especially at this moment--during a global pandemic--is not only cruel  and reckless, it is deadly.   I have met many Nevada families, and I have heard stories from men,  women, and children whose lives would be just devastated without the  Affordable Care Act: cancer survivors, people with diabetes, asthma,  cystic fibrosis, and countless other preexisting conditions that affect  families. These are real Nevadans whose healthcare would be jeopardized  if the ACA were no longer the law of the land.   I always tell my constituents that I carry their stories with me to  Washington. They inform the actions that I take and the decisions that  I make. I want to take some time to share some of the stories that I  have heard--stories from Nevadans whose lives have been saved and who  enjoy the quality of life because of the Affordable Care Act; stories  from Nevadans who are outraged about what is happening and have reached  out to my office to make their voices heard; and countless stories of  how allowing the ACA to be dismantled would impact their lives.   First, I want to share a letter from Jen, who lives in Henderson, NV.  Jen's husband is one of the 1.2 million Nevadans who is estimated to be  living with a preexisting condition. Like many people, Jen is worried  about the health of her husband and the future of her family if the  Affordable Care Act is eliminated.   Here is what Jen wrote:         Dear Senator Rosen, I am watching the confirmation hearing       for Amy Coney Barrett, and listening to the conversation       around the ACA. I'm scared to death that it will be       overturned, and what that means for me and my husband. In       February 2019, at only 38, he had a devastating stroke, and       had to stay in the hospital for four months. If he hadn't had       insurance, we would never have been able to afford his care.       I'm scared of losing that protection from pre-existing       conditions. He will need specialists for the rest of his       life, as well as physical, occupational, and speech therapy.       We cannot afford his care otherwise. I am so scared. Please       help.    Unfortunately, Jen's situation and concerns are far too common. Many  Nevadans and Americans across our country are worried about a future  where they could lose their lifesaving coverage.   Here is another letter from a Nevadan who lives in Spring Creek who  is worried about his own continued healthcare without the protections  the ACA provides:         I have had asthma my whole life and it's severe. I finally       have good insurance and need it desperately. This will affect       millions of us. I have lived through not having insurance and       it almost killed me. The insurance companies at that time       were asking for premiums higher than what I made.    Nevadans across the State are absolutely terrified about the  possibility of losing care because of this nomination.   I received a letter from a brave Nevadan who lives in Minden, which  is a small town in the western part of our State. She wanted to share  with me her health struggles and her fears for the future. She said  this:         I have been fighting a rare, aggressive form of breast       cancer for the past 4 years and still have numerous surgeries       to undergo as part of my ongoing battle against this       devastating disease. I worry about how the loss of the       preexisting conditions protection would adversely affect my       treatment plan, my everyday financial security, and my       ability to get health insurance in the future should I lose       what I currently have.    The Affordable Care Act has opened the door to healthcare for  Nevadans all over my State, in communities big and small. These are  real people with real struggles and real families who desperately want  the best possible care for their loved ones. That is all. They want the  best care for their loved ones. Don't we all want that?   What is at stake here is life or death for far too many Nevadans and  too many Americans across this country. Assuring the health of our  loved ones should be an essential, basic, human right.   It is thanks to the Affordable Care Act that more than 200,000  Nevadans get coverage through the ACA's expanded Medicaid Program. It  is thanks to the Affordable Care Act that over 77,000 Nevadans have  coverage through the Nevada Health Link insurance exchange, and it is  thanks to the Affordable Care Act that over 19,000 Nevadans under the  age of 26 get to remain covered through their parents' health insurance  plans.   All of these people--that is 1 in 10 Nevadans--could lose their  health insurance if the Supreme Court overturns the ACA.   All of them could face overwhelming costs and denials of the care  they both need and deserve.   Not to mention, it is thanks to the ACA that there are an untold  number of people who can still get coverage because insurance companies  can no longer put lifetime caps on their healthcare coverage. Before  the ACA, an insurance company could limit how much they would pay for  your medical bills over your lifetime.   One constituent from Las Vegas voiced her concerns that without ACA  protections, we would see a return of lifetime caps on coverage.   She said this:         I am concerned about the potential elimination of the       Affordable Care Act. In addition to the potential elimination       of preexisting conditions, no one seems to address  [[Page S6568]]       the issue of lifetime limits, which were eliminated under the       ACA.        For those with long-term illnesses, they stand to risk loss       of medical insurance while battling catastrophic illnesses.        My husband has been battling colon cancer for several       years. If the lifetime limit were to be reinstated, we would       no longer be covered for any of his chemo or other cancer-      related treatments.        I am sure that the insurance companies would jump at the       chance to stop coverage for those with extraordinarily high       medical expenses.    The American people? Well, they want us to protect their care. The  American people want us to protect them. They do not want to see the  Affordable Care Act eliminated.   The fact is, our healthcare coverage is better now than it was before  the ACA was enacted. Insurance plans now have to cover those 10  essential health benefits, and we have fought hard against junk plans  that claim to provide coverage but aren't there when you need them the  most.   In addition to that, many middle-income Nevadans can access  affordable care because of the much needed tax credits that the ACA  provides.   I have spoken with and heard from countless Nevadans, and I can say  with certainty that no issue matters more to people of my State than  their health and safety and the health of their loved ones.   The Affordable Care Act has not only given families the peace of mind  that comes with quality health coverage, but it has literally saved  lives.   Without the critical protections the ACA provides, we risk going back  to the days when big insurance companies could deny insurance coverage  based on preexisting conditions. Repealing the Affordable Care Act  would have dire consequences for hard-working Nevada families and  families across our country.   Healthcare shouldn't be a partisan issue. We have an obligation to  protect the health of our constituents. We need access to healthcare  more now than ever, and taking critical protections away from Nevadans  would be a disaster for our State, and it would be a disaster for our  country   I heard from another constituent, Carol, who lives in Pahrump, who  highlighted the risk of this nomination during the current challenges  our Nation faces due to the pandemic.   Carol wrote to me, saying this:         Our country is in a public health crisis right now, one       that gets worse by the day.        In this moment, we need our legislators to protect our       families, to provide relief and support, to do the job we       elected them to do.        We do not need to rush through the nomination of a Supreme       Court Justice who is on the record as hostile to the law that       provides our healthcare protections.    Well, Carol is right to point out that we are in the middle of a  catastrophic pandemic that has left more than 225,000 Americans dead.  Not only that, but this pandemic could put millions of Americans at  risk of being denied coverage because of a new preexisting condition-- COVID-19. Just imagine being someone who suffered through even a mild  case of COVID-19, only to have their coverage taken away because of  this new preexisting condition.   Just this week, we are seeing the highest positivity rates across the  country we have seen thus far. Instead of developing a clear, national  strategy for combating the coronavirus or crafting comprehensive  legislation to assist Americans in need of a lifeline during this  difficult time, this administration and Senator McConnell seem to be  preoccupied with rushing through a Supreme Court nominee who is  outwardly hostile to the Affordable Care Act.   Since coming to Congress, I have made it my mission not only to  preserve the Affordable Care Act but to expand care for all Americans.  I have worked to increase access, lower costs, and improve quality of  care. In fact, one of my first actions as a Senator was to join my  colleague Senator Joe Manchin in introducing legislation to demand that  the Senate intervene to defend the Affordable Care Act in court.   Instead of joining me and my colleagues and working to protect  Americans' health, this administration is too busy playing politics  with people's lives and is singularly focused on taking away your care,  my care, our care.   Our healthcare is at stake. Our lives are at stake.   Before the Senate confirms a lifetime appointment to our Nation's  highest court, the American people's vote should be counted and their  voices should be heard. This is how the American people feel.   A constituent who lives in Reno wrote to me saying that ``President  Trump has promised to appoint justices who will overturn Roe v. Wade  and undermine access to healthcare--certainly not what I want. And not  what the majority of your constituents want.''   He continues:         The election is already underway and we should be given the       power to decide which President nominates someone for this       seat. The Senate should be focused on addressing the COVID-19       crisis, not fast-tracking a Supreme Court nominee.    We are only 9 days away from an election, but let's be clear. The  election has already started, and millions of Americans all across our  country have already cast their ballot. They have mailed in their  ballots, and early voting is happening in many places as we speak,  including my home State of Nevada.   We should allow the American people to have their say at the ballot  box before the Senate considers a lifetime appointment to the Supreme  Court--one that will determine the future of access to quality,  affordable healthcare in the United States for everyone.   I am sure that other Senators--well, they are hearing the same  stories from their constituents like the ones I have shared today, and  I truly hope that my colleagues really listen to them; that they really  hear the pain, the anguish, and the anxiety that so many Americans are  feeling right here in this moment. Their lives, their healthcare--they  are going to be directly impacted by our decisions.   I will not support the nomination of a Supreme Court Justice who does  not support the Affordable Care Act. I will vote against Judge  Barrett's nomination   I yield the floor.
