 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of  this legislation.   This bill is one of the most consequential policies considered by  this body during my time in Congress. From top to bottom, it provides  struggling Americans with the relief that they need.   It provides critical healthcare funding to help crush the virus,  including funds to continue ramping up vaccinations.   It provides funds to help small businesses stay afloat, to help  restaurants keep their lights on, to help families afford health  insurance, to keep workers employed, and to help kids get back into  school.   It bolsters State and local governments and provides emergency  assistance to the millions of Americans behind on rent. On top of that,  this bill is projected to cut child poverty in this country in half.   This is an excellent bill, and I thank my colleagues, the chairman,  especially, and our partners in the administration for swiftly bringing  this critical relief to the floor.   The American people know that help is on the way. I urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes.''    Mr. Speaker, every day 30 people are  killed by someone using a gun. That number jumps to 100 if you factor  in accidents and suicides involving guns. The steady stream of gun  violence devastates families, communities, and schools.   Gun violence costs our country $280 billion every year. This status  quo is not okay.   Our constituents know it, and they support H.R. 8 overwhelmingly.   The Special Order last night on H.R. 8 was another low point for  decorum in the House. To be generous, it was an embarrassing display  and a complete misrepresentation of the facts.   Viewers were told that the bill would create a Federal gun registry.  Wrong. Read page 5, line 18. H.R. 8 prohibits any registry.   They were told you can't give a gun to a family member. Wrong. Read  page 3, line 7. You can.   They were told that you can't transfer a gun if someone was suicidal  or needed it for protection to address a self-defense situation. Wrong.  Read page 3, line 21. You can.   They were told that you can't lend a gun to a friend to go hunting.  Wrong. Read page 4, line 16. You can.   What the bill does do is close the private gun sale loophole, which  has made it easy for felons and other prohibited purchasers to buy a  gun online, at gun shows, or in person-to-person sales.   We know universal background checks work. Every day they stop some  160 felons and some 50 domestic abusers from buying a gun. Every day.   But without universal background checks, these people can take their  business elsewhere, to someone without a Federal firearms license and  buy the same gun.   I have personally filled out the 4473 form required to buy a gun from  a licensed dealer. I have done it many times. It is something that  every responsible gun owner should be able to live with. Heck, they  should welcome it because it helps stop dangerous individuals from  getting a gun.   In 90 percent of the cases, background checks are completed within  minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that these letters that I have from dozens of gun  violence prevention groups, healthcare workers, law enforcement, and  others be included in the Record.                                                      March 5, 2021.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Republican Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader Schumer, Leader McConnell, Speaker       Pelosi, and Leader McCarthy: We write to you in support of       H.R. 8/S. 529 the Bipartisan Background Checks Act and H.R.       1446/S. 591 the Enhanced Background Checks Act. As gun       owners, we understand that responsible gun ownership starts       with background check. Loopholes in federal law have       perpetuated the gun violence crisis in our country, including       those in our background checks system. Congress must enact       meaningful legislation to reduce gun violence. The Bipartisan       Background Checks Act would close one such loophole by       ensuring that a background check happens on every firearms       sale.        Since 1993, the National Instant Criminal Background Check       System (NICS) has conducted firearm background checks on gun  [[Page H1290]]       purchasers. Federally licensed dealers must run a check       through NICS to determine whether a potential buyer is       prohibited from purchasing firearms. If information in NICS       shows that a person is indeed prohibited, the dealer must       deny the sale.        However, no background check is required for sales at gun       shows, through online marketplaces, or between private       individuals. Individuals who would otherwise be prohibited       from purchasing or possessing a gun can easily buy guns       through such unregulated sales. And the frequency of these       unregulated sales is growing: recent studies indicate that       approximately 22 percent of firearms are purchased without a       background check, up to 80% of firearms used in crimes are       obtained without a background check.        H.R. 8/S.B. 529 the Bipartisan Background Checks Act/      Background Check Expansion Act would require a background       check on every sale, ensuring that people prohibited from       purchasing firearms cannot exploit loopholes and purchase       guns through an unregulated sale at a gun show, online, or       from an unlicensed private seller. In addition, individuals       would no longer be able to cross state lines solely to       purchase a firearm in a state with less stringent background       checks. Closing these background check loopholes is critical       to reducing gun violence throughout the United States.        Additionally, H.R. 1446/S. 591 the Enhanced Background       Checks Act/Background Check Completion Act would provide the       FBI more time to complete background checks and ensure that       people prohibited from possessing firearms are not able to       obtain them by default because of an incomplete background       check. This deadly loophole in existing law was exploited by       a white supremacist who killed nine people at the Mother       Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina.        As responsible gun owners, we urge you to consider this       legislation which would help keep our communities safe. Our       support for universal background checks stems from our desire       to protect the Second Amendment rights of law abiding       citizens while maintaining checks and balances to keep       communities safe.        We urge you to pass H.R. 8/S. 529 the Bipartisan Background       Checks Act/Background Check Expansion Act and H.R. 1446/S.       591 the Enhanced Background Checks Act/Background Check       Completion Act, as soon as possible.            Sincerely,      Giffords Gun Owners for Safety.                                   ____                                                      Gun Owners for                                           Responsible Ownership,                                      Lake Grove, OR, March 5, 2021.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Majority Leader,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Minority Leader,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Republican Leader,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader Schumer, Leader McConnell, Speaker       Pelosi, and Leader McCarthy: We are gun owners, outdoors       enthusiasts, and veterans who seek reasonable and responsible       solutions to preventing gun violence. We believe our Second       Amendment rights come with responsibilities. We also believe       in common-sense efforts to reduce gun violence and promote       gun safety across the country, including universal background       checks and safe and secure storage of firearms.        H.R. 8 / S. 529 the Bipartisan Background Checks Act /       Background Check Expansion Act would require a background       check on every sale, ensuring that people prohibited from       purchasing firearms cannot exploit loopholes and purchase       guns through an unregulated sale at a gun show, on line, or       from an unlicensed seller. In addition, individuals would no       longer be able to cross state lines solely to purchase a       firearm in a state with less stringent background checks.       Closing these background check loopholes is critical to       reducing gun violence throughout the United States.        Additionally, H.R. 1446 / S. 591 the Enhanced Background       Checks Act / Background Check Completion Act would provide       the FBI more time to complete background checks and ensure       that people prohibited from possessing firearms are not able       to obtain them by default because of an incomplete background       check. This deadly loophole in existing law was exploited by       a white supremacist who killed nine people at the Mother       Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina.        Oregon adopted universal background checks in 2015 which we       strongly supported. However, our citizens are still       vulnerable to the importation of firearms from states with       less stringent laws. We need federal legislation that will       apply to all.        We urge you to pass H.R. 8 / S. 529 the Bipartisan       Background Checks Act / Background Check Expansion Act and       H.R.1446 / S. 591 the Enhanced Background Checks Act /       Background Check Completion Act, as soon as possible.

Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Republican Leader,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader Schumer, Leader McConnell, Speaker       Pelosi, and Leader McCarthy: States United to Prevent Gun       Violence is a group of 32 state affiliates across the United       States that work on Gun Violence Prevention. We come from all       areas of this country. Urban, rural, and, suburban. We       believe that gun violence is a public health problem, and,       that the legislation proposed will prevent many communities       from suffering the trauma of gun violence.        Since 1993, the National Instant Criminal Background Check       System (NICS) has conducted firearm background checks on gun       purchasers. Federally licensed dealers must run a check       through NICS to determine whether a potential buyer is       prohibited from purchasing firearms. If information in NICS       shows that a person is indeed prohibited, the dealer must       deny the sale.        However, there is a loophole in federal law and no       background check is required for sales at gun shows, through       online marketplaces, or between private individuals.       Individuals who would otherwise be prohibited from purchasing       or possessing a gun can easily buy guns through such       unregulated sales. And the frequency of these unregulated       sales is concerning: recent studies indicate that       approximately 22 percent of firearms are purchased without a       background check, and up to 80% of firearms used in crimes       are obtained without a background check.        H.R. 8 / S. 529 the Bipartisan Background Checks Act /       Background Check Expansion Act would require a background       check on every sale, ensuring that people prohibited from       purchasing firearms cannot exploit loopholes and purchase       guns through an unregulated sale at a gun show, online, or       from an unlicensed seller. In addition, individuals would no       longer be able to cross state lines solely to purchase a       firearm in a state with less stringent background checks.       Closing these background check loopholes is critical to       reducing gun violence throughout the United States.        Additionally, H.R. 1446 / S. S. 591 the Enhanced Background       Checks Act / Background Check Completion Act would provide       the FBI more time to complete background checks and ensure       that people prohibited from possessing firearms are not able       to obtain them by default because of an incomplete background       check. This deadly loophole in existing law was exploited by       a white supremacist who killed nine people at the Mother       Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina.        We know that in many of our states we have not been able to       pass any form of gun Violence Prevention Bills. If passed       these Bills would bring immediate relief to all Americans       from most forms of gun Violence.        We urge you to pass H.R. 8 / S. 529 the Bipartisan       Background Checks Act / Background Check Expansion Act and       H.R. 1446 / S. 591 the Enhanced Background Checks Act /       Background Check Completion Act, as soon as possible.            Sincerely,                                            Clai Lasher-Sommers,                                                 Executive Director,      States United to Prevent Gun Violence.                                   ____                                  Major Cities Chiefs Association,                                                      March 5, 2021.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Republican Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader Schumer, Minority Leader McConnell,       Speaker Pelosi, and Republican Leader McCarthy: I'm writing       on behalf of the Major Cities Chiefs Association (MCCA), a       professional organization of police executives representing       the largest cities in the United States and Canada. The MCCA       strongly supports H.R. 8/S.B. 529, the Bipartisan Background       Checks Act of 2021/Background Check Expansion Act. The       Association has been a strong advocate for sensible gun       policy for many years. Instituting universal background       checks is a core tenant of the MCCA's Firearms Violence       Policy, which our membership approved in 2018.        Since 1993, the National Instant Criminal Background Check       System (NICS) has conducted firearm background checks on gun       purchasers. Federally licensed dealers must run a check       through NICS to determine whether a potential buyer is       prohibited from purchasing firearms. If information in NICS       shows that a person is indeed prohibited, the dealer must       deny the sale. However, there is a loophole in federal law,       and no background check is required for sales at gun shows,       through online marketplaces, or between private individuals.       Individuals who would otherwise be prohibited from purchasing       or possessing a gun can easily buy guns through such       unregulated sales.        H.R. 8/S.B. 529 would require a background check on every       sale, ensuring that people  [[Page H1291]]       prohibited from purchasing firearms cannot exploit loopholes       and purchase guns through an unregulated sale at a gun show,       online, or from an unlicensed seller. In addition,       individuals would no longer be able to cross state lines       solely to purchase a firearm in a state with less stringent       background checks. Closing these background check loopholes       is critical to reducing gun violence throughout the United       States.        Many MCCA members are experiencing a significant uptick in       gun violence in their cities. The MCCA's most recent Violent       Crime Survey, which showed a nationwide rise in both       homicides and aggravated assaults in 2020, supports these       reports. Ensuring background checks for all gun sales and       transfers will save lives by helping keep firearms out of the       hands of those who are not permitted to have them under the       law. It will also be a critical step in combatting the       epidemic of gun violence currently plaguing our country.        Gun violence is more than just a public safety issue; it's       an officer safety issue as well. MCCA members, and law       enforcement agencies all across the country, have had far too       many officers killed or wounded in the line of duty by       individuals who should have been prohibited from purchasing a       firearm. We must enact policies at the national level to help       ensure these brave men and women return home safely after       their shifts.        The MCCA urges Congress to pass H.R. 8/S.B. 529, the       Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021 /Background Check       Expansion Act, as soon as possible. Please do not hesitate to       contact me if the MCCA can be of any assistance.            Sincerely,                                              Chief Art Acevedo,                                   Chief, Houston Police Department,      President, Major Cities Chiefs Association.                                   ____                                                      March 3, 2021.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Republican Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader Schumer, Leader McConnell, Speaker       Pelosi, and Leader McCarthy: We write to you in support of       H.R. 8/S. 529 the Bipartisan Background Checks Act. As       physicians, we believe that gun violence and its associated       traumas are a public health crisis, and that Congress must       enact meaningful legislation to help reduce gun violence in       our communities. In 2019, 39,707 people died from gun       violence. Tragically, the pandemic and resulting economic       fallout may further exacerbate this public health crisis.       Experts have suggested that the pandemic may drive increases       in suicides, domestic violence, and community violence in the       coming years. Several loopholes in federal law--and the       background check system in particular--are not sufficient to       prevent individuals who are ineligible to own a firearm from       purchasing one. The Bipartisan Background Checks Act would       enact universal background checks, closing these dangerous       loopholes by ensuring that a background check happens on       every firearms sale.        The American Medical Women's Association has been the voice       and vision of women in medicine since 1915. Time and time       again, AMWA, as an organization, stands to decrease the       burden of gun related fatalities and violence. AMWA       acknowledges gun violence for what it really is: a deadly       epidemic resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality for       our patients.        Since 1993, the National Instant Criminal Background Check       System (NICS) has conducted firearm background checks on gun       purchasers. Federally licensed dealers must run a check       through NICS to determine whether a potential buyer is       prohibited from purchasing firearms. If information in NICS       shows that a person is indeed prohibited, the dealer must       deny the sale.        However, no background check is required for sales at gun       shows, through online marketplaces, or between private       individuals. Individuals who would otherwise be prohibited       from purchasing or possessing a gun can easily buy guns       through such unregulated sales. And the frequency of these       unregulated sales is concerning: recent studies indicate that       approximately 22 percent of firearms are purchased without a       background check, up to 80% of firearms used in crimes are       obtained without a background check.        H.R. 8/S. 529 the Bipartisan Background Checks Act/      Background Check Expansion Act would require a background       check on every sale, ensuring that people prohibited from       purchasing firearms cannot exploit loopholes and purchase       guns through an unregulated sale at a gun show, online, or       from an unlicensed seller. In addition, individuals would no       longer be able to cross state lines solely to purchase a       firearm in a state with less stringent background checks.        Too often, our patients and our communities bear witness to       the terrible tragedies that occur when people use guns to       harm themselves or others. Gun violence is a complex public       health issue that will require a comprehensive solution;       enacting universal background checks is an important first       step. Our support for universal background checks comes from       our desire to save lives and protect our patients.        We urge you to pass H.R. 8/S. 529 the Bipartisan Background       Checks Act/Background Check Expansion Act, as soon as       possible.            Sincerely,                                   Theresa Rohr-Kirchgraber, MD,                                                        FACP, FAMWA,      Chair, Advocacy Committee AMWA.                                   ____         Members of the 117th Congress: We, the undersigned       organizations, strongly urge you to cosponsor and quickly       pass H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Check Act, and S. 529,       the Background Check Expansion Act, to expand Brady       Background Checks to cover all firearm transactions, as well       as H.R. 1446, the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2021, to       close a dangerous gap in law that allows thousands of       prohibited individuals to purchase firearms every year.        Since the Brady Law was enacted in 1994, more than 3.5       million prohibited firearm transactions have been prevented.       In 2015 alone, an average of 619 individuals per day were       deemed by law to be too dangerous to possess a firearm and       were blocked by the system.        Background checks are conclusively effective and have saved       countless lives. However, because only federally licensed       firearms dealers are required to conduct these checks, an       estimated one in five gun sales or transfers--those conducted       by private sellers, including sales online and at gun shows--      are completed without a background check. Without background       checks it is almost impossible to keep guns out of the hands       of prohibited individuals or to hold illegal gun dealers       accountable.        H.R. 8 and S. 529 will make us all safer by requiring a       background check for virtually every firearm sale and       transfer. The bills include narrow, reasonable exceptions       like transfers among close family members and short-term gun       loans among hunters and sport shooters. The legislation does       nothing to impede lawful gun purchases, while closing off a       wide and well-known avenue for illegal transactions by       prohibited, and often dangerous, buyers. It is past time to       expand lifesaving background checks to every gun sale, and       the public agrees: more than 90 percent of Americans,       including large majorities of gun owners, support universal       background checks.        Likewise, it has been over five years since a prohibited       person massacred nine parishioners at the Emanuel AME Church       in Charleston, South Carolina, with a gun purchased at a       licensed firearms dealer and it is far past time for Congress       to take action to fix this gap in law.        Under current law, a licensed dealer may transfer a gun to       a buyer after three business days even if the background       check has yet to determine whether that buyer is legally       eligible to purchase a gun, now known commonly as the       ``Charleston Loophole.'' According to FBI data, thousands of       guns are sold each year through this loophole to individuals       who are prohibited from possessing firearms--over 43,000       since 2008. In the last decade an average of 10 prohibited       individuals have been able to purchase guns at licensed       firearms dealers through the Charleston Loophole every single       day.        H.R. 1446 will prevent the sale of firearms to prohibited       individuals by providing the FBI with additional time to       complete background checks--allowing the system to better       focus its resources and efforts, and provide accurate       dispositions to federally licensed firearms dealers. This       legislation will have a tremendous impact on public safety       while ensuring that lawful gun owners are not subject to       indefinite bureaucratic delay.        We urge you to act quickly to pass these life-saving pieces       of legislation.

Mitch McConnell,      Minority Leader. U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Republican Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell, Leader Schumer, Speaker       Pelosi, and Leader McCarthy: The National Police Foundation       is an independent and nonpartisan 501(c)(3) organization       dedicated to advancing American policing through science and       innovation. For many years, the Foundation has  [[Page H1292]]       advocated strongly for and continues to support common sense       responses to America's gun violence problem. Addressing and       strengthening our system of background checks is long overdue       and it is my belief that H.R. 8/S.B. 529 can address these       issues and is worthy of full consideration.        Since 1993, the National Instant Criminal Background Check       System (NICS) has conducted firearm background checks on gun       purchasers. Federally licensed dealers must run a check       through NICS to determine whether a potential buyer is       prohibited from purchasing firearms. If information in NICS       shows that a person is indeed prohibited, the dealer must       deny the sale.        However, there is a loophole in federal law and no       background check is required for sales at gun shows, through       online marketplaces, or between private individuals.       Individuals who would otherwise be prohibited from purchasing       or possessing a gun can easily buy guns through such       unregulated sales. And the frequency of these unregulated       sales is concerning: recent studies indicate that       approximately 22 percent of firearms are purchased without a       background check, and up to 80 of firearms used in crimes are       obtained without a background check.        H.R. 8/S.B. 529 the Bipartisan Background Checks Act/      Background Check Expansion Act would require a background       check on every sale, ensuring that people prohibited from       purchasing firearms cannot exploit loopholes and purchase       guns through an unregulated sale at a gun show, online, or       from an unlicensed seller. In addition, individuals would no       longer be able to cross state lines solely to purchase a       firearm in a state with less stringent background checks.       Closing these background check loopholes is critical to       reducing gun violence throughout the United States.        The women and men serving on America's front lines deserve       the support that these bills will provide. Beyond data and       research, common sense tells us that the solutions offered in       H.R. 8/S.B. 529 are needed and will make a difference. We       urge you to pass H.R. 8/S.B. 529 the Bipartisan Background       Checks Act /Background Check Expansion Act, as soon as       possible.            Sincerely,                                                James H. Burch, II,      President.                                   ____                                                      March 4, 2021.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Republican Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader Schumer, Leader McConnell, Speaker       Pelosi, and Leader McCarthy: March for Our Lives Colorado       (MFOL CO) has been pushing for common-sense gun laws for our       state since 2019. MFOL CO's mission is to prevent gun       violence in Colorado by engaging youth in the legislative       process to further safety measures to protect ourselves and       our fellow classmates. As such, we strongly endorse H.R. 8       for its potential to prevent gun-related violence. In 2013,       Colorado passed House Bill 13-1229, resulting in the passage       of universal background checks for firearm sales through       unlicensed sellers in response to devastating events of gun       violence in both Colorado and across the nation. According to       the Colorado Bureau of Investigation, 2019 alone resulted in       the rejection of 2.11% of sales (3,477 firearm sales) through       unlicensed sellers due to indicators on background checks       that suggest the guns would potentially be misused, showing       that UBC laws have the empirical ability to keep guns from       individuals who might misuse them.        Since 1993, the National Instant Criminal Background Check       System (NICS) has conducted firearm background checks on gun       purchasers. Federally licensed dealers must run a check       through NICS to determine whether a potential buyer is       prohibited from purchasing firearms. If information in NICS       shows that a person is indeed prohibited, the dealer must       deny the sale.        However, there is a loophole in federal law and no       background check is required for sales at gun shows, through       online marketplaces, or between private individuals.       Individuals who would otherwise be prohibited from purchasing       or possessing a gun can easily buy guns through such       unregulated sales. And the frequency of these unregulated       sales is concerning: recent studies indicate that       approximately 22 percent of firearms are purchased without a       background check, and up to 80% of firearms used in crimes       are obtained without a background check.        H.R. 8/S. 529 the Bipartisan Background Checks Act/      Background Check Expansion Act would require a background       check on every sale, ensuring that people prohibited from       purchasing firearms cannot exploit loopholes and purchase       guns through an unregulated sale at a gun show, online, or       from an unlicensed seller. In addition, individuals would no       longer be able to cross state lines solely to purchase a       firearm in a state with less stringent background checks.       Closing these background check loopholes is critical to       reducing gun violence throughout the United States.        Additionally, H.R. 1446/S. 529 the Enhanced Background       Checks Act/ Background Check Completion Act would provide the       FBI more time to complete background checks and ensure that       people prohibited from possessing firearms are not able to       obtain them by default because of an incomplete background       check. This deadly loophole in existing law was exploited by       a white supremacist who killed nine people at the Mother       Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina.        H.R. 8 will save lives through increased background checks       for unlicensed sales in the United States. Our organization's       first-hand experience with gun violence in our youths brings       a grave brevity to our support of H.R. 8. March For Our Lives       was forged to call for action against the violence that has       plagued our nation. We call on you now to pass these bills to       protect millions of student lives across the United States.        We urge you to pass H.R. 8/S. 529 the Bipartisan Background       Checks Act/Background Check Expansion Act and H.R. 1446/S.       529 the Enhanced Background Checks Act/Background Check       Completion Act, as soon as possible.            Sincerely,      March For Our Lives Colorado.                                   ____                                              American Psychological                                      Association Services, Inc.,                                                      March 8, 2021.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Republican Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader Schumer, Leader McConnell, Speaker       Pelosi, and Leader McCarthy: On behalf of the American       Psychological Association (APA), I write to express our       support of H.R. 8/S. 529 the Bipartisan Background Checks Act       of 2021. This important legislation would address our       nation's gun violence public health crisis by closing pre-      existing loopholes that allow for unlicensed gun sellers to       avoid comprehensive background checks on firearms sales.        APA is the largest scientific and professional organization       representing psychology in the United States with nearly       122,000 researchers, educators, clinicians, consultants, and       students. Our mission is to advance the creation,       communication, and application of psychological knowledge to       benefit society and improve people's lives. APA advocates for       a public health approach to gun violence prevention,       supporting evidence-based programs and policies that can       reduce the occurrence and impact of firearm-related violence       in the United States.        Research demonstrates almost 80% of all firearms acquired       for criminal purposes are obtained through transfers from       unlicensed sellers and 96% of persons incarcerated for gun       offenses who were already prohibited from possessing a       firearm at the time of the offense obtained their firearm       from an unlicensed seller. Moreover, states that only require       background checks on sales through federally licensed       firearms dealers showed higher rates of adolescents who carry       guns than states that require universal background checks on       all prospective gun buyers.        Thank you for your work to prevent gun violence tragedies.            Sincerely,                                        Brian D. Smedley, Ph.D.,                         Chief of Psychology in the Public Interest,      American Psychological Association.                                   ____                                   American College of Physicians,                                                      March 4, 2021.      Hon. Michael Thompson,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Rep. Thompson: On behalf of the American College of       Physicians (ACP), I am writing to offer our strong support       for the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021 (H.R. 8),       legislation introduced in the 117th Congress to expand and       enhance the National Instant Criminal Background Check System       (NICS). We applaud your continued efforts to reduce firearms-      related violence through common sense legislation. As an       organization representing physicians who have first-hand       experience with the devastating impact on the health of their       patients resulting from firearms-related injuries and deaths,       we have a responsibility to be part of the solution in trying       to mitigate firearms-related tragedies. We stand ready to       work with you to advance this important legislation.        The American College of Physicians is the largest medical       specialty organization and the second-largest physician       membership society in the United States. ACP members include       163,000 internal medicine physicians (internists), related       subspecialists, and medical students. Internal medicine       physicians are specialists who apply scientific knowledge and       clinical expertise to the diagnosis, treatment, and       compassionate care of adults across the spectrum from health       to complex illness.        We remain alarmed by the tragic toll of firearms violence       in our neighborhoods, homes, workplaces, and public spaces.       Deaths and injuries from firearms are not just a result of       mass shootings, they are a daily occurrence; in 2019, 39,707       Americans lost their lives to firearms, according to the       Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This issue       represents an urgent public health  [[Page H1293]]       crisis and now is the time to act, on a bipartisan basis, on       measures to improve the safety of all Americans.        The Bipartisan Background Checks Act would strengthen the       accuracy and reporting of the National Instant Criminal       Background Check System (NICS) as well as expand Brady       background checks to cover all firearm sales, including       unlicensed firearms sellers currently not required to use       background checks. Examples of gun sales not requiring       background checks through NICS include those at gun shows,       through the internet, and between private individuals or       classified ads. With some exceptions, the legislation would       expand background checks to cover all private and commercial       firearm transfers and sales. In addition, because gun sellers       would now be required to perform background checks for all       sales and transfers, gun purchasers would no longer be able       to cross state lines to buy firearms in a state with less       rigorous background check laws.        In conclusion, for more than 20 years, we ACP has urged the       adoption of policies to reduce deaths and injuries related to       firearms violence. A brief summary of ACP's updated position       paper on this issue can be found here. We remain committed to       this endeavor and we call on Congress to pass H.R. 8 as a       necessary first step in addressing the public health crisis       created by firearms violence.            Sincerely,                                   Jacqueline W. Fincher, MD, MACP,                                                         President.     On this bill we have coauthors who are  Democrats and Republicans, cops, hunters, gun owners, district  attorneys, a former FBI agent, and veterans, who have served in combat  and put their lives on the line to protect our Second Amendment.   There is bipartisan support for universal background checks in  Congress and near universal support for background checks from the  American people.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 8.    Mr. Speaker, that is nonsense. What was  just said on the floor is not accurate.   The only thing this bill does is require a background check. If  someone has legally purchased a firearm and passed a background check,  nobody is going to take that gun away from them. They legally purchased  it. They passed the background check.   To come out with that kind of nonsense, that type of scare tactic, is  not complementary to the decorum of this  [[Page H1302]]  House, and it does not speak to this bill.                                time  1545
