 Mr. President, irrespective of how the Presidential  election came out last November, we would be having a conversation  about how to fix ObamaCare. There are many reasons for that, but most  importantly is that it has just skyrocketed costs for people in this  country. Premiums have gone through the roof, deductibles have  increased, copays have increased, and out-of-pocket costs have become  so extensive for people that even if they have coverage, they can't use  their plans in many cases. So when our colleagues across the aisle talk  about the recently rolled out proposal coming from the House--which  they will be discussing and we eventually will be discussing--to try to  drive down the costs for people in this country, that is what this  debate is really all about.   You can say what you want, but the fact is that this year, 2017,  premium increases are 25 percent in the exchanges--25 percent. In six  States, the premium increases were 50 percent in the exchanges. I don't  know how anybody--any family in this country--can keep up with those  kinds of skyrocketing premiums. If you are buying your insurance on the  individual market, the roof is blown off.   I talk to people in my State of South Dakota all the time who share  with me the excessive amount that it now costs for them to cover  themselves and their families. I talked to a lady in Sioux Falls  recently, and she told me they are now paying $22,000 a year for health  insurance. That is not working. That is why what we had was an abysmal  failure.   In terms of choices, the whole idea was that people were going to  have options out there. In a third of the counties in America today-- one-third of the counties in America today--people have one option, one  insurer. It is pretty hard to get a competitive rate when you only have  one option. There is a virtual monopoly in a third of the counties in  America today.   So we have markets collapsing, insurers pulling out, and we saw that  last fall Blue Cross Blue Shield pulled out of the individual market in  South Dakota and left 8,000 people wondering how they are going to  continue to cover themselves with health insurance. The markets are  collapsing, choices are dwindling, and costs are skyrocketing.   The Senator from Michigan was just on the floor talking about how  terrible things are going to be under the proposal that is being  considered and discussed in the House of Representatives, but the fact  is, things are terrible today, and that is why we are having this  conversation. Eight in ten Americans think ObamaCare either ought to be  repealed entirely or dramatically changed, significantly changed. By  any estimation, by any objective measurement or metric, it has been a  failure, and that is why we are having this conversation, and that  conversation would have occurred irrespective of what happened in the  Presidential election last fall.   So let's be clear about why we are here and why we are having this  conversation and why we are coming up with a better solution for the  American people that will drive down their costs, give them more  choices, create more competition in the marketplace, and give them a  higher and better quality of care because it restores the doctor- patient relationship, which is so important, not having the government  intervening and being in the middle of all of that.                      The Economy and Regulatory Reform    Mr. President, we have a recovery that technically began almost 8  years ago, but for too many Americans, it still feels as if we are in a  recession. Americans basically have not had a pay raise in 8 years.  Since the recovery began in 2009, wage growth has averaged a paltry  0.25 percent a year--one quarter of 1 percent increase in pay per year  since 2009. Well, imagine if you are a family and you are looking at  everything that is going up in your lives, whether it is healthcare,  which I just talked about, or the cost of education or the cost of  energy or the cost of food, all of these things that continue to go up,  and you are getting a 0.25-percent--one quarter of 1 percent--pay raise  on an annual basis. It is pretty hard not to feel like you are starting  to sink and your head is going to be below water before long.   Good jobs and opportunities for workers have been too few and too far  between. Millions of Americans are working part time because they can't  find full-time employment. Even as some economic markers have improved,  our economy has stayed firmly stuck in the doldrums. Economic growth  for 2016 averaged a dismal 1.6 percent, and there are few signs that  things are improving.   By the way, the historical average going back to World War II is  about 3.2 percent average growth in the economy. So last year we were  at one-half of what the average had been going back all the way to  World War II.   The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office is projecting average  growth for the next 10 years at just 2 percent--in other words, long- term economic stagnation.   The good news, though, is that we don't have to resign ourselves to  the status quo. We can get our economy going again. Republicans are  committed to doing just that. To get our economy going again, we need  to identify the reasons for the long-term stagnation we are  experiencing.   A recent report from the Economic Innovation Group identified one  important problem: a lack of what the organization calls ``economic  dynamism.'' Economic dynamism, as the Economic Innovation Group defines  it, refers to the rate at which new businesses are born and die.   In a dynamic economy, the rate of new business creation is high and  significantly outstrips the rate of business deaths. But that hasn't  been the case in the United State lately. New business creation has  significantly dropped over the past several years. Between 2009 and  2011, business death outstripped business birth.   While the numbers have since improved slightly, the recovery has been  poor and far, as I mentioned before, from historical norms. The  Economic Innovation Group notes that in 2012--the economy's best year  for business creation since the recession--it fell far short of its  worst year prior to 2008. This is deeply concerning because new  businesses have historically been responsible for a substantial part of  the job creation in this country, not to mention a key source of  innovation. When new businesses aren't being created at a strong rate,  workers face a whole host of problems.   ``A less dynamic economy,'' the Economic Innovation Group notes, ``is  one likely to feature fewer jobs, lower labor force participation,  slack wage growth, and rising inequality--exactly what we see today.''   Well, American workers clearly need relief, and restoring economic  dynamism is a key to providing it. We need to pave the way for new  businesses and the jobs they create, and we need to ensure that current  businesses, particularly small businesses, are able to thrive.  [[Page S1620]]    There are a number of ways we can do this. One big thing we can do is  relieve the burden of excessive government regulations. Obviously some  government regulations are important and necessary, but too many others  are unnecessary and doing nothing but loading businesses down with  compliance costs and paperwork hours. The more resources businesses  spend complying with regulations, the less they have available for  growth and innovation. Excessive regulations also prevent many new  businesses from ever getting off the ground. Small startups simply  don't have the resources to hire individuals, let alone the consultants  and lawyers to do the costly work of complying with the scores of  government regulations.   Unfortunately, over the past 8 years, the Obama administration spent  a lot of time imposing burdensome regulations on American businesses.  According to the American Action Forum, the Obama administration was  responsible for implementing more than 675 major regulations that cost  the economy more than $800 billion. Given those numbers, it is no  surprise that the Obama economy left businesses with fewer resources to  dedicate to growing and creating jobs or that new business creation  seriously dropped off during those years in the Obama administration.   Since the new Congress began in January, Republicans have been  focused on repealing burdensome ObamaCare regulations using the  Congressional Review Act. We have already used this law to repeal three  Obama regulations, and this week we will use it to repeal at least two  more, including the ``blacklisting'' rule, which imposes duplicative  and unnecessary requirements for businesses bidding on Federal  Government contracts, and the Bureau of Land Management methane rule,  which curbs energy production on Federal lands by restricting drilling.  This methane rule would cost jobs and deprive State and local  governments of tax and royalty payments that they can use to address  local priorities.   Another area of regulatory reform we need to address is ObamaCare, as  I mentioned. Repealing the burdensome mandates and regulations this law  has imposed on businesses will go a long way toward removing barriers  to new businesses and spurring growth at existing businesses.   Another important thing we can do is remove unnecessary barriers that  restrict access to capital. Both new and existing businesses rely on  capital to help them innovate, expand, and create jobs.   In addition to removing burdensome regulations, tax reform needs to  be a priority. Measures like allowing new businesses to deduct their  startup costs and reducing rates for small businesses would spur new  business creation and help small businesses thrive. Republicans plan to  take up comprehensive tax reform later this year, and I look forward to  that debate.   The American economy has always been known for being dynamic and  innovative, and we need to make sure it stays that way. We need to free  up the innovators and the job creators so that the next big idea isn't  buried by government regulations before it has a chance to see the  light of day.   Sluggish economic growth doesn't have to be the new normal. By  removing burdensome government regulations and reforming our Tax Code,  we can spur business creation and innovation. We can increase wages and  opportunities for American workers, and we can put our economy on the  path to long-term health, where that growth rate gets back to that more  historic level that allows for better paying jobs and higher wages for  American families.   I look forward to working with my colleagues in both Houses of  Congress to achieve these goals, and I am anxious for us to start  passing bills that will put policies in place that are favorable to  higher economic growth, better jobs, and better wages for the American  people and their families.   I yield the floor.
