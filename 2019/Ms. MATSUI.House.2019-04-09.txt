 Madam Chair, I am pleased to join my colleagues in  cosponsoring this legislation.   Our internet economy has been the envy of the world, with good  reason. The first site to ever go live on the world wide web did so in  August 1991, less than 28 years ago.   Since then, a balance of innovation and investment has transformed  the internet into a driving force of the American economy, and that  balance of innovation and investment also requires that the internet  remain open.   Innovators, entrepreneurs, businesses, and consumers rely on the  internet as an open platform for online commerce, to freely exchange  ideas, and to make internet access more accessible to more Americans.   To that end, addressing and preventing paid prioritization  arrangements that result in consumer harm has been a priority of mine  for years; and, as I have said through this debate, the fundamental  issue surrounding net neutrality is ensuring consumers don't have to  pay more for the same products and services online.   I am mindful of the potential use cases that next-generation networks  can facilitate, and I previously introduced legislation to ensure that  all consumers are able to access online content equally as we balance  the service requirements and consumer benefits of our open internet  policies.   I also want to be clear that I don't support taxing the internet,  but, going forward, I welcome a serious conversation with all my  colleagues on universal service contribution reform in order to protect  the long-term sustainability of rural broadband support.   Net neutrality protections must ensure the internet remains an open  marketplace, ensure that the internet is free of content-based  discrimination, and ensure broadband access is affordably and reliably  deployed across the country.  [[Page H3176]]    Passage of this legislation is an important step toward these goals,  and I am proud to support it.
