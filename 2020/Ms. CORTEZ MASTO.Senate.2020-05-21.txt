 Mr. President, today, the Senate confirmed the  nominations of David Wright and Christopher Hanson to serve as  Commissioners on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, NRC. While I am  pleased that these nominees will provide the NRC with a full  Commission, I remain deeply concerned with Mr. Wright's history of  strongly supporting efforts to move the Yucca Mountain repository  forward and oppose his confirmation today.   Shortly after Mr. Wright joined the Commission in 2018, the State of  Nevada called for Mr. Wright to recuse himself from matters pertaining  to Yucca Mountain licensing. He refused. Mr. Wright is on the record  calling for the ``expeditious implementation of the Yucca Mountain  program'' and founded the Yucca Mountain Task Force. His refusal to  recuse himself denies Nevada its right to an unbiased Commissioner on  the NRC and furthers the distrust that plagues the Nation's management  of nuclear waste.   More than 30 years ago, Nevada was thrown into the center of the  nuclear waste debate, when Congress dismissed the siting process it  established in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and named Yucca  Mountain the sole nuclear waste repository for the Nation over the  strong objections of Nevadans. The site is physically unsuitable and  puts at risk the safety, security, and economic well-being of the  State. The decision broke the trust of the American people in the  government's ability to responsibly manage nuclear waste. The  reappointment of Mr. Wright to the NRC does nothing to regain the trust  of Nevadans or establish confidence in nuclear waste repository  licensing processes.   Commissioners serving on the independent agency must be neutral and  unbiased in order to ensure confidence in the guidance, regulations,  and determinations issued by the NRC. Mr. Wright can make the decision  to recuse himself from Yucca Mountain licensing matters, and it is my  hope that he will chose to do so to bring integrity to the Commission  and to restore the rights of the State of Nevada.   I also acknowledge the importance of Mr. Hanson being confirmed to  the NRC today. He will help bring balance to the Commission with his  decades of experience on nuclear energy and waste issues.   I will continue to work with my colleagues in the Senate to ensure  Congress continues to utilize its authority to oversee the work of the  Commission and hope all Commissioners will approach all matters,  including those that pertain to Yucca Mountain licensing, without  preexisting bias and conflicts of interest.                            ____________________
