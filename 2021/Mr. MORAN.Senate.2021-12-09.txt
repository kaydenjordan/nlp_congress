 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and honor the  upcoming retirement on January 1, 2022, of a true public servant and  leader, Dr. Louis Uccellini, Director of National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service.   Louis is the epitome of a dedicated civil servant, having spent the  past 43 years of his career at both NOAA and NASA contributing to and  leading the maturation and advancement of our Nation's weather  prediction capabilities. Put simply, there is no aspect of today's  weather forecast that Dr. Uccellini hasn't advanced during his storied  career.   But Louis' contributions span far beyond science. Perhaps most  notably, and certainly most visible to the public, are the  organizational changes Louis has made to National Weather Service since  becoming Director in 2013. The establishment and development of the  Weather-Ready Nation program, a paradigm shift that refocused the  entire NWS staff and mission, now enables forecasters to use weather  information to deliver Impact-based Decision Support Services to  emergency managers, which is empowering local officials to help  citizens be ready, responsive and resilient to weather events. This is  the real purpose of the weather forecast and is allowing the National  Weather Service to better perform its mission of saving lives and  protecting property.   Louis' mark on the National Weather Service will undoubtedly be felt  for many years to come. On behalf of my constituents in Kansas and a  grateful nation, I personally thank Dr. Louis Uccellini for his service  to our Nation; wish him and his wife, Susan, well in retirement; and as  Louis would say, ``I'll leave it at that.''                            ____________________
