 Mr. Speaker, we have heard numerous comments from the  left extolling the virtues of ObamaCare, and I think it is instructive  to hear the words of a former Democratic President that is beloved by  the left. Here is what he said less than 6 months ago: ``So you've got  this crazy system where all of a sudden 25 million more people have  health care and then the people who are out there busting it, sometimes  60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage  cut in half. It's the craziest thing in the world.''   Mr. Speaker, hardworking American families in my district, they don't  want crazy. They want the American Health Care Act, a sane plan that  gives them their freedom back.   In a few minutes, Mr. Speaker, you are going to hear somebody from  the other side say that a bunch of my constituents are going to lose  coverage. That is absolutely false. Those constituents are getting  their freedom back to choose whether or not they want healthcare  coverage and what kind of healthcare coverage they want. I say vote  ``yes.''
