 Mr. Speaker, our frontline healthcare workers face a  mental health crisis. One in five healthcare providers experienced  mental health problems during the pandemic. This should concern every  American.   On March 30, National Doctors' Day, we recognize that to protect our  public health, we must protect the well-being of our health workers.   When doctors and nurses struggle with their mental health, they  struggle to care for us. Nearly half of healthcare workers, 47 percent,  are considering leaving their roles in the next 3 years. We need their  talent, dedication, and expertise.   Congress recently passed a law that will connect doctors and nurses  with mental health resources, but we can and must do more.   Healthcare workers helped keep us safe during the pandemic. We have a  responsibility to get them the healthcare that they need.                            ____________________
