 Mr. President, today I am introducing the Rhode Island  Fishermen's Fairness Act of 2020 along with my colleague Senator  Whitehouse. This legislation seeks to address a longstanding inequity  in our Nation's fisheries management system which denies Rhode  Islanders a voice in the governance of many stocks that local fishermen  catch and rely upon for their livelihoods.   The Magnuson-Stevens Act granted Rhode Island voting membership on  the New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC), as NEFMC-managed  stocks represent a significant percentage of landings and revenue for  the State. However, Rhode Island has an even larger stake in Mid- Atlantic fisheries. Yet, it does not have voting representation on the  Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (MAFMC), which currently  consists of representatives from New York, New Jersey, Delaware,  Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina.   According to data provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration (NOAA), between 2014 and 2108, Rhode Island accounted  for approximately a quarter of the commercial landings by value from  stocks under the MAFMC's sole jurisdiction, and its commercial landings  were greater than the total landings of all of the states currently  represented on the MAFMC with the exception of New Jersey.   As the rest of the Nation learned during the Democratic National  Convention, the Rhode Island State appetizer is calamari. That is  squid. And while squid is our number one landed species, Rhode Island  doesn't have a formal say in the management of this stock.   This legislation offers a simple solution with sound precedent. North  Carolina was added to the MAFMC through an amendment to the Sustainable  Fisheries Act in 1996. Like Rhode Island, a significant portion of  North Carolina's landed fish species were managed by the MAFMC, yet the  State had no vote on the council. Similarly, the Rhode Island  Fishermen's Fairness Act would create two seats on the MAFMC for Rhode  Island: one seat appointed by the Secretary of Commerce based on  recommendations from the Governor of Rhode Island, and a second seat  filled by Rhode Island's principal State official with marine fishery  management responsibility. To accommodate these new members, the MAFMC  would increase in size from 21 to 23 voting members. In short, Rhode  Island would be guaranteed the same minimum representation as every  other State on the MAFMC.   With mounting economic, ecological, and regulatory challenges, it is  more important than ever that Rhode Island fishermen have a voice in  the management of the fisheries they depend on.   I urge our colleagues to join us in supporting this commonsense  legislation.                            ____________________
