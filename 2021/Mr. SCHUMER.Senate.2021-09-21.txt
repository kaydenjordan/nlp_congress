 Mr. President, yesterday, Speaker Pelosi and I put in  motion the path to pass a continuing resolution that in one fell swoop  would accomplish four very important things. It would keep the  government open through December 3 of this year and avoid a needless  and dangerous shutdown. It would provide emergency funding to help  resettle Afghan evacuees; it would approve tens of billions of dollars  in disaster aid funding; and it will suspend the debt ceiling until  December of 2022, commensurate with the time necessary to cover the  debt of the bipartisan $908 billion emergency COVID-relief bill passed  at the end of last year.   Now, today, I want to spend some time focusing on the last of these  items, addressing the debt limit to avoid a first-ever default in  American history.   Throughout modern history, addressing the debt ceiling has  consistently been done on a bipartisan basis. Let me repeat that.  Throughout modern history, addressing the debt ceiling has consistently  been done on a bipartisan basis. Since 1960, the debt ceiling has been  raised approximately 80 times under both Republican and Democratic  administrations and under both unified and divided government. So much  for the argument by Leader McConnell that when all three branches are  controlled by one party, the debt ceiling ought to be their exclusive  domain. That is not what history has shown, and that is not what  happened actually in 2017 when Donald Trump was President, McConnell  was majority leader, and McCarthy was Republican Speaker--I believe it  was McCarthy back then--but the debt ceiling was renewed bipartisan.   To do otherwise, to not do the debt ceiling in a bipartisan way, has  been considered unthinkable because the consequences for the economy,  for the American people, and for our standing on the world stage would  be too severe.   Senate Republicans and the Republican leader, however, are again  engaging in fantastical feats of sophistry to justify why this time is  somehow different. We know it is not. We all know the truth. Democrats  and Republicans both had a hand in approving the spending we now must  pay.   Look, we know the Republican justification for forcing a default is  totally dishonest, plain and simple. Don't ask me; just listen to the  Wall Street Journal. Here is what it said:         Congress would still need to raise the debt limit this fall       even if no new major spending programs were enacted.    This idea that they don't want to raise the debt ceiling to deal with  future spending is just totally false. Ask the Wall Street Journal.   The fact is, our continuing resolution would suspend the debt limit  through December of 2022, an amount of time commensurate with the debt  incurred as a result of passing the bipartisan $908 billion emergency  COVID relief legislation in December of last year. Remember, that  legislation was drafted by Republicans, voted for by Republicans, and  put on the floor by Leader McConnell, who voted for it, and signed by a  Republican President. Democrats worked with our colleagues to pass this  bill because it was the right thing to do for our families, our  [[Page S6558]]  small businesses, and suffering communities.   Our CR is now carefully tailored--carefully tailored--to account for  this debt. This is as reasonable as it gets. So for Republicans to  suddenly throw their hands in the air and abscond from their  responsibility to pay debt that they proudly supported is nothing short  of a dine-and-dash of historic proportions.   Republicans racked trillions of dollars of debt under President Trump  and are demanding American families foot the bill. What will this do?  It could stop payments to Social Security recipients. It could stop  payments to veterans. It could raise interest rates, making a mortgage  or car loan more expensive. It could cause local governments to pay  more in interest, and that might mean increased taxes for people. This  is playing with fire. Playing games with the debt ceiling is playing  with fire and putting it on the backs of the American people.   Of course, there is a very quick and easy way to make sure we avoid  all of this from becoming even a possibility. Republicans simply don't  have to vote to force a default. It is that simple.   Democrats will do the right thing and the responsible thing when the  continuing resolution comes for a vote on the floor. We will see who  among the Republican conference will do likewise.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, in addition to keeping our  government open and maintaining our government's full faith and credit,  Senate Democrats will also continue working this week on confirming  even more of President Biden's nominees to the bench and to his  administration.   For the information of my colleagues, later today, I will move to  file a discharge petition on the nomination of Rohit Chopra to serve as  Director of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. In the wake of the  financial crisis of 2008, the CFPB was created under the Obama  administration with a simple mandate: protect American consumers from  predatory financial practices.   Rohit Chopra is the right man to lead this Agency after it languished  under the Presidency of Donald Trump. Trump didn't really care about  the average person being taken advantage of by the big financial  institutions, despite his claim he is a working-class President. Mr.  Chopra, on the other hand, has a long history of defending student loan  borrowers from unscrupulous for-profit colleges and already served in  the CFPB under President Obama, where he was defending the rights of  middle-class people who might be taken advantage of by rapacious  financial institutions. He has the experience; he has the dedication;  and he will have the support of Senate Democrats when his nomination is  brought to the floor this afternoon or later this week.                            ____________________     Mr. President, over the next few weeks, Senate Democrats  will also move forward on a number of noncontroversial nominees  critical to keeping our country safe and advancing American diplomacy  abroad.   Over the last few months, there has been a growing backlog on these  nominees due to Republican obstructionism, and it is our hope, starting  this week, we can move to secure their confirmation.   But, last week, a number of my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle announced they will seek to delay these nominees for no other  reason than to score cheap political points in an effort to win fans on  the far right. It is no secret. People leading this are all competing  to run for President on the Republican side in 2024, and they are in  feverish--feverish--pursuit of the extreme right in this country, which  they think will help them win a primary. So they tie this Chamber in a  knot but, more importantly, jeopardize the security of Americans.   This is unacceptable. Every one of these nominees won bipartisan, if  not unanimous, support in committee. That same level of support should  continue on the floor. The Republicans who are delaying the  confirmation of these nominees are deliberately making the American  people less safe--less safe on the foreign policy side, where we need  nominees to the Defense and State Departments, and less safe on the  domestic side as well, where there is talk of holding up U.S. attorneys  who are in charge of prosecuting Federal laws in all the States.   Under normal circumstances, all of these nominees should be dispensed  with speedily and without controversy, but because of the self-interest  of a few obstructionists, the Senate could be forced to drag out what  is normally a simple process.   I urge these colleagues to drop their theatrics immediately and allow  these nominees to these critical Agencies to go through.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now a quick update on voting rights. Last  week, several of my colleagues introduced the Freedom to Vote Act, a  powerful new bill that would tackle head-on voter suppression, partisan  gerrymandering, and the scourge of dark money.   The legislation also responds to recommendations from election  officials and includes new provisions to boost confidence in our  elections, including critical anti-election subversion reforms, a  flexible voter ID standard, and commonsense voter list maintenance  requirements. This legislation will promote greater confidence in our  elections, and I believe all Senators--Democrat, Republican, and  Independent alike--should support the package.   At the end of last week, I moved to place the Freedom to Vote Act on  the legislative calendar, enabling me to schedule a vote on this bill  in the immediate future.   This week, my colleague Senator Manchin, who helped craft this  legislation and relied on many of the good practices in West Virginia  to do so--Senator Manchin, this week, is making an effort, a good-faith  effort, to reach colleagues on the other side of the aisle to win  support of the Freedom to Vote Act, and, in fact, he has been meeting  with a number of Republican colleagues.   We are committed to finding common ground, if there is common ground  to be found. We look forward to hearing what changes Republicans might  want to make. And if Republicans engage earnestly and honestly, we will  work with them. The voting rights working group I convened earlier this  year is prepared to help in that effort, but we need to move quickly.  Time is of the essence.   As Senator Manchin said earlier this year regarding congressional  action on voting rights, ``Inaction is not an option.'' I agree with  Senator Manchin in that regard.   To that end, it is my intention to hold a vote for the Freedom to  Vote Act here on the Senate floor. If Republicans are unwilling to move  forward, Democrats will have to move on our own. Inaction from  Republicans on voting rights is not an excuse to do nothing. We are  going to take action to make sure we protect our democracy and fight  back against the disease of voter suppression, partisan gerrymandering,  and election subversion that is metastasizing at the State level.                            ____________________     Mr. President, and finally on Haiti, we have all seen  these horrible images coming from our southern border as Haitian asylum  seekers, simply looking to escape tyranny and the problems, that they  have sought--have been met at our doorstep with unimaginable indignity.   Images of Haitian migrants being hit with whips and other forms of  physical violence is completely unacceptable. This behavior must be  addressed, and we must provide accountability. The images turn your  stomach. It must be stopped, this kind of violence.   Right now, I am told there are four flights scheduled to deport these  asylum seekers back to a country that cannot receive them. Such a  decision defies common sense. It also defies common decency and what  America is all about. Remember that lady in the harbor in the city in  which I live.   So I urge President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas to immediately put a  stop to these expulsions and to end this  [[Page S6559]]  title 42 policy at our southern border. We cannot continue these  hateful and xenophobic Trump policies that disregard our refugee laws.  We must allow asylum seekers to present their claims at our ports of  entry and be afforded due process.   I commit to work with this administration to provide resources so  that we can establish safe, orderly, and humane processes for those  seeking protections. Again, the policies that are being enacted now and  the horrible treatment of these innocent people who have come to the  border must stop immediately.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the desk  that is due for a second reading.
