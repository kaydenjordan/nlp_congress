 Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring congratulations to  the division 3A women's volleyball State champions, Reservoir High  School of Fulton, Maryland, a school I am proud to say is located in  Maryland's Third District.   This outstanding team finished the season with a remarkable 18-1  record. They won the triple crown of championships: the Howard County  Championship, the 3A East Region Championship, and the 3A State  Championship.   The Gators were led by head coach Carole Ferrante and assistant  coaches Holly Hynson, Julie Poston, and Meghan Kelley.   Again, congratulations to these outstanding athletes: Gabby, Lexi,  Haley, Samiha, Azariah, Chaeli, Madison, Destiny, Kelsey, Anjola,  Elsie, Maddie, Jessica, Madison, and Mayah.   We are proud of their accomplishments. Well done.                            ____________________
