 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed  to speak for up to 15 minutes, followed by Senator Marshall for up to 1  minute, prior to the scheduled rollcall vote.    Madam President, as my colleague from Utah just noted a  minute ago, he has been asking for votes on this matter repeatedly. And  today, he and others seek to invalidate a regulation issued by the  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that require most healthcare  providers to be vaccinated.   And suffice it to say, this is something that the Supreme Court has  ruled on. The Supreme Court has actually taken this up and agrees with  our position that, in effect, this is an area where there is a strong  public interest. And I believe what my colleague is proposing is just  far outside the mainstream of opinion regarding vaccinations in  America. There simply is a point where an anti-mandate agenda becomes a  dangerous anti-vaccine agenda, and my colleagues on the other side, in  my view, have crossed that line quite some time ago.   So I am just going to take a few minutes to describe why I think this  is such an extreme position outside what the vast majority of Americans  agree and in contrast to what the Supreme Court has said.   Americans support a vaccine provision or requirement for healthcare  workers by a 20- or 30-point margin--no surprise about that. Everybody  is concerned about sitting in a room with a doctor or nurse who may be  contagious and who has been unvaccinated. I want to particularly  emphasize the people affected here who are the most vulnerable based on  what we have seen during the pandemic. We are talking about those with  chronic illness and seniors.   Three-quarters of the Americans who died of COVID-19 were seniors,  and 200,000 of those COVID deaths were Americans living or working in  long-term care facilities like nursing homes. Many others were in and  out of hospitals and doctors' offices routinely.   Making sure that healthcare workers are vaccinated, colleagues, I  don't think is about any partisan position. It is about a commonsense  policy designed to keep seniors--people I have worked with for 7 years;  before I came to the Congress, I was director of the Gray Panthers--I  think we all believe we want vulnerable people to be safe. So I am  going to start by quoting a ruling by the Roberts Court--hardly, at  this point, colleagues, some kind of radical left judiciary. Recently,  they allowed the vaccine requirement for healthcare workers to go  forward, and I am just going to quote:         Ensuring that providers take steps to avoid transmitting a       dangerous virus to their patients is consistent with the       fundamental principle of the medical profession: First, do no       harm. It would be the very opposite of efficient and       effective administration for a facility that is supposed to       make people well to make them sick with COVID-19.    This vaccine provision or requirement is about keeping our healthcare  workforce safe. Doctors and nurses in our country are overwhelmed. That  is what they just told me as I went about my State, going to hospitals  and vaccination sites and other healthcare programs.   These providers have been working nonstop for years under  extraordinary stress, and what they are all about is honoring that  Hippocratic Oath and trying to save lives. At times in this pandemic,  our hospitals have been jampacked with COVID patients. If lots of  doctors and nurses are out sick during a big COVID wave, that has got  an impact on the standard of care for everybody. It drops for COVID  patients, for stroke patients, for people hurt in car accidents. Our  country desperately needs to protect our healthcare workforce.   Now, right at the heart of my colleagues' case--and as my friend from  Utah said, we have had a number of debates about this subject--my  colleagues say every person is unique, and there needs to be  flexibility when it comes to vaccines. Colleagues, I am just fine with  that. The fact is, the administration is allowing for medical and  religious exemptions. Flexibility is written into the rule because that  is just plain old common sense.  [[Page S936]]    Vaccine requirements aren't anything new for healthcare workers. Flu  shot requirements have been common for a long time. When you go into  healthcare, it is understood that a vaccine requirement can be part of  the job.   Furthermore, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has  already pushed back the deadline for healthcare workers in several  States to have their first vaccine dose. Originally, the deadline was  in December. Now, it is February. The idea that this is somehow an  inflexible and unreasonable mandate coming from nowhere is just plain  wrong.   I would just close by way of saying it is time for us to move past  these battles that I think regrettably continue to make this pandemic-- which strikes me as having nothing to do with politics--such political  hutzpah.   It is good news that the Omicron wave is receding. With any luck,  that will be the last major COVID wave that threatens to overwhelm our  healthcare system. We all want our lives to get back to normal, and the  way to do that is with smart public health policies--and smart public  health policies, we know, consistently get broad support from the  American people. That is what the vaccine provision requirement for  healthcare workers is all about. That is why the Supreme Court upheld  it.   I would urge that we oppose this joint resolution and do everything  we can to make sure that healthcare workers are going to be vaccinated.  And as I said to my constituents when I was home this weekend, what I  wanted to make sure was that everybody who could, get vaccinated as  quickly as possible.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  following members of my office be granted floor privileges for the  remainder of the Congress: Maia Hamin, Bonnie Million, Panya Gupta,  Katie Rader, Felicia Chou, Raghav Aggarwal, Sarguni Singh, James Maloy,  and Nadia Laniyan.
