 Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Roselle Park High  School wrestling team for reaching the milestone of 1,000 varsity wins  after beating Scotch Plains last week. The Roselle Park Panthers became  only the fourth program in the country and just the second in New  Jersey to reach this milestone.   The entire community played a part in propelling the Panthers to this  milestone. The Panthers have always had strong support from local  businesses, community groups, and, of course, their loyal fans and  neighbors.   Mr. Speaker, Head Coach Ryan Rooney and his team have worked hard to  get to this point, but they aren't letting the record distract them  from their ultimate goal: winning another State championship.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Coach  Rooney and the Roselle Park Panthers for their 1,000th win and wish  them continued success on their way to another State championship.   Go Panthers.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, let me first thank the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans) for hosting tonight's Special Order. I am glad  to see that his celebrating allowed them to get here on time, since his  team was victorious yesterday in the Super Bowl.                                time  1945    Let's see. For 84 percent of the American voters, the economy is the  number one issue to care about. Tonight's Special Order is made even  more important after the huge drop in the stock market today. But, of  course, the stock market is not the only measure of a healthy economy  or economics of our community.   Building wealth matters. Wealth is what families accumulate and pass  down generation after generation. It is the house you pay for and give  to your children so they can grow their families without paying rent.   It is the retirement fund you live off of and pass on to your  children so they can pay for their own children's college education. By  building wealth, we are building a safety net that allows us to start a  business or survive if we lose our jobs. Yes, building wealth matters,  but the Black community has been shut out from building its wealth.   More than 25 percent of the Black community has zero net worth or has  a negative net worth, and the median Black family is worth 12 times  less than the median White family.   Why is that?   One reason for the vast majority of households in the United States,  two-thirds of the family's wealth is tied up in the value of their  home. That means the racial gap in wealth is mostly a racial gap in  housing, and the housing wealth gap is not by chance.   For decades, Federal law and policy favored Whites and discriminated  against Blacks. For decades, private banks discouraged lending to Black  people, and for decades, restrictive covenants outright prevented Black  people from owning homes in certain areas of town.   There are young people today struggling to rent apartments in major  cities because, in 1950, their grandfather was denied a loan by a bank  because of his race. The young people of color are, in essence, forced  to play catchup with their White colleagues.   To build wealth in Black communities, we need to work towards ending  the racial unemployment gap. As the President has repeatedly  proclaimed, Black unemployment has been dropping for the past 8 years,  reaching a historic low this year, but that statistic doesn't tell the  whole story.   While unemployment has gone down, the gap between Black and White pay  has not been going down. Black men only earn 70 cents an hour for every  dollar a White individual makes. As long as that remains true, our  communities will continue to struggle economically.   To close the economic gap, it requires us to close the wage gap.  Workers everywhere need to be free to bargain collectively. We need to  make unions and their workers stronger, not weaker. We need to raise  the minimum wage for both tipped and untipped workers. We need to  strengthen the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.   These basic steps will help generate Black wealth by closing the wage  gap. Those are a few of the short-term solutions to closing the wealth  gap and the wage gap among people who are in the workforce today. But  we need a long-  [[Page H769]]  term plan. We need to increase the participation and the success of  Black, Latino, and female students in careers that rely on science,  technology, engineering, and math.   Fewer than half of all high schools in the United States offer  calculus. Many high schools across the country don't even offer physics  or chemistry. And the students who don't have access to senior-level  science or math classes are disproportionately students of color or  low-income students. This is a national disgrace.   This disparity continues through college, where only 4 percent of  engineering majors are Black or African American, and only 8 percent  are Hispanic or Latino.   Look, the world around us is undergoing rapid change and will  continue to evolve, and there is a growing gap between jobs that are in  high demand and the people who have the skills to fill them. Over the  next 10 years, 80 percent of careers will require a deep understanding  of STEM skills, but our young women, Black youth, and people of color  are being left behind. They are among the least likely to pursue  studies in the most in-demand STEM fields, despite the fact that they  are among the fastest growing demographics in the country.   It is our duty to create an educational system that encourages young  people, whatever their backgrounds, to dream big, to achieve big. Only  then will we be positioned to create a future in which technology  reflects the strength of America's diverse communities.   I would just like to say we are here tonight to discuss this matter  that has plagued our community for decades, as I stated, but it is time  for us to level the playing field once and for all, for all families to  be able to benefit from what this country has to offer, the great  American Dream.   It is a dream for everyone, and we are bent on making sure that all  communities have an opportunity to benefit from this great Nation's  wealth.    Mr. Speaker, if Mr. Evans missed it, I missed it because I  don't believe the President mentioned it at all.   Look, I mean, people who are struggling in this country making $7 an  hour, $8 an hour, $9 an hour, $10 an hour, it does not meet their  essential needs. It is not enough money to live in this Nation, to have  decent housing.    Sure, you can make $7 or $8 an hour, but what are you going to be  able to afford as a home?   Sure, you can make $7 or $8 an hour, but what does your children's  future look like in terms of saving money for education?   You are using everything primarily to feed and to clothe them.   It has been discussed over the past 5 to 6 years that a minimum of  $15 is needed for people to survive in this country. So we need to get  up off of this high horse that my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle said: Well, just pull yourself up by your bootstraps.   Those days are over. And we were never given the bootstraps to hold  onto. There is always, always something in our way.   Anytime an African-American family finds themselves in a position to  move forward, the goalpost is moved and it is further away, the rules  are changed. Every time we get to a point where there might be  equality, somehow there are different issues which don't allow you to  move forward as your counterparts in the majority population. It is  wrong and it needs to stop. We need to continue to bring light to it as  a Congressional Black Caucus.   It is our duty, as the voice of people in this country of color, to  make sure we know that this travesty is going on, we understand it, we  see it, we are not going to tolerate it anymore, and we are going to  have to fix it. That is the way I feel.    They have to. It is the only way for people in this  country to make it.
