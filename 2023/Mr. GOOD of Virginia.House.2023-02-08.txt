 Madam Speaker, the Biden administration  continues their all-out assault on the Second Amendment as evidenced by  the President's call just last night in this very Chamber for banning  weapons he finds objectionable.   Madam Speaker, Democrats believe that the government should decide  your God-given constitutionally protected rights. Their new ATF rule  published in the Federal Register further threatens the rights of law- abiding citizens.   It treats individuals who own pistols with stabilizing braces as if  they possess illegal short-barrel rifles, and it forces them to  surrender them to the Federal Government. If they don't surrender them,  then they are retroactively declared criminals for what was then a  lawful purchase, and they now face up to 10 years in prison and a  $250,000 fine.   This is just another example of the Washington-knows-best elites who  are out-of-touch with everyday Americans.   So I introduced the PISTOL Act to block the ATF from redefining  pistol braces as short-barreled rifles. My legislation provides a  simple statutory definition of a pistol and would prevent the Biden  administration from improperly classifying pistol braces or regulating  them by decree or fiat.   The Second Amendment is not subject to bureaucratic interpretation,  and we have got to fight to protect the God-given and constitutionally  protected rights of all Americans.                            ____________________
