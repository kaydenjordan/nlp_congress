 Mr. Chairman, my congratulations to the chairman of  our committee, Mr. Thornberry, and the ranking member, Mr. Smith, for  helping us put together an extremely important bill that does many,  many good things for our military and our national security. You have  heard speakers before me talk about those issues ranging from the  additional pay for our military personnel, both civil and enlisted. All  that is good.   However, I do want to raise an issue here, and that is, this bill  also pushes even further and faster down the path towards a new nuclear  arms race. I said before, we are well into the first quarter of it.  Well, when this bill goes into law, we will be well into the second  quarter, an extraordinarily expensive proposition, costing this country  well over $1.2 trillion to $1.5 trillion over the next 20 years.   It also puts us in a position where I believe we are not going to be  more safe. Many of the weapons that are being developed--the bombs, the  delivery systems--are designed not to be observed. So much of what we  have learned over the years about how to keep ourselves and our enemies  at bay on the mutually assured destruction track will not apply as we  go into this.   A couple of things immediately on my mind. A low-yield nuclear  weapon, there is no such thing as ``low.'' It happens to be a whole  lot, much larger than the bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima. So  where are we going to go here? Does it make us safer to have a low- yield nuclear weapon on one of our submarines? Probably not, because  now that submarine has become not a strategic but, rather, a tactical  weapon and puts it in an entirely different class.   Also, there is a lot of money being spent on the National Nuclear  Security Administration, way over budget, $198 million--$115 million.  It goes on and on. Is that a smart thing to spend $115 million for the  mixed oxide facility? I think not.   So there are questions that could be raised, and hopefully, as this  bill progresses through the Congress, those questions will lead to a  better resolution.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk as the  designee of the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, this amendment deals with the new low-yield D5 or W76-2  nuclear warhead.  [[Page H4561]]    In the NDAA, there is the establishment of this new low-yield nuclear  warhead. This amendment would fence 50 percent of the funding for the  warhead until such time as the Secretary of Defense submits a report on  the program's impacts on strategic stability and options to reduce the  risk of miscalculation associated with the inability of adversaries to  be able to distinguish between an SSBN missile carrying a single low- yield warhead and a missile carrying several high-yield nuclear  warheads, and to preserve the survivability of the second-strike  capability of the SSBNs. It also strikes the unnecessary provision in  the mark.   People who have looked at these issues--for example, former Secretary  of State George Shultz and Senator Lugar, recently wrote: ``The  justification for new Trident warheads fails on many levels. It is  unlikely that there is such a thing as a limited nuclear war; preparing  for one is folly.''   Back in January, 2018, former Secretary of State George Shultz wrote  in Congressional testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee:  ``One of the alarming things to me is this notion that we can have  something called a small nuclear weapon, which I understand the  Russians are doing, and that somehow that's usable,'' he told the  panel.   He went on to say: ``Your mind goes to the idea that, yes, nuclear  weapons become usable. And then we're really in trouble, because a big  nuclear exchange can wipe out the world.''   Senator Nunn and former Secretary Moniz talked about this, saying:  ``The most immediate priority should be to structure and posture U.S.  and Russian nuclear forces to deter nuclear use and reduce the risk of  an accidental, mistaken or unauthorized launch. Against this backdrop,  the current Russian concept of `escalate to de-escalate'--i.e., limited  nuclear use designed to create a pause in the conflict and open a  pathway for a negotiated settlement on Moscow's terms--and U.S. calls  for more `usable' nuclear weapons taken together make the world a  vastly more dangerous place.''   So what we would like to do here is simply have a report, again, from  the Secretary of Defense to lay out exactly what this is all about, why  it is important, and what it means for our principal deterrent force:  nuclear-armed submarines. That is what it is.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Washington (Mr. Smith), the ranking member of the full  committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that I may be  permitted to revise my remarks, made during general debate in the  Committee of the Whole earlier today, beyond technical, grammatical,  and typographical corrections.    Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to take a  few minutes here on the floor to discuss, really, something that  follows along from the last couple of hours where we have been  discussing national defense issues.   The $708 billion that is going to be spent in the National Defense  Authorization Act by the Department of Defense is extremely important,  and there are many parts of that National Defense Authorization Act  that are worthy of discussion.   One thing that was not discussed here on the floor but was taken up  in committee over the last several hearings was the ability of the  military to actually be able to deliver materiel, supplies, in the case  of a major conflict. Do we have the ability to deliver the follow-on  equipment necessary should a major conflict break out somewhere in the  world?   The answer is, no, we don't. And the reason is that the American  maritime industry has dwindled over the last several decades.   In the 1980s, we had about 240 American-built and American flagships  with mariners, captains, engineers and seamen and -women on those ships  capable of providing the necessary support for the military sealift  command. Today, we have about 80 American-flagged ships with American  seamen on those ships.                                time  2000    The mariners are in short supply. TRANSCOM, responsible for moving  the personnel as well as the equipment that the military needs  somewhere in the world, estimates--as well as the MARAD indicate that  we are some 1,800 mariners short of the minimum necessary to man and  personnel the ships to move the equipment somewhere in the world.   This is a major national defense issue not really taken up and  discussed in the NDAA.   So what are we going to do about it? Can our shipyards actually  produce the necessary ships for the American military? The answer is:  not now, but they need to.   In the National Defense Authorization Act, there is a section that  calls for the construction of the ships--actually, construction by  foreign shipyards.   It seems strange that we would find what was once one of the great  maritime nations, the United States, in such a quandary that we do not  have the personnel or the ships to be able to move our national  defense.   There is something we can do about this, and it is not directly in  the area of the Department of Defense, although it is tangential and,  therefore, important to our national defense.   It seems that over the last decade we have become an energy-producing  Nation. With the fracking and other techniques, we are now actually an  exporter of oil and natural gas. This is part of the energy revolution  that is taking place in the United States.   That oil and natural gas is a strategic national asset, as is the  United States Department of Defense--the Navy, the Army, the Air Force,  the Marines, and the Coast Guard.   If we are to maintain our ability to defend this Nation and to  conduct military operations anywhere in the world, we have to have a  strong maritime industry.   If we consider for a moment the combination of that strategic  necessity of the maritime industry, the strategic benefit that comes  from the production of natural gas and oil, and the economic value of  exporting natural gas and oil, we can come to what we call a solution.   The solution is to take a very small percentage of the production or  the export of natural gas, LNG, and oil and require that it be  exported, transported, on American-built ships, American flagged, with  American mariners.   We call this the Energizing American Shipbuilding Act. It was  introduced yesterday, and we announced it in a press conference earlier  today.   Joining me at that press conference was Senator Roger Wicker, who  will be carrying the bill on the Senate side; the chairman of the  Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation of the House  Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Duncan Hunter; a member  of the Committee on Armed Services,  Donald Norcross; and a member of  the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure's Subcommittee on  Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation, Alan Lowenthal; together with  members of the industry: the Shipbuilders Council, VT Halter Marine out  of Mississippi, the representatives of the maritime unions that work on  the ships and unions that work in the shipyards.   We are prepared to move this bill. Let me tell you what it will do if  we are successful in passing the Energizing American Shipbuilding Act.   What we will do and what America will do is build ships once again.  It is anticipated that, if we start with 1 percent of the LNG that is  exported, over the next 15 to 20 years we will build some 23 LNG ships.  If we ramp that up to a full 15 percent, we will be building those LNG  carriers.   Similarly, if we begin at a very small percentage of the oil that is  exported, we will build another 30 LNG tankers.   In the course of some 15 to 20 years, we will be able to build some  50 ships in American shipyards, providing thousands of jobs not only in  the shipyards but in the supply of engines, pumps, pipes, electronic  equipment, and fittings of all kinds.   And, of course, the steel industry that would be providing the steel  for  [[Page H4581]]  these ships would also be playing a major part.   Now, do keep in mind that this is a very, very small part of the  total number of LNG vessels that are going to be needed. It is  anticipated that just to supply the necessary transport for American  LNG some 225 LNG vessels would be built. We would be looking at a very  small percentage of those that would be built here in the United  States. Nonetheless, that would represent a major part and a major  opportunity for the American shipbuilding industry.   Similarly, for the export of oil, that would similarly build ships  here throughout the shipyards of the United States. Exactly how many?  Well, we will have to figure that out as it goes on. If we really ramp  up the amount of oil and natural gas that we export, perhaps we will  build more than 50.   But it also means that the mariners will be able to work on these  ships. As they work on these particular ships, the LNG and the oil  tankers will be developing the skills necessary to transfer over to  provide the personnel necessary for the military on the cargo ships,  the roll-on and roll-offs, as well as the oil tankers that the military  will need as it transports the personnel and the equipment around the  world.   So this is what we are trying to do. We are trying to energize the  American shipbuilding industry by requiring that a small percentage of  the LNG that will be exported from the United States and the oil that  will be exported will be on American-built ships with American  mariners. That is our goal.   I believe that we will be able to accomplish this in the days ahead,  as we move this thing through the process and get it under way. We have  very strong, bipartisan support, both Democrats and Republicans  supporting the bill.   We also have very strong bicameral support, with the bill being  introduced in the Senate by Senator Roger Wicker and here in the House  by myself and by Chairman Duncan Hunter.    So I bring this to the attention of the Congress and the American  public, that it is our goal to make it in America, that there is a  better deal for America if we pass a law that requires that this  strategic national asset, oil and natural gas, be on an equally  strategic important asset, American ships, and that those ships be  manned by American sailors and officers. That is our goal.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
