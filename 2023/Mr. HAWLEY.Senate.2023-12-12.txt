 Mr. President, I want to add a few words to my friend  Senator Lujan's eloquent statement of the need to do justice to these  good Americans who have--let's just tell it like it is--been poisoned  by their own government, who have been exposed to nuclear waste,  nuclear radiation by the U.S. Government, by the U.S. Defense  Department.   These Americans are happy to do their part for national security.  They are proud of what they have done for their country. But they  deserve to be recognized, and they deserve to be compensated.   And so I want to add again my voice in support of justice for these  Americans. And I want to say again to this body that it is wrong--it is  wrong--to turn our backs on these tens of thousands of Americans who  have given their health and, in many cases, their lives for their  country and not been recognized for it; in many cases not been  compensated for it. And now they are told that because of the actions  of this body, because of the conference report, because of a backroom  deal struck in conference, this program that compensates victims of  nuclear radiation will soon expire. And tens of thousands of Americans  who have relied on this program for 30-plus years for lifesaving health  and treatment will get nothing. The lights will go dark, and these  Americans will be turned out into the cold. And thousands more--like  the residents of my State and New Mexico and other States around this  country who deserve compensation--will get nothing.   That is not acceptable to me. It is not right. And I want to take a  moment now to tell a story or two from the victims who are affected,  just to help everybody understand what is at stake here because I know  this is the national defense bill, and if I have learned one thing  about this bill, it is, the suits always get paid. The corporations,  they always get paid. The defense contractors, they always get paid.  They come out great in the end. It is amazing. It is a law in  Washington, ironclad. If you are a big corporation, you do defense  work, you are going to be fine. This body will take care of you.   But will we take care of the men and women who don't otherwise have a  voice in this body? Will we take care of the men and women who don't  pay DC lobbyists, who don't work for the Raytheon Corporation? Will  they be taken care of? That is the question. Let's meet a few of them.  Let me introduce you to Claire.   Claire's parents grew up near Weldon Spring in my State, in Missouri.  Weldon Spring is the site of a Manhattan Project uranium refining site.  That site sat untouched from the Manhattan Project era until 2001, more  than 50 years after it was contaminated.  [[Page S5914]]    In 2020, Claire was diagnosed with lymphoma. She was 2 years old. Let  me introduce you to Veda, Claire's cousin. Veda, her mom and dad, they  all lived together right near that same site where nuclear waste has  been dumped, not adequately cleaned up or dealt with. She grew up  there, and, wouldn't you know it, just 6 weeks after her cousin Claire  was diagnosed with lymphoma, Veda was diagnosed with leukemia. She was  4 years old when she was diagnosed.   Why is this happening in St. Louis? I will tell you why. St. Louis  was a uranium processing site, like many other cities around the  country, and St. Louis was proud to do its part in the Manhattan  Project. You won't get any argument from me about that. You certainly  won't get any argument from Missourians. But here is what is not  acceptable. After the Manhattan Project was concluded, the Federal  Government didn't clean up the waste. No, the Federal Government  allowed nuclear waste to sit out in barrels right near a stream that  runs along schools, that runs alongside suburbs, that cuts right  through the heart of the city.   The Federal Government dumped nuclear waste into a public landfill.  Then it dumped the nuclear waste into a second landfill. Then it dumped  it into an area in the downtown part of the city. And here we are, all  these decades later, how much of it has been cleaned up? None of it.  None of it. That is why these children are sick.   Let me introduce you to Howard Billiman because it is not just in  Missouri, but it is all over the country. This is Howard Billiman.  Howard was a Navajo code talker in World War II, absolutely  instrumental to the U.S. war effort. He died of stomach cancer after  living downwind from the nuclear tests that Senator Lujan was talking  about just a moment ago. And now his children who also grew up downwind  have developed cancer themselves. So it is not just one generation. It  is generation upon generation because the U.S. Government has not done  what is right. They haven't cleaned up the contamination. They haven't  made whole the families they injured.   In fact, as this body recognized in 1990, when it first passed the  radiation statute, the government owes these folks an apology; it owes  them a cleanup; and it owes them recognition and compensation.   That is true also of Bernice Gutierrez. Here is Bernice. She was 8  days old--8 days--when the government tested the first atomic bomb just  miles away from her family's home in New Mexico. Her entire family was  repeatedly exposed to nuclear tests. As a consequence, 44 members of  Bernice's family--44--have been diagnosed with cancer or other  radiation-linked diseases. Her mother had cancer three times. Three of  her brothers have had cancer. Her sister has had cancer, and she has  thyroid disease. Her oldest son passed away from a radiation-linked  disease, and her daughter now has thyroid cancer. Add to that, 36  additional relatives who have cancers linked to radiation. This is all  one family in one State who have been compensated not at all--not at  all.   They have given their health for this country. They haven't gotten  recognition. They haven't gotten compensation. That is wrong.   Meet Leslie Begay. Leslie is a Navajo marine who fought for his  country in Vietnam. There he is. When he returned home, he went to work  mining uranium to support the Cold War effort. Think about this. He  goes to Vietnam, fights for his country in Vietnam, comes home, goes to  the uranium mines to support his country's Cold War effort. He says he  was issued--in his words--``just a rain jacket, safety glasses, and a  hard hat. That's it.''   Now, Leslie is having a double lung transplant. He lives in New  Mexico. He pays $700 a month for medication. And what does he get for  his injuries, for his illnesses brought on by his exposure in the  mines? Nothing. Nothing. Zero. He has gotten zero.   I want to introduce you to one more person, my friend, Kristen  Camuso. Kristen grew up in St. Louis. She played in and around  Coldwater Creek, that creek where the government left barrels of  radioactive waste sitting out for literally years, open, the rain, the  elements. The waste leaked out of the barrels right down into the  creek. And for decades, the people of St. Louis were told: Oh, there is  no problem. The creek is fine. No problem at all. You can play in it.  Your kids can play in it. You can send your kids to school by it, build  houses by it, and people did because that is what the government said.  And now thousands of people are sick, including Kristen.   Since her 2012 cancer diagnosis, Kristen has had her gall bladder  removed. She has had a total hysterectomy. She has had her left adrenal  gland removed, and after all that, doctors found another tumor on her  right adrenal gland and a lesion on her liver. Her medicine is so  expensive, she has to ration the care. There is just no way around it.  As she says, ``I am forced to choose which way I can die.''   I say, again, this is not right. These are good people who have done  nothing wrong. Their government has caused this. When the government  causes injury, the government should make it right. That is what we are  asking for. That is what the radiation compensation program does, and  it is wrong to let it expire. It is an injustice. It is a scar on the  conscience of this body and this Nation.   And I will come to the floor as long as it takes until we do right by  these Americans who have done right by their country because they  deserve better than this.   Here is the last thing I will say. You know, you think about the  billions of dollars in costs that the government has imposed on these  people, taking their health, taking their lives, over decades, and yet  what is in this year's Defense bills, the Defense appropriations bills,  one analysis recently found that House and Senate appropriators have  added at least $26 billion for programs the Pentagon doesn't even want,  $26 billion in 1 year.   Things like $5 million for a social network analysis for the Army, $4  million to research the impacts of soil structures on hydrology, $12  million for new snow removal equipment. Where is my favorite? The $15  billion inserted by Senators--$15 billion with a ``b''--in 1 year, $15  billion for 636 weapons projects the Pentagon did not request. That is  636 weapons programs the Pentagon doesn't request. But yet we don't  have a dime for these people.   We don't have a dime for the people exposed to nuclear waste and  radiation by their own government. No, this is not right. It is not  right, and I am not willing to accept it. Senator Lujan is not willing  to accept it. And I urge the Members of this body, do not be willing to  accept it. We must reauthorize this program. We must do right by these  Americans. They deserve it.   This isn't a welfare check; this is justice. It is what they deserve.  It is what they have earned. And I will continue to come to this floor  as long as it takes.   I am going to make a motion now to extend debate on this bill. I have  no illusions that this will succeed. I realize my colleagues are eager,  all too eager, to move on, but I think it is important we take as much  time as is necessary to understand the stakes of what we are doing and  to understand the stakes of turning our backs on these people.                    Motion To Table the Motion To Recommit     =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S5914, December 12, 2023, third column, the following  appears: MOTION TO TABLE AMENDMENT NO. 1373      The online Record has been corrected to read: MOTION TO TABLE  THE MOTION TO RECOMMIT    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Mr. President, so now, I move to table the Schumer motion to  recommit, and I ask for the yeas and nays.
