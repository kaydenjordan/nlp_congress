 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for  yielding. He has pulled us together. Those of us who have been able to  work with him over the years, as I have--13 years on the committee--we  appreciate the gentleman's work from Georgia's 13th District.   Mr. Speaker, my colleagues have already very eloquently reminded you  of the significance, the history, and the benefits of unions. I want to  talk to you about the power of unions, the power to effect change in  the workforce.   Next month, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in Janus v.  AFSCME. This will decide whether workers can receive all the benefits  of a union contract without contributing any funding in return. We call  them fair share fees.   Unions work because the workers pay their fair share, and they all  benefit from what is negotiated. Each worker chooses whether or not to  join a union, but the union is still required by law to represent and  negotiate on behalf of all of the workers. Some people want to see an  end to that, which is why this case is headed to the U.S. Supreme  Court. A negative decision could reverse a 40-year unanimous precedent  supporting State's rights.   Now, I want to say that I believe in the power of unions. It allows  employees a voice when some of them feel that they have been silenced.  When they can't speak and ask for increased wages or a safe working  environment for fear of retaliation, the unions speak. The unions are  their voices and they demand fair and reasonable working conditions.   We saw that power in 1970 during the Postal Workers' strike. Workers  had had enough. And as the gentleman from Georgia mentioned earlier, we  saw that power during the Memphis Sanitation Workers' strike. Workers  were willing to sacrifice their lives.   The Reverend James Lawson, a good friend of mine, was a United  Methodist pastor in Memphis at the time. He made a phone call to a man  he had met about 10 years earlier. Jim Lawson had just gotten out of  prison for refusing to go to Korea. Jim Lawson met Martin Luther King  after he got out of prison. They both ended up in India, studying under  Gandhi.   Jim Lawson realized that Martin Luther King had started this  organization with four others called the Southern Christian Leadership  Conference, so he called him and said: ``Would you come to Memphis? We  need you to help with this sanitation workers' strike.''   It is little known that when Dr. King tried to get the SCLC board to  vote to come to Memphis, they were not in support. Dr. King struggled  around a couple of days by himself, and then let everybody know on the  board he was going to go by himself. That, of course, changed everybody  else's minds and they joined him in Memphis.   We all know what happened to Martin Luther King, Jr., when he went to  Memphis. He was killed on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel. He  sacrificed his life for workers, the people who built this country.   I owe my ``middle classness'' to my maternal and my paternal  grandfathers. Both of them worked for the Southern Pacific Railroad and  became members of a union and earned enough money to buy a house.   In my little town where I was born, Waxahachie, Texas, an African  American owning his own home, not a shanty?   So it inspired his three boys, one of which was my father, to raise  his four kids in a middle class way. We all went off to college. We owe  that not only to the ingenuity of my grandfather and my parents, but  also to the unions.   So I will support unions as long as I can. Long after I am out of  Congress, I intend to support unions because they have power to change  lives. I am an example.   Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank Reverend Cleaver for  his comments.   Mr. Speaker, there are 7.1 million members of just the public sector  unions. Thirty-four percent of all of the employees in public service  belong to unions, and this Supreme Court case would be devastating to  these 7.1 million families.   Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I yield to the  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Clarke), who serves on the very  influential Energy and Commerce Committee.   Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, the  gentleman from Georgia, for anchoring this very important Special Order  this evening.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in solidarity with my colleagues in this very  important  [[Page H664]]  discussion about fair share fees for union workers.                                time  2045    In 1977, the Supreme Court, in Abood v. Detroit Board of Education,  decided that fair share fees were constitutional, full stop. This  decision allowed unions to be paid fair share fees by nonunion members  in order to negotiate on their behalf.   Fair share fees have become increasingly significant and important,  as unions continue to fight for worker protections in the workplace.   Now, 40 years later, the Supreme Court is poised to hear this issue  yet again in Janus v. AFSCME.   So what has changed? What has changed?   Mr. Speaker, I am deeply concerned that this is yet another attempt  to put big business above working people and weaken organized labor as  effective representatives for the working class.   I, therefore, ask the Court to be thoughtful. I ask that they think  of the consequences that will follow by reversing this law. I ask the  Court not to be used as pawns by the Republican conservatives,  millionaires and billionaires, to weaken organized labor and unions of  the 21st century.   If it were not for organized labor, many of us would not be standing  here representing our constituents today. My mother was a member of DC  37, a part of AFSCME, and it was through her labor union, her local,  that she was able to put money aside for my brother and me to go to  college, to make sure that our healthcare was taken care of.   And here we are in the wealthiest Nation in the world where  millionaires and billionaires are lining their pockets with profits,  and, at the same time, we have workers who are before the Supreme Court  just seeking dignity to be organized through labor and labor unions.   This is a time for all Americans to remember their roots. Organized  labor is part of the bedrock of this Nation. It is my hope that the  Supreme Court will remember that in their deliberations.   Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, it was so good of the  gentlewoman to mention the why in all of this because, Mr. Speaker, in  1977, 41 years ago, in the Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, it was  ruled constitutional, and now they want to come back 41 years later and  say it is not constitutional. That is the big why we are going to get  to answer as we move with these great speeches from our Members from  across the country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison), a  tireless fighter for working people, who is also the vice chairman of  our Congressional Progressive Caucus as well as the vice chairman of  our Democratic National Committee and a good friend. We work together  on the Financial Services Committee.
