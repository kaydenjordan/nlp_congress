Sec. 9.  House Concurrent Resolution 124 is hereby adopted.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Reschenthaler) pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 1518, providing for consideration of  four measures.   First, the rule provides for consideration of H.R. 1948 under a  closed rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate equally divided  and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the  Committee on Foreign Affairs and a motion to recommit.   Second, the rule provides for consideration of S. 3905 under a closed  rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  Oversight and Reform, and a motion to commit.   Third, the rule provides for consideration of S. 4003 under a closed  rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  the Judiciary and a motion to commit.   Fourth, the rule provides for consideration of a Senate amendment to  H.R. 1437. The rule makes in order a motion offered by the chair of the  Committee on Appropriations that the House concur in the Senate  amendment with a House amendment and provides 1 hour of debate on the  motion equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority  member of the Committee on Appropriations.   The rule also deems passage of a motion to concur in the Senate  amendments to H.R. 2617 with a House amendment.   The rule further deems passage of H. Con. Res. 124 and H. Res. 1516.   Lastly, the rule provides the majority leader or his designee the  ability to en bloc requested roll call votes on suspension bills  considered from December 12 to December 15. The rule also provides roll  call votes on suspension bills considered on December 12 may be  postponed through December 15.   Mr. Speaker, as we come to the end of the 117th Congress, we are  working this week to pass legislation that deserves to make it across  the finish line before the end of the year.   First, the VA Employee Fairness Act. The healthcare workers at VA  medical centers are exceptional at what they do serving our veterans.  Many of them are veterans themselves. They deserve the same rights as  their counterparts outside of the VA system to collectively bargain.   In today's world, the balance of power is disproportionately skewed  towards employers over employees.                                time  1230    As a former union member and a small business owner myself, and as  the current chair of the Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions  subcommittee, I can think of no better way to honor these workers and  the people they serve, who we all respect and honor, than to provide  them the tools to empower them to have a voice in this important  American workplace.   From our national security to the regulation of prescription drugs,  the Federal Government relies on services of contractors and  consultants to provide for the American people. It is critical that we  know that these contractors are working in the best interest of the  American people.   Unfortunately, the current Federal acquisition process allows bad  actors to slip through the cracks without disclosing their potential  conflicts of interest.   As a member of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, I am proud of  [[Page H9747]]  the work that the committee has done to investigate McKinsey & Company  for this very reason. This contractor--one of the oldest and most  prestigious consulting firms in the world--was advising the FDA on the  safety and efficacy of prescription pain medications at the same time  the very same consultants were also advising Purdue Pharma on how to  ``turbocharge'' sales of OxyContin, a major driver of the opioid  epidemic.   While the McKinsey scandal shined a light on organizational conflicts  of interest, the issue itself is not new. The Preventing Organizational  Conflicts of Interest in Federal Acquisition Act would require Federal  contractors to disclose any potential conflicts of interest before they  are awarded a Federal contract to ensure they are effectively serving  the taxpayers. In the Senate it was bipartisan, and it should pass  without objection and without delay.   Also included in today's rule is the Law Enforcement De-Escalation  Training Act, which would direct the Department of Justice to develop  trainings on alternatives to the use of force and safely to respond to  an individual experiencing a mental health, behavioral health, or  suicidal crisis. We shouldn't even have to be including this bill in  the rule, but unfortunately, partisan politics caused it to need to be  reconsidered this week.   On this topic, I am proud that the district I represent is leading  the way with an initiative we call A3, anyone, anywhere, anytime. This  program connects people in need of mental health support that is  outside the police system to help respond to the emergency while  simultaneously allowing the police to focus on more appropriate police  matters.   This was a long, developed partnership between our behavioral health  departments and our local law enforcement, which support it very  strongly, and is working to protect the public.   Finally, the rule includes a 1-week continuing resolution.  Appropriators are hard at work to come to a year-long agreement over  spending, and they need an extra week to finalize it.   Mr. Speaker, we have a wonderful opportunity this week to make  transformative changes with these bills.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an ABC news  piece titled: ``Lawmakers aim to strengthen transparency in the  lucrative--and murky--Federal contracting process.''                              [From ABC News]   Lawmakers Aim To Strengthen Transparency in the Lucrative--and Murky--                       Federal, Contracting Process                              (By Soo Rin Kim)         A bipartisan coalition of senators introduced legislation       on Monday meant to improve transparency in the highly       competitive and notoriously murky federal contracting       process, taking aim at companies that accept lucrative work       from government agencies without having to disclose potential       conflicts of interest        The bill, called the Preventing Organizational Conflicts of       Interest in Federal Acquisition Act would seek to mitigate       conflict-of-interest concerns by forcing contractors to       ``disclose other parts of their business that conflict with       the work they are bidding to perform for the government,''       according to Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., chairman of the       Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.        ``If we don't know whether [federal contractors] are       serving other, potentially conflicting interest, we can't be       confident that Americans are getting exactly what they pay       for,'' said Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, a cosponsor of the       bill.        For many American companies, federal contracts represent a       crucial source of revenue, as well as visibility and       credibility. Firms from every major business sector compete       for this work, and winners often execute their end of the       agreement while pursuing outside business opportunities--      which sometime overlap with their frederal contracts.        While existing rules stipulate that government agencies       assess potential conflicts of interest before determining       contract winners, watchdogs say the process remains opaque.        ``Based on current federal contract regulations, agencies       cannot always discern whether government contractors have       business relationships with foreign governments and private       entities that could create a conflict of interest,'' said       Noah Bookbinder, president of the nonprofit government       watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in       Washington.        Scott Amey, general counsel for the government ethics       watchdog Project on Government Oversight, warned that       ``without more guidance, organizational conflicts of interest       can result in unfair competitive advantages and biased       contract awards--both of which compromise the impartiality of       the federal government and the integrity of the contracting       process.''        In a press release announcing the new legislation,       lawmakers cited reporting in ProPublica that raised conflict-      of-interest questions about consulting giant McKinsey &       Company's recent work for the Food and Drug Administration.       ProPublica reported that in at least one FDA contract,       McKinsey  [[Page H9748]]       allegedly failed to disclose its conflicts of interest with       corporate pharmaceutical clients despite its contract with       the agency obligating the firm to do so.        According to documents obtained by ProPublica, McKinsey       allegedly advised the FDA's drug-regulation division for more       than a decade while simultaneously accepting work from major       pharmaceutical companies. In some cases, according to       ProPublica, McKinsey helped those clients navigate FDA       regulations while advising the FDA on how to strengthen       regulations for the pharmaceutical industry.        Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., said McKinsey's handling of its       work with the FDA demonstrates ``the danger that conflicts of       interest can pose in government contracting.''        ``Our bipartisan bill would help ensure that companies that       enter into a contract with the government are acting in the       best interest of the American people,'' Hassan said.        McKinsey spokesperson Neil Grace told ABC News that       McKinsey's consulting work with pharmaceutical companies       ``did not create a conflict of interest'' for the firm's work       with the FDA because it ``has not advised the FDA on       regulatory policy or on specific pharmaceutical products.''       Instead, said Grace, McKinsey's work for the agency ``focused       on administrative and operational topics, including       improvements to organizational structures, business processes       and technology.''        ``Given the absence of a conflict of interest, there was no       requirement for any McKinsey disclosure,'' Grace said. ``That       said, McKinsey's proposals to the FDA frequently mentioned       the company's and personnel's experience with the       pharmaceutical industry, making the FDA aware of this aspect       of McKinsey's work in the field.''        Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa joined Peters,       Grassley, and Hassan in sponsoring the federal legislation.     Mr. Speaker, conflicts of interest are not a new  issue, but it is clear that more needs to be done by this Congress. The  American people ought to have faith that their tax dollars are being  spent wisely on contractors who are working in their best interest.  This bill will increase impartiality and integrity within the Federal  consultant and contractor system.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, first of all, my good friend from  Pennsylvania and the gentleman from Texas--you know, I am always open  to working on these sometimes difficult rules that we have in our  Congress. I respect the opinion, but I have a different perspective.  What we are doing today is keeping the lights on.   With all due respect, the last time the Republicans were in charge of  the Congress the lights went off. That is  [[Page H9749]]  not good for anyone. It is not good for the American people, and it is  not good for the world economy.                                time  1245    What we are trying to do here in the House is make it a little bit  easier for the arcane rules that, I think, most of us would agree to in  the Senate to make it easier for the bill to come back over and,  hopefully, have an agreement, a bipartisan agreement, on longer  spending in an omnibus.   With all due respect, we have something that we have here in these  Chambers: a disagreement. The tone, I think you can tell, of my voice  is very different. But I do think the things that both gentlemen have  brought up are real issues.   Immigration is a real issue. We have tried, many of us, to come up  with something that is bipartisan that leads to solutions to a  difficult situation that multiple administrations and Congresses have  struggled for; that has a long history in this country when it comes to  immigration, the benefit and the challenges around that; and being able  to make sure that the beneficiaries of immigration are consistent with  treaties that we have signed around the world, and principles, but also  to American citizens.   On the other issues, those are all real issues. What we have here in  front of us today in these resolutions are laws that will actually help  the American people, too, and, lastly, will continue to keep the lights  on by funding government.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   We are not talking about the Federal budget in its entirety today.  That will continue to be negotiated and debated, and there will be a  vote on it.   What we are talking about are specific resolutions that the Committee  on Rules has passed down here to this body to talk about protecting  workers who protect veterans. That is what we are talking about today.  We are talking about improving healthcare for America's veterans that  we all say we respect, admire, and honor.   We know that when people are able to organize in the workplace, or at  least to present the opportunity, they are safer. Research shows that  hospitals that have had the ability for workers and nurses to organize  and have a fair say in how they treat their patients, that mortality  rates improve, that people are served better. That is what we are  talking about today.   We are talking about giving police departments the resources they  need in the world today so that behavioral health people can do their  job, so that police officers can do their job and not respond to almost  one in four calls in the United States that involve mental health,  where the police officers are asked to do something that they shouldn't  be asked to do.   As I mentioned in my opening comments, I have spent 30 years involved  in my own district--from a mayor of a city of 130,000 people, to the  legislature, to this body--developing programs with the police  department in behavioral health, which started with a conversation with  a beat patrolman and a mental health clinician. All it is about is  improving the safety of Americans. That is what we are talking about  here.  [[Page H9750]]    We are talking about helping with the opioid crisis. I haven't heard  anything from the gentleman about the things that are actually in this  rule.   Do we want to help people with the high mortality and suicide crisis  in opioids that we know now, from the hearings that we have had, that  the chair and I have asked for in the Committee on Oversight?   We brought the CEOs of the largest corporation, Johnson & Johnson, to  testify in front of Congress about what they did at what used to be a  great American pharmaceutical company that once had one of the most  admired CEOs in the world and now has somebody who has lied on his  college resume twice and has helped to kill Americans by deliberately  turbocharging the sale of opioids to Americans.   That is what we are talking about in this rule, holding people  accountable.   McKinsey & Company, a company that was based in San Francisco for  years--I have known people who lived in my district and worked there.  It once was a shining light of American innovation and management. Now,  it has fallen to this epitome of greed and hypocrisy. That is what we  are talking about, stopping that kind of behavior, in this rule.   We are talking about keeping the lights on in the United States  Congress, and the Federal Government, for 1 week so that we can have an  omnibus, and then we can debate those other things.   Do I agree that the process is not perfect? I agree. Do I agree we  could do better? I agree, and I am open to those things. But let's  focus on what is in this rule.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time  for closing.   Mr. Speaker, let me say that I always enjoy being on the floor and  debating my friend from Pennsylvania. I will miss this if I am not  afforded the opportunity to do it again.   Mr. Speaker, again, focusing on the rule here. First in this rule, we  are helping veterans. We are helping the people who serve veterans to  be able to organize.   One of my favorite quotes on the ability of workers to have a voice  is from Dwight David Eisenhower, who said, Only a fool would try to  stop an American man or woman in the workplace from organizing.   So that is the first point, helping people to have a voice in the VA  to serve our veterans better.   The second point is on holding McKinsey & Company, a very large  corporation, American company, accountable for their role in the opioid  epidemic.   Third in the rule is helping our investment in public safety, a  bipartisan effort that came out of the Senate, to help provide them to  de-escalate when they are in a difficult situation.   Lastly, we are here to keep the lights on.   Mr. Speaker, while I appreciate the debate and the passion, we do  have work to do today, and I would request and ask Democrats and  Republicans to vote ``yes'' on this rule.   This rule is an important step in passing these bills that will make  a difference in the lives of the Americans that we represent and help  restore faith in this institution and the government.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support the legislation, and I urge a ``yes''  vote on the rule and the previous question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Reschenthaler is as  follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 1518         Strike sections 8 and 9.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1518, I  call up the bill (S. 3905) to prevent organizational conflicts of  interest in Federal acquisition, and for other purposes, and ask for  its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure before us.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 3905, the Preventing Organizational Conflicts of  Interest in Federal Acquisition Act, which was introduced by Senator  Gary Peters, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental  Affairs Committee, has strong bipartisan support and passed the Senate  this summer with unanimous consent.   In April, we introduced a companion bill, H.R. 7602, following one of  the Oversight Committee's investigations, which highlighted the need to  strengthen government contracting laws on conflicts of interest.   The committee's investigation found that a consulting contractor  advised the Food and Drug Administration at the same time they were  advising private-sector clients that were regulated by the FDA. Many  times, it was the exact same consultants advising the FDA and private- sector clients on the same issue.   In this case, the consultant failed to follow the rules on disclosing  these amazing conflicts, collecting millions of dollars from both the  regulator and the private-sector client.   Although this is one extreme example, other organizational conflicts  of interest, large and small, occur across government. The Government  Accountability Office regularly fields bid protests involving  organizational conflicts of interest.   In 2014, a major defense contractor paid a settlement for allegedly  failing to disclose conflicts while advising the Nuclear Regulatory  Commission.   Organizational conflicts of interest can occur when a contractor's  competing interests raise questions about their ability to provide  impartial advice to the government. It is crucial that government  contractors are providing impartial advice, particularly when the  government is paying for their expertise and objectivity on sensitive  matters.   The rules on organizational conflicts of interest have not changed  significantly since the 1990s. This bill would make long-overdue  revisions to strengthen these rules.   The current rules set basic standards to prevent organizational  conflicts of interest but leave the details up to individual agencies.  The current patchwork system creates the risk of egregious breaches of  the public trust.   In 2009, Congress asked for the organizational conflict of interest  rules to be reassessed. Draft rules were issued, but the reform effort  was eventually abandoned, and the rules were never finalized.   This bill requires the revisions that were then started to be  completed. This bill would also mandate that rules on government  contractor conflicts are thoroughly revised and ensure that there is a  uniform set of standards.   These reforms will help government contractors as well by ensuring  clarity  [[Page H9838]]  and consistency across the executive branch. This is especially  beneficial to contractors working for multiple agencies.   It is outrageous that a contractor would be allowed to advise  government regulators at the same time they are advising the industry  that is being regulated.   If we do not take steps to prevent conflicts of interest, and thereby  safeguard the integrity of government decisionmaking and operations,  then we risk potentially serious breaches in the public trust.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I will speak briefly on the work we have done on  oversight on the opioid crisis, in this case specifically on the role  that McKinsey & Company played in, unfortunately, the tragedy that has  been the opioid epidemic that led us to introducing this bill for  greater oversight.   I will start by saying this is something that, for me, Chairwoman  Maloney and some of my colleagues on both sides expressed a great deal  of passion for.   We had hearings on the opioid epidemic and the role of some of these  agencies, including requiring the chairman of Johnson & Johnson to come  to testify in front of the committee. The committee spent a good deal  of time, and I know that there was concern across the aisle, given the  devastation that this epidemic has caused.   This particular initiative is directed at some of the things that  were the most egregious part of what happened to the American public  who suffered under the abuses of the opioid epidemic.   In this case, McKinsey was a contractor for the FDA, Johnson &  Johnson, and other people who were making money off of this well-told  tragedy of how they were inducing people to be addicted to the drug  that was supposed to be relieving their pain.   The contractors play a critical role in supporting the Federal  workforce and giving advice to government functions. These are  contractors for which this initiative, this bill, would try to make  sure the rules were clearer. It would help them, as well.   Taxpayers need to know that work is done ethically and transparently.  Unfortunately, loopholes allow contractors, which this initiative, this  bill, attempts to close or will close, to advise private-sector clients  and the Federal Government at the same time. I think anyone would agree  that that is a conflict of interest.   The most notorious example was what I just referred to, this conflict  of interest playing out with McKinsey & Company's work on Perdue  Pharma's roadmap, in this case, to ``turbocharge'' opioid sales. They  were giving them advice on how to turbocharge an addictive drug that  was causing devastation across this country.   One of the things that led me into this discussion was, when I was in  the legislature in California, two parents separately brought tragic  cases of how their kids had lost their lives because of this.   The conflict of interest fueled the opioid crisis that has claimed  hundreds of thousands of American lives.   I am grateful and proud of the work that I was able to do with a  former chair, Elijah Cummings, who had great passion for this and  opening the committee's investigation of Perdue Pharma specifically. I  am grateful to current Chair Maloney for continuing this work.   A vote to pass this bipartisan bill today will send it to the  President's desk and will bring much-needed transparency to Federal  contracting and help to address some of the things that led to the  opioid crisis epidemic in this country.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
