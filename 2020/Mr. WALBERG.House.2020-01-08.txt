 Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member and the  chairman for moving this bill forward.   I rise today in support of H.R. 4500, the Promoting United States  Wireless Leadership Act of 2019.   I am pleased my colleague from Michigan, Representative Dingell,  worked with me on this important legislation to enhance United States  leadership in the development of wireless standards.   Michigan's economy has become resurgent, in no small part, thanks to  the renewed focus under past-Governor Snyder on STEM education and  technical careers in the IT field.   As co-chair of the 5G Caucus, I understand the importance of bringing  not only these technical jobs to Michigan, but also the jobs that will  come as a result of leading the world on 5G deployment. As industry  continues to send their best and brightest to these global technical  standards-setting bodies, we must continue supporting them with  necessary technical expertise and continue leading the world in  wireless innovation.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
