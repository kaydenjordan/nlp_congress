 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to complete my  remarks before the scheduled 4:30 vote if my remarks run beyond 4:30.    Madam President, a great American anniversary is upon us:  [[Page S7063]]  400 years ago this Saturday, a battered old ship called the Mayflower  arrived in the waters off Cape Cod. The passengers aboard the Mayflower  are, in many ways, our first founders. Daniel Webster called them ``Our  Pilgrim Fathers'' on the 200th anniversary of this occasion.  Regrettably, we haven't heard much about this anniversary of the  Mayflower. I suppose the Pilgrims have fallen out of favor in  fashionable circles these days. I therefore would like to take a few  minutes to reflect on the Pilgrim story and its living legacy for our  Nation.   By 1620, the Pilgrims were already practiced at living in a strange  land. They had fled England for Holland 12 years earlier, seeking  freedom to practice their faith. But life was hard in Holland, and the  Stuart monarchy, intolerant of dissent from the Church of England,  gradually extended its oppressive reach across the Channel. So the  Pilgrims fled the Old World for the New.   In seeking safe harbor for their religion, the Pilgrims differed from  those settlers who preceded them in the previous century, up to and  including the Jamestown settlement just 13 years earlier. As John  Quincy Adams put it in a speech celebrating the Pilgrims' anniversary,  those earlier settlers ``were all instigated by personal interests''  motivated by ``avarice and ambition'' and ``selfish passions.'' The  Pilgrims, by contrast, braved the seas ``under the single inspiration  of conscience'' and out of a ``sense of religious obligation.''   Not to say all aboard the Mayflower felt the same. About half of the  102 passengers were known as ``Strangers'' to the Pilgrims. The  Strangers were craftsmen, traders, indentured servants, and others  added to the manifest by the ship's financial backers for business  reasons. The Strangers did not share the Pilgrims' faith, suffice it to  say. Winston Churchill, in his ``History of the English-Speaking  Peoples,'' wryly observed that the Strangers were ``no picked band of  saints.''   So these were the settlers who boarded the Mayflower, which Dwight  Eisenhower once characterized as ``a ship that today no one in his  senses would think of attempting to use.'' One can only imagine the  hardships, the dangers, the doubts that they faced while crossing the  north Atlantic. The ship leaked chronically. A main beam bowed and  cracked. The passage took longer than expected--more than 2 months.  Food and water--or beer, often the beverage of choice--ran dangerously  low.   But somehow, through the grace of God and the skill of the crew, the  Mayflower finally sighted land. Yet the dangers only multiplied.  William Bradford, a Pilgrim leader whose ``Of Plymouth Plantation'' is  our chief source for the Pilgrim story, recorded those dangers:         They had now no friends to welcome them, nor inns to       entertain or refresh their weatherbeaten bodies; no houses or       much less town to repair to, to seek for succor. . . . And       for the season it was winter, and they that know the winters       of that country know them to be sharp and violent, and       subject to cruel and fierce storms, dangerous to travel to       known places, much more to search an unknown coast. Besides,       what could they see but a hideous and desolate wilderness.    And to those physical dangers, you can add legal and political  danger. While the Mayflower had found land, it was the wrong land. For,  you see, the Pilgrims' patent extended to Virginia, but Cape Cod was  hundreds of miles to the north. According to Bradford, ``some of the  Strangers,'' perhaps hoping to strike out on their own in search of  riches, began to make ``discontented and mutinous speeches.'' These  Strangers asserted that ``when they came ashore, they would use their  own liberty; for none had the power to command them'' in New England.   Maybe they had a point. But Stranger and Pilgrim alike also had a  problem: They couldn't survive the ``desolate wilderness'' alone.  Before landfall, then, they mutually worked out their differences and  formed what Bradford modestly called ``a combination.''   This ``combination'' is known to us and history, of course, as the  Mayflower Compact. But this little Compact--fewer than 200 words--was  no mere ``combination.'' It was America's very first constitution;  indeed, in Calvin Coolidge's words, ``the first constitution of modern  times.''   Likewise, Churchill called the Mayflower Compact ``one of the more  remarkable documents in history, a spontaneous covenant for political  organization.'' High praise coming from him, so it is worth reflecting  a little more on a few points about the Compact.   First, while the Pilgrims affirmed their allegiance to England and  the monarchy, they left little doubt about their priorities. The  Compact begins with their traditional religious invocation: ``In the  name of God, Amen.'' They expressed as the ends of their arduous  voyage, in order, ``the Glory of God,'' the ``advancement of the  Christian faith,'' and only then the ``honor of our King and Country.''  And much like the Founding Fathers' famous pledge to each other before  ``divine Providence'' 156 years later, the Pilgrims covenanted with  each other ``solemnly and mutually in the presence of God.''   Second, they respected each other as free and equal citizens. Whether  Pilgrim or Stranger, the signatories covenanted together to form a  government, irrespective of faith or station.   Third and related, that government would be self-government based on  the consent of the governed. The Pilgrims did not appoint a patriarch;  they formed a ``civil body politic'' based on ``just and equal laws,  ordinances, acts, constitutions, and offices.'' And immediately after  signing the Compact, they conducted a democratic election to choose  their first Governor.   Fourth, again prefiguring the Declaration, the Pilgrims did not  surrender all rights to that government. They promised ``all due  submission and obedience'' to the new government--not ``total'' or  ``unquestioning'' or ``permanent'' submission and obedience. That  obedience would presumably be ``due'' as long as the laws remained  ``just and equal,'' and the officers appointed performed their duties  in a ``just and equal'' manner.   Finally, even in that moment of great privation and peril, the  Pilgrims turned their eyes upward to the higher, nobler ends of  political society. They listed their ``preservation'' as an objective  of the new government, but even before that came ``our better  ordering.'' The Pilgrims understood that liberty, prosperity, faith,  and flourishing are only possible with order, and that while safety may  be the first responsibility of government, it is not the highest or  ultimate purpose of government. This new government would do more than  merely protect the settlers or resolve their disputes; it would aim for  ``the general good of the Colony.''   There, aboard that rickety old ship, tossed about in the cold New  England waters, the Pilgrims foreshadowed in fewer than 200 words so  many cherished concepts of our Nation: faith in God and his  providential protection; the natural equality of mankind; from many,  one; government by consent; the rule of law; equality before the law;  and the impartial administration of the law.   Little wonder, therefore, that Adams referred to the Mayflower  Compact and the Pilgrims' arrival as the ``birth-day of your nation''  or that Webster, despite all the settlements preceding Plymouth, said  that ``the first scene of our history was laid'' there.   But that history was only just beginning. The Pilgrims still had to  conquer the ``desolate wilderness'' and establish their settlement.  Considering the challenges, it is a wonder that they did. As Coolidge  observed, though, the Compact ``was not the most wonderful thing about  the Mayflower. The most wonderful of all was that those who drew it up  had the power, the determination, and the strength of character to live  up to it from that day.''   They would need all that and more to survive what has been called  ``the starving time.'' Upon landfall, the Pilgrims ``fell upon their  knees and blessed the God of Heaven who had brought them over the vast  and furious ocean.'' But it would be a ``sad and lamentable'' winter of  disease, starvation, and death, as half the settlers died and seldom  more than half a dozen had the strength to care for the ill, provide  food and shelter, and protect the camp.   As anyone who has endured a New England winter knows, at that rate,  there might not have been any camp left to protect by spring. But what  can only be seen as a providential moment came in March, when a lone  Indian  [[Page S7064]]  walked boldly into their camp and greeted them in English. His name was  Samoset. He had learned some broken English by working with English  fishermen in the waters off what is now Maine. Samoset and the Pilgrims  exchanged gifts, and he promised to return with another Indian,  Squanto, who spoke fluent English.   Squanto's Tribe had been wiped out a few years earlier by an epidemic  plague. He now lived among the Wampanoag Tribe in what is today  Southeastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island. The plague had also  weakened the Wampanoags, though not neighboring rival Tribes. The  Wampanoag chief, Massasoit, thus had good reason to form an alliance  with the Pilgrims. Squanto introduced him to the settlers and  facilitated their peace and mutual aid treaty, which lasted more than  50 years.   Squanto remained with the Pilgrims, acting, in Bradford's words, as  ``their interpreter'' and ``a special instrument sent of God for their  good beyond their expectations.'' He instructed them on the cultivation  of native crops like corn, squash, and beans. He showed them where to  fish and to hunt. He guided them on land and sea to new destinations.   And you probably remember what happened next. As the Pilgrims  recovered and prospered throughout 1621, they received the blessings of  a bountiful fall harvest. The Pilgrims entertained Massasoit and the  Wampanoags and feasted with them to express their gratitude to their  allies and to give thanks to God for His abundant gifts. This meal, of  course, was the First Thanksgiving.   Now, the Thanksgiving season is upon us, and, once again, we have  much to give thanks for. But this year we ought to be especially  thankful for our ancestors, the Pilgrims, on their 400th anniversary.  Their faith, their bravery, their wisdom places them in the American  pantheon. Alongside the Patriots of 1776, the Pilgrims of 1620 deserve  the honor of American Founders.   Sadly, however, there appear to be few commemorations, parades, or  festivals to celebrate the Pilgrims this year, perhaps in part because  revisionist charlatans of the radical left have lately claimed the  previous year as America's true founding. Nothing could be further from  the truth. The Pilgrims and their Compact, like the Founders and their  Declaration, form the true foundation of America.   So count me in Coolidge's camp. On this anniversary a century ago, he  proclaimed that ``it is our duty and the duty of every true American to  reassemble in spirit in the cabin of the Mayflower, rededicate  ourselves to the Pilgrims' great work by re-signing and reaffirming the  document that has made mankind of all the earth more glorious.''   Some--too many--may have lost the civilizational self-confidence  needed to celebrate the Pilgrims. Just today, for instance, the New  York Times called this story a ``myth'' and a ``caricature'' in the  food section, no less. Maybe the politically correct editors of the  debunked 1619 Project are now responsible for pumpkin pie recipes at  the Times as well.   But I, for one, still have the pride and confidence of our forebears.  So here, today, I speak in the spirit of that cabin, and I reaffirm  that old Compact. As we head into the week of Thanksgiving, I will be  giving thanks this year in particular to ``our Pilgrim Fathers'' and  the timeless lessons they bequeathed to our great Nation. For as  Coolidge observed, ``Plymouth Rock does not mark a beginning or an end.  It marks a revelation of that which is without beginning and without  end.''   May God continue to bless this land and may He bless the memory of  the Pilgrims of 1620. I extend my best wishes to you and to your family  for a Thanksgiving as happy and peaceful as the First Thanksgiving.   I yield the floor.
