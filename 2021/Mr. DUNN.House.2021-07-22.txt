 Mr. Speaker, I came to speak on this bill because it means  a lot to me. My war was Vietnam, and I remember the end of that war. I  remember the friends that we left behind, I remember the families that  were torn apart, and it still weighs on me.   Now I have a son who spent years in Afghanistan, and when he talks to  me, he does not talk about taxes or healthcare. He talks about the  people he left behind in Afghanistan and what we are doing for them. We  cannot do this again. We must not do this again. We have to rise and  bring back and repatriate all the people who were so important to us in  combat.   Mr. Speaker, I know you understand that. Please do not abandon  friends of America again.
