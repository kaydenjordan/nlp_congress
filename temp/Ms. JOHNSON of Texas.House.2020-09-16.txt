 Mr. Speaker, we woke up this morning to another  1,000 souls lost to coronavirus and the Western States are ablaze. Our  most powerful weapon for combating these threats is rigorous, unbiased  science. And yet this administration continues to suppress and  misrepresent the work of our Federal scientists.   HHS officials appear to be tampering with public health bulletins to  suit their political narrative. EPA is misrepresenting its own  analysts' work to absolve polluters. And just yesterday, the President  claimed that science doesn't know about the impacts of climate change.   If science doesn't know, who does?   This cannot go on. My committee has been fighting back. Among other  initiatives, we have passed the Scientific Integrity Act to make sure  that Federal science is not distorted by politics or special interests,  no matter who is in the White House.   As we work to make this bill a law, I commend all of our Federal  scientists who remain objective, exacting, and transparent in their  research: Don't quit. Continue to stand up to scientific integrity.  Your country needs you. We all do.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R.  2574, the Equity and Inclusion Enforcement Act of 2019. This bill will  take a meaningful step forward to ensure that programs receiving  federal funding are upholding a high standard of equality and  inclusion--similar to that which our country strives for.   In 2001, the Supreme Court, in its ruling in Alexander v. Sandoval,  stated that only the Department of Education can challenge schools and  other programs over discriminatory practices. In the majority opinion  written by Justice Antonin Scalia, supported by the court's  conservative bloc, he claimed that students and parents did not own the  right to challenge schools and other programs on their practices and  policies. Let me repeat that--the Supreme Court ruled that instead of  allowing those directly and adversely affected by discriminatory  practices and policies to initiate legal proceedings, the  responsibility would be  [[Page H4443]]  placed on government bureaucrats. Now, at a time when the Department of  Education lacks competent leadership, it is more important than ever  before to reverse the Supreme Court's decision.   H.R. 2574 rectifies the Court's ruling and would allow students and  parents to hold federally funded programs, like schools, accountable  for any discriminatory practices and policies that impact people of  color through a private right to action within the Civil Rights Act of  1964. It also creates an Assistant for Equity and Inclusion position in  the Department of Education, tasked with guiding and advising the  agency as to the best practices and policies for students in every  classroom across the country.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation and ask for its immediate in consideration in the Senate.    Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of S.  881 ``The Promoting Research and Observations of Space Weather to  Improve the Forecasting of Tomorrow, or PROSWIFT, Act.''   Space weather is something the American public may not yet have an  awareness of, but it has the potential to impact society across the  world--every single day.   Geomagnetic storms or solar flares can cause disturbances in both  space and the near-Earth environment.   These effects can reach the Earth's surface and pose significant  risks to humans operating in space, some aircraft flights, space  communications, GPS-based services, the electric grid, pipelines, and  other space-based and ground-based infrastructure.   In short, space weather events can have major societal, national  security, economic, and health impacts.   That is why I was an original co-sponsor of Mr. Perlmutter's H.R.  5260, ``The PROSWIFT Act,'' which is the basis of the text of the  Senate-passed space weather bill we are voting on today. H.R. 5260 was  widely supported by the space weather community, including academia,  industry, and not-for-profit entities.   I want to commend my colleague on the House Science Committee, Mr.  Perlmutter, for tirelessly pushing to make this legislation a reality  for over five years.   He and his dedicated staff worked closely with my Committee staff,  with the staff of the Committee's Ranking Member, as well as staff of  our colleagues in the Senate, to bring this legislation to the floor  today.   Unlike previous attempts to move this legislation, I am proud that  the bill being voted on today came out of regular order in the House  Science Committee.   This bill took into consideration feedback from major stakeholders in  the space weather community and was strengthened during our markup  process to include a commercial space weather pilot program. It was  further strengthened following negotiations with our colleagues in the  Senate.   I am pleased that this bill represents both bicameral and bipartisan  agreement on this important issue.   I have supported the overall agenda to advance the space weather  enterprise and ensure capabilities for space weather observation and  forecasting for many years and Congresses before this. I am looking  forward to finally passing this legislation today, and have it enacted  after years of hard work.   Being able to better understand and predict space weather events is  vitally important to protecting our society, our economy, and our  critical national infrastructure. I urge my colleagues to support this  bipartisan and good governance bill.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 4979) to direct the Director of the National  Science Foundation to support STEM education and workforce development  research focused on rural areas, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4979         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Rural STEM Education Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The supply of STEM workers is not keeping pace with the       rapidly evolving needs of the public and private sector,       resulting in a deficit often referred to as a STEM skills       shortage.        (2) According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the United       States will need one million additional STEM professionals       than it is on track to produce in the coming decade.        (3) Many STEM occupations offer higher wages, more       opportunities for advancement, and a higher degree of job       security than non-STEM jobs.        (4) The 60,000,000 individuals in the United States who       live in rural settings are significantly under-represented in       STEM.        (5) According to the National Center for Education       Statistics, nine million students in the United States--      nearly 20 percent of the total K-12 population--attend rural       schools, and for reasons ranging from teacher quality to       shortages of resources, these students often have fewer       opportunities for high-quality STEM learning than their peers       in the Nation's urban and suburban schools.        (6) Rural areas represent one of the most promising, yet       underutilized, opportunities for STEM education to impact       workforce development and regional innovation, including       agriculture.        (7) The study of agriculture, food, and natural resources       involves biology, engineering, physics, chemistry, math,       geology, computer science, and other scientific fields.        (8) Employment in computer and information technology       occupations is projected to grow 11 percent from 2019 to       2029. To help meet this demand, it is important rural       students have the opportunity to acquire computing skills       through exposure to computer  [[Page H4464]]       science learning in grades PreK - 12 and in informal learning       settings.        (9) More than 293,000,000 individuals in the United States       use high-speed broadband to work, learn, access healthcare,       and operate their businesses, while 19,000,000 individuals in       the United States still lack access to high-speed broadband.       Rural areas are hardest hit, with over 26 percent of       individuals in rural areas in the United States lacking       access to high-speed broadband compared to 1.7 percent of       individuals in urban areas in the United States.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous materials on H.R. 4979, the bill now under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4979, the Rural STEM  Education Act.   I thank Ranking Member Lucas and Representative McAdams for  introducing this important bill, which I am proud to cosponsor.   The COVID-19 crisis has revealed and exacerbated the many harmful  inequities that persist in our society. Rural communities have not been  spared.   Broadband access and the so-called digital divide have long been a  barrier to high quality STEM education for students in rural areas.  STEM teachers in rural communities are stretched thin, often teaching  multiple STEM subjects at multiple grade levels. While dedicated and  hardworking, these teachers have limited resources and support,  including training that is up-to-date and optimized for schools in a  rural setting.   Rural school districts also have limited access to library equipment  to provide students with hands-on experiences and a glimpse of what it  is like to actually do science.   The sudden transition to remote education across the Nation that has  occurred due to the pandemic has amplified these challenges for rural  communities.   School districts are getting creative. Some are setting up internet  hotspots in the parking lot. Some students can download assignments and  submit homework. Others are sending out paper packets for students  without reliable transportation. While these stopgap measures are  helpful, they are not enough.   And students are falling behind. If we had invested in improving  remote teaching and mentoring and improving broadband access before the  pandemic hit, rural communities would have been better prepared to  weather this crisis.   The Rural STEM Education Act provides for research and development to  improve access to evidence-based STEM education opportunities in rural  schools and provide teachers with the support and tools they need to  teach more effectively.   I am particularly excited about the NIST rural connectivity prize  competition and the Broadband Research and Development Working Group,  which would advance research and technology development to expand  broadband access across the country.   The bill also provides for a much-needed assessment of Federal  investments in rural STEM education through the National Academies of  Science and the Government Accountability Office.   This bill is a critical step forward to ensuring that more students  have access to a high-quality STEM education and that we are equipped  with the STEM workforce we need to face future challenges like this  pandemic.   Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member of the Committee on  Science, Space, and Technology, Mr. Lucas, for introducing this bill,  and also for working collaboratively with me and the staff to ensure it  was a bipartisan effort.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1245     Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Utah (Mr. McAdams).    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   I would like to take a moment again to thank the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas) for working with the members of this committee on  this legislation and thank Mr. McAdams and Dr. Baird.   It is my hope that we can pass this bill out of the House today and,  hopefully, work with our colleagues in the Senate to get this  bipartisan bill, as well as many others, of course, we have sent over  there passed into law.   This bill is needed more now than it was when we started out, so I  would hope that the Senate will see the need to pass this bill as soon  as possible.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4990,  the Election Technology Research Act of 2020. I am proud to join my  colleagues, Representatives Sherrill and Gonzalez, in introducing this  bipartisan bill.   Just a few weeks from now, Americans will begin casting their ballots  in the 2020 election. They will also do so in the midst of a global  pandemic and a divided country. The stakes could not be higher. We face  many threats to our democratic institutions, including to our most  sacred right and responsibility as citizens: our vote.   Unfortunately, the greatest threats today are the spread of  misinformation and the active disenfranchisement of American citizens.  Those are human vulnerabilities that are amplified by technology.  However, we must not lose sight of the vulnerabilities inherent to the  technologies that we use to cast and count our votes.   As it has across all aspects of our lives and society, technology has  become an integral part of the election process. The use of technology  in elections has changed significantly since the enactment of Help  America Vote nearly 20 years ago.   H.R. 4990 authorizes research and standards development activities at  the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Standards  and Technology to help modernize and secure our election systems and  ensure that they are accessible to all.   The legislation also includes a small amendment to HAVA to ensure  that the standards and guidelines developed to help States secure their  election systems cover all of the election technologies in use today.   This legislation represents just a tiny piece of what is needed in  terms of policy, leadership, and funding to ensure free, fair,  transparent, and secure elections, but it is an important piece, if not  in time for this election, then for all future elections.   I want to again thank my colleagues, Representatives Sherrill and  Gonzalez, for their hard work and our colleagues on the House  Administration Committee for their support in getting this bill to the  floor.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this good, bipartisan  legislation.
