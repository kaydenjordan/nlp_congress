 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the legacy of one of my  constituents, Mr. Freddie Warmack, from Newberry, Florida, a small  rural community of approximately 6,000 in north central Florida.   Following a lifetime of public service, Mr. Warmack passed away on  April 1, 2019, at the age of 87. Mr. Warmack dedicated his life to the  betterment of his community and country.   As a young man, Mr. Warmack served his country in the Korean War.  Upon his return to Newberry, Florida, he became a city commissioner and  went on to be elected the first African American mayor of Newberry,  where he served from 1984 to 1994. During the 10 years that Mr. Warmack  served as mayor, he instituted a great change in the Newberry  community. He helped start the Meals On Wheels program and served on  the Central Florida Community Action Agency.   He helped institute the historic city hall still used today and  renovated the first African American school in the city and the  adjoining property into a park named in his honor.   Mr. Warmack's compassion and respect for others has left an impact on  all those who were lucky enough to have known him, and I would like to  honor the accomplishments and legacy of Mr. Warmack and the strides he  has made for his community and communities across our great Nation.                            ____________________
