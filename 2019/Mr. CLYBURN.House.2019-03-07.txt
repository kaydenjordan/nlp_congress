 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Nadler) for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution condemning anti- Semitism, Islamophobia, and bigotry against minorities.   This resolution expresses our rejection of all attempts to weaponize  words and sow discord and division.   Make no mistake, our Caucus is unified, but unity does not mean  unanimity. We are the most diverse Caucus in the history of Congress.  We are a true reflection of who and what America is.   Each of us brings our own familiar backgrounds and personal  experiences to this august body. Those experiences help shape our  values and our perspectives as we do the work of the American people.   We learn from one another, and we do so following President Lincoln's  declaration: ``With malice toward none; with charity for all; with  firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive  on to finish the work we are in.''   This resolution condemns hateful expressions of intolerance, honors  the heritages and experiences of all who serve in this body, and  commits all of us to the continued search of a more perfect Union.
