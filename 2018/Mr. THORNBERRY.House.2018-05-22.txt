 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on H.R. 5515.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to bring to the House floor H.R. 5515, the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019. This measure  was reported favorably out of our committee by a vote of 60-1, and if  signed into law, this would be the 58th consecutive year in which a  National Defense Authorization Act was signed into law.   I want to begin by thanking the members of the House Armed Services  Committee, because each of them has contributed to the work product  that we bring before the House today. I particularly want to express my  appreciation to the ranking member, the gentleman from Washington (Mr.  Smith), for not only his cooperative approach to matters of national  security, but for all of the input, all of the good humor, all of the  partnership that he brings into making this truly a bipartisan bill  which we bring before the House today.   I also want to thank the staff of the committee on both sides of the  aisle for incredible hours, incredible work, not only in the last few  weeks, but throughout this process as we have conducted our hearings,  our briefings, and traveled, done all sorts of work that contributed to  this bill.   Mr. Chairman, I also want to especially thank the legislative  counsel. We have had hundreds of amendments considered in committee. We  have had hundreds of amendments which have been drafted for floor  consideration. That is a lot of work on a very few individuals who have  had to make sure it was in the appropriate legislative language. I  especially want to thank legislative counsel working with our staffs  for getting this measure ready for floor consideration.   Mr. Chairman, the best way to summarize this bill is that it takes  the next steps: the next steps to rebuilding our military, the next  steps to reforming the Pentagon, the next steps towards strengthening  our country's national security.   We are going to hear a lot more about the details in the moments and  days to come. I just want to emphasize that no one bill can do  everything that needs to be done on behalf of the men and women who  serve our Nation, especially in repairing their equipment, in repairing  their readiness, and in giving them the best equipment, support, and  training our Nation can provide. No one bill can do all those things,  but this bill takes important next steps building on what was done in  the 2018 bill.   Finally, Mr. Chairman, I just want to make this point: We live in a  volatile and dangerous world. Our country has a number of tools at its  disposal--diplomacy, economics and trade, soft power and influence, a  variety of tools--but, in my view, the most important tool is our  military strength. I believe our military strength enhances all of  those other tools so that, when our military is strong, our diplomacy  is more effective. When our military is strong, our economic tools and  sanctions are more effective. When our military is strong, our soft  power somehow becomes more persuasive.   Just to take one example, there is a lot in the news these days, even  today, about whether or not there will be some sort of a negotiated  agreement with North Korea. I don't know how that will come out. What I  do know is a strong military improves our negotiating position, and a  strong military helps make sure we can defend this country if  negotiations do not bear fruit.   What we are trying to advance in this bill, along with the  appropriations bill, which will come, is to put the United States in a  stronger position, hopefully, to get a negotiated result with Iran,  North Korea, a variety of other situations around the world, but, above  all, to defend this country and to defend our way of life, to defend  the American people by way of supporting the men and women who risk  their lives for us. That, bottom line, is what this bill tries to do.  It is what all of these thousands of pages and hundreds of amendments  are designed to do. With the bipartisan support of this House, I  believe it will be successful.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Wilson), the chairman of the Subcommittee on  Readiness.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Turner), the chair of the Subcommittee on  Tactical Air and Land Forces.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Rogers), the distinguished chair of the  Subcommittee on Strategic Forces.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Wittman), the distinguished chair of the Subcommittee on  Seapower and Projection Forces.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Coffman), the distinguished chair of the Subcommittee on  Military Personnel.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler), the distinguished chair of the  Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Stefanik), the distinguished chair of  the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of the time.   Mr. Chairman, I would just pick up on a couple of the points the  ranking member made, largely in agreement with him.   We do have fiscal challenges in this country, and that is even more  reason that, together, we need to continue to work to see that the  taxpayers get more value for the money that is spent by the Pentagon.  That is part of the reason that we have put such an effort, again, on a  bipartisan basis, on defense reform, on buying things and services  smarter, so that we can get more value for the taxpayer, but also, so  we can make decisions faster. With the world moving so quickly around  us, we have to be able to be more agile, and our reform efforts are a  part of that goal.   But I do think Secretary Mattis has cut to the heart of the matter  when he says, We can afford survival. Currently, defense is roughly 15  percent of the Federal budget, not much for all that it provides for  the American people and for the country. Yes, the country can afford to  survive.   Lastly, Mr. Chairman, I just want to make the point that over the  next 3 days we are going to consider many amendments. We are going to  hear debate about some of them. We got a taste of that tonight with a  difference, for example, on some of the policies in the nuclear posture  review, and we will have to vote on some of those amendments. There  will be people pro and con. Some Members, including me, may not have  our position prevail on all of those amendments.   But none of that should take away from the fact that there is far  more in this bill upon which we agree than upon which we disagree. I  think that is a very important message for friends and allies around  the world to hear, for adversaries or potential adversaries around the  world to hear, and, most importantly, for the men and women who have  volunteered to risk their lives, to serve our Nation, to protect our  freedoms, defend our country, they need to hear that there is far more  in this bill upon which there is agreement on a bipartisan basis than  any of the disagreements that we may discuss and, ultimately, vote on.   The country has to be defended. I am very proud, on a bipartisan  basis and a vote of 60-1, this bill has been reported favorably to the  House floor, and I look forward to its consideration over the next 3  days.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I include in the Record the following  exchange of letters during consideration of H.R. 5515:   [[Page H4375]]                                       U.S. House of Representatives,                                         Committee on the Budget,                                       Washington, DC, May 10, 2018.

Mr. Chair, I include in the Record the following  exchange of letters during consideration of H.R. 5515:           House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space and             Technology,                                      Washington, DC, May 14, 2018.      Hon. William M. ``Mac'' Thornberry,      Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Thornberry: I am writing to you concerning the       bill H.R. 5515, the National Defense Authorization Act for       fiscal Year 2019. There are certain provisions in the       legislation which fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the       Committee on Science, Space, and Technology.        In the interest of permitting your committee to proceed       expeditiously to floor consideration of this important bill,       I am willing to waive this committee's right to sequential       referral. I do so with the understanding that by waiving       consideration of the bill the Committee on Science, Space,       and Technology does not waive any future jurisdictional claim       over the subject matters contained in the bill which fall       within its Rule X jurisdiction. I request that you urge the       Speaker to name members of this committee to any conference       committee which is named to consider such provisions.

Our Committee recognizes the importance of H.R. 5515 and       the need for the legislation to move expeditiously.

This, of course, is conditional on our mutual understanding       that nothing in this legislation or my decision to forego a       sequential referral waives, reduces or otherwise affects the       jurisdiction of the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure, and that a copy of this letter and your       response acknowledging our jurisdictional interest will be       included in the Committee Report and as part of the       Congressional Record during consideration of this bill by the       House.        The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure also       asks that you support our request to be conferees on the       provisions over which we have jurisdiction during any House-      Senate conference.

In the interest of permitting your committee to proceed       expeditiously to floor consideration of this important bill,       I am willing to waive this committee's right to sequential       referral.

I request that you urge the Speaker to name       members of this committee to any conference committee which       is named to consider such provisions.        Please place this letter into the committee report on H.R.       5515 and into the Congressional Record during consideration       of the measure on the House floor. Thank you for the       cooperative spirit in which you have worked regarding this       matter and others between our respective committees.

Hon. William M. ``Mac'' Thornberry,      Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Thornberry, I write with respect to H.R.       5515, the ``National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal       Year 2019.'' As a result of your having consulted with us on       provisions within H.R. 5515 that fall within the Rule X       jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary, I forego any       further consideration of this bill so that it may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor for consideration.        The Judiciary Committee takes this action with our mutual       understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 5515 at       this time,  [[Page H4378]]       we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject matter       contained in this or similar legislation and that our       committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as       this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may       address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our       committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate       conference involving this or similar legislation and asks       that you support any such request.        I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming       this understanding with respect to H.R. 5515 and would ask       that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be       included your committee report and in the Congressional       Record during floor consideration of H.R. 5515.            Sincerely,                                                     Bob Goodlatte,                                                          Chairman.                                   ____                                                                             House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Armed Services,                                       Washington, DC, May 14, 2018.      Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R.       5515, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year       2019. I agree that the Committee on the Judiciary has valid       jurisdictional claims to certain provisions in this important       legislation, and I am most appreciative of your decision not       to request a referral in the interest of expediting       consideration of the bill. I agree that by foregoing a       sequential referral, the Committee on the Judiciary is not       waiving its jurisdiction. Further, this exchange of letters       will be included in the committee report on the bill.            Sincerely,                                     William M. ``Mac'' Thornberry,                                                          Chairman.                                   ____                                                                             House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                       Washington, DC, May 10, 2018.      Hon. William M. ``Mac'' Thornberry,      Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Thornberry: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       5515, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year       2019. There are certain provisions in this legislation which       fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on       Homeland Security.        In the interest of permitting your committee to proceed       expeditiously to floor consideration of this important bill,       I am willing to waive this committee's right to sequential       referral. However, I do so with the understanding that by       waiving consideration of the bill, the Committee on Homeland       Security does not waive any future jurisdictional claim over       the subject matters contained in the bill which fall within       its Rule X jurisdiction. I request that you urge the Speaker       to name members of this committee to any conference committee       which is named to consider such provisions.        Please place this letter into the committee report on H.R.       5515 and into the Congressional Record during consideration       of the measure on the House floor. Thank you for the       cooperative spirit in which you and your staff have worked       regarding this matter and others between our respective       committees.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,                                                          Chairman.                                   ____                                                                             House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Armed Services,                                       Washington, DC, May 14, 2018.      Hon. Michael T. McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R.       5515, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year       2019. I agree that the Committee on Homeland Security has       valid jurisdictional claims to certain provisions in this       important legislation, and I am most appreciative of your       decision not to request a referral in the interest of       expediting consideration of the bill. I agree that by       foregoing a sequential referral, the Committee on Homeland       Security is not waiving its jurisdiction. Further, this       exchange of letters will be included in the committee report       on the bill.            Sincerely,                                     William M. ``Mac'' Thornberry,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, there is widespread, bipartisan support for efforts to  expand the number of small businesses that do business with the  Department of Defense. I particularly want to thank Chairman Chabot and  Ranking Member Velazquez of the Small Business Committee for their  partnership in working toward that goal.   Unfortunately, I believe that a number of small businesses that may  receive some initial funding to do business with the Department of  Defense and develop their technologies have found that they do not  continue to do business with the Department of Defense or their  technologies are not taken up into a program of record so that it is a  temporary, one-time infusion of cash which does not fully accomplish  the goals that so many of us want to achieve.   This amendment requires the Department of Defense to set up a  database of small business innovators, specifically those who receive  grants through the Small Business Innovation Research program and the  Small Business Technology Transfer program, so that we can track these  businesses and see: Do their technologies get taken up in a program of  record? Do these small businesses do further business with the  Department of Defense? I think that is in doubt, but we won't know  until we have this database.   That is the purpose of this amendment. I recommend its adoption, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I would just say the gentleman is right. I  don't mean to say that inclusion in a formal program of record is the  only measure of success. I just think we need to track this to see: Do  those small businesses continue to do business with the Department of  Defense? Are their technologies taken up or not? That is the goal here.   Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentleman, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes.   Mr. Chair, I was interested to hear the gentleman's reasoning behind  his amendment. Just to clarify for all Members, the overseas  contingency account existed before the Budget Control Act existed. The  reason it was created was because we live in a volatile, dynamic world,  and there needed to be some accounting mechanism that would be  responsive to particular kinds of conflicts so that, if we needed more  people, more weapons to be successful, for example, fighting a  terrorist in a particular location, you would have that flexibility.  But those funds are authorized and appropriated just like every other  part of the defense budget is. So the assertion that one sometimes  reads that these are slush funds that can be spent as wanted by the  Pentagon is, of course, absolutely not true.    Mr. Chairman, it is true that our forces are engaged in more  countries  [[Page H4558]]  where there are conflicts going on--not that we are in all of those  conflicts, but we are engaged with local militaries in more countries  than we had been in the past. Part of the reason is because the  terrorism problem has spread to more countries than it has in the past,  and most of us think that it is better to engage terrorists over there  rather than just stick our heads in the sand and wait for them to come  attack us over here. So that has been part of what has happened, at  least in the past 17 years, as we try to prevent terrorist attacks here  at home.   I have to say thanks to our military and intelligence community and  law enforcement, they have been remarkably successful.   I would just say, finally, Mr. Chairman, as I mentioned before, 15-- one, five--15 percent of the Federal budget is spent to defend this  country. The rest, 85 percent is spent on other things. When John  Kennedy was President, it was 50 percent of the Federal budget that was  spent defending the country. As Secretary Mattis says: I think we can  afford survival.   So I understand the sentiment that we wish all of this conflict would  go away and the world would just be a peaceful place. It hasn't quite  happened yet, and until it does, it is important for the United States  to be strong, to keep terrorists engaged overseas rather than here, and  that is exactly what the overseas contingency account tries to help  accomplish.   Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Washington (Mr. Smith), the ranking member of the Armed Services  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Lamborn) having assumed the chair, Mr. Johnson of Louisiana, Acting  Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union,  reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill  (H.R. 5515) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2019 for  military activities of the Department of Defense and for military  construction, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal  year, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, pursuant to House Resolution 905, I  offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chair, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Smucker).    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time on this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon).   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of  the bloc of amendments, and amendment 41, for the Department of Defense  to gather the data necessary to successfully extend the TRICARE Prime  healthcare benefit to Puerto Rico to meet the needs of our retired  military families on the same basis as in the mainland.    More than 200,000 Puerto Ricans have served in all branches to date,  and the VA has registered almost 100,000 veterans residing in Puerto  Rico, yet they face disparity in benefits. TRICARE treats Puerto Rico  as an overseas location, with fees and copays higher than what they  would be for Prime. Dependents of retired veterans in Puerto Rico  either get fewer benefits or pay more.   Puerto Rican veterans have fought, bled, and died side by side with  their comrades in arms from the whole Nation. The information required  through this amendment will support the decision to finally do justice  for our servicemembers and veterans.   Mr. Chair, I support this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    I also urge support for en bloc No. 1.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, pursuant to House Resolution 905, I  offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis).    Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers on this en  bloc package, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, pursuant to House Resolution 905, I  offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chairman, I have no requests for time. I urge  adoption of this en bloc package, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, pursuant to House Resolution 905, I  offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that amendment  No. 55 in House Report 115-698 be modified in the form I have placed at  the desk.  [[Page H4575]]     Mr. Chairman, I have no requests for time for this en  bloc package. I urge its adoption, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
