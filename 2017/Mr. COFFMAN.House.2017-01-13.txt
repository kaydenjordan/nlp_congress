 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 84.   If we look back at the origin of this 1947 law in the aftermath of  World War II, it was really written to require, I think at that time,  10 years of separation between anybody who had served in the military  and then serving as a Secretary of Defense. I think one of the core  reasons for that is the fact of would there, in fact, be a bias between  that military officer and their branch of service.   I think when we look at General Mattis and this waiver, that is  certainly not the case. He was the combat and commander for Joint  Forces Command when it was standing. The purpose of Joint Forces  Command was to integrate our military together in terms of jointness.  He was very successful at that. So that bias is not going to be there.   In the State of Colorado, he came out about a year ago to speak  before the University of Colorado Denver to our veterans' association.  I will never forget those young marines and soldiers who had served  under him in combat, those junior enlisted, and how they looked up to  him in a way I have never seen junior enlisted look up, in my time in  the Army and Marine Corps, to a flag officer in the same way.   So I think he is going to be such an extraordinary asset to the  national security of this country, and I am proud to rise in support of  S. 84.
