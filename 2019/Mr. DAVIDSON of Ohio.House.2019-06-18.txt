 Mr. Speaker, United States Ranger history  predates the Revolutionary War. However, June 19 marks the 77th  anniversary of Major William Darby formally organizing and activating  the 1st Ranger Battalion.   I rise today to honor the exceptional Americans who have volunteered  as Army Rangers, fully knowing the hazards of their chosen profession.  One of the greatest and most humbling honors of my life has been  serving our Nation in uniform, and particularly, serving in the Army  Ranger regiment.   The Army Ranger legacy is as old as the Republic, going back to  Francis Marion, to Daniel Boone, to great Americans like Command  Sergeant Major Douglas Greenway, and on to current Active Duty members.   It wasn't until after the Civil War--more than half a century without  military Ranger units--that the U.S. Army Rangers were officially born.  Seventy-five years ago, fighting on the bitter and bloody beaches of  Normandy, Rangers gained their motto: ``Rangers lead the way.''   Since Pointe du Hoc, Rangers have led the way, from the Japanese POW  camps, to theaters of war, including: Korea, Vietnam, Panama, Operation  Desert Storm, Somalia, Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi  Freedom, and the great war on terror.   Today, I honor the elite soldiers serving our country as U.S. Army  Rangers.  [[Page H4705]]                                ____________________
