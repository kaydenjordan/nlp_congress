 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, the Senate voted yesterday to reopen the  government. I am glad that cooler heads and bipartisan good will  prevailed before too much damage was done, but where do we go from  here?   The leadership of both Houses needs to negotiate appropriations caps  for the rest of this year and all of next year. We all need to do our  part to make sure this is done immediately. As a matter of fact, half  of that job is practically done. Our colleagues in the House have a  promise from the Speaker of the House to consider a Defense  appropriations bill at the spending level set by the most recent  National Defense Authorization Act. That amount is $700 billion and  represents an increase of $88.6 billion over last year's enacted  spending level--a welcome development. It would seem to make sense for  this body to adopt that figure in the Senate bill, and the job would be  halfway done. I hope our leaders will not wait until the week after  next to get us an agreement on domestic spending.   Let's not approach the next few days as if the battle lines are again  drawn. Rather than using the coming days to suit up for the next  showdown, perhaps we can work to strengthen the Senate so that it does  the governing that our Founders envisioned, the governing that the  statesmen who preceded us have protected. Americans do their jobs day  in and day out, and they expect the same hard work from their elected  representatives in Washington.   In this regard, I would like to call attention to an op-ed by radio  host Hugh Hewitt that was published online yesterday by the Washington  Post. It is titled ``How to end the Senate's astonishing  dysfunction''--a pretty graphic title for an op-ed. Mr. Hewitt warns  that the institution of the Senate is ``careening toward widespread  contempt, as happened to its Roman predecessor even before the emperors  turned it into a fancy advisory council.'' One might be inclined to  agree given the events of the past few days. Indeed, we have reached an  embarrassing low point where a government shutdown is wrongly used as a  bargaining chip for merely political gain. Mr. Hewitt concludes, ``It  would be best for both parties to head off change imposed from pressure  from the outside with change organically orchestrated from within by  those with care for the body and its original design.''   There are plenty of experts with ideas on how to create a more  efficient and more effective Senate. Those ideas should be welcomed  now. But those of us who took an oath in this Chamber and serve with  the great legacy of this institution cannot stay on the sidelines. We  occupy a unique position to drive reforms and to make the Senate  better, ensuring its existence and its success for the next generation.   There is real hope that these reforms have already begun. For  example, there has been support by both Democrats and Republicans to  change the procedural rules on executive and judicial nominations,  shortening postcloture debate from 30 hours to 8 hours. The Democratic- led Senate passed this rule on a temporary basis in 2013, with  bipartisan support. Our colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Lankford, has  a thoughtful proposal. He suggests that we permanently shorten  postcloture debate on executive and judicial nominations. I agree with  this proposal. The practice of confirming noncontroversial nominees is  a courtesy historically given without needless delay to whoever  occupies the Oval Office, to whomever the public has installed as  President, Democrat and Republican alike.   Delays are not only inconvenient as the new administration tries to  put its team in place, but more importantly,  [[Page S453]]  delays keep highly qualified individuals from serving the American  people--sometimes in positions affecting our national security or  delivering disaster response.   Like Mr. Hewitt, I believe we can do more to make the Senate work for  the American people with ``an overhaul of its rules'' that ``preserves  the rights of the minority in some cases . . . while also reflecting  the speed at which the world moves today.''   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the op-ed by Mr. Hewitt  be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                 [From the Washington Post, Jan. 22, 2018]              How To End the Senate's Astonishing Dysfunction                              (By Hugh Hewitt)         Remember Roscoe Conkling? Few people do even though for       many years the New Yorker was the ``first man'' in the Senate       and king of patronage.        How about Henry Cabot Lodge? ``Something about the League       of Nations?'' you ask, if you are going off your college days       or AP history prep. ``No, wait, Nixon's running mate!'' you       say, and head to Wikipedia to discover both fragments of       memory are right. The Lodges were a father-and-son team of       senators.        How about Robert Taft and Mike Mansfield? Lyndon Johnson       was preceded as Senate majority leader by the man known as       ``Mr. Republican'' and followed by the good and decent       Mansfield, who went on to be a good and decent ambassador to       Japan under Presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. (When       was the last time anyone thought of a senator as such a       statesman that he or she could serve as ambassador to a key       ally for more than a decade under presidents from both       parties?)        The point is that the Senate as an institution is--or was--      quite the work of genius, but its individual members, no       matter how famous in their day, fade into background       characters in presidential biographies. (And most       presidential biographies don't really get read all that       much.) Now the Senate itself is careening toward widespread       contempt, as happened to its Roman predecessor even before       the emperors turned it into a fancy advisory council.        Whether the decline began with the sliming of Robert Bork       or the segregationist filibusters of civil rights       legislation, the modern Senate has been on a downward spiral       for some time, and even current Senate majority leader Mitch       McConnell (R-Ky.), the Senate's most able leader of my       lifetime, isn't shrewd enough to reverse the trajectory in       the public's eyes. After another government shutdown,       President Trump and others are pushing hard to make the       apparently dysfunctional upper chamber a purely majoritarian       place. McConnell resists this, knowing that the rights of the       minority party are (or at least used to be) key impediments       on the country rushing into dangerous waters.        What the Senate needs is an overhaul of its rules, one that       preserves the rights of the minority in some cases--key       legislation, for example, and perhaps appointments to the       Supreme Court--while also reflecting the speed at which the       world moves today. Simple majorities on appropriations and       time limits on debate over minor nominees are two obvious       reforms. They could be traded for agreement on the high court       vacancies, formalizing the modern precedent established by       McConnell of no nominations in an election year but       consideration and votes on nominees from the year prior such       as Anthony M. Kennedy. The same deal could also include       changes to the ``Byrd Rule,'' which gives the Senate       parliamentarian broad sway over what is allowed under budget       reconciliation--an extraconstitutional expansion of the       parliamentarian's powers that makes sense only under a Cubist       understanding of how the Senate is supposed to operate.        Now, with the shock of the shutdown very palpable,       McConnell and his minority counterpart, Charles E. Schumer       (D-N.Y.), should empower a small group of widely liked and       respected members to fashion a package of reforms with the       only guarantee being that their work product receive an up-      or-down vote made effective by a simple majority.        The Senate's dysfunction is astonishing to Americans who       have to make things actually run and who have to do their       jobs to keep their jobs. Trump has shrewdly taken aim at the       Senate's vulnerability as an issue. It would be best for both       parties to head off change imposed from pressure from the       outside with change organically orchestrated from within by       those with care for the body and its original design.     Mr. President, we can do more to streamline nominations,  and we can do more to prevent the next budget stand-off.   I want to remind my colleagues of the bipartisan work that has been  done by Senate Appropriations members--Republican and Democratic--in  just the past year. Eight of the twelve annual appropriations bills  passed out of committee last year. Most passed unanimously, with  unanimous votes from Republicans and Democrats in the full  Appropriations Committee. The remaining four were released as  chairman's marks.   Let me recount the work that was done last year.   On July 13, 2017, the full Appropriations Committee, on a bipartisan  basis, unanimously approved the fiscal year 2018 Military Construction  and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies appropriations bill. The vote  was 31 to 0.   On July 20, 2017, the committee unanimously--again by a vote of 31 to  0--approved the fiscal year 2018 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food  and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies appropriations bill.   Also on July 20, the committee approved the fiscal year 2018 Energy  and Water Development appropriations bill by a vote of 30 to 1--still  an overwhelming bipartisan vote on the part of the Appropriations  Committee.   On July 27, 2017, the Appropriations Committee unanimously, by a vote  of 31 to 0, approved the fiscal year 2018 Transportation, Housing and  Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act.   Also on July 27, the Appropriations Committee approved the fiscal  year 2018 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies  Appropriations Act. That was by a vote of 30 to 1--overwhelmingly  bipartisan.   On the same day, July 27, the committee unanimously approved the  fiscal year 2018 Legislative Branch appropriations bill.   I could go on and on. Two more:   In 2017, the full Appropriations Committee approved the Labor, Health  and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies appropriations  Bill. The vote then was a little closer--29 to 2--but still  overwhelmingly bipartisan by a pretty evenly divided Appropriations  Committee.   On September 7--well before the end of the fiscal year--the Senate  Appropriations Committee unanimously approved the 2018 Department of  State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs appropriations bill.   All of these bills and then four chairman's marks have been available  to this Senate for consideration, and not a single one of them has been  brought to the floor. What would be the reason for that? I think  Members of the majority would say it is because we couldn't get 60  votes for cloture on a motion to proceed, and realizing that we  couldn't get the 60 votes, we decided not to burn the time that we  needed for other considerations, such as nominations or tax reform or  other legislation that had a chance. Members of the minority party  would probably say we couldn't get to a realistic caps agreement for  domestic spending and for defense spending, and so there was no point  in doing that, so we wouldn't agree to the 60 votes. But for whatever  reason, citizens should know and Members should know that the  Appropriations Committee did its work, and they had bills within the  caps available to them, that were available for consideration. Yet, for  whatever reason, they were not allowed to come to the floor for a vote.   Shouldn't we make a commitment to at least bring one bill or at least  a minibus, combining three bills, to the floor and see if Members can  work their will during this calendar year of 2018?   Annual appropriations bills should be passed in committee and then  should come to the floor for a vote. This is how the spending process  ought to work. We can do that more easily with a budget deal. We can do  it with a bipartisan agreement on spending caps, which is the next big  item to be negotiated. We need to eliminate sequestration, and we need  to agree to defense and domestic spending levels. As I say, the work is  already halfway done for us. A parade of weeks- or months-long  continuing resolutions is not how we should be funding the government,  and we have a resounding agreement to that statement from Members on  both sides of the aisle.   The government shutdown this week was unfortunate, but it does not  mean we have to continue the Senate's ``downward spiral,'' as Mr.  Hewitt describes. We now have an opportunity for reform and for  reflection about how we want to shape the future of this institution. I  hope my colleagues, with the support of majority and minority Members,  will seize this opportunity to enact positive change.  [[Page S454]]    Mr. President, I yield the floor.
