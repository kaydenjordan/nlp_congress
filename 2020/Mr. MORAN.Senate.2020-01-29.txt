 Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I submit to the desk a  question on my behalf and on behalf of Senator Cornyn.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question from Senator Moran and Senator Cornyn  is for counsel to the President:         Is it true that in these proceedings that the Chief Justice       can rule on the issue of productions of exhibits and the       testimony of witnesses over the objection of either the       managers or the President's counsel? Would a determination       by the Chief Justice be subject to judicial review?    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, thank you for the  question, and let me answer it this way--lay out my understanding of  the process.   If we were going to start talking about subpoenaing witnesses,  subpoenaing documents, having things come into evidence that way, the  first question would be subpoenas would have to be issued to the  witnesses or for the documents, and if those subpoenas were resisted on  the grounds of some privilege or immunity, then that would have to be  sorted out because if the President asserted, for example, the immunity  of a senior adviser to the President or an executive privilege over  certain documents, then the Senate would have to determine whether it  was going to fight that assertion and how--through some accommodation  process and negotiation--or if the Senate were going to go to court to  litigate that. And that whole process would have to play out. That  would be the first stage, and that would have to be gone through  anytime the President resisted the subpoena on the witnesses or  documents. That would take a while.   That is what the House managers decided not to do in the House of  Representatives.   Then, once there had been everything resolved on a subpoena, or  something like that, it sounds like the question asks further, in terms  of questions here in the trial, of admissibility of particular  evidence. It is my understanding, then, that the Presiding Officer--the  Chief Justice--could make an initial determination if there were  objections to admission of evidence, but that all such determinations  can be challenged by the Members of the Senate and would be subject to  a vote.   So it would not be--I think there were some suggestions earlier--that  we don't need any other courts; we don't need anything involved with  anyone else because the Chief Justice is here.   That is not correct. On the subpoenas at the front end, that is not  going to be something that is determined just--with all respect, sir-- just by the Chief Justice. That is something that would have to be  sorted out at the courts or by negotiation with the executive branch.   Then, once we are here on specific evidentiary objections, if we have  a witness and there are objections during depositions that have to be  resolved, or by a witness on the stand, if there are objections to  particular documents--authentication or things like that--the Chief  Justice could make an initial ruling, but every one of those rulings  could be appealed to this body to vote by a majority vote on whether  the evidence would come in or not.   And you might have to consider rules, whether you are going to have  the Federal Rules of Evidence apply or some modified rules of evidence,  and all of that would have to be sorted out.   I don't think that we would get to the stage, then, of any  determinations in evidence here being in any way appealed out to the  courts, but that would be a process that this body would have to decide  what would be admissible in evidence in the trial.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Minnesota.
