 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  the YWCA USA as they celebrate their 160th anniversary.   With a mission that is dedicated to eliminating racism, empowering  women, and promoting peace, justice, freedom, and dignity for all, the  YWCA is exactly the kind of organization we need today. It provides  leadership development programs for young women in topics ranging from  economic empowerment to engaging young girls in STEM fields.   From its humble beginnings, the YWCA now operates 1,300 program sites  across 47 States and the District of Columbia, serving over 2 million  women, girls, and their families. It has been at the forefront of  social progress, from civil rights to voting rights, to equal pay, to  healthcare reform.   It is currently the largest network of providers to help victims of  domestic violence or sexual assault. In my district, the YWCA in San  Gabriel Valley serves nearly 4,000 people, annually, through its  domestic violence program called WINGS.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the YWCA for 160 years of great work.                            ____________________
