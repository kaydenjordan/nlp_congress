 Mr. Speaker, let me thank the chairman of the  Judiciary Committee, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte), for  all that he has done to advance immigration reform during this  Congress.   I do support H.R. 4760, Securing America's Future Act. This  legislation ensures that our immigration policies put the interests of  Americans first.   We need to thank not only Chairman Goodlatte, but others who have put  so much time and effort into this legislation. We appreciate Mr.  Goodlatte's diligence, expertise, and commitment to improving our  immigration system.   Any immigration reform considered by Congress must, at a minimum,  secure our borders, implement workforce verification to end the illegal  jobs magnet, reduce chain migration, bolster interior enforcement, and  prevent abuse of our asylum laws. Securing America's Future Act  includes all of these necessary provisions.   The bill delivers on the President's pledge to voters to complete  physical barriers along our southern border, penalize lawless sanctuary  cities, and end the Obama administration's catch-and-release policy  that returns dangerous criminal immigrants to our streets to prey on  innocent Americans.   Of special interest to me is the inclusion of the Legal Workforce Act  in the bill, which requires all new employees' work eligibility to be  verified. This will reduce illegal immigration and save jobs for  American workers.   Also important is the deadline to finally implement an entry-exit  tracking system to identify visa overstayers. They comprise half of the  almost 1 million new illegal immigrants every year.   Securing America's Future Act helps keep our communities safe and  protects American workers. It deserves our enthusiastic support.   Madam Speaker, again I want to thank Chairman Goodlatte for offering  this legislation.
