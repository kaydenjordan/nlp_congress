 Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate is at the point  we are this morning. Last night, we agreed to proceed to consideration  of H.J. Res. 44, which will overturn the Bureau of Land Management's  Planning 2.0 Rule. The House has considered this already. They passed  this resolution on a strong bipartisan basis. It was a 48-vote margin.  They did this just before the February recess, and so it is now in  front of the Senate.   As the sponsor of the Senate version, I have come to the floor now to  explain to colleagues why this BLM Planning 2.0 Rule is such a bad rule  and to urge its nullification.   There are probably a lot of folks that are asking the question: BLM  Planning 2.0, what is it? It is not just folks that are listening, it  is colleagues here. What exactly is Planning 2.0 and what exactly does  Planning 2.0 do? A lot of people are saying: I never heard of this one.  Where did it come from? Based on that, I think a lot of context is in  order as we begin this debate.   The Bureau of Land Management is a Federal agency that manages 245  million acres of land in 12 Western States, along with 700 million  acres of Federal and non-Federal subsurface estate.   Congress has directed the BLM to manage those lands according to the  Federal Land Policy and Management Act. That is too long to say. So we  just refer to it as FLPMA. It serves as the agency's organic act. It  mandates a multiple-use mission for BLM lands. I think it is important  to always remember that. BLM is required to manage under the concept of  multiple use. It lays out a planning process for its mission. It  establishes a special status relationship between the Federal  Government and the States and the local governments that are affected  by the agency's resource management plans.    I think it is important, as we are focusing on the BLM right now,  that we remember that BLM lands are not national parks or wildlife  refuges. They are not wild and scenic rivers or wilderness. BLM lands  are working lands. They are valuable--not because they might contain a  Mount Denali, like up north, or the Grand Canyon--but rather because  these lands contain energy and minerals and they can be used. Again,  this is the multiple-use concept. They can be used for grazing. They  can be used for recreation and many other purposes.   They are valuable in this way and as such are a leading source of  good jobs for families and communities all across the West. BLM's  management of western lands has never been without controversy. That is  part of the reason that the last administration decided to overhaul the  regulations that guide the planning process. The stated goals from the  administration were to create a better process that would increase  transparency, increase public involvement, and reduce the amount of  time it takes to develop a resource management plan.   So those clearly all sound like good ideas, good goals.  Unfortunately, the reason we are here today seeking to overturn this  planning 2.0 rule is that  [[Page S1610]]  the BLM absolutely failed to achieve any of those three goals. Instead  of greater transparency, BLM delivered a new process that ensures less  transparency. Instead of expanding public participation, Western States  are looking at fewer and weaker opportunities to influence the  management of local lands.   Planning 2.0 also turns the relationship between federal, state, and  the local governments on its head. It just really turns it upside down.  What actually happens then is that it has effectively subverted FLPMA,  shattering the special status arrangement that the West is supposed to  have under the Federal law.   As a Senator for the State of Alaska when this rule came out, I  looked critically at it and I have problems with many aspects of the  rule. I know I am joined by nearly all of my western colleagues and  many who are not from the West but who have taken the time to  understand how our land management laws are supposed to work and who  have looked critically at this rule.   The more my staff and I have unpacked the Planning 2.0 Rule, the less  we like it and the greater is our conviction that this rule should be  overturned through the Congressional Review Act. That is why we are  here. I could go on for quite some time, but for purposes of this  statement, I will list this morning my four main criticisms, all of  which compound each other and show why this rule must be repealed.   First of all, Planning 2.0 seeks to transition to a landscape-level  approach for land management planning. It is not a bad concept on its  own, really. I don't have any problem with BLM determining, for  instance, where our solar resources are located, but to make that a  defining measure and to make that a defining feature of a resource  management plan is a bad idea.   It all but assures that new and revised plans will not have the level  of detail or specificity that is needed to properly manage our local  resources. It allows for planning areas to cross State lines without  regard to the competing priorities of neighboring Governors. It does  not ensure that existing State and local plans will be consistent. It  is very obvious that BLM will deploy it as a mechanism to reduce or  perhaps to eliminate many reasonable uses of Federal land that provide  jobs and support communities all across the West.   The second criticism I have is that Planning 2.0 allows BLM officials  to remove the decisionmaking authority from our field offices and our  State directors, and it tends to centralize that power at BLM  headquarters. So for those of us in the West, we are looking at a  situation where effectively the management decisions of our land are  being taken from those who are on the ground, people who really  understand the conditions and are those who are most impacted by it. It  shifts it back East to be decided by those who don't have that same  local understanding, who might not really have any understanding as to  the areas and why this is so important.   So centralizing power at BLM headquarters, in my view, is never the  right direction. I am not suggesting that this is going to happen every  time with every decision. However it could happen at any time, whenever  a future administration decides that a decision needs to be made at the  headquarters level rather than locally. So now, at a moment's notice-- perhaps without even any notice at all--decisionmaking authority can be  taken away from a Western State with expertise and effectively siloed  here in Washington, DC. That is not the direction to be taken.   The third area of concern I have is that Planning 2.0 reduces the  ability of western stakeholders to provide input into the land  management process, as well as their stature within it. So, again, it  compounds the fact that you are shifting decisionmaking authority back  here to the East. By further limiting stakeholders' input, that is very  problematic.   Now, the agency has talked a good game about public participation.  But if you read the rule, what it effectively does is just kind of  front-load public input while cutting later opportunities for feedback.  If left in place, Planning 2.0 would ensure BLM would be able to  maximize its decisionmaking power while at the same time effectively  sidelining input from Western States.   We previously were in a situation where western stakeholders had a  seat on the stage before this rule, but under it they are really  demoted. They are effectively demoted to a middle row in the mezzanine  as part of a bigger crowd, but with no special status. I think it is  important to keep that in context.   The fourth area of concern is that BLM 2.0 weakens and eliminates the  requirements in FLPMA that require BLM to coordinate planning and  resource uses with our States and local governments. Under this rule,  BLM shifts the burden for making sure that resource management plans  are consistent with State and local governments plans away from itself  and onto the States and onto the local governments. That is not right.   The agency is also limiting the opportunities that those government  have to identify and remedy deficiencies within and across plans  wherever they may be found.   So here are a couple of examples this morning for the Senate, just to  illustrate why so many of us are concerned about this and are opposed  to Planning 2.0. You have to ask yourself: Is it fair and is it really  what Congress intended, for a western stakeholder to have the same  voice and influence over the management of their local lands as any  other member of the general public from anywhere else, with no  connection, no relationship to these areas?   To be more specific, should a small placer miner in Chicken, Alaska,  or a cattle grazer in Nevada be relegated to the same status as a  lawyer in, say, Vermont who has never visited either Chicken, Alaska,  or rural Nevada? My answer to this is pretty easy. It is a simple no.  But that is what awaits us under Planning 2.0.   So here is a real world example of what Planning 2.0 will mean on the  ground. Last year, the BLM finalized a resource management plan for 6.5  million acres of eastern Interior Alaska. Much of that plan was  developed in accordance with the principles of Planning 2.0. So what  does it actually look like for us up there in Alaska, in the eastern  Interior area?   The plan closes nearly three-quarters of the 40-mile district, where  the only economic activity, really, is placer mining--small placer  mining. They closed it to mineral entry. More than 1 million acres are  withdrawn into what they call ``areas of critical environmental  concern''. This is a land management tool that BLM has used more and  more in recent years to sidestep Congress's sole authority to designate  Federal wilderness.   So the agency sought public comment, but it was limited public  comment. Then it effectively ignored the comments that it did receive.  Ultimately, very few Alaskans were able to participate in the  development of the plan, and even fewer Alaskans are happy with the  final outcome of the plan. As we expected and as we feared, the  Planning 2.0 process was used to shut down a reasonable use of Federal  land that the last administration just did not like. This was done even  though it enjoys overwhelming support among local residents who really  depend on it for their livelihood.   The Planning 2.0 process was also used to close off Federal lands to  the public in violation of the ``no more'' clauses within ANILCA, or  the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, even though there  was no imminent threat or reason to do so. So, as colleagues are  considering how they will cast their vote on this resolution of  disapproval, I am sure, again, that many had not really focused on this  Planning 2.0 before. Most of them would never be able to find Chicken,  Alaska, on a map, and they are thinking: This is not going to impact  me. I am not from the West.   But for those of us in the West, if you live in one of the 12 Western  States that have BLM land, believe me, you are impacted. I would  suggest that what we are seeing, starting in Alaska, is something that  simply won't stay up there. If this rule is allowed to remain in place,  you will see that move through all of our Western States.   BLM maintains and periodically revises dozens of resource management  plans in its 12 Western states. So if Planning 2.0 stays on the books,  I think what it will do is it will harm our Nation's energy producers.  I think it will harm our mineral developers. I think it will harm those  who rely on  [[Page S1611]]  Federal lands for grazing. It will most certainly cost us jobs. It will  cost us economic opportunity, and it will hurt the communities and the  people of our Western States.   I would ask that you don't just take my word for this. Six counties  from six different States have challenged this rule as impairing the  informational and coordination rights of local governments. They  believe that it violates FLPMA and that BLM has failed to properly  evaluate the impact that it will have. I think they have a very strong  case. This is a fatally flawed rule. Our best option is to overturn it  while we have the ability to do so under the Congressional Review Act  and to hold BLM accountable to the underlying statute and its multiple- use mission. If we can agree to do that today, we can then work with  our new Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, to make genuine  improvements to the BLM land management planning process. I know that  Secretary Zinke cares about our public lands. He understands these  issues, and I think he is dedicated to ensuring that we get this right.    I would like to close by thanking the roughly 80 stakeholder groups  that are supporting our disapproval resolution. I also thank the 17  Senators who are cosponsoring the Senate version of it. I thank the new  administration, which has released a statement of policy in support of  it. I also acknowledge and thank Representative Cheney and Chairman  Bishop in the House, who led the resolution through the House with good  bipartisan support a couple of weeks back.   It is now the Senate's turn to act on this. It is our turn to  recognize why this rule deserves to be overturned. For the good of our  Western States, let's send this disapproval resolution to the  President's desk.   With that, I again urge the Senate to support House Joint Resolution  44.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 3:45  p.m. today, there be 15 minutes of debate remaining on H.J. Res. 44,  equally divided in the usual form.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship be discharged from  further consideration of S. 416 and the bill be referred to the  Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.    Mr. President, we are coming to the end of debate on  the disapproval resolution for the BLM Planning 2.0 Rule. I would like  to take just a few minutes to highlight the very broad support it has  drawn here on Capitol Hill but really across the country.   Here in the Senate, I mentioned earlier that there is a total of 17  Members who have joined me in sponsoring our version of this  resolution. That is nearly one-fifth of this Chamber. It includes every  Republican from a Western State with BLM lands within its borders.  These are Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Nebraska, Utah, Wyoming, Colorado,  Nevada, Montana, even Kentucky, and the State of the occupant of the  Chair, North Dakota, and Oklahoma, so a very strong contingent of  Members who are in support of this disapproval resolution.   Across the Capitol, the House of Representatives passed this  resolution with bipartisan support a couple of weeks ago through the  leadership of Representative Cheney of Wyoming. This resolution wound  up with 234 votes in the House. That is a pretty strong vote.   The reason why so many Members of the House and the Senate want to  overturn BLM's planning 2.0 Rule is pretty simple. We know what it  means for our Western States. We don't like the impacts that it will  have and neither do a wide variety of elected officials and  stakeholders back home.   In my State of Alaska, I have heard from the Alaska Municipal League,  the Alaska Farm Bureau, and the Associated General Contractors of  Alaska. The Greater Fairbanks Chamber of Commerce wrote to ask us to  overturn the rule. The Alaska Chamber wrote in support of our  resolution because they said BLM's planning process ``has grown to be  substantially lengthier, more confusing, and burdensome for  stakeholders to engage in.''   We have heard from our leaders in the Alaska State Legislature, State  Senators Pete Kelly and John Coghill, who have asked for this rule to  be nullified, as have several of our Alaska Native corporations,  including CIRI, Olgoonik, and Calista Corporation. The Alaska chapter  of the Safari Club opposes it because its landscape-level approach to  land management planning has the potential to withdraw and lock up even  more land in Alaska.   Alaska's energy, mineral, and timber producers are united in their  opposition to this rule and in their support of our disapproval  resolution. We have heard from the Resource Development Council, the  Alaska Oil and Gas Association, the Alaska Forest Association, the  Council of Alaska Producers, the Alaska Support Industry Alliance, the  Fortymile Mining District, and the Alaska Miners Association, and they  all oppose BLM's planning 2.0 Rule because it reduces economic  opportunities for Alaskans--those who actually live near these BLM  lands, who know  [[Page S1624]]  the most about them, and who depend on them to provide for their  families.   It is the same story in many other Western States, from Arizona and  New Mexico to Washington and Oregon, to Montana and South Dakota. This  rule affects all 12 BLM States, and those States just are not happy  about it.   We have heard from about 80 groups so far that oppose that rule, and  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the list of supporters be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                         S.J. Res. 15/H.J. Res. 44                  Strong Support From Western Stakeholders                            National Stakeholders         American Energy Alliance, American Exploration and Mining       Association, American Farm Bureau Federation, American       Petroleum Institute, Americans for Prosperity, American Sheep       Industry Association, Association of National Grasslands,       Independent Petroleum Association of America, National       Association of Conservation Districts, National Association       of Counties, National Association of State Departments of       Agriculture, National Cattlemen's Beef Association, National       Mining Association, National Water Resources Association,       Public Lands Council, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Western       Energy Alliance.                              State Stakeholders         Associated General Contractors of Alaska, Alaska Chamber of       Commerce, Alaska Chapter, Safari Club International, Alaska       Farm Bureau, Inc., Alaska Forest Association, Alaska Miners       Association, Alaska Municipal League, Alaska Oil and Gas       Association, Alaska Support Industry Alliance, Alaska       Trucking Association, Calista Corporation, Cook Inlet Region,       Inc., Council of Alaska Producers, Fortymile Mining District,       Greater Fairbanks Chamber of Commerce, Members of the Alaska       State Senate, Olgoonik Corporation, Resource Development       Council.        Arizona Association of Counties, Arizona Cattle Growers       Association, Arizona County Supervisors Association, Arizona       Farm Bureau Federation, Arizona Mining Association,       California Cattlemen's Association, California Farm Bureau       Federation, California Wool Growers Association, Rural County       Representatives of California, Colorado Cattlemen's       Association, Colorado Farm Bureau, Colorado Wool Growers       Association, Idaho Cattle Association, Idaho Farm Bureau       Federation, Idaho Wool Growers Association, Montana       Association of Counties, Montana Association of State Grazing       Districts, Montana Electric Cooperatives' Association.        Montana Farm Bureau Federation, Montana Mining Association,       Montana Petroleum Association, Montana Public Lands Council,       Montana Stockgrowers Association, Montana Wool Growers       Association, Eureka County, Nevada, Nevada Association of       Conservation Districts, Nevada Association of Counties,       Nevada Cattlemen's Association, Nevada Farm Bureau       Federation, New Mexico Cattle Growers' Association, New       Mexico Farm and Livestock Bureau, New Mexico Wool Grower,       Inc, North Dakota Stockmen's Association, Association of       Oregon Counties, Oregon Association of Conservation       Districts, Oregon Cattlemen's Association.        Oregon Farm Bureau, South Dakota Cattlemen's Association,       South Dakota Public Lands Council, Utah Association of       Conservation Districts, Utah Association of Counties, Utah       Cattlemen's Association, Utah Farm Bureau Federation, Utah       Wool Growers Association, Washington Cattlemen's Association,       Washington Farm Bureau Federation, Western Interstate Region       of NACo, Governor Mead of Wyoming, Petroleum Association of       Wyoming, Wyoming Association of Conservation Districts,       Wyoming County Commissioners Association, Wyoming Farm       Bureau, Wyoming Stock Growers Association, Wyoming Wool       Growers Association.     This list includes our Nation's energy and mineral  producers, the people who keep our lights on, who provide fuel for our  vehicles, and who construct everything from semiconductors to  skyscrapers. The American Petroleum Institute, the Independent  Petroleum Association of America, the Western Energy Alliance, the  National Mining Association, and the American Exploration & Mining  Association are all opposed to this rule, and so are many State groups,  like the Arizona Mining Association, the Montana Electric Cooperatives'  Association, and the Petroleum Association of Wyoming.   Joining them are many of our Nation's farmers and ranchers, the  individuals who provide so much of our Nation's food supply, whether  that is steak or whether that is milk or something else. The National  Cattlemen's Beef Association and the American Sheep Industry  Association have registered their opposition. The American Farm Bureau  Federation opposes the rule and so do many of its State partners,  including the Colorado Farm Bureau, the New Mexico Farm & Livestock  Bureau, the Oregon Farm Bureau, and the Washington Farm Bureau.   Perhaps most critically, planning 2.0 has drawn strong opposition  from local and State governments, the entities that are elected to  represent all of the people, not just one specific interest. The  National Association of Counties, the voice of county governments all  across the country, sent a letter outlining their support for the  disapproval resolution. Another group, the National Association of  Conservation Districts, wrote that planning 2.0 should be repealed  because it ``skirts the Federal Land Policy and Management Act and  reduces the ability of local government involvement'' while seeming  ``forced and blind to the many issues raised in the public comment  period.''   Again, this disapproval resolution has drawn strong support from a  wide range of stakeholder groups--energy, mining, and grazing,  America's farmers and ranchers, State officials, local counties, and  conservation districts. Everything from the Alaska Trucking Association  to the Public Lands Council and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have all  weighed in. At last count, more than 80 groups had asked us to repeal  BLM's planning 2.0 Rule, and I am sure there are many others that are  not included in that count.   We have heard such strong support because this is a misguided rule  that will negatively impact our Western States. It subverts the special  status relationship between the Federal Government and the States and  local governments. It limits local involvement and local input. It  opens the door for decisionmaking authority to be centralized at BLM's  headquarters here in Washington, DC. It upends BLM's multiple-use  mission by allowing the agency to pick and choose among preferred uses,  while sidelining industries that provide good-paying jobs in our  western communities.   I think there is broad agreement that planning 2.0 should be  overturned. That is what we are here to do, and we will have that  opportunity in just a few moments.   So I ask all Members of the Senate, including those who do not have  BLM lands in their States, to consider the strong support this  resolution of disapproval has drawn and to join us in passing it at 4  o'clock.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
