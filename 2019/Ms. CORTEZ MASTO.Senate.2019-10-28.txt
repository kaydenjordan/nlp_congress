 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 961, as  provided for under the previous order, and I ask that it be reported by  number.    Mr. President, I rise to support this amendment,  which is an amendment that supports our Native-American communities who  face food insecurity.   The Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations, commonly known  as FDPIR, provides food assistance for 90,000 people in 276 Tribes  across this country. Often, on Tribal lands--and certainly in the rural  parts of my home State of Nevada--people live miles from a SNAP office  or a grocery store. So FDPIR provides a crucial source of nutrition.   But many enrollees in the program still have to pick up the FDPIR  benefits in person, and for elderly or disabled Tribal members, it is  too difficult to make that trip. So I urge my colleagues to vote for  this important amendment to study ways to improve access to the program  for the homebound and the elderly.   I thank my colleague and fellow member of the Indian Affairs  Committee, Senator Lankford, for his support on this important effort.  We want to ensure that no one is going hungry when there is food  waiting for them just a few miles away.   I thank the Senate leadership for allowing open debate and discussion  of the issue facing Indian Country on the floor of this Chamber.   I look forward to continued conversations on how to help members of  Tribes to thrive and to grow their communities and to chart a more  vibrant future.   Thank you.
