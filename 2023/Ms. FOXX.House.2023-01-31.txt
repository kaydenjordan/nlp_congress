 Mr. Speaker, throughout the course of our lives, we are  both blessed and fortunate to cross paths with and befriend individuals  who harbor a profound sense of dedication toward serving others and  their communities. To me and countless others, Virginia Smith of Stokes  County, North Carolina, is one of those people.   This year, she will retire as the chairwoman of the Stokes County  Republican Party, a position she has held since 2003.   To know Virginia is to know someone who lives and breathes the  meaning of possessing a servant's heart.  [[Page H514]]  From organizing events with her church to her civic involvement within  her community, wherever Virginia goes, you know that she is on a  mission to serve, and she will not be deterred in that mission.   Truly, she is a community-driven woman. I cannot overstate her rock- ribbed conservatism and how she has always espoused, promoted, and  shared both the values and principles upon which our constitutional  republic was founded.   The simple truth is that we need more Virginia Smiths in this world.    Her work as chairwoman and as a proud member of the Stokes County  community has helped lay a foundation upon which our future leaders,  the young men and women of today, can grow and thrive.   Mr. Speaker, as Virginia enters this new and exciting chapter of her  life, may she know that she has left an indelible mark upon the lives  of so many people, me included. I am confident she will continue to do  so.   May God continue to bless her and her family in the days ahead.                      Reasonable Raising of Debt Ceiling     Mr. Speaker, with $31.4 trillion in national debt, House  Republicans are committed to finding a solution that is reasonable,  sensible, and responsible regarding raising the debt ceiling.   President Biden would be irresponsible not to negotiate. We must  finally address Washington's reckless government spending if we want to  put America on a better fiscal path.   After 2 years of reckless deficit spending, the Biden administration  is refusing to negotiate with Republicans to protect taxpayers and  solve our Nation's debt crisis.   Democrats accelerated spending following the last massive debt limit  increase. After passing the largest debt limit increase in American  history, it took Democrats only a little over a year to max out the  Federal Government's credit card again.   Democrats outspent record-high revenue. Despite record-high revenues  from the Republican-passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Federal spending has  continued to balloon, increasing by $10 trillion over the last 2 years,  a record for a new President.   There is a bipartisan path forward. Instead of refusing to negotiate,  Democrats need to join Republicans in crafting a plan that protects  taxpayers. All eight major spending reforms since 1985 have been  attached to debt ceiling legislation.   We must be, again, as Republicans say, reasonable, sensible, and  responsible regarding raising the debt ceiling. We call on President  Biden and the Democrats to join us in this effort.                            ____________________
