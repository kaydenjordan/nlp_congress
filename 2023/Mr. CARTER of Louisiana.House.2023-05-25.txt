 Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge my  Republican colleagues to step up to the plate, come back to work, and  pay our Nation's bills.   Defaulting on our debt would be catastrophic. In my district alone,  this will kill some 6,700 jobs, jeopardize Social Security payments for  91,000 families, put health benefits at risk for 388,000 people, and  threaten the retirement savings of 99,100 people near retirement. This  is in my district alone.   Look around. House Republicans went home and dodged their  responsibilities, hurting everyday working people in the process. I  stand firmly united with my Democratic colleagues and the American  people to pay our debt without playing games with people's lives.   I urge the Republicans to put on their big boy pants and big girl  pants and come back to work. Do the right thing. Do the right thing for  the American people because the American people deserve better.   Let's do our jobs.                            ____________________
