 Mr. President, this week marks the 10th anniversary of the  end of Sri Lanka's decades-long civil war. On May 19, 2009, Sri Lanka's  26-year conflict between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, LTTE,  and the government of Sri Lanka came to a close with the LTTE's  military defeat and surrender. This anniversary comes on the heels of  the horrible Easter Sunday terrorist attacks on churches across Sri  Lanka for which we are still seeking answers and accountability from  ISIS and its affiliates on the island.   While the end of the war was a counterterrorism victory, we have  since learned the ugly cost of this effort. According to International  Crisis Group, in the final months of Sri Lanka's civil war, Sri Lankan  Government ``attacks on its own self-declared `no-fire zones' killed  tens of thousands of [Tamil] civilians . . . claims range from 7,000 to  147,000 dead.'' For several years, I have been calling for an  international, independent mechanism to investigate allegations of war  crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the Sri Lankan  conflict. I also remain concerned about recent violations of human  rights and religious freedom in that country.   Since the end of the war, there has yet to be real progress made on  reconciliation and accountability for Tamils through domestic  processes, as recommended by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights  2015 Investigation on Sri Lanka, OISL. Human rights violations against  Tamil, Christian, and Muslim minorities continue, and the Sri Lankan  Government has  [[Page S3048]]  failed to bring to justice the perpetrators of attacks against  journalists, religious, and ethnic minorities and opposition  politicians.   Sri Lanka has a long way to go on its path to reconciliation. In  addition to pursuing meaningful justice and accountability, the Sri  Lankan Government must implement comprehensive security sector reform,  fully operationalize the Office of Missing Persons to provide families  with answers on what happened to their loved ones, repeal the  controversial Prevention of Terrorism Act, PTA, release political  prisoners as called for by our own State Department and required by  fiscal year 2019 Appropriations bill and address the root causes of the  civil war and the government's responsibility to protect citizens of  all communities.   Concerns over intercommunal strife are exacerbated by the horrific  April 21 Easter attacks on churches and hotels across the island that  killed over 200 civilians. We are learning that ISIS-affiliated  entities were behind the attacks. As Sri Lanka deals with the very new  threat of Islamic extremism, it is critical that its government not  repeat its pattern of suppressing media, civil society, and religious  freedom under the veil of counterterrorism. The government's abuse of  emergency powers, recent ban on Muslim face-covers, coupled with  retaliatory attacks against mosques and Muslim businesses with little  response from Sri Lanka law enforcement is problematic and only serves  to heighten tensions between religious and ethnic communities. I urge  the Sri Lankan security forces to exercise restraint in their response  to the Easter attacks.   While horrific on their own, the Easter attacks were a stark reminder  that, as we come upon the 10th anniversary of the end of Sri Lanka's  civil war, intercommunal conflict remains a reality on the island. The  Sri Lankan Government's response to the Easter attacks echoes of the  country's history of conflict and oppression under cover of  counterterrorism. As we remember and commemorate the tens of thousands  of lives lost leading up to May 2009, I urge Sri Lanka, the United  States and the international community to continue to pursue justice,  accountability, and reconciliation for a war-torn nation.                            ____________________
