 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I am here to speak against an amendment included in this  rule, the Foxx-Davis amendment, in defense of the 2,300 factory workers  and 900 family farmers who grow sugar beets in my community.   The sugar program in this country supports family farmers. The  company that is formed is a co-op formed by local family-owned growers  who come together, and all they ask for is a fair chance to compete, to  grow their high quality product, and to not have to compete with state- subsidized foreign sugar that is dumped if we don't have a program that  protects our local growers.   The question is really simple. It comes down to marginally increasing  the profits of large corporations or supporting family farmers who  support their families by growing high quality sugar beets and  sugarcane in this country.   This is a program that does not cost the taxpayers a dime according  to CBO.   It comes down to a simple question: Are we going to support our own  growers, or are we going to support foreign-produced sugar and  moderately, if at all, increase the profits of large companies?    Mr. Chairman, I want to point out that the Republican  chairman of the committee and the Democratic ranking member of this  committee both oppose this amendment, for good reason.   It is a simple question: Do we want to support local growers like the  900 families that I represent who, collectively, through a co-op, own  their processing facility?   This notion of mega producers is really a story of 900 families that  collectively bound together in a co-op to own the production facility  to deal with the sugar that they, themselves, grow.   This is a question of local growers or foreign-subsidized sugar using  child labor. That is the simple question before us.
