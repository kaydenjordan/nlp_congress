 Madam Speaker, I rise to commemorate  National Nutrition Month.   Madam Speaker, there are serious challenges related to hunger and  food insecurity across eastern North Carolina and other parts of the  country, and we need to do all we can to feed hungry kids, seniors, and  our most vulnerable populations.   Recently, I spent time at Windsor Elementary School in Bertie County,  North Carolina, and spoke with Tiwana Smallwood, the school  nutritionist, who stressed the need for programs to improve nutrition  and reduce hunger.   Ms. Smallwood highlighted nutrition's vital role in our health and  healthcare systems, noting that some families and school systems across  the First Congressional District need help to make ends meet with  rapidly increasing prices.   Let me be clear, everyone deserves access to nutritious food to fuel  a healthy and prosperous life. I will work to ensure that is achievable  for school districts across America.   Madam Speaker, the options are clear. Supporting our citizens or  ignoring their health and well-being. I know where I stand, and that is  with supporting the health and well-being of eastern North Carolinians.                            ____________________
