 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1011, I call  up the bill (H.R. 184) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to  repeal the excise tax on medical devices, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the bill H.R. 184, currently  under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today, the House will vote on H.R. 184, the Protect  Medical Innovation Act, which will finally repeal the medical device  excise tax and eliminate a burden on patients and the companies that  create and produce lifesaving medical devices for people all over the  world.   The medical device industry is truly an American success story,  directly employing more than 400,000 people. In Minnesota alone, more  than 35,000 people are employed at almost 700 companies, mostly small  companies that you have never heard of. Many of them were started by a  doctor or an engineer or an entrepreneur in the garage or in the  backyard with an idea to improve or help save someone's life. In fact,  80  [[Page H7120]]  percent of all medical device companies have less than 50 employees,  and 93 percent have less than 500 employees. The jobs they provide are  good, rewarding jobs that pay above-average salaries.   Mr. Speaker, America is a net exporter in medical devices, one of the  other reasons why it is an American success story. But back in 2013,  the Affordable Care Act imposed a new 2.3 percent excise tax on all  medical devices.                                time  1600    Mr. Speaker, 2.3 percent may not sound like much, but it wasn't a tax  on profits; it was a tax on sales, on revenue. Usually the government  puts an excise tax on things we want to discourage, like tobacco,  alcohol, or gas-guzzling automobiles.   Why would we want to discourage medical innovation? Only in  Washington would you impose a tax on lifesaving medical devices and  then think you are going to help reduce healthcare costs.   Guess what? The device tax caused the loss of over 29,000 jobs. Now,  with strong bipartisan support, we have been able to eliminate this  onerous tax with suspensions. The last time we suspended this tax,  companies responded by hiring more engineers and more technicians and  putting more money into research and development projects for these  new, lifesaving technologies.   But these innovators need certainty. They need predictability. And a  permanent repeal is needed to especially help startup companies from  where the next generation of inventions and innovation will come.   Investors will hold back capital in new companies when there is a  threat of an excise tax starting back up because it already takes 8 to  10 years, Mr. Speaker, for these companies to become profitable in the  first place. This tax raises the bar and makes it even more difficult  for them to become profitable.   I have had many conversations with companies that I represent in my  community about what this excise tax means to them. I remember having a  conversation with a medium-sized company owner who said that without  this tax they would be able to have a few more projects online, which  meant they would hire two more engineers and two more technicians.  Other companies to which I have spoken said they would be able to  directly invest more in research and development, creating more high- paying jobs, invent better products. Ultimately, it is about helping  more patients.   The good news, Mr. Speaker, is there is strong recognition that we  need to eliminate this tax on a bipartisan basis, because it is such  bad policy. In fact, very few bills have such strong bipartisan  support: 277 cosponsors. Mr. Speaker, 44 of those cosponsors are  Democrats across the aisle.   I pledge that I will continue working with Senator Klobuchar in the  Senate across the aisle, and my colleagues, to get this over the finish  line, because there are very few issues that would unite an Elizabeth  Warren and a Ted Cruz, but this, Mr. Speaker, is one of them.   Mr. Speaker, I would encourage all Members to support this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Banks), someone who represents a State that is steeped in  medical technology jobs and has been a leader in championing the repeal  of this tax.     Mr. Speaker, contrary to some of the claims we heard a  little bit before about the bill doing nothing to help everyday,  average Americans, I will just remind Members that this bill reverses a  harmful tax that is hurting job growth and innovation across the  country.   Access to good-paying jobs and innovative medical products is  critically important, and I would argue that that is really important  for everyday Americans.   I would agree, also, with what was said earlier. Americans need  certainty. This is an industry that needs certainty if we are going to  be able to invest in new innovations, new inventions, to keep patients  at the forefront of lifesaving and life-improving technology, to make  sure their healthcare is the model of the rest of the world.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Utah (Mrs.  Love), who has been a strong voice for innovation, not only in her  State but within our conference here in the House of Representatives,  in repealing the device tax.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Utah.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for sharing his perspective from  California. I think of Minnesota and California and Massachusetts and  some other States that have a propensity of strong ecosystems of  medical technology, and those jobs, we know, are very, very important.  We want to see those continue.   I just want to mention, Mr. Speaker, what we don't want to go back  to, because these are the stories we were hearing prior to our  suspension, why we need to permanently repeal this tax.   I remember speaking to a company in Plymouth, Minnesota. They were  pretty clear. They said: Instead of 10 projects, we are only going to  have 6 projects funded with this tax in place. That means too few  engineers, too few technicians while that device tax was in effect.   I talked to another company that was actually in Texas. They had laid  off an employee that had been employed for 22 years, and then they had  laid off 25 people, deferring the hiring of another 15 employees  because of that tax being put in place.   Another medical company in Shoreview, Minnesota, told me they had to  borrow $100,000 a month from the bank just to pay the device tax  because the tax was on sales and revenue, not on profits. That is a  high-risk tragedy, Mr. Speaker, in order to keep these companies alive.   There is a company in New York that was trying to finance a new  cancer therapy using gamma radiation, and they struggled to raise the  necessary funds that were necessary to complete the project because the  medical device tax was discouraging investment in lifesaving  innovation.   And then, Mr. Speaker, I remember having a conversation with an  employee, someone from my district, and he came up to me and said: Mr.  Paulsen, I have been employed at this medical device company for 21  years, a strong medical device manufacturer, but because of the tax, I  have lost my job. Now his family struggled at his new job because his  wages were $40,000 less than where he was before he was laid off, all  because of that device tax. His vacation time was cut in half, and his  healthcare costs also went up.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  while we wait for one additional speaker.   Mr. Speaker, let me just remind folks where we are right now. Think  back to 2013, 2014 when this tax was first put in place. We heard  earlier from one of our colleagues who had said: Do you know what? The  medical device industry was a part of putting together the Affordable  Care Act, and they agreed to this.   Actually, that is a myth. It is not true. I have talked to numerous  medical device manufacturers, small, medium, and large, as well as the  associations, that said they had no part in agreeing to that. In fact,  when this dollar amount came up as a part of the Affordable Care Act,  they backed into it. There was some dollar amount assigned, and that is  how he backed into a 2.3 percent excise tax.   And, again, just a reminder, an excise tax is a tax on your sales and  revenue, not on your profits. For companies that take 8 to 10 years to  become profitable in the first place, that is a high hurdle when you  are trying to attract new capital, new investors in order to take the  risk that this new technology is going to be successful.   You have already got to go through the FDA. You have got to go  through a rigorous process, go through a gold standard, and then you  have to make sure that you are going to potentially have CMS offer a  reimbursement policy for your devices.   So there is a whole host of, or a multitude of, risk factors that go  in already when companies are thinking of starting up to actually be a  part of this strong ecosystem of providing medical technology and  lifesaving innovation that goes out to help our patients.   The good news is, if we keep this industry strong in America, if we  can repeal this tax permanently, we will not only be improving  healthcare outcomes around the world; we will be keeping those jobs  here. We will be keeping the headquarters here in the United States.   So it is not just some of the tax reforms you pass, Mr. Speaker. It  is about giving more certainty and more predictability by repealing a  tax that never should have been put in place in the first place.   And I think with strong bipartisan support, both on a vote today in  the House and potentially once again in the Senate--I think the last  time we had a vote leading up to President Obama signing a temporary  suspension of the device tax, we had enough votes in the House to  override a Presidential veto. That is what got the attention of the  Senate. That is what got the attention of the President at that time,  and we actually made it the law of the land, 2-year suspension. We  renewed another 2-year suspension.   But now is the time, Mr. Speaker, to actually make this permanent, to  put ourselves in a position to make this repeal permanent, to put  ourselves in a position where we can guarantee that American innovation  is going to be strong and steadfast for years and decades to come. We  can keep this American success story alive.   We have got a host of other challenges, I know, as we look towards  the medical device industry. We have a hearing going on right now on  trade,  [[Page H7123]]  for instance. We don't need to do anything else with potential tariffs  or quotas in different areas that put additional uncertainty on this  industry, on these high-paying, high-quality jobs. So this is one  initial effort that we can make today on the House floor, with a strong  bipartisan vote, to make sure a permanent repeal is also the law of the  land.   Mr. Speaker, I am looking around for my colleague from Indiana, who I  think is on the way right now.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                   Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Indiana (Mrs. Walorski), who has been a champion of not only repealing  this tax, but fighting hard for the medical device industry in her home  State.    Mr. Speaker, as I close, let me remind my colleague,  because he had mentioned eliminating the individual mandate as a part  of the tax reform that was enacted recently, according to the IRS, 79  percent of the 6.6 million people who paid the penalty in 2015 had  incomes below $50,000. These are middle class people.    I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts.    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, on the individual  mandate, 6.6 million people who paid the penalty had incomes below  $50,000. These are middle class people who had to pay the fine instead  of buying overpriced ObamaCare coverage that they could not afford.  Now, starting in 2019, they are not going to have to do that anymore.  Republicans think that is a good thing.    Let me close back on the bill, though, Mr. Speaker.   The good news is that both Republicans and Democrats here today agree  and understand that the medical device excise tax does more harm than  good, and it has to be repealed. We heard testimony and speakers today  on both sides of the aisle. We will have a strong, bipartisan vote to  repeal this tax permanently.   We have already had a suspension twice. But we need to give this  industry certainty so that we can make sure that this American success  story not only survives, but thrives.   It is about high-paying jobs with net exports around the world. This  makes sure that patients not only in the United States are going to  have access to new medical technology devices, for baby boomers,  seniors, and those getting up in their elder years with new devices.  This is really critical for the innovation that is going to help to  make sure that we are protecting patients around the world, keeping  headquarters here, keeping jobs here, and improving healthcare  outcomes.   Today, we have an opportunity to help. It is helping those small  startups that are part of the very ecosystem that has made this  industry so strong in the United States that provides these jobs, and  making sure that entrepreneurs, doctors, engineers, and folks who come  up with an idea in the backyard or in the garage can see their idea  come to fruition.   So let's remove this threat to innovation. Let's remove this job- killing tax once and for all. There are 277 cosponsors in the House.  How many bills actually get that many cosponsors of Democrats and  Republicans? Let's continue to show the American public that what we  are doing here in Washington on this issue is results oriented, is  solution oriented, and we are sensitive, and we understand that.   Mr. Speaker, I ask everyone to vote for the passage of H.R. 184, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
