 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, today we are voting on the nomination of  William Emanuel to serve on the National Labor Relations Board. The  NLRB may be one of the most important independent Federal agencies that  you have never heard of. They are responsible for protecting the lawful  rights of workers to come together and bargain with their bosses for  higher wages and better working conditions.   Starting a union is not an easy task. Often, it is a large  corporation against its own employees. The money and the ability to  threaten retaliation are heavily weighted on the corporate side.   For more than a century, many corporations fought unions tooth and  nail, hiring strikebreakers and union-busting thugs and, later on,  union-busting lawyers. So back in the 1930s, Congress established the  NLRB to act as a referee and to keep the playing field level so that  workers would have a chance to form a union if they wanted to.   President Trump picked William Emanuel to fill a vacancy on the NLRB.  Mr. Emanuel has over 40 years of experience practicing labor and  employment law. He has represented manufacturing companies, trade  associations, logistics companies, hospitals, and dozens of other giant  companies involved in labor disputes. He has represented big companies  like Nissan, FedEx, Rite Aid, Safeway and Uber. That is an impressive  resume. There is just one problem with it: In his more than four  decades of practice, he has never been on the side of the workers--not  once.   Every party to a dispute is entitled to legal representation, and Mr.  Emanuel has every right to spend his career representing corporations,  but a guy who has never even once represented workers should not serve  on the NLRB, period.   The NLRB is not the Department of Commerce. It is not the Chamber of  Commerce. It is not there to help pump up big corporations. No. When  Congress created the NLRB, it gave it a simple mission: encourage  collective bargaining. An individual who has spent his career working  for some of the country's most ruthless union-busting firms, fighting  off union efforts at every turn, has absolutely no business at the helm  of an agency whose job is to encourage collective bargaining. The deck  is already stacked against hard-working Americans.   For the last few decades, productivity has increased, corporations  and shareholders have gotten richer, but workers haven't shared in that  growth.  [[Page S5880]]  Hourly wages have been virtually flat for almost 35 years, and one  reason for this is the decline of unions. The impact is everywhere.   Inequality has risen in America. Why? According to the Economic  Policy Institute, the decline in unions accounts for about 20 percent  to 30 percent of the growth in income inequality over the past several  decades. When unions decline, all workers are hurt. For the more than  40 million non-union men working in the private sector, the loss of  unions over the past 30 years has been equivalent to an annual wage  loss of about $109 billion. It is no wonder that American families are  feeling the squeeze.   The decline of unions isn't an accident. It didn't happen on its own  or as the unexpected byproduct of some other event. No. Large  corporations have called on their Republican buddies in local, State,  and Federal governments, and they have launched a quiet but deadly  attack on unions. Twenty-eight States have passed laws banning the  collection of union dues from workers that the unions represent. The  only purpose of these laws is to starve the unions of resources and  make it harder for workers to join together and to stand up for  themselves.   The Supreme Court hasn't been kind to unions either, effectively  decimating the ability of home healthcare workers to join together in  2014. Now with a Republican-appointed majority on the Court, they are  poised to deal the knockout blow to public sector unions later this  term. And with the nomination of Mr. Emanuel, workers won't be able to  count on the NLRB, either.   As a candidate, President Trump promised American workers that under  a Trump Presidency, ``the American worker will finally have a president  who will protect them and fight for them.'' He also promised to ``drain  the swamp'' in Washington and fill his administration with those who  would work for working Americans--not for donors and not for special  interests.   When President Trump nominated Mr. Emanuel to serve at the highest  labor court in the land, he delivered another gut punch to working  people. In fact, Mr. Emanuel is the dream nominee for the donors and  special interests. Trade associations for the companies that make their  profits on the backs of low-wage workers immediately came out in  support of his candidacy. The National Restaurant Association, the  International Franchise Association, the National Retail Federation,  the Retail Industry Leaders Association, the National Right to Work  Committee, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce applauded President Trump's  pick with almost giddy enthusiasm and urged the Republican Senate to  quickly confirm him to the Board. Today, unless a few of my colleagues  on the other side of the aisle decide to stand up for workers, they  will get their wish.   We all know that Washington works great for the trade associations  and their armies of lobbyists and lawyers, but it delivers one punch  after another to the hard-working Americans who sent us to Washington  to work for them. If Congress isn't going to stand up for workers, the  very least we can do is give these workers a fighting chance to join  together and stand up for themselves.   It is the NLRB's job to make sure that employees can join unions if  they want to. That is the law. A man who has spent 40 years beating  back workers' efforts to form unions has no business on the Board. I  urge my colleagues to join me in opposing his nomination.    Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

CFPB Rule     Mr. President, Wells Fargo creates 3.5 million fake  accounts, charging customers fees and ruining credit scores. Equifax  lets hackers steal personal information on 143 million Americans,  putting nearly 60 percent of American adults at risk of identity theft.  What is the Republican Party's response? To take away your legal rights  to hold companies like Wells Fargo and Equifax accountable.   I know that sounds nuts, but it is true. Here is the issue. If you  have a checking account, a credit card, a private student loan, or any  other number of financial products, there is a good chance that you  have given up your right to go to court if this financial firm cheats  you. That is because millions of financial contracts include a forced  arbitration clause that says that, if you want to legally challenge  something your financial company did to you, you can't join with other  customers in court. You have to go to arbitration all by yourself.   Think about what that means in the real world. You wake up one  morning, and you find a mysterious $30 fee on your account statement.  You call the bank and say: Hey, I didn't agree to this. The bank tells  you: Go pound sand. So what are your options?   Well, if there is no forced arbitration clause in your contract, you  can join a class action lawsuit against the bank for free. Chances are  you are not the only customer who got hit with an unauthorized $30 fee.  A class action gives you a chance to get some of that money back, and,  just as importantly, the bank might actually have to cough up some real  money and think twice before hitting you and their other customers with  hidden fees again.   Think what happens if there is a forced arbitration clause. You can't  join with other customers in court. Your only option is to go out on  your own and file an arbitration claim, which will cost you $200 or  more just to get started. OK. Who is going to pay $200 to get back a  $30 fee? No one. And that is exactly what the banks are counting on.  They can get away with nickel-and-diming you forever.   Earlier this year, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau put a  stop to that. They issued a new rule that prohibits financial companies  from forcing you to give up your right to join in a class action. The  rule guarantees your right to join other customers in court and to hold  your bank accountable.   But Republicans in Congress are now coming after the rule. House  Republicans have already voted to reverse the rule, and now Senate  Republicans are gearing up to follow suit.   Make no mistake: Anyone who votes to reverse this rule is saying loud  and clear that they side with the banks over their own constituents,  because bank lobbyists are the only ones who are asking Congress to  reverse this rule. Every other organization--all of those that  represent actual human beings--want the rule to be saved.   Let me read from just a few. The Military Coalition, which represents  more than 5.5 million veterans and servicemembers, supports the CFPB  rule because ``our nation's veterans should not be deprived of the  constitutional rights and freedoms that they put their lives on the  line to protect, including the right to have their claims heard in a  trial.'' The Coalition says, ``The catastrophic consequences these  [forced arbitration] clauses pose for our all-voluntary military  fighting force's morale and our national security are vital reasons''  to preserve the rule.   The AARP, which represents nearly 40 million American seniors, says  that the CFPB rule should be preserved because it ``is a critical step  in restoring consumers' access to legal remedies  [[Page S6091]]  that have been undermined by the widespread use of forced arbitration  for many years.''   And the Main Street Alliance, which represents thousands of small  businesses, says the CFPB rule will help small businesses fight against  big financial firms that try to drive up their fees.   There it is: veterans, servicemembers, seniors, small businesses,  consumers--all lining up to support the CFPB rule. But that is not all.  Let Freedom Ring, which is an organization that proudly touts itself as  ``supporting the conservative agenda'' likes the CFPB rule too. They  say it is ``in keeping with our Framers' concerns that without  appropriate protections, civil proceedings can be used as a means to  oppress the powerless.''   That is the thing we have to understand. The effort to reverse the  CFPB rule isn't about promoting a conservative agenda, and it sure as  heck is not about promoting a working people's agenda. It is about  advancing the donors' agenda, the big money agenda. That is it, period.   It is amazing. Not even a decade ago, the banks sparked a financial  crisis that hurt millions of working families. And while the big banks  got a taxpayer bailout and are back to doling out multimillion-dollar  bonuses to their executives, a lot of working families are still  struggling to recover.   Yet, here in Congress, the Republican Party is still carrying water  for the big banks. The big banks say: Jump. The Republican Party asks:  How high? The big banks tell Congress to take away their customers'  rights to hold them accountable, and the Republican Party says: You  bet. The big banks say: Take away those rights right now--right on the  heels of Wells Fargo and Equifax sticking it to millions of customers.  The Republican Party, without an ounce of shame, says: Yes, sir, just  keep those donations coming.   The Republican Party will stop carrying water for the big banks only  if you demand it. There are a lot of dollars on the other side, but  your votes, your calls, your emails can make a real difference. Tell  your Senators to stand up to the big banks and vote no on this  resolution.                                  Healthcare    Mr. President, over the past several weeks, families all over this  country have raised their voices yet again. They have not given up, nor  have they been shouted down, and they have made it very clear where  they stand on the issue of healthcare.   The American people don't want tens of millions of people to lose  their healthcare coverage. They don't want to open the door to  insurance companies discriminating against people with preexisting  conditions or eliminating addiction coverage or denying care for people  with mental illness. They don't want to kick our grandmothers out of  nursing homes or tell the parents of babies born prematurely that they  are on their own to deal with a multimillion-dollar hospital bill. They  don't want the Republican healthcare repeal bills--not any of the bills  that have come before and not the latest version that was revealed this  morning that is still as rotten to the core as every bill that has come  before it.   Doctors and nurses don't want the Republican repeal. Neither do  hospitals and insurance companies and nursing homes and Governors and  State insurance commissioners.   But Senate Republicans plow ahead anyway. They are so desperate to  destroy the Affordable Care Act that they keep yelling about how our  healthcare system is in crisis, how it is imploding in front of our  very eyes, trying to convince everyone that we need to blow the whole  thing up in order to save it. But the thing is, while Republicans try  to manufacture an imaginary healthcare crisis to justify their cruel  repeal bill, there is a real crisis about to unfold--a crisis created  by the Republicans.   September 30 is the deadline for several healthcare provisions. If  Congress doesn't act this week, Federal programs that help children,  pregnant women, people in need of addiction treatment, veterans,  Medicare beneficiaries, and other populations will run out of funding  or just expire altogether. In many cases, Republicans and Democrats  have bills stacked up, just waiting to get a vote, the agreements all  hammered out. But instead of bringing those bills to the floor, the  Republican leadership is fixated on repealing health insurance  coverage. They insist on voting again on something that most of America  doesn't want while they ignore the work on healthcare that needs to get  done now. This is beyond stupid.   One of the most important programs that will be expiring is the  Children's Health Insurance Program, which provides coverage for 9  million low-income children and pregnant women across this country.  Senator Ted Kennedy and Senator Orrin Hatch wrote this legislation  together back in the 1990s. Today, that program works with Medicaid to  provide health insurance for one out of every three kids in this  country, including foster children and kids with special health needs.   Senator Hatch and Senator Wyden--a Republican and a Democrat--have a  bill ready to go to extend this program. Funding expires on September  30, but instead of holding a vote on that bill, Republicans want to  spend this week trying to squeeze reluctant Senators to support the  Graham-Cassidy bill, which contains permanent cuts to the Medicaid  Program.   Then there is the funding for community health centers, which provide  high-quality, integrated care. In Massachusetts, our community health  centers serve one in every seven residents. Our health centers are on  the frontlines of the opioid epidemic. They are working to eradicate  tuberculosis. They are improving nutritional health. They are taking  the stigma out of mental health treatments. And they save money,  promoting prevention and reducing the use of hospital emergency rooms.   Community health centers are a big part of what is working well in  healthcare today--more coverage at lower cost. They work, but they are  running out of time. Funding for community health centers runs out on  September 30. Last week, 70 U.S. Senators--including 24 Republicans-- signed a letter urging Congress to act to extend this funding. But  instead of extending these funds, the Senate Republican leaders say:  Too bad, we are too busy trying to knock millions of people out of  healthcare coverage.   Then there is the funding for medical training at a special type of  health center--teaching health centers. This program helps train  primary care doctors. Greater Lawrence Family Health Center in  Massachusetts was the very first community health center in the country  to have a residency program like this. Almost 80 percent of their  residents continue to work in underserved communities after they  graduate--areas that often have a shortage of primary care physicians.   Funding for this program also runs out on September 30. Senator  Collins and Senator Tester--a Republican and a Democrat--have a bill  ready to go to extend funding for teaching health centers. But instead  of holding a vote on that bill this week, Republicans have said: Sorry,  we are too busy trying to take away healthcare coverage from the many  people who walk through the doors of community health centers.   What else is at risk if Senate Republicans refuse to act before  September 30? A whole package of Medicare Programs, which help seniors  and people with disabilities access the care they need. In  Massachusetts, this includes the SHINE Program, which helps Medicare  beneficiaries pick the right health insurance plans.   Medicaid payments that go to hospitals treating large numbers of low- income patients are also going to run out.   Funds for the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting  Program, which funds home visits to new and expectant parents to help  give them the training they need and the help they need to keep a new  baby healthy and safe, will run out. Senators Grassley and Menendez--a  Republican and a Democrat--have a bipartisan bill ready to go. But  instead of voting to help those new babies and their families,  Republicans want us to vote on a bill to take away health insurance.   Let's not forget the bipartisan compromise that Senator Alexander and  Senator Murray--a Republican and a Democrat--were working on to lower  health insurance premiums. In order to keep insurance premiums down for  millions of insurance plans, the bill has to  [[Page S6092]]  pass this week. But Republicans walked away from the table because it  is more important to them to rip healthcare from millions of Americans  than to lower healthcare costs for hard-working families across this  country.   There is a whole list of concrete things that Republicans and  Democrats could be working on together to improve healthcare in this  country--healthcare for babies, for new moms, for seniors on Medicaid,  for people with disabilities, and for every American who buys an ACA  insurance plan. In fact, behind the scenes, Republicans and Democrats  have already been working together on these programs. The bills are  ready to go. They are drafted, they are printed up, and they are just  waiting for a vote.   We are on the edge of a healthcare crisis. It is a healthcare crisis  created by the Senate Republican leadership that insists that we burn  time off the clock this week, voting on yet another effort to rip away  people's health insurance.   The Senate has real work to do--work that could help millions of  American families. It is time to drop this cruel effort to repeal  healthcare and instead focus on making sure that important health  programs don't run out of funds in the next few days. That is what the  American people want to see us do.   Mr. President, I yield.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). The Senator from Connecticut.
