 Madam Speaker, as America marks a year since President  Biden's inauguration, Republicans are focused on delivering solutions  to the multitude of crises his administration has created.   After a year of one-party rule, the reality is American families are  seeing empty shelves at the grocery store. Businesses cannot find  workers. Inflation just hit the highest rate in 40 years. Meanwhile,  the catastrophe at our southern border continues to worsen. In the past  12 months, more than  [[Page H244]]  1.7 million people have been caught trying to enter the United States  illegally.   Madam Speaker, the Biden administration can ignore these inconvenient  truths all they want. Do you know who is noticing? The American people  are noticing. These are the same people who are working every day, the  people driving our economy forward in spite of President Biden stacking  the odds against them.   Madam Speaker, be assured when Republicans regain the majority in the  House, we will continue tackling these challenges by getting government  out of the way, restoring our God-given freedoms, and ensuring  Americans keep more of their hard-earned money.
