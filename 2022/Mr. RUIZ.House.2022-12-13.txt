 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate a champion for our  local veterans, Rafael ``Ralph'' Duarte, and to thank him for his years  of service to our communities.   Tomorrow, Ralph will transition after 10 years with the Riverside  County Department of Veteran Services, where he has built a legacy as a  fierce advocate, pillar of strength, and beacon of hope for Riverside  County veterans.   Ralph was born in Delano, California, and graduated from Coachella  Valley High School. He is a decorated Army veteran, having served for 4  years in Iraq and Afghanistan with the 3rd Ranger Battalion, 75th  Ranger Regiment.   After he returned home from the battlefield, he settled in Indio,  California, and immediately got to work.   He has helped thousands of veterans recover their earned benefits  that were denied to them by local, State, and Federal agencies over the  years. In fact, it is estimated that he has helped local veterans and  their families obtain $55 million in monetary benefits. That is $55  million to get them the care they need, the salary they have earned,  and the recognition they deserve.   He truly goes above and beyond to serve others, even making home  visits just to help elderly veterans fill out the necessary paperwork  to get their VA benefits and care.   Ralph has participated in hundreds of community events. From  community forums with the VFW, to our county's annual Veterans Expo, to  my Veterans University, Ralph has always been there to greet veterans  with a friendly smile, make them feel at home, and connect them with  the resources they need.   His compassion, professionalism, and hard work has changed the lives  of countless veterans for the better. His dedication, leadership, and  advocacy have made Riverside County an even more welcoming place to  those who served.   Ralph has always said that he is doing God's work in caring for those  who have served and sacrificed to protect our Nation, and I couldn't  agree more. Our local veterans have been truly blessed to have him  fighting on their behalf.   So I thank Ralph for all that he has done. On behalf of California's  36th Congressional District, I wish Ralph, along with his wife, Rachel,  and children, Ralph, Abram, and James, the best of luck in their next  adventure.                 Honoring Tribal Chairman Richard Milanovich     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a visionary leader and  trailblazer, Tribal Chairman Richard Milanovich, who served the Agua  Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians for nearly 30 years.   Chairman Milanovich was a powerhouse who came from humble beginnings.  He grew up poor in Palm Springs, and his family survived on nutrition  assistance.   He went on to serve our Nation as an infantryman in the U.S. Army for  3 years before returning to the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians  reservation.   In 1984, he was elected as Tribal chairman, ushering in a new age of  prosperity for the Tribe. His impact spread far and wide, and he is  still revered as a change-maker for Tribes throughout California and  the entire Nation.   We celebrate Chairman Milanovich's memory and legacy by renaming the  Palm Springs post office in his honor.                 Honoring Marine Corps Corporal Hunter Lopez     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Marine Corps Corporal  Hunter Lopez, my constituent who was killed in action while serving our  Nation at the Kabul airport on August 25, 2021.   Yesterday, this body honored his legacy by unanimously passing  legislation to designate the La Quinta post office in his memory.   Corporal Lopez was the embodiment of service. He lived his life with  a larger purpose in mind, a purpose of serving our country and  contributing to something greater than himself.   With the Marine Corps, he aided the largest airlift in human history,  evacuating over 120,000 of our fellow Americans and allies.   Corporal Lopez worked up until his last moment to save others. Now,  his story is forever entwined with our Nation's, and it is my hope that  with this legislation, future generations will come to know his legacy  of remarkable service, compassion, and heroism.                            ____________________
