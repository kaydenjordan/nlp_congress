 Mr. Speaker, I wear my mask in solidarity and support  for the families, the children, the seniors being impacted by the  Canadian wildfires. I rise today to call attention to the climate  crisis, which we are all witnessing before our very own eyes.   Air pollution is spiking across the country from wildfires that have  been raging in the Canadian provinces of Quebec and Nova Scotia.   To be clear, Mr. Speaker, this is just the start of the Canadian  wildfire season, and it is evident that due to the human and societal  impacts on climate, there is an increase in wildfire season, length,  frequency, and burn area.   Mr. Speaker, climate change is not a hoax.   We are not only seeing the haze from these fires, we are also feeling  it in our very own lungs. The environmental and public health impacts  are very real, and we must do more to hold polluters accountable.   Thirty-seven percent of the total area of forest burned in the  western U.S. and Canada since 1986 can be linked to emissions released  by the world's 88 biggest fossil fuel producers and cement  manufacturers.   Air pollution from wildfire smoke has become a significant health  risk in the United States, and it is growing.   Mr. Speaker, climate change is not a hoax.   In my city of New York, we are being severely impacted, and we are  taking extreme precautions, especially for children, older adults, and  asthmatics.   Last night, the city's air quality index was 215, a score considered  very unhealthy by the Environmental Protection Agency. This was deemed  the second worst level of air pollution in the world.   The situation is so grave that Mayor Eric Adams forced schools to  cancel all outdoor activities today.   Mr. Speaker, climate change is not a hoax.   Is this the future for our children? Let me remind you that millions  of Americans die each year from air pollution-related health issues.   In 2016, around 4.2 million premature deaths were associated with  fine particulate matter, according to the World Health Organization.   That is why I am insisting on passing my bill, the Green Climate Fund  Authorization Act, which will authorize appropriations to the Green  Climate Fund, ensuring that the U.S. is a leader in global solutions to  combat climate change.   Again, Mr. Speaker, climate change is not a hoax.   Moreover, we know where the money goes. It matters. Join me in this  fight in cosponsoring the Green Climate Fund Reauthorization Act.   Mr. Speaker, climate change is not a hoax.                            ____________________
