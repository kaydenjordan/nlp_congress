 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  legacy of Jack Trice--Iowa State University's first African-American  athlete, and the namesake of the college football stadium in Ames,  Iowa--he is an inspiration.   Trice enrolled at Iowa State University with the desire to play  football and graduate with a degree in animal husbandry and to help and  support farmers.   Tragically, 100 years ago, on October 8, 1923, Trice passed away at  just 21 years old after sustaining severe injuries during a game.   While his life was cut short, his legacy prevailed. In 1997, Iowa  State University renamed their college football stadium the Jack Trice  Stadium, and it remains the only major stadium in college football that  is named after an African American.   Today, Iowa State University supports thousands of students through  [[Page H4955]]  the Jack Trice Character Award and Jack Trice Endowed Scholarship  helping generations of Cyclones succeed.   This October will mark the 100-year anniversary of Jack Trice's  tragic death. To honor him, Iowa State will host the Jack Trice legacy  game on October 7 and hold the ceremony at the same location where his  funeral was 100 years ago at the central campus lawn on October 8.   I am proud to introduce a House resolution that recognizes the life  and legacy of Jack Trice, a young man that passed away way too soon,  but inspired our communities and the Cyclone nation.                         Honoring Officer Kevin Cram     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Algona  Police Officer Kevin Cram, who was senselessly murdered while doing his  job.   Officer Cram was a 10-year veteran of Iowa law enforcement and a  member of the Algona Police Department. He was also a son, husband, and  father who is remembered as a family man and a true hero.   Proudly wearing the badge, he dedicated his career to protecting our  families and keeping our streets safe. Words cannot accurately express  my gratitude for his service and sacrifice. Officer Cram gave his life  to protect the lives of fellow Iowans.   There is no greater sacrifice than this.   My prayers remain with his family, the Algona Police Department, and  everyone who knew and loved him.   Madam Speaker, Officer Cram will never be forgotten.               Recognizing Governor Reynolds and Kevin Reynolds     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize my friend and  Iowa's conservative champion, Governor Kim Reynolds and her husband,  first gentleman, Kevin Reynolds.   We both came to the Iowa Senate together, serving the rural  communities that power our economy and feed and fuel the world. I can  tell you that she was the leader back then and she is still a  tremendous leader today.   Since day one, she delivered real victories for our State. As  promised, she signed into law the largest tax cut in Iowa history, gave  parents a voice in their children's education, and she secured a $1.83  billion surplus for our State budget with no debt. She has also  deployed the Iowa National Guard to the southern border to do what  President Biden will not do: secure our border and protect our  families.   While Governor Reynolds continues her selfless work in Iowa, my  prayers are with her family and her husband, Kevin, who was recently  diagnosed with cancer. I have no doubt that through their faith in God  they will overcome this challenge and they will continue delivering  results for Iowa.   Madam Speaker, I thank Governor Reynolds and Kevin for their  dedication to our great State.                            ____________________
