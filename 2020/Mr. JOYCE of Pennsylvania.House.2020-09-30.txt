 Mr. Speaker, in 2020, America is facing  significant threats to our health, to our values, and to our national  security. The Chinese Communist Party has attempted to exert control  over every facet of America's economy and industry, and even our health  and safety.   The coronavirus has exposed that much of America's medical supply  chain, as it currently stands, runs directly through China. This should  concern every American. Why would we trust a regime that lies about a  pandemic to control our access to healthcare?   As a physician, I have long been concerned about the Chinese  Communist Government's near monopoly on the manufacturing of generic  medicines. And that threat doesn't stop there. We cannot allow the  Chinese Communist Party to control our access to prescription drugs and  the vital materials that are used in healthcare equipment, not to  mention PPE.   For the sake of American patients and our national security, we must  correct course and return the essential medical innovation and  manufacturing home to America and away from this hostile regime.   For months, the China Task Force has been working to identify  realistic and achievable solutions to secure our medical supply chain  and ensure that Americans are never beholden to the Chinese Communist  Party for our medicines and for our healthcare equipment. We are taking  a comprehensive approach to end America's reliance on China and bring  jobs home to America.   Our supply chain challenges extend beyond the healthcare regime. From  technology to manufacturing, too many materials that we rely on every  day are sourced from China.   Earlier this year, I introduced legislation that seeks to end  America's dependence on China for rare earth elements and other  critical minerals--these are essential, and they are used in the  manufacturing of medical supplies, defense technology, and high-tech  products--by establishing a supply chain for these materials here in  the United States. It is important for our survival into the upcoming  technology advancements that our country is so dependent on. It also  requires the Department of Defense to source these materials from  America.   Pennsylvania, my home, is home to a dedicated and highly skilled  workforce, and I am working on a plan to incentivize companies to bring  their research, the development, and the production of materials back  home.   As President Trump said earlier this month: ``We want to build  factories in Baltimore, not Beijing. We want to make our products in  Chicago, not Shanghai.'' And, I might add, we want to make medicines in  Chambersburg, not China.   Mr. Speaker, this is the fight of our lives, and we have a real  opportunity to make a difference. There is nothing partisan about  securing America's place as a leader in the 21st century. There is  nothing partisan about bringing jobs home to America. There is nothing  partisan about combating a hostile regime's overreach into American  lives.   This is not about Republicans or Democrats; this is about Americans.  I urge my colleagues from across the political spectrum to get behind  our commonsense solutions to counter the Chinese Communist Party and  protect our Nation.   It is simple. We must secure our supply chains. We must defeat China  in the race to the next-generation technology. We must prepare  Americans to succeed in the years to come.   From strengthening our supply chains and bringing jobs home to  America and to our allies, countering Chinese interference in our  educational institutions, we must take action. We must continue  fighting to defend the American people and equip America to lead the  way in the 21st century.   As I have said before on this floor, this is the fight of our  lifetime, and it is one that we certainly can win.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5736, the Transnational White  Supremacist Extremism Review Act.   H.R. 5736 requires the Department of Homeland Security Undersecretary  for Intelligence and Analysis, I&A, to coordinate with Federal partners  and develop a terrorism threat assessment concerning homeland threats  related to ``foreign violent white supremacist extremist  organizations.''   This bill further requires I&A to share the information with State  and local law enforcement partners, as well as fusion centers. Ensuring  that State and local law enforcement and fusion centers have access to  information on current and emerging threats is a fundamental  responsibility of the Department of Homeland Security, particularly the  Office of Intelligence and Analysis.   The Trump administration has taken significant action to address  domestic extremism, including white supremacy. The creation of the  Office of Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention in April 2019 and  the release of the DHS Strategic Framework for Countering Terrorism and  Targeted Violence in September 2019 demonstrate a coordinated and  comprehensive commitment to addressing emerging threats in both  international and domestic terrorism.   Subcommittee Ranking Member Walker led our efforts to negotiate  changes to the base bill during the committee markup. I want to thank  Subcommittee Chairman Rose for accepting our changes to the bill. I  urge its passage, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 5780. This bill makes the great work done  by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency more accessible  to stakeholders.   CISA provides advice and recommendations upon the request of critical  infrastructure owners and operators on how to secure and protect their  facilities in cyberspace and physically.   This bill will help stakeholders clearly know what CISA can do.  Continuing to develop the relationship between CISA and our private  stakeholders remains an integral piece of our critical infrastructure  security.   I thank Representatives Underwood and Katko for their bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5823.   Preparing our State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments for  the increasing number of cyber threats they face is a necessary  priority.   Cybersecurity preparedness is ineffective if our only focus is on  Federal preparedness. It is incumbent on us to ensure that our State  and local partners are taking advantage of the resources that we can  offer so they, too, can prepare for the threats that they might face.  H.R. 5823 will do just that. It establishes a matching grant program  for State and local governments to access and close vulnerabilities in  their IT systems.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives Richmond and Katko for their  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5822. The Department of  Homeland Security has an important mission to protect the homeland and  secure our borders. To accomplish this mission, DHS must enter into  contracts for equipment and services. To protect taxpayer dollars and  ensure that DHS is getting the most bang for its buck, the Department  must utilize experienced acquisition professionals.   In the past decade, GAO has consistently identified issues that must  be addressed to improve acquisition operations at DHS, including  shortages in the number of trained acquisition professionals. This bill  addresses this specific issue by developing trained acquisition  professionals within DHS.   H.R. 5822 provides the on-the-job acquisition training, rotations  throughout the Department, mentoring, and other opportunities to  enhance acquisition knowledge, and experience for the participants. I  applaud my colleague, Representative Titus, for her efforts to bring  this bill forward.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5811, the TSA  Personnel Workplace Improvement Act of 2020. This bipartisan  legislation, championed by Representative   John Katko, will make  important enhancements to the workplace rights of TSA employees, in  particular, women and nursing mothers.   Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, frontline personnel of the  Transportation Security Administration have continued to serve the  traveling public to keep our Nation's transportation system secure. At  a time when the criticality of the TSA personnel is so clearly  demonstrated, we, in Congress, have an opportunity with this bill to  express appreciation for their services.   H.R. 5811 requires the administrator to ensure that employees have  access to safe, clean, and free lactation facilities for an appropriate  amount of time. It requires TSA to coordinate with National Institutes  for Health to ensure that lactation facilities meet necessary  standards. Finally, this legislation will ensure paid family leave for  the entire TSA workforce.   Mr. Speaker, this corrects an oversight in last year's NDAA that  provided paid family leave to the rest of the Federal workforce. I  thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) for his leadership on  this important legislation. I also thank the gentleman from California  (Mr. Correa) for his support of this bipartisan legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5804.   According to DHS, there are millions of victims of trafficking  worldwide each year. Men, women, and children are trafficked throughout  the world--many of the victims right here in the United States.   The Blue Campaign is a national campaign designed to promote  awareness of trafficking and help identify the signs of trafficking.  The Blue Campaign conducts outreach to law enforcement, the public, and  certain industry professionals. The ability to recognize the signs of  trafficking can lead to rescuing individuals from trafficking and  bringing the criminals who seek to exploit them to justice.   This bill would build on the excellent work of the DHS Blue Campaign  and expand its awareness to include even more individuals that are  likely to encounter victims of human trafficking.   I applaud the efforts of my colleague from Texas (Mr. Crenshaw) and  urge other Members to support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Crenshaw).    Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
