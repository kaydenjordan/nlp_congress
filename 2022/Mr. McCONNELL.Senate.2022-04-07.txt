 Madam President, here is a quote from Candidate  Biden's campaign website in 2020:         The U.S. has a right and a duty to secure our borders and       protect our people against threats.    Well, that was then; this is now.   The Biden administration's weak border policies set a new record in  2021. Customs and Border Protection had to make--listen to this--2  million--2 million--arrests, and it doesn't appear that that new record  will last long; 2022 is already trending even worse.   CBP is currently seeing about 7,000 encounters every single day, and  they fear they could see as many as 18,000 per day--a truly staggering  figure.   To put this in perspective, President Obama's former DHS Secretary  Jeh Johnson has reflected that a daily count above 1,000--above 1,000-- was ``a relatively bad number, and I was gonna be in a bad mood the  whole day,'' reflecting back on his experience.   Now we are at seven times that figure and still climbing. It is a  President's responsibility to fix this crisis, but this President is  taking major steps to make it even worse.   The Biden administration has announced they will cancel legal  authorities that have helped CBP contend with these massive surges. A  group of States led by Arizona have explained in court that title 42 is  ``the only safety valve preventing this Administration's disastrous  border policies from devolving into an unmitigated catastrophe.''   The administration's attempts to explain why they are caving to the  far left and throwing our borders open make no sense whatsoever. The  White House keeps claiming this is a public health decision; they  cannot keep title 42--leading you to ask, why?   Democrats don't act like they think COVID is finished. They give  speeches daily about the need for more funding. They say we should be  sending health assistance around the rest of the world. The only place  on the planet where Democrats say COVID is over apparently is at our  southern border.   A growing number of House and Senate Democrats have expressed concern  and anger over President Biden's awful decision. But press releases are  one thing. What matters is how people vote.   Senate Democrats have taken every meaningful opportunity to back the  administration's border policies and vote down Republican efforts to  improve security. Their votes have helped create this mess. We will see  if they finally change course and begin voting to help Republicans end  the crisis instead.    I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.    Mr. President, President Biden was elected on the  promise that he would govern as a moderate and unite the country. He  insisted the radical left would not be calling the shots on his watch.  But when it came to one of the most consequential decisions a President  can make--a lifetime appointment to our highest Court--the Biden  administration let the radicals run the show.   With Washington Democrats in power, the far left got the reckless  inflationary spending they wanted; the far left has gotten the insecure  border they wanted; and today, the far left will get the Supreme Court  Justice they wanted.   The fringe activists who demand partisan Court packing, attack the  Justices, and describe our Constitution as ``trash'' made up their  minds from the start of this administration that if a Supreme Court  vacancy should arise, they wanted one nominee and one nominee only:  Judge Jackson. They spent dark money to promote this person  specifically. They pushed her for the D.C. Circuit. Then they badgered  [[Page S2068]]  Justice Breyer to quit. In February, one of these groups announced  Judge Jackson would be the nominee before President Biden actually did  make the announcement. So think about that for a moment.   The Senate has examined Judge Jackson's qualifications with the  seriousness and vigor that a lifetime appointment deserves. Unlike when  the parties' positions are reversed, the country was not subjected to  uncorroborated smear campaigns, committee boycotts, stunts with  cardboard cutouts, or mobs chasing Senators around the Capitol.   Now a few of our Democratic colleagues seem to have decided in  advance they would claim that Judge Jackson was treated shabbily. I  have heard that script recited, even though it didn't happen. It didn't  happen.    Let's be clear. No nominee before the Senate for any position  deserves a cakewalk or a coronation. Tough questions about a Federal  judge's own rulings and statements are the definition of ``fair game.''  My Republican colleagues' vigorous inquiry shed important new light on  a frequently disturbing judicial record. So I applaud my colleagues for  focusing on substance and not following the Democrats' recent  precedents into the gutter.   Unfortunately, what the Senate's process turned up was disturbing.   First, the nominee would not follow the Ginsburg-Breyer precedent and  denounce the insane concept of partisan Court packing.   Second, her judicial record is full of cases where Judge Jackson  ruled like a policymaker implementing personal biases instead of a  judge following the text wherever it led.   Third, her aggressive judicial activism frequently focused on  treating convicted criminals as gently as possible. In literally case  after case, from deadly fentanyl to open borders, to child  exploitation, Judge Jackson tilted the scales of justice away from  public safety and innocent victims in favor of her career-long passion  for softening up criminal sentencing. In Judge Jackson's courtroom,  plain legal text and clear congressional intent were no match for what  the judge admits are her personal ``policy disagreements.''   Even as a violent crimewave sweeps America, Democrats are pursuing a  nationwide campaign to make the justice system softer on crime. They  are stacking the deck with far-left prosecutors, woke warriors at the  Department of Justice, and Federal judges who believe criminals deserve  lighter treatment. This project is terrible for innocent American  families. And every piece of evidence suggests Democrats' view Judge  Jackson as its crown jewel.   I will close with this: These debates about judicial philosophy are  not just academic. The charged political atmosphere around  confirmations, the outsized role that unelected judges play in our  national life--these are direct consequences of liberal judicial  activism. They are direct results of the effort to misuse Federal  courts as a progressive legislature that voters can't kick out.   A republic of self-serving citizens should not spend every June  watching with bated breath to see if five or six lawyers will hand down  sweeping policy changes with zero basis in the written Constitution.   The solution is not to make the Court even more of a  superlegislature, like liberals want--a delegitimizing death spiral  that would destroy the rule of law. There is only one solution. The  Senate should only confirm Justices who will follow the text of our  laws and our Constitution wherever it leads, who will leave subjective  policy judgments on this side of the street, where they belong. That is  how we lower the temperature. That is how we shore up the courts. That  is how we protect the rule of law. Staff the judiciary with brilliant  men and women who understand and embrace this limited role. No other  road leads anywhere good for our great Nation.
