 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to strongly urge the  Hackensack City Council to reconsider their decision to turn down a  nearly $2.4 million Federal grant to hire new firefighters, which the  Hackensack Fire Department and I worked very hard to claw back from  Washington to New Jersey.   This grant will hire new firefighters to better protect our first  responders, families, and help lower property taxes by taking the  financial burden off of Hackensack taxpayers.   This week, I stood with the Hackensack Fire Department, the  Professional Firefighters Association of New Jersey, Hackensack IAFF  Locals 2081 and 3172, and Bergen County Executive Jim Tedesco to call  on the Hackensack City Council to accept this Federal grant.   We know that firefighters will be retiring in the coming years, and  the public safety report calls for the city to hire new firefighters.  Yet, the city council plans to reject the grant and resubmit it for  fewer firefighters.   I will do everything I can to support any revised grant application,  but this is a very risky decision that could result in no new  firefighters being hired with Federal investment, and that puts  people's lives in danger.   Mr. Speaker, we must always look out for our families and get the  backs of those who protect us.                            ____________________
