 Madam Speaker, President Biden has set forth a national  plan to crush the virus. With this bill, Congress is providing the  President with the resources and tools to implement a national plan  that was sorely lacking under President Trump. States competed against  each other during the Trump administration for personal protection  equipment, ventilators, and testing supplies. That now ends.   This legislation provides $20 billion to speed up the distribution  and administration of COVID-19 vaccines. It invests over $47 billion in  a national testing strategy. It invests $7 billion to hire 100,000 new  full-time public health workers to perform vital tasks, like vaccine  outreach and contact tracing. It invests more than $25 billion to  address health disparities.   We also include assistance for struggling families to help keep their  lights on, the heat working, and the water running. We included $7.6  billion to expand internet connectivity to help students and teachers  without home internet access.   Madam Speaker, the American Rescue Plan meets the unprecedented  challenges our Nation is facing, and it deserves strong bipartisan  support.
