 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the New York  State Legislature for passing the DREAM Act. States have had to step up  because of the Trump shutdown, because of our inability to move forward  and recognize that this continues to be a nation of immigrants.   So States like New York today had to pass the DREAM Act to allow in  young people, many of whom are nurses, doctors, members of our Armed  Forces, and teachers who are contributing to our communities across the  country. All they want is a shot to be part of the American Dream,  because this is a nation of immigrants.   The DREAM Act today in the New York State Legislature was named after  my good friend who passed this year, unfortunately, Senator Jose  Peralta.   I congratulate New York. That lady still stands in the harbor with  her torch lighting the bay for everyone across the world, because we  are a nation of immigrants.                            ____________________
