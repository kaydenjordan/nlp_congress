 Madam President, first, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to  speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, a few minutes ago, Chair Janet Yellen was  approved by the Senate Finance Committee to be Secretary of the  Treasury by an extraordinary 26-to-0 vote.   I have seen times around here in the Senate where you come away  convinced you couldn't get 26 to 0 among Senators to buy a soda. I want  to thank Senators Grassley and Crapo for working very closely with me  and Senate Democrats to achieve this remarkable vote this morning.   The fact is, Janet Yellen has been confirmed by this body four times.  She really belongs in the Senate confirmation hall of fame, and the  reason that she has been confirmed all of these times is because of  what we saw at her confirmation hearing on Tuesday. She did a superb  job. After the hearing, she responded in a substantive way to hundreds  of questions that came from colleagues and has made a real commitment  to transparency.   Now, I know that Senators are working on a variety of issues now, but  I would like to say that I think, given the urgency of the economic  challenge our country faces, in a truly perilous economic time, I would  very much like to work with all of my colleagues, particularly Senators  Crapo and Grassley, to find a way to, today, bring up Chair Yellen for  confirmation to be our Secretary of the Treasury.   I want to say I very much appreciate the conciliatory way this was  discussed today, and I really hope the Senate can vote on her  nomination today.   I yield the floor.
