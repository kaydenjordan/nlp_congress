 Madam Speaker, today we act so that women will no longer  experience the fear of not knowing if they can maintain their family's  financial security while they are pregnant.   As the number of women who work as the primary breadwinners in their  households continues to rise, this financial insecurity rises as well.   While growing up, my mother was forced out of the Navy because she  was pregnant. Although times have changed, mothers are still being  forced out of their employment due to the absence of reasonable  accommodations. I know first-hand the pressures of being that single  source of income for my household, and I have seen how Black and Latina  workers are overrepresented in low-wage, physically demanding jobs that  need pregnancy accommodations for them to stay safe.   More than a decade ago, the Americans with Disabilities Act was  amended to better implement the principle that physical or mental  disabilities should be met with reasonable accommodations.   Pregnancy is not considered a disability under the ADA, however,  enabling employers to deny reasonable accommodations like allowing  pregnant employees to sit on a stool rather than stand during a long  shift.   This bill would correct that, and I would like to include in the  Record a letter from the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities  addressed to Chairman Scott and Ranking Member Foxx in support of the  Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.   New Mexico is one of thirty states that have enacted laws to protect  access to reasonable accommodations for pregnant workers so they have  safe working conditions and, if they are denied that, the right to  receive lost pay and compensatory damages.   Millions of pregnant workers in these states have benefited from  these protections, but a pregnant employee's ability to work safely  should not depend on where in this country she lives.   The Pregnant Workers' Fairness Act, which is endorsed by nearly 200  worker advocates, civil rights groups and the business community, will  hold every employer in our country, across state lines, to these same  standards.   As we hear horrific stories of immigrant women forced to have  hysterectomies and lose their ability to have children, we are reminded  that the health, safety and wellbeing of all women is not something we  can turn a blind eye to, whether those women work in boardrooms, on a  factory floor, or in a hospital.   I support this legislation because no expectant mother should have to  risk her health or that of her unborn child to stay financially stable.   I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this historic bill.                                                 September 11, 2020.      Re Support for Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, H.R. 2694.       Hon. Bobby Scott,      Chairman, Committee on Education and Labor, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.       Hon. Virginia Foxx,      Ranking Member, Committee on Education and Labor, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Scott and Ranking Member Foxx: As co-chairs       of the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) Rights       Task Force, we write in strong support of the Pregnant       Workers Fairness Act, H.R. 2694. CCD is the largest coalition       of national organizations working together to advocate for       federal public policy that ensures the self-determination,       independence, empowerment, integration and inclusion of       children and adults with disabilities in all aspects of       society.        The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)'s mandate that       covered employers make reasonable accommodations to ensure       equal opportunity for applicants and employees with       disabilities has been tremendously important in helping       people with disabilities secure and maintain employment.       While the ADA does not cover pregnancy itself as a       disability, in light of the ADA Amendments Act, which lowered       the standard for demonstrating a disability from what the       courts had previously applied, many pregnant workers who       experience pregnancy-related complications should be covered       as people with disabilities and entitled to reasonable       accommodations under the ADA. Yet many courts have continued       to interpret the ADA's coverage narrowly, and in practice,       large numbers of pregnant workers are not offered reasonable       accommodations. Furthermore, a clear pregnancy accommodation       standard will help prevent pregnancy-related complications       before they arise. Such accommodations should be provided to       pregnant workers so that they can remain in the workforce and       not lose their employment simply because they experience       pregnancy-related limitations.        The accommodation requirement of H.R. 2694 is limited, as       is the ADA's accommodation requirement, to those       accommodations that are reasonable and would not impose an       undue hardship. That standard takes into account the needs of       employers while also ensuring that pregnant workers can stay       on the job with reasonable accommodations. This protection is       critical not only for pregnant workers but for our national       economy.        The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is particularly important       to people with disabilities. Many people with disabilities       who did not require accommodations before becoming pregnant       experience new complications due to how pregnancy impacts       their disabilities, and need accommodations once they become       pregnant. These workers are sometimes told that they are not       entitled to accommodations because the employer views the       need for accommodation as related to pregnancy rather than to       the worker's underlying disability.        We thank the Committee for moving the bill forward and urge       all members of the House of Representatives to vote for the       Pregnant Workers Fairness Act and oppose any motion to       recommit.
