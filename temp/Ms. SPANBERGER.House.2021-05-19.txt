 Madam Speaker, I rise to remember the life of a  courageous, kind, and selfless Virginian, Mike Lecik.   Service was an unwavering part of who Mike was. Throughout his  career, Mike served as an Air Force firefighter, an assistant fire  chief with the U.S. Department of Defense, and the assistant chief at  the Huguenot Volunteer Fire Department in central Virginia.   As an Air Force firefighter, Mike deployed twice to the Middle East.  After coming home to Powhatan County, he was proud to serve in his  local volunteer fire department. He cared deeply for his community and  his country. A few years ago, Mike was diagnosed with multiple myeloma,  a blood cancer linked to the dangerous conditions of his service as an  Air Force firefighter.   I first got to know Mike because the VA did not recognize this  connection, and he wanted to do something about it. He wanted to learn  more about how the system could be changed for the better and for the  benefit of his fellow servicemen and -women.   This fight was not just about getting the support that he needed;  rather, it was about the thousands of firefighters just like him who  faced this challenge. Mike truly wanted every veteran firefighter to  get the care they deserved.   Mike passed away earlier this year at the age of 41.   Mike was dedicated to his community, the safety of his neighbors,  and, above all, his family. It was my honor to have him as a  constituent.   Mike leaves behind a family and a community that deeply cared for  him, and he leaves behind a cause that is worth championing.   Across the board, firefighters are more likely to be exposed to  certain carcinogens. They are more likely to suffer certain diseases  and illnesses because of their career. And they experience higher rates  of cancer than the general U.S. population.   This connection is well-documented by scientific research, but it is  yet to be recognized by the VA, the Federal agency entrusted with  caring for those who have borne the battle.   Military firefighters put their lives on the line each day--not just  to defend our country but also to selflessly defend their fellow  servicemembers. But to this day, thousands of veteran firefighters are  left uncovered by the VA for certain types of cancer treatments.   Earlier this year, I reintroduced the Michael Lecik Military  Firefighters Protection Act in Mike's name to fix this longstanding  issue. This bipartisan legislation would make sure diseases like Mike's  are recognized as presumptive service-connected disabilities.   By recognizing the long-term effects of military firefighting and the  diseases that can arise from this career over time, our bill would  provide much-needed peace of mind and security to thousands of veteran  firefighters and their families. It would lift an undue burden off  thousands of veterans experiencing severe and often-terminal illnesses.   Right now, the VA doesn't cover significant treatment costs like  those faced by Mike, as the VA, in many cases, does not recognize the  direct service connection between firefighting and cancer as a  presumptive service-connected disability beyond 1 year following Active  Duty.   Our legislation would establish the presumption that veteran  firefighters who become disabled by serious diseases, including heart  disease, lung disease, and certain cancers like Mike's, within 15 years  of separating from Active Duty contracted the illness due to their  service in the military.   By creating this presumption, the VA would be required to provide  equitable disability benefits and treatment cost coverage to veteran  firefighters like Mike.   This legislation has the support of Democrats and Republicans from  across the political spectrum, including many who have served our  country.   Specifically, I would like to thank my Republican colleague,  Congressman Bacon from Nebraska, himself an Air Force veteran of nearly  30 years, for his continued partnership in leading this bill. I thank  Congressman Bacon for recognizing that this issue should unite us all  because we all represent veterans with stories like Mike's.   Even as he was engaged in the battle of his life--for his life--Mike  was eager to make progress on this issue. When I first reached out to  Mike to ask whether he would like to be involved with the legislation,  he never hesitated.   Mike had already been in touch with our team about some of his issues  with the VA. And when asked if he wanted to take up this challenge and  make a difference through the legislative process, he said:  ``Absolutely.'' He was ready to take up the mantle for his fellow vets.  It was his honor.    Even as his illness progressed, he stayed apprised of new  developments on this legislation, and my team was humbled to work with  him. He showed incredible strength and determination that we will never  forget.   The Michael Lecik Military Firefighters Protection Act is about a  fundamental question: How do we show our gratitude and appreciation to  those who served, to those who have put on the uniform, and to those  who have worked under hazardous and dangerous conditions to keep their  countrymen and fellow servicemembers safe?   The answer is found beyond platitudes. It is found beyond spoken  promises. It is found in action. And it is found in delivering the  benefits our veterans have earned through their sacrifice.   No veteran who puts on the uniform should repeatedly have to make the  argument that their injury, their illness, is connected to their  service when the evidence is so apparent--to the degree that the  majority of our States have already recognized the link between these  serious diseases and the occupational hazards of firefighting and have  enacted presumptive disability laws.   In the case of Mike and thousands of firefighters like him, no  veteran should experience a VA that refuses to help cover the costs of  treating their service-connected cancer.   As I urge my colleagues to recognize the urgent need to pass the  Michael Lecik Military Firefighters Protection Act, I am thinking of  his wife, Tiffany, and his three daughters, Amery, Aubrey, and Addy. He  loved them deeply, and I work in his honor.  [[Page H2551]]                                ____________________
