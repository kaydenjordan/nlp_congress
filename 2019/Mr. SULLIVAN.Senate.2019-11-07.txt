 Mr. President, it is Thursday afternoon, and that means  it is one of my favorite times in the U.S. Senate because I get to come  to the Senate floor and recognize an Alaskan who has done something  that is great for our State, great for the community, great for the  country--you name it. I come here and brag about somebody I represent  in Alaska, and I call this person the Alaskan of the Week. I know the  Presiding Officer likes it, and the pages certainly do.   What I like to do when I am starting this speech each week is talk to  our visitors in the Gallery and people who are watching on TV to give a  little update on what is going on in Alaska and encourage a visit. You  will have the visit of a lifetime, guaranteed, if you come to Alaska.   Right now, as you can imagine, the great white north winter is coming  in parts of the State. It has definitely arrived in other parts. Winter  is a great time to be in Alaska, not just the summer. You can ski,  snowboard, and at the end of the day sit back, drink something warm,  and watch the northern lights dance in our sky. So come visit. You will  love coming to visit Alaska.   What is really nice to do if you come and visit now is to wear a fur  in Alaska. We have some great furriers in Alaska, but David Green  Master Furrier in Anchorage is one of the oldest, most well respected,  and certainly one of the best in our State and, I think, in the  country. It is an Alaskan institution, and our Alaskan of the Week, Mr.  Perry Green, one of the kindest, most generous, most patriotic, hard- working Alaskans, has worked throughout the decades to keep this great  institution that way.   Let me tell you a little bit about Perry Green. His father David was  from New York. He was enthralled with Alaska, a huge fan of the  characters that Alaska attracts, as well as Jack London's ``Call of the  Wild.'' So David moved to Washington State to be close to Alaska, where  he eventually opened stores many, many years ago.   Perry Green, David's son, was born in Seattle on March 17, 1936. That  is St. Patrick's Day. How great is that? I always knew Perry had a  little Irish in him. He recalled:         My father would come back from Alaska with such great       stories, and all the Alaska sourdoughs would come to visit       him. They sat at the dinner table and I was enthralled with       their tales.    Anyone who knows anything about Alaska knows those stories, has heard  about them, read about them--bear attacks, moose charges, frostbite,  crossing perilous rivers, traversing vast landscapes under the dancing  skies, wolves howling in the distance, fires barely starting at 40  below, and countless stories about being saved by the kindness of  strangers out on the trail.   Perry also came of age during World War II. His father made fur ruffs  for the soldiers' parkas, which set the stage for Perry's enduring  patriotism and support for our troops. He said:         I remember watching the troops head overseas, the wonderful       parades. It all made me swell up with pride.    I would say that Perry Green is the most patriotic American I know,  and we have a lot of patriots in Alaska.   He met his beautiful future wife, the beautiful Gloria, gracious  Gloria, when they were both young and began dating as teenagers, and  they have been together ever since. As a matter of fact, that is 63  years of marriage. That is something to be celebrated. Perry said that  marrying Gloria was the best decision he ever made. I know Gloria, and  I would certainly agree with Perry, and I would certainly agree with  this: Like me, he definitely married up.   Like his father, he traveled back and forth to Washington State often  for work. He went to Alaska to work on the Alaska Railroad in order to  save enough money to buy Gloria a wedding ring. He served in the U.S.  Army for 3 years, and eventually he and Gloria  [[Page S6469]]  made their way to our great State to forge a life together. They have  been there ever since, and what a life they have lived.   Initially, Perry worked at his father's store in downtown Anchorage,  but for a time he broke out on his own and started the Anchorage Fur  Trading Company, which became the largest fur dealer in Alaska, and it  was wildly successful. He traveled all across the State--300 villages  in all, some of them multiple times--buying furs from the locals. He  traveled by dog team, by sled, by snow machine, by bush plane, and  everywhere he went he was greeted warmly and generously by people in  rural Alaska in these villages. He said:         I learned so much from the Alaska Native people. I was in       awe of their kindness, their respect for elders, and their       rich, cultural heritage.    That time in rural Alaska was one of the best times of his life and  laid the foundation for what has been one of Perry Green's biggest  loves--our State, the great State of Alaska, which he has given his all  to.   His company, David Green Master Furrier, is an iconic business in  downtown Anchorage because they sell some of the best and most  beautiful furs around, no doubt, but also because of Perry and his  extended family, who have done such a great job of running the company  for decades.   My daughters and I have a little tradition on Christmas Eve. We head  over to this great store and look for something to buy my wife, their  mom. It is a fun, fun tradition that we do.   Perry has been the face of the store for decades. People still  remember his quirky commercials featuring tarantulas, huge athletes  chasing him around, and always the tagline, ``If you don't know your  furs, know your furrier.''   It seems that all of Anchorage and so much of Alaska knew their  furrier. It should be noted that they also know this Alaska furrier in  Las Vegas as well. Perry Green is a very good poker player and has won  three World Series of Poker bracelets and has made it to the final  table of the World Series of Poker main event in Vegas two times. How  about that for an adventurous life?   It wasn't just his store and Perry's love of a good poker game that  has endeared him to so many Alaskans. A man of deep faith, he is one of  the most generous people in my State and one of the most committed  Alaskans to public service and helping others.   ``I never was interested in being rich,'' Perry said. ``I wanted to  do something positive for other people because that's the greatest  thing you can do.''   He has sat on nearly every board there is. You name it--the taxicab  commission, the insurance board, the planning and zoning board, the  symphony and opera board, the Rotary board, and a member of the Elks  Club, the Masons, the Alaska Jewish Campus and Museum. The list goes on  and on in terms of his service.   He also raises money for numerous causes. ``I can't think of a  fundraising effort that his name isn't a part of,'' his longtime friend  Gordon Glaser said about Perry.   Perry is especially generous in causes that raise money for our men  and women in uniform. On the eve of Veterans Day, we can't thank him  enough for that.   ``Anyone who's been in Anchorage in the last two generations knows  that if you need something done, Perry will do it,'' his friend Gordon  said.   If you are down on your luck or if you need a job, need a place to  stay, or need some assistance, Perry will help. Every community, every  State, has leaders like this. We all know those types of people. They  are very special, and he is one of them.   Perry and his wife Gloria are also personally generous with their  house--a lively, happy place open to people all across our State and,  really, the world.   Anchorage Mayor Ethan Berkowitz, another longtime friend of Perry's,  credits him for teaching him and so many others ``how to be an  Alaskan.'' What does that mean? According to Mayor Berkowitz, it means  that he brought the spirit of Tikkun Olam to Alaska. That is a Hebrew  phrase meaning healing the world. Perry has brought this to our State  one generous act at a time, one community at a time.   Perry and Gloria will be honored at Alaska's Jewish Gala next week-- one of our State's most fun and memorable events. It will be next  Saturday evening, and I will be there for sure. It is a time when we  all can gather together, celebrate the vital role the Jewish community  has played in our great State, and be reminded that Alaska is a place  where we can all come together and take care of each other the way the  Greens have been doing for decades.   Rabbi Yosef Greenberg, a good friend of mine and another extremely  generous man who has given so much to our State, says that the mission  of the Alaska Jewish Campus that Perry Green has been so generous to is  ``Warming up Alaska!''   ``In the 60 years of Alaska's statehood,'' said Rabbi Greenberg,  ``Perry Green has warmed up Alaska, not only with his David Green fur  coats but even more so with the joys of his life, big heart, and  lending a hand to ordinary Alaskans and anyone in need.'' That is how  he has warmed up our great State.   Perry and Gloria have done so much for Alaska. They are highly  deserving of this recognition they will be receiving at the Jewish Gala  next week. Congratulations to them and their 5 children, 13  grandchildren, 8 great-grandchildren, and all of the extended Green  family, so many of whom continue to serve our State and country so  well.   Perry, from your friend, congratulations on being our Alaskan of the  Week.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
