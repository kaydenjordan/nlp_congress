 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor and celebrate the life  of Dr. Ambrous Oliver Findley, Jr., affectionately known as ``Butch,''  who recently passed and is survived by his loving wife, Wanda, and his  children, grandchildren, sister, nephews, and dear friends.   Butch's life was filled with tremendous acts of service. After  obtaining a bachelor's in psychology from the University of South  Florida, Butch's commitment to the well-being of others led him to the  U.S. Navy where he selflessly served as a hospital corpsman. A man of  diverse talents and interests, Butch then returned to the University of  South Florida and obtained a bachelor's in biology and premed.   Butch's devotion to the medical profession later led him to attend  the West Virginia School of Osteopathic Medicine and complete his  residency at the General Hospital in Pinellas Park, Florida. After this  pivotal chapter, Butch once again answered the call of duty, this time  as a physician in the United States Army where he served at the rank of  captain in Fort Stewart, Georgia.    For 42 years, Butch then dedicated himself to the well-being of  Georgians in Rabun County, leaving an indelible mark on the northeast  Georgia community that he served--first at Ridgecrest Hospital and  later at MedLink Rabun. He was not merely a physician; he was a beacon  of hope and healing, touching countless lives.   Beyond the stethoscope, Butch reveled in the simple joys of life.  Whether exploring new adventures or finding solace in the comfort of  home, he cherished precious moments with his family and friends.   Butch's kindness, compassion, and profound sense of duty will forever  resonate in the hearts of those who knew him. As we bid farewell to a  beloved husband, father, grandfather, brother, and friend, we find  peace knowing that he is now with our Heavenly Father.   Georgia's Ninth District will always remember and honor the  incredible legacy that Dr. Butch Findley, Jr. left behind.                  15th Annual Industry Appreciation Luncheon     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Hall County's top  industries for 2023. Earlier this month, the Greater Hall County  Chamber of Commerce held its 15th Annual Industry Appreciation Luncheon  at Lanier Technical College in Gainesville. On behalf of the Ninth  District, I would like to recognize this year's winners.   First, congratulations to Mar-Jac Poultry for receiving the Top Large  Employer award for 2023. Based in Gainesville, the poultry capital of  the world, Mar-Jac Poultry plays a pivotal role in our community's  economic prosperity.   With the help of its 1,400 dedicated employees, Mar-Jac Poultry  processes 2.4 million birds per week with plans to expand capacity by  50 percent and create 100 new jobs. I am proud to recognize Mar-Jac  Poultry for this exciting award, and I thank the company for investing  in our community.   This year's top Medium Sized Employer award is Corporate Storage, a  successful third-party logistics provider with 56 hardworking  employees.   Over the years, Corporate Storage has evolved from the initial moving  and storage company, Adams Transfer Company, which was founded in  Athens back in 1903, into a thriving business that provides commercial  warehousing, records management, and logistic services.  [[Page H5992]]    Corporate Storage recently completed a $15 million expansion to  improve service for manufacturing, healthcare, and food processing  customers throughout north Georgia. Congratulations, Corporate Storage,  for this well-deserved recognition.   Last but not least, I would like to honor the Top Small Employer,  pdblowers, Incorporated, which employs 28 Georgians at its headquarters  in Gainesville.   Founded in 1990, pdblowers is a custom manufacturer of positive  displacement blower systems, including fabrication, design, and systems  integration. The business has built an outstanding reputation as a  leading distributor in its field due to years of exceptional customer  service, innovative solutions, and on-time delivery.

Additional companies honored by the Greater Hall County Chamber of  Commerce include: Carroll Daniel Construction for workforce  development, Performance Foodservice for workforce excellence, Marel  for safety performance, ZF for corporate responsibility, and Harris  Products Group for environmental responsibility.   Congratulations to Hall County's 2023 top industry winners. I thank  each of the recognized companies for investing in our community,  driving innovation, and fostering economic growth in Hall County.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong support of this  amendment offered by my colleague from Texas, Representative Pfluger.   It will strengthen H.R. 5961 by unequivocally blocking sanctioned  Iranian funds from potentially being unfrozen and keeping these dollars  out of the hands of the world's leading state sponsor of terror.   This amendment will close troubling loopholes that allow President  Biden to abuse waiver or license authorities to release billions in  frozen Iranian assets.   Enough is enough. We cannot continue policies that enrich Iran,  embolden terrorists like Hamas, and put American troops in harm's way.   Representative Pfluger's amendment also aligns with and reaffirms the  goal of my bill, the Standing Against  [[Page H6013]]  Houthi Aggression Act, because the Houthis are also proxy terrorists  for Iran.   His amendment prevents Iranian funds from being used against our  national security interests and limits President Biden's ability to  circumvent Congressional oversight.   Mr. Chair, I applaud Representative Pfluger for his work on this  critical amendment, and as a cosponsor of it, I urge all Members to  support it.   We must stand united in stopping Iran from financing terrorists and  in protecting American troops and allies abroad.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to oppose Representative Jackson's  amendment to add a 5-year sunset period. We cannot risk funds going to  terrorism ever, certainly not now and certainly not in 5 years.   Additionally, the only thing standing in the way of $14.3 billion  going to support Israel's eradication of Hamas is Joe Biden and Chuck  Schumer. The House has done its job. The Senate and the President have  so far done nothing but be a roadblock. Yes, we are witnessing a Biden- Schumer roadblock, a B-S roadblock, and it is totally unacceptable. It  is a dangerous state of affairs, and Biden and Schumer are the problem.  [[Page H6015]]    How can we support our closest ally in the Middle East when the  President and the Senate stand in the way?   The House has done its job. It is now time for the President and Mr.  Schumer to clear their B-S roadblock.
