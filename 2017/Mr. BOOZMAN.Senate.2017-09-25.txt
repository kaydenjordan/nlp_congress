 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the  life and legacy of Arkansan Gene Sullivan. Gene will forever be  remembered as the great optimist with the can-do attitude and endless  determnation. There was no project too small and, certainly, no project  too large that he wouldn't tackle with his trademark tenacity. Gene led  a life dedicated to the outdoors and was a man of great faith.   While there are many remarkable stories that we remember about Gene,  I want to share a personal letter that he sent to his grandchildren on  his 81st birthday. On February 8, 2017, Gene wrote the following:         As I sit in my easy chair in the early morning of my 81st       birthday, I give thanks to the Lord for how He has blessed me       throughout my life with love and mercy rather than justice. I       want to share with you some things I know to be true and pray       that you will consider them in your short journey through       this life on earth.        (1) God's judgement of how you live your life is the only       one that is really important. (2) The Bible provides God's       directions for having a successful life. Read it and live it.       (3) When you are older and look back, you will not regret any       time you spent with family, serving the Lord and loving and       serving others.        I love you and you are one of the blessings of my life.    He also included two Scriptures for them to read and contemplate.   Deuteronomy 11:1: ``Therefore you shall love the LORD your God, and  always keep His charge, His statutes, His precepts, and His  commandments [it is your obligation to Him].''   1 John 4:20: ``Whoever claims to love God yet hates a brother or  sister is a liar. For whoever does not love their brother and sister,  whom they have seen, cannot love God, whom they have not seen.''   As we mourn the loss of this Arkansas leader, I think it would serve  us all well to reflect upon the timeless wisdom that he passed along to  his grandchildren on his 81st birthday.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to mark an important occasion in  my home State of Arkansas and our country.   In September of 1957, nine young African-American teens who were  determined to receive the same education that had only been available  to their White peers became the focus of an event that had  repercussions throughout the Nation.   When the Supreme Court ruled that the racial segregation of public  schools was unconstitutional in its 1954 Brown v. Board of Education  decision, it paved the way for integration of public schools across the  country.   Although the highest Court in the land had spoken, the process of  desegregating the public schools was complex and still faced incredible  opposition. Civil rights groups worked with citizens to help them  enroll students of color in traditionally all-White schools. The Little  Rock Nine were beneficiaries of such assistance from Daisy Bates and  the Arkansas NAACP, among others.   On the first day of class in the fall of 1957, Little Rock Central  High School became ground zero in the movement for public school  integration. Governor Orval Faubus called in the Arkansas National  Guard amid threats from pro-segregationists to hold protests at Central  High and prevent any African-American students from entering the  school. Unfortunately, the Guard was initially deployed in order to  help thwart the integration effort, and as a result, Arkansas and  Central High became a flashpoint that represented just how difficult  integration would be, especially across the South. Despite the  hostility, there were forces within Little Rock that were working  together to successfully achieve a peaceful public school  desegregation, starting with Central High.   Eventually, President Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne Division of  the  [[Page S6089]]  U.S. Army to Little Rock and federalized the Arkansas National Guard to  protect the students and ensure public safety at a time when tensions  were running very high throughout the city. President Eisenhower's  actions helped make it possible for the Little Rock Nine to actually  enter the school and attend class. Even though they were allowed to  attend Central High, the African-American students were still subjected  to a daunting amount of abuse and hostility. They told stories of being  threatened and intimidated by fellow students and mistreated by the  school's administration.   Ernest Green, Elizabeth Eckford, Jefferson Thomas, Terrence Roberts,  Carlotta Walls LaNier, Minnijean Brown, Gloria Ray Karlmark, Thelma  Mothershed, and Melba Pattillo Beals each chose to confront injustice  and inequality in a very visible and courageous way. These Arkansans  are now icons of the civil rights movement. Their actions and  willingness to step forward and face what they had to have known would  have been an incredibly difficult and emotional experience deserves  celebration and recognition. By resolving to carry out these actions at  such a young age, the Little Rock Nine set an example for Americans of  every age to follow. It takes courage to do the right thing in the face  of overwhelming adversity. That lesson has not been forgotten.   Arkansas has come a long way since the integration of Central High.  While there is still work left to be done, Arkansans are proud of the  progress we have made. Today, leaders and citizens across our State  come together to promote equality and celebrate our diversity.   The theme of the 60th anniversary celebration of Central High's  integration is ``Reflections of Progress.'' This is so appropriate  given that we have indeed made so much progress in the years that have  followed the tumultuous start to integration.   In an effort to ensure that the legacy of the Little Rock Nine lives  on, exhibits and items recognizing their contributions are on display  at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and  Culture in Washington, DC. The museum itself is a moving experience  that I highly recommend for every visitor to our Nation's Capital. For  Arkansans, we have an added incentive to visit in order to see the  displays that honor the brave actions and determination of these Little  Rock teens. We are also grateful that these items are on view for the  entire country to observe and reflect upon.   The integration of Central High School serves as a poignant reminder  of where we have been as a country but also of where we are headed. I  am eager to work with my fellow Arkansans and all Americans as we  pursue a better future for ourselves, our children, and our  grandchildren.   I am proud to support legislation introduced by my fellow Arkansas,  Senator Tom Cotton, to extend the boundary of the Little Rock Central  High School National Historic Site in order to preserve the surrounding  buildings. It is inspiring to know that our State is taking the  opportunity to appropriately mark this significant occasion.   I commend the city of Little Rock, the Little Rock School District,  and the Central High Integration 60th Anniversary Committee for the  hard work and preparation to properly honor and celebrate this historic  milestone. I thank all who have been involved in the planning of this  celebration. I know that it will provide many Arkansans the chance to  remember and reflect upon the Central High integration and the Little  Rock Nine and also to educate younger generations about the struggle  for equal rights. We will certainly build upon the celebration and take  another step forward by remembering our history and creating a brighter  tomorrow.   I yield the floor.
