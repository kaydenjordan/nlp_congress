 Mr. President, I rise to commend Agriculture Committee  Chairman Roberts and Ranking Member Stabenow for their leadership in  crafting a bipartisan farm bill that will help support our Nation's  farmers and growers, provide funding for critical agriculture research  programs, and make important investments in nutrition and food security  programs.   It is an exciting time for agriculture in Maine. In fact, according  to a recent study, Maine ranks first in the Nation for farming outlook,  which considers factors such as farmer age, percentage of beginning  farmers, and number of farms per 100 residents. According to the most  recent Census data, the share of Maine farms owned and operated by  farmers under the age of 45 is steadily growing. These factors show  that Maine farms are poised for continued growth and long-term success.   The bill we have just passed includes a number of provisions from the  Next Generation in Agriculture Act, which I introduced with Senator  Heitkamp, including a reauthorization of the Beginning Farmer and  Rancher Development Grant Program at a higher funding level. Since this  program was established nearly a decade ago, it has supported more than  60,000 beginning farmers across every region of the country. In Maine,  these grants have helped to build the capacity and skills of beginning  farmers, as well as implement a dairy farmer apprenticeship program.   Maine's agricultural resurgence has also been bolstered by a rapidly  expanding organic sector. According to the Maine Organic Farmers and  Gardeners Association, Maine's organic agriculture sector has grown 76  percent over the past 5 years alone. In 2017, the association certified  535 farmers and producers representing more than 90,000 acres of  farmland. The strong support for organic agriculture in this bill will  help ensure that this sector continues its growth.   Federal investment in organic agriculture research, however, has not  kept pace with the growth of organic producers. This bill incorporates  legislation I introduced with Senator Casey that will increase funding  for the Organic Agriculture Research and Extension Initiative, OREI.  These additional resources will help ensure our farmers and producers  benefit from the rising demand for organic products.   In addition to experiencing a resurgence in agriculture, Maine is  also in the midst of reorienting its forest products industry following  the downturn of traditional pulp and paper production in our State. I  am encouraged to see that the bill supports innovative wood products  research and development at institutions of higher learning. Based on  provisions of the Timber Innovation Act, which I have cosponsored, the  bill would authorize grants to advance the use of innovative wood  products. Priority would be given to proposals that include the use or  retrofitting of existing sawmill facilities with higher-than-average  unemployment rates, which could be helpful to States such as Maine that  are still recovering from the job losses from the closure of  traditional mills.   An amendment that I sponsored with Senator Cantwell to direct the  Forest Service to continue using remote sensing technologies when  conducting forest inventory and analysis activities has also been  incorporated. This technology is faster and less expensive  thanphysically surveying plots of land and would enable the Forest  Service to provide more accurate data to inform forest management  decisions.   The bill also includes a number of provisions from the Local FARMS  Act, legislation that I led with Senator Brown. One key provision  provides mandatory funding for the Organic Certification Cost-Share  Program, which helps to cover a portion of the costs associated with  obtaining or renewing organic certifications.   Another component from our Local FARMS Act is the Local Agriculture  Market Program, which will provide grants to support the development  and expansion of direct producer-to-consumer marketing, as well as  value-added agricultural products.   The bill also includes important provisions that help combat hunger,  including the Local FARMS Act's establishment of a Harvesting Health  pilot program through which fresh fruits and vegetables are provided to  low-income individuals and households, as well as the reauthorization  of the Seniors Farmers' Market Nutrition Program. The latter program is  critically important for combating hunger among seniors and is  complemented by the Farm Bill's reauthorization of the Commodity  Supplemental Food Program, also known as the Senior Food Box Program.  In an effort to help more seniors access and remain enrolled in the  Senior Food Box Program, I am pleased that the bill includes a  provision from legislation I authored with Senator Casey, the  Nourishing Our Golden Years Act, which would allow States to establish  a 3-year certification period for participants 60 years or older,  effectively simplifying the process to provide this much-needed  support.   The Specialty Crop Block Grant program that has been so vital for  farmers and producers in my State is reauthorized for another 5 years.  These grants support research and extension activities that address key  challenges facing specialty crops, including Maine's iconic potatoes  and lowbush blueberries, aiming to improve production efficiency,  address threats from pests and diseases, more accurately prevent and  monitor potential food safety hazards, and enhance crop  characteristics.   The bill also makes important investments to support the export of  U.S. agricultural products by reauthorizing both the Market Access  Program, MAP, and the Foreign Market Development Program, which are  critical to the success of Maine farmers and fishermen as they work to  remain competitive in the global marketplace. According to the Maine  International Trade Center, MAP has allowed Maine companies to expand  their markets and  [[Page S4726]]  create more local jobs by facilitating the promotion and sale of Maine  products like wild blueberries in the Middle East, maple syrup in  Central Africa, and shellfish in the Far East.   As we continue to promote products such as maple syrup abroad, we  must also ensure that we are not hindering their success here at home.  Pure maple sugar producers in my state have expressed serious concerns  with the ``added sugar'' requirements in the FDA's updated nutrition  facts label rule. The rule would require the label to state that all  sugar in the product is ``added sugar.'' While the FDA intended for the  rule to help consumers make better-informed dietary choices, it is  clear that the Agency's proposal instead creates confusion. Producers  believe that the term ``added sugar,'' when used with a single- ingredient sweetener such as pure maple syrup or honey, implies the  addition of another sugar like corn syrup.   I have raised this issue directly with FDA Commissioner Gottlieb, who  is open to considering other approaches proposed by the industry, and  have addressed it through language in the agriculture funding bill that  directs FDA to evaluate alternate labeling proposals. Although I am  encouraged to see that the FDA recently announced it would ``swiftly  formulate a revised approach that makes key information available to  consumers in a workable way,'' I have joined Senator King in offering  an amendment to help ensure that this problem is rectified.   Another reasonable reform I am pleased to see included is sponsored  by Senator Grassley. It closes a loophole allowing an unlimited number  of passive ``managers'' to be designated by farm entities for the  purpose of collecting farm subsidies. These subsidies are intended to  support workers who are truly ``actively engaged.'' This provision will  save an estimated $211 million, $100 million of which will be  reallocated to The Emergency Food Assistance Program, TEFAP, which  supports food pantries around the country.   It is a testament to the leadership of Chairman Roberts and Ranking  Member Stabenow that they have produced a strongly bipartisan farm  bill, and I am pleased to have supported it.                            ____________________
