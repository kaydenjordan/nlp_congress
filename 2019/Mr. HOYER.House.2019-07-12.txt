 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, before I get into the schedule, I know that all of our  thoughts are with my good friends in Louisiana and my good friend who  represents Louisiana, his constituents, and the people of Louisiana as  they brace for Tropical Storm Barry, expected to make landfall  tomorrow.   This is a serious storm, and, when combined with the flooding we have  already seen along the Mississippi, it poses a serious threat to the  safety and welfare of many.   We hope everyone is safe and taking the necessary steps to get out of  harm's way, and I want the gentleman from Louisiana to know how much we  are paying attention to his constituents in the State he represents and  the region he represents.    I know the gentleman is concerned. We share that concern,  and we share the concern for the people of south Louisiana.   Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for morning-hour  debate, 2 p.m. for legislative business, with votes postponed until  6:30 p.m.   On Tuesday and Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning- hour debate and noon for legislative business.   On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business.  Last votes of the week are expected no later than 3 p.m. on that  Thursday.  [[Page H5766]]                                     time  1345    Mr. Speaker, we will consider several bills under suspension of the  rules, including H.R. 748, Middle Class Health Benefits Tax Repeal Act  of 2019. A complete list of suspension bills will be announced by the  close of business today.   The House will consider H.R. 3494, the Intelligence Authorization  Act. I am pleased to say that the bill was approved by unanimous voice  vote in committee and would authorize funding and enable congressional  oversight of the U.S. intelligence community.   Mr. Speaker, the House will also consider a resolution to hold  Attorney General Barr and Secretary Ross in contempt over efforts to  ignore congressional subpoenas and subvert the 2020 Census with the  addition of a citizenship question meant only to deter minorities from  participating, leading to an undercount in parts of the country.   In addition, the House will also consider S.J. Res. 36, S.J. Res. 37,  and S.J. Res. 38.   Mr. Speaker, last month, the Senate passed 22 resolutions of  disapproval related to the Saudi-UAE arms sale for which the  administration declared an emergency, thereby bypassing the Congress of  the United States. The House will take up three of these resolutions  related to precision-guided munitions, the most controversial and  significant sales contemplated.   Lastly, the House will consider H.R. 582, Raise the Wage Act. This  legislation, authored by Chairman Scott, would gradually increase the  minimum wage to $15 by 2024. This bill is an important step toward  lifting millions of American workers out of poverty.   We believe that one should not be working a 40-hour week and still  remain under the poverty level in our country. We raise the minimum  wage for the first time in nearly a decade, essentially, 10 years.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his observations.  He, I think, told a partial story of the CBO study and some other  studies. Of course, he mentioned the city of Baltimore.   The problem with the city of Baltimore, as the mayor who vetoed it  indicated, was that next door, the minimum wage was lower. Had the  minimum wage been the same, there would not have been the same  transfer, I suggest to the gentleman.   That aside, he mentions the CBO report on the impact of gradually  raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. The minimum wage was last  raised in 2007. It then incrementally raised over 3 years to the  present $7.25. It has not been raised in a decade. The poorest workers  in America have not had a raise in 10 years.   We don't think that is right, as we see this extraordinary disparity  of income, where presidents of corporations now are making 1,500 times  what their average worker makes.   Very frankly, we are a consumer-based economy. Seventy percent of our  GDP is based upon consumers. If we raise their salaries, they are going  to spend more, grow the economy, and, I suggest, grow jobs, not shrink  jobs.    Let's look at the CBO study. The CBO study had a number of different  averages that were perceived, three of which were zero loss of jobs.  3.7 million was the maximum, not the average, the maximum loss.   I am not surprised that opponents of raising the minimum wage would  point to that as if it were the figure. It is a maximum, the worst-case  scenario.   We have a growing economy. I don't expect the worst-case scenario to  occur. The fact of the matter is that we believe that this bill and  this raise will have little, if any, adverse impact.   What we do know is this, which the gentleman did not mention. CBO  said the bill will give 27 million workers in America a raise, and that  the worst-case scenario--we don't want to see anybody lose their job-- would be 3.7 million, but the average would be less than 2 million.  That was their average estimate, and three of them were zero.   We believe that 27 million Americans, which will lift 1.3 million  Americans out of poverty, is something that will be good for America.  It will be good not only for those workers but good for business, for  families, for children, and, frankly, for all of us.   The benefits of the Raise the Wage Act for America's workers, in our  opinion, far outweigh any potential risk. We think the risk is minimal.   More than 10 years with no increase in the Federal minimum wage, I  might point out, Mr. Speaker, is the longest period since the adoption  of the minimum wage in 1938, the longest period we have gone without  raising the minimum wage.   Mr. Speaker, it has been 10 years since we Democrats were in the  majority. I point that out because the last time we were in the  majority, we passed and, very frankly, President Bush signed the raise  that was to $7.25 an hour. But this is the longest time in history it  hasn't been raised.   The Raise the Wage Act is a critical step, in my view, toward  restoring the value of work and ensuring that working families--we all  say we are for working families. Well, we ought to pay them, and we  ought to pay them a decent wage.   By the way, this raise is probably a very, very infinitesimal  percentage of the raises that those at the upper level, in the top 10  percent and the top 5 percent, have received.   This will allow working families to achieve some type of financial  security. We believe that is essential.  [[Page H5767]]    We are very pleased that this bill is moving forward, and we urge all  of our Members to support it.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I would simply say that he said the entire State of Maine. Maybe he  missed the fact that I said 27 million people, under this bill, are  going to get an increase in their salary and in their ability to  support themselves and their families. That, by the way, is about the  size, perhaps, of New York. It is not quite California, which is 38 or  39 million people. But 27 million are going to get a raise.   My suggestion is, and I believe this sincerely, that that increase  and raise, because they are consumers, those consumers all spend their  spendable money. They need it to support themselves, and that is going  to be an infusion.   When the gentleman says small business, I understand that. We all pay  it in the end because the consumer of services and goods is who will  pay it. We understand that. But not paying it perhaps advantages us  because some families can't support themselves and, very frankly, may  be on public assistance, so we pay for it one way or the other.   This is the right thing to do. Twenty-seven million Americans, that  is about a sixth, I think, of our workforce, somewhere in that  neighborhood, are going to get a raise under this bill.   I hope that the estimate of 1.3 million is wrong. I think it is  wrong, as I explained. If everybody is doing the same, then the  employer that needs to have things done is going to get those things  done. He or she will be on a competitive level because others will be  doing the same thing, in terms of the level of pay. They won't be  competing with people who are paying their folks at a very low level,  and people will be able to survive.   I understand the gentleman's position. By the way, I would say the  gentleman's argument has been made since 1938.                                time  1400    Every time the minimum wage came up for increase, we have heard this.  I didn't hear it in `38, I want to make that very clear. But that  argument has been made every time the minimum wage, while I have been  involved in this floor over the last 30 years, has been made. And I  suggest to you, as a result of the raising of the minimum wage, our  economy has been better, it has grown more, people have been better  off, and we have had a better country.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I think we have exhausted that subject. I think the positions have  not changed since 1938, and I don't expect them to change in the next  few minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   We did have a meeting, and in a bipartisan fashion, I think we are  all hopeful that we can pass the USMCA.   I was here when we passed NAFTA, as was the Speaker. There were a  number of promises made, as the gentleman knows from his knowing  experience of NAFTA. We are very focused, as the gentleman knows, on  workers' rights, environmental protections, the price of  [[Page H5768]]  biologics, and the length of time that they would be protected from  generic competition and bringing prices down.   But we are, as we discussed in the meeting to which the gentleman  referred where we met with the Prime Minister of Canada, Mr. Trudeau,  and many of his Cabinet, we are very concerned about enforcement. We  want to say if we make this agreement that it will, in fact, be  enforced. And, as the gentleman knows, there were meetings as late as  yesterday on this issue.   The good news is, as the gentleman probably knows, Ambassador  Lighthizer has great respect and confidence on both sides of the aisle.  I would say that he is one of those people who both sides of the aisle  believe is credible, knowledgeable, straightforward and an honest  broker. So we are working very hard with him.   Almost every Democrat has said we are trying to get to ``yes'' on  this. I don't think you have heard many Democrats, if any, say we are  not for this agreement.   So I am hopeful that we can get there, personally. I think this is an  improvement over the existing NAFTA.   I would say, however, that I think it would be a mistake if, in fact,  we don't get to an agreement, which I hope we will, to back out of  NAFTA, as the President has indicated. I think that would cause chaos  in our economy and with respect to Canada and Mexico, as well. So I  think that would not be a good policy. But I think a good policy would  be, if we can get enforcement and the assurances that the agreements  that are made will, in fact, be carried out by all parties, then,  hopefully, we can get this done.   Whether we can get this done by the August break, can't make that  representation to the gentleman, which does not surprise him, I am  sure. But I can tell you, yesterday, as you know, there was work being  done on it, and I trust that there will be work being done on it in the  coming days. And if we can get to an agreement, we will move it as  quickly as possible.    But we may need to make sure that the protections that are referenced  in the document will, in fact, be the protections that are affected and  enforceable.   I thank the gentleman.    I thank the gentleman for his comment,   Joe Wilson, of  course, a member of his party.     Joe Wilson filed that bill five Congresses ago, 8 years ago, and it  languished. It was not brought to the floor. It did not pass.   I understand the gentleman's concern, but he ought to also reflect  upon the fact that   Joe Wilson introduced it four Congresses ago, so  that we have now included it in the bill. We think it was a proper  provision to have in our bill.   Of course, all your people voted against that bill, and I would  observe, they voted against a bill that, frankly, the chairman of your  committee, now the ranking member, wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street  Journal that said the appropriate level of funding was exactly what we  put in our bill. The Joint Chiefs of Staff said that the figure for  2020 was 733.   I was deeply regretful that a bill which was the figure that Mr.  Thornberry put forward in an editorial in The Wall Street Journal--and,  I might say, I had conversations with him subsequent to that, recently,  which confirmed to me that he still held that view.   Notwithstanding that, every one of your Republicans voted against it.  And it was the largest--there was this complaint about the size of the  military pay raise. It was the largest raise for our military in 10  years. Now, we were in charge 10 years ago and we are now back in  charge, which means we have had the two largest raises, and that was  included in your MTR.   Mr. Speaker, I would hope the whip would, as we do so often, work in  a bipartisan fashion on these issues. The committee did work in a  bipartisan fashion. I am very disappointed that this was made a  political issue. Mr. Speaker, it was made a political issue on the  theory that maybe the Democrats can't pass this bill, and if we all  vote against it, we will say: Look, the Democrats don't support  defense.   Mr. Speaker, we did pass that bill. We passed it with over 218  votes--220, to be exact--and it included some very, very important  things for our men and women in uniform, for weapons systems, for  operations, for training to strengthen our national security.   It was turned into, in my opinion, Mr. Speaker, a partisan issue, and  that is sad and unfortunate because, at least on the national security  of which I have been supportive for 38 years--I supported much of the  Reagan buildup. I supported the deployment of missiles in Europe. I  supported the MX missile, which was somewhat controversial in my  district. I did it because I thought America needed to be strong and to  make sure the world knew we were going to be strong.    When you talk about   Joe Wilson's amendment, which we included in  our bill, which you were supportive of and I think the level of funding  was also, frankly, intellectually supported, if not politically  supported, I regret that we did not have a bipartisan vote on the  defense bill.   With respect to his specific question, I respond to the whip, Mr.  Speaker: We hope this bill is signed. If not, we hope it goes to  conference. We hope we have a conference agreement, Mr. Speaker, and we  hope that the Wilson amendment is kept in the conference report.  [[Page H5769]]         Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman specify what they were?    Mr. Speaker, obviously, we could debate a bill we just  passed, a bill that has been debated on this floor for 3 days, a bill  that was chairmanned and supported by somebody equally, if not more,  bipartisan in terms of his work over the years on this matter of  defense, Adam Smith, period.   It is a good bill, Mr. Speaker. It takes care of the men and women.  It provides them the necessary resources. And, yes, it says we ought to  have a new AUMF that is now 18 years old.   With respect to the pay raise that was going to happen anyway, I  presume that the gentleman refers to the recommendation of the  President of the United States, a Republican. We took the  recommendations of the President of the United States and put it in our  bill. It is higher than any figure that was put in for our men and  women in uniform during the previous 10 years that the Republicans  controlled the House and controlled this bill.   There were poison pills, from my perspective, in the defense bills in  years past. I now note that I voted against those bills when they  passed the House. I voted for the conference committee when it came  back.    I am hopeful that the Republicans will decide that the rhetoric they  used, ``If you vote against this bill,'' meaning the defense bill, to  our side, ``you vote against the men and women in the Armed Forces, the  men and women in uniform, the men and women at the point of the  spear,'' I hope you will remember that language, Mr. Speaker. I hope my  Republican colleagues will remember that language. Now, apparently, it  doesn't apply.   This was a good bill. That was a bill worked on in a bipartisan  fashion.   I will tell the whip, Mr. Speaker, that I had conversations with some  of the top Republican leaders on that committee with respect to funding  levels. I was told that the funding levels that were in our bill, as  the Joint Chiefs said and as the ranking member said in an editorial in  The Wall Street Journal, were appropriate levels that will fund the  priorities of our country and the needs of our national security, Mr.  Speaker.   Certainly, I hope that the Senate and the House can work on this. By  the way, the Senate number is the same as our number as it relates to  compensation, I believe, for members of the Armed Forces.   I would hope, Mr. Speaker, when this bill comes back from conference,  that we will have agreement, will pass it, and will send it to the  President for signature. That is the way it ought to be.   I am sorry that we didn't get significant support, as is almost  always the case, except when political games were played, not just that  items were put in that the Republicans didn't like or the Democrats  didn't like. There were a lot of things in the defense bills that I  [[Page H5770]]  voted for that I didn't like, but I thought the overall bill was a bill  that supported our troops and supported our national security, as I  think this bill did. We will see.    Mr. Speaker, I only want to say that I do not accept the  premise that anything in this bill we just passed with a majority vote  undermines training, operations, or acquisitions, period.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet on Monday next, when it shall  convene at noon for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative  business.
