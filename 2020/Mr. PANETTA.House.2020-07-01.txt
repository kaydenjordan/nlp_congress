 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and honor the life  of the mayor of Salinas, California, Joe Gunter.   Mayor Gunter passed on Monday after a quick bout, unfortunately, with  cancer.   Mayor Gunter was a true public servant, who truly understood what it  means and what it takes to live up to our obligations as Americans--to  give back to his country and community--that gives all of us so much.   Right out of high school, Mayor Gunter joined the Marines where he  served and fought in Vietnam. Right out of his service to our country,  Mayor Gunter joined the Salinas Police Department where he proudly  served and protected for 32 years.   And right out of that service to our community, Mayor Gunter then  volunteered at a Women's Crisis Center, in youth sports, for the  Salinas Air Show, and the California Rodeo.   But that wasn't enough. Because right out of retirement, Joe then  served as mayor of Salinas for the past 8 years. And I can tell you, as  Mayor Joe knew well that it really wasn't about the snarkiness of your  tweets, it is about making government work for people.   Joe would tell you he wasn't much for politics, but when it came to  serving the people of Salinas, Mayor Gunter was the best. Because Joe  knew dang well that good governing is good politics.   My prayers are with his wife, Lisa, his children, and his  grandchildren. I hope they take comfort knowing that although Joe will  be missed, his legacy of service will always endure with the people of  this country and the community of Salinas, California.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I am proud to have supported H.R. 2, the  Moving Forward Act.   This comprehensive infrastructure package will make clean energy  investments, create more affordable housing, and improve broadband  across the United States.   I am proud that H.R. 2 included many of my bills, including the green  bus tax credit, so that Monterey-Salinas Transit and Santa Cruz METRO,  in my district, can get their fleets of zero-emission buses on the  roads and also my Clean Energy Production Parity Act to support linear  generators manufactured in California.   H.R. 2 also includes my amendments to increase the Reforestation  Trust Fund for more job-creating environmental infrastructure and to  give greater flexibility to communities using EDA funding so that we  can better target Federal funding for economic recovery projects.   It is past time to address the infrastructure needs of our country.  That is why I urge my colleagues in the Senate to, hopefully, take up  and pass H.R. 2, so that we can continue to move our country forward to  meet the challenges of tomorrow.                            ____________________
