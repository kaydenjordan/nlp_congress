 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Coronavirus  Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act.   This legislation takes major steps to support American workers and  families during this unprecedented time. It provides increased funding  to get our healthcare workers essential supplies and equipment. It also  helps small businesses that have been asked to close their doors and  sacrifice their livelihoods for everyone's health and safety.   This bill is not perfect. I am disappointed that we are paying for  things that don't have anything to do with COVID-19, and I am concerned  about inadvertent damage we may be doing to our seasonal businesses by  incentivizing people to stay at home rather than going back to work  once shelter-in-place restrictions are lifted.   Small, seasonal businesses are the lifeblood of Michigan's First  District, and, as we implement this policy, I will do everything I can  to prevent unintended consequences from happening. The people of  Michigan's First District are resilient. We have survived hardships  before, and we will again.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
