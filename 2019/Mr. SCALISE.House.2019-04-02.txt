 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the House on an  important issue, and maybe the most important issue, Mr. Speaker, and  that is the issue of life.  [[Page H2942]]    We brought a bill forward, H.R. 962, the Born-Alive Abortion  Survivors Protection Act. This is a bill, Mr. Speaker, that many wonder  why is it even necessary that we need a law to say that if a baby is  born alive, outside of the womb, we need to give it the full  protections under law.   Many people ask, Mr. Speaker, why isn't that already protected? If a  baby is born alive, it should have the full protections of anybody  else. And yet, as we see in States like New York and other States  around the country, they allow, in those States, the baby, even after  it is born alive, to be killed. To me, Mr. Speaker, that is murder, and  yet, in many States, they don't have the full protection that all of us  enjoy. How could that be, in the United States of America, that a baby  born alive can still be killed after it is born outside of the womb?   This issue transcends the abortion debate. In fact, people across  every spectrum--Republicans, Democrats, and Independents, even people  who align themselves as pro-choice--believe it is wrong to murder the  baby after it is born alive, and yet it is still allowed. There should  be no reason that this is a gray issue.   Today, Mr. Speaker, I will be joining my colleague, Ann Wagner, the  lead author of this bill, to start a discharge petition: an opportunity  for every Member of Congress to make their voices heard loud and clear  that this bill ought to come to this floor for a full debate and,  ultimately, for a vote.   We ought to pass this law, Mr. Speaker. There should be no doubt. It  shouldn't be a partisan issue. It shouldn't be an issue that we have  disagreement over, and yet we do. For whatever reason, the Speaker will  not allow this bill, though, to come up for a vote. We have tried time  after time to move unanimous consent to bring this bill to the floor  and, for months, that motion has been denied.   The most vulnerable among us should no longer be denied that  protection under the law. Mr. Speaker, this bill has to come up for a  vote. This bill has to be debated by the people's House.   Why not allow people all across the country to participate in this  debate? As they find out about it, the reaction I get is not a debate  on political lines, it is shock that this isn't already law.   Every baby born alive, Mr. Speaker, ought to have the full protection  under law that is currently provided to all of us. H.R. 962 should be  one of the easiest things that we pass through this House, yet,  unfortunately, it has become one of the most difficult. But that is  okay, Mr. Speaker. We know that it is the difficult things that we come  here to do, not the easy, because it would have already been done.   So we are going to be leading the charge today, standing with people  all across the country. And, in fact, we are actually bringing in  people, Mr. Speaker, who survived an attempted abortion. It happens all  across this country. And when that baby is born alive, that baby ought  to have the full protection under the law. We will start the process  today to ensure that that full debate happens and, ultimately, that the  vote happens to pass the Born Alive Act.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to sign on to this discharge  petition.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for  his leadership on healthcare.   First of all, Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this resolution,  which has nothing to do with actually helping improve healthcare, the  costs, especially, that so many millions of people are enduring,  because the Affordable Care Act is anything but affordable.   Mr. Speaker, let's keep in mind what this resolution is about. It is  not about changing any healthcare policy. It doesn't do that. It has  been made clear. It is attempting just to try to take cheap shots at  the President while diverting attention away from what this lawsuit  that you see moving through the courts is really all about.   Mr. Speaker, if the healthcare law that my friends on the other side  of the aisle rushed through Congress and passed is held  unconstitutional, they have nobody to blame but themselves. Let's keep  in mind--and they want you to forget this, Mr. Speaker--and let's go  back to those days when they rammed this bill through and the infamous  statement: You have to pass the bill to find out what is in it.   Nobody read that bill who voted for it. We said back then that it was  unconstitutional.   And, oh, by the way, not only was it that, but it has actually led to  dramatic increases in cost for families. So someone with a preexisting  condition--whom we want to protect, by the way, Mr. Speaker. But we  don't just want to protect the fact that they shouldn't be able to have  costs go up. We want to help them lower the costs for health insurance  and lower their premiums.   So many millions of Americans are not only facing double-digit  increases, but people with preexisting conditions, in many cases, are  facing a $10,000 deductible, so they have no access to healthcare, Mr.  Speaker.   Why don't we focus on the underlying problem?   We on the Republican side support protecting people with preexisting  conditions, but we also want to lower their premiums and lower their  deductibles. The other side wants to see their costs continue to go up.  That is the biggest difference between the two sides.   We ought to focus on lowering premiums. Let families make those  decisions, not unelected bureaucrats in Washington. That is what we  ought to be focused on. This resolution falls short.
