 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 382, the  Pandemic is Over Act.   A public health emergency was first declared by Health and Human  Services Secretary Alex Azar in January 2020. It was a different time.  We knew little about the novel coronavirus that was overtaking the  world. We didn't understand how it worked. We had no way to treat it or  reduce the spread.   Now, over 3 years later, the landscape has completely changed.  Reliable vaccines, tests, and treatments are widely available.  Businesses are open, Americans are traveling freely, and folks are  ready and willing to get back to work.   As I have said from the beginning, it is unlikely we will ever fully  rid ourselves of the coronavirus, but it can, and indeed has, become  something we have the ability to deal with. Society can and should be  returning to normal.   Even President Biden acknowledged as much in an interview last  September, more than 4 months ago, when he said the COVID-19 pandemic  is over. Yet this administration has continued to extend the length of  the public health emergency, using it to retain fear in the American  people and to justify continued requests for Federal funding.  [[Page H533]]    In absence of the administration's willingness to immediately  rightfully end the public health emergency declaration, it is time for  Congress to act.   I am grateful to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie) for  bringing this bill forward. I urge all my colleagues to support a  formal end to the public health emergency declaration.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 75, I call up  the bill (H.R. 497) to eliminate the COVID-19 vaccine mandate on health  care providers furnishing items and services under certain Federal  health care programs, and ask for its immediate consideration in the  House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks on the  legislation and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 497.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 497, the Freedom for  Health Care Workers Act, introduced by my Energy and Commerce Committee  colleague Representative Duncan.   I want to start by making one thing clear: I believe in the safety  and effectiveness of vaccines. I am a physician. I am pro-vaccine. At  the same time, I am conservative, and I believe in individual choice.  It is my firm conviction that, whenever possible, the Federal  Government should leave decisionmaking to State or local authorities.   Additionally, my background in medicine has informed my belief that  medical decisions are extremely personal and should be made by  individuals in consultation with their doctors.   So, at the end of 2021, when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  Services announced a decision to mandate that healthcare workers  receive a COVID-19 vaccine to remain employed, I opposed the decision.  I believed this move by the Biden administration to be unnecessary,  inappropriate, and a net harm to our healthcare system as a whole.   That is why my colleague Vern Buchanan and I led a letter with 113  other Members outlining our opposition to the mandate and our concerns.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record that letter in opposition to the  mandate.                                      Congres of the United States,                                        House of Representatives,                                   Washington, DC, December 6, 2021.      Hon. Chiquita Brooks-LaSure,      Administrator, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services,           Baltimore, MD.        Dear Administrator Brooks-LaSure: The COVID-19 pandemic has       taken a significant toll on the American public both       physically and emotionally for almost two years. In that       time, though, multiple vaccines have become widely available       for those wishing to  [[Page H540]]       be vaccinated. According to the Mayo Clinic, nearly 60       percent of the United States population over the age of 12 is       fully vaccinated, including over 83 percent of the Medicare-      aged population.        Thankfully, the United States has seen an overall decrease       in new COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths since       vaccines became readily available, and while we are not yet       out of the woods, many are saying the end of the pandemic is       in sight. Former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner       Scott Gottlieb, M.D. recently stated the pandemic ``may well       be over'' by January 4, which is the deadline the Centers for       Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) set for complying with       either its vaccination mandate or enforcing the continued use       of masks and weekly testing.        At a time when we are facing a growing health care       workforce shortage--including a projected physician shortage       of more than 100,000 by 2034--implementing a federal vaccine       mandate will only serve to exacerbate the problem. By your       own admission, ``[t]hese requirements will apply to       approximately 76,000 providers and cover over 17 million       health care workers across the country.'' It is difficult, if       not impossible, to reconcile the rationale for implementing a       mandate like this at the tail end of the pandemic while we,       as a nation, are struggling to staff hospitals, physician       offices and other ancillary providers.        We fully support your agency's goal of ``[e]nsuring patient       safety and protection,'' but if seniors are unable to access       care because their provider no longer participates in the       Medicare program, this rule will undermine its stated goal.       By subjecting providers to egregious federal overreach, our       nation's most vulnerable populations will be at risk and       America's seniors will bear the brunt of any provider loss       due to non-compliance with this heavy-handed and       constitutionally dubious vaccine mandate. Americans are       quitting their jobs at a record pace, and this new federal       mandate will only make matters worse and keep more Americans       out of the workforce.        There are over 54 million Medicare-aged Americans, and it       is our duty as Members of Congress representing those seniors       to ensure they maintain access to their preferred health care       provider. This is especially true when that means opposing an       administrative agency's actions that will lead to fewer       options for our constituents; longer wait times; and the       inevitability of adverse health outcomes due to fewer       available providers.        We strongly urge you to abandon implementing this onerous       new rule and instead heed current statistics that show       seniors are vaccinated at a higher rate than the rest of the       population of vaccinated Americans while also uniquely       vulnerable to disruptions in the health care system and       consider the potentially negative consequences this mandate       will have on the size and strength of our health care       workforce. To truly ensure patient safety and protection, we       must preserve Americans' access to their preferred providers       rather than impose a new one-size-fits-all federal mandate on       our nation's health care providers at a time when they can       least afford it.

CMS does not impose such a  mandate for any other vaccine. Furthermore, the vaccine, while  effective at preventing severe disease and death, is not shown to  totally prevent transmission of the virus.   It was difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile the rationale for  implementing a mandate like this at the tail end of the pandemic while  we as a Nation are struggling to staff hospitals, physician offices,  and other ancillary providers.   Our Nation's healthcare system was already facing a growing  healthcare workforce shortage, including a projected physician shortage  of more than 100,000 by 2034. I was worried--and, indeed, we saw it  play out--that implementing a Federal vaccine mandate would only serve  to exacerbate the problem.   For example, in my home State, Indiana University lost 125 employees  as a direct result of the vaccine requirement, and that is just one  small example. Thousands of individuals across the country either  resigned or were let go due to this mandate.   Now, over a year later, despite several lawsuits rising through the  courts questioning the validity of this exact rule, the Biden  administration continues to enforce this mandate.   Today's bill does what the Biden administration will not. It ends the  onerous mandate imposed by a Federal Government agency on the American  people. It provides important autonomy to healthcare workers and  critical relief to hospitals and other facilities that continue to face  staff shortages.   My Democratic colleagues will say that this mandate was worth it,  that repealing it will hurt healthcare workers or patients they serve.  I haven't seen any data to suggest that.   What we do know is that 95 percent of Americans have either been  vaccinated or had COVID-19. We know the vaccine no longer totally  prevents transmission of COVID-19.   CMS' vaccine mandate won't end with the public health emergency on  May 11 or sooner if the previous bill that we just debated goes into  law. It will go on indefinitely unless the administration rescinds it  or Congress takes action.   Given that the administration threatened to veto this legislation, it  doesn't seem like they plan to reverse course, so Congress must step  in.   We are not taking away anyone's ability to get vaccinated. Healthcare  workers can and should protect themselves, including getting vaccinated  if they choose. Nor are we taking away the ability of individual health  systems to make decisions about what vaccinations they may require.                                time  1515    For instance, many healthcare systems have required employees to get  a flu shot for many years. The Federal Government simply shouldn't  demand they do so.   Federal bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., do not know the needs of  Hoosiers in my district or many Americans across the country and must  not be allowed to make medical decisions on their behalf.   Mr. Speaker, for all of these reasons, I urge my colleagues to  support H.R. 497 here today, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I just want to remind everyone that I am a  physician, and I support vaccination. I just don't support the Federal  Government mandating it. If local facilities want to mandate  vaccination, that is up to them. I just don't believe the Federal  Government at CMS should do it. Also, in recent history, the only ones  who have cut Medicare are the administration and the Democrats, not  Republicans.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina  (Mr. Duncan), the primary sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I just want to remind everyone that CMS  doesn't mandate any other vaccine, and this also doesn't preclude local  hospital systems, local governments, or State governments from  mandating a vaccine.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.  Guthrie), the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on  Health.    Mr. Speaker, I support vaccination of healthcare  workers. I just don't think that CMS should be mandating it nationally.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Carter), a pharmacist.    Mr. Speaker, no one is endangered by this legislation.  As I have said before, it doesn't prevent healthcare facilities from  requiring a COVID vaccine for their employees.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Pfluger).    Mr. Speaker, CMS mandates one vaccine, COVID-19. They  don't mandate any other vaccines. That doesn't mean healthcare workers  don't get the COVID-19 vaccine.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington  (Mrs. Rodgers), the chairwoman of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, viral diseases like measles have been  around for centuries. COVID-19 likely will also be persistent.   So, when do my Democratic colleagues propose that this Federal  mandate end? I propose that we pass this legislation and end it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida  (Mrs. Cammack).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Iowa (Mrs. Miller-Meeks), who is a physician.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Iowa.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Georgia (Ms. Greene).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Alford).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Van Duyne).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Murphy), who is a physician.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time remains  on each side?    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I say again that I am a physician. I was a practicing  physician for 15 years before I came into Congress. I am pro-vaccine. I  believe that the COVID-19 vaccine saves lives and prevents serious  illness. I have been vaccinated myself and boosted. My family has taken  the vaccines.   That is not what this is about, Mr. Speaker. What this is about is a  Federal mandate to force medical decisions on individual American  citizens.   Again, it also doesn't stop local hospitals, like my hospitals in  Evansville, Indiana, from requiring the COVID-19 vaccine for their  employees. I think we have a disconnect here about what this  legislation is actually about. It is actually about Federal control at  CMS. Again, CMS has only mandated one vaccine, and that is the COVID-19  vaccine.   Mr. Speaker, I agree with my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle that vaccines save lives, but I also think it should be a  personal choice, and that is what this is about. We need to get past  this because, as I mentioned earlier, other viral diseases like the  measles have been around literally for centuries--centuries--so when  does a Federal vaccine mandate for COVID-19 end?   When do we come to an end point, say, okay, the risk is so low that  we are not going to mandate from CMS that you get a medical treatment  that you may not want or you lose your job?   Now, again, I reiterate, if your local hospital or medical facility  says, look, this is part of our employment requirement, okay, that is  up to them, but not the Federal Government.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Allen).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reiterate again that as a physician, I  support vaccination for healthcare workers if they choose to do so or  if their local medical facility says it is a requirement for them to be  employed at that facility. I just don't support the Federal Government  mandating it nationwide because they don't mandate any other vaccine,  and they never have that I am aware of.   So there are all kinds of other things in medicine that I wish people  would do:   I wish people would get screened for colon cancer.   I wish people would get their mammograms.   I wish people would get their pap smears.   I wish people would get their prostates checked.   The reality is it is a free country. We are not going to mandate all  of those things, are we?   We could, I guess.   This is just another medical treatment that people should have the  freedom to choose. The Federal Government shouldn't be mandating it.   Again, I can't be more clear, and other doctors that have spoken  today have said, ``we believe in vaccinations.'' In fact, we did public  service announcements supporting it. We just don't believe that CMS  should be mandating this for healthcare workers, and that this mandate  should end.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 497, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
