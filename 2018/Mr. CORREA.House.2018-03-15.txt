 Madam Speaker, I rise in honor of a remarkable member of  my staff and a remarkable member of my community, Bob Banuelos, who  passed away suddenly last week.   Bob spent over 30 years working for the people of Orange County.  Before joining my team, he also worked for my predecessor,  Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez.   Bob had deep roots in our community. He grew up on a small family  farm in Fountain Valley and was a long-time member of the Orange County  political environment.   Bob worked for the less fortunate throughout his community, and he  was a friend to everybody he met.   Bob was also the first Native American candidate to run for Congress  in Orange County in 1992, and he came close to winning. He changed  Orange County politics forever.   I am saddened by his passing. He devoted his life to making Orange  County a better place for everybody to live. We will all miss him, and  we will never forget him.                            ____________________
