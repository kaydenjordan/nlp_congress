 Madam Speaker, rather than working across the aisle to  advance a bipartisan highway bill, as they are attempting to do in the  Senate, House Democrats have jammed a partisan bill through to the  floor that puts America on a road to nowhere.   This bill is nothing but a partisan wish list that prioritizes the  Green New Deal agenda over the core needs of our Nation's  infrastructure, like roads and bridges. In fact, the bill before us  would actually prevent the building of new roads, ripping away the  ability of States to prioritize the needs of local communities.   I was sent to Washington to ensure our government is transparent and  accountable for every action it takes. Spending $1 out of every $2 to  comply with Green New Deal mandates is absolutely ludicrous.   I will not accept a deal that puts big cities and Big Government over  the interests of the American taxpayers who I represent in rural  America.   We are willing and open to negotiating realistic ways to rebuild our  highways and infrastructure, but it must be done in a fiscally  responsible manner and not through deficit spending.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this misguided piece of  legislation.
