 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the I life of  Ronnie Lopez, a beloved men to, and community leader in Arizona. Lopez  is intimately known around the Valley by many for his efforts  championing public policies and civic engagement for Phoenix's Latino  community.   Born in the small mining town of Miami, AZ, Ronnie was raised  alongside his two older brothers by his hard-working mother, who  cleaned houses and worked in the area mines to provide for their  family. Ronnie's professional career in Phoenix began in them id 1960s  as a field representative for the Arizona State Civil Rights  Commission, where he investigated discrimination allegations. Shortly  after, Ronnie extended his expertise to Chicanos Por La Causa, an  organization dedicated to supporting underserved Latinos in Phoenix,  and was elected justice of the peace in West Phoenix. In 1978, Ronnie  accepted a position to serve on the staff of Arizona Governor Bruce  Babbitt, where he championed better housing and education for the  Latino community. In the many years that followed, Ronnie ran his own  consulting firm--working with government leaders, businesses, and  public campaigns to facilitate change for Arizonans in need. In what  free time he had left, Ronnie endeavored to mentor many of Arizona's  young public servants, some of whom serve as elected officials today.  Above all else, those who had the pleasure of working with Ronnie will  remember him for his selflessness.   Please join me in honoring life of Ronnie Lopez, a devoted leader,  mentor, and personal friend whose impact will not be forgotten.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of  Dr. Gabriel Lopez-Plascencia--Dr. Lopez--a well-known physician from  metro-Phoenix who practiced medicine for over six decades. Dr. Lopez  was the primary physician for many low-income families living in  Phoenix's underserved communities.   Born in Jalisco, Mexico, Dr. Lopez attended the University of  Guadalajara before eventually moving to the United States and enlisting  in the Arizona National Guard as a medical officer. He served the  Arizona Guard for 20 years, retiring as a lieutenant colonel. Even the  he continued to support and collaborate with the Guard through  additional activations until the mid 1990s. In addition to his military  service, Dr. Lopez made a point to make his services available to  indigent populations in South Phoenix, where poverty has affected  predominantly Latino communities for decades. As an active Mexican  American, he was also one of the founding members of the Mexican  American Chamber of Commerce in Phoenix. Dr. Lopez's community-oriented  spirit, expertise, and dedication to service contributed to the health  of many Arizona working families and allowed them to seek the American  dream just as he did many years ago.   Please join me in honoring the life of Dr. Gabriel Lopez-Plascencia,  a passionate doctor, surgeon, and servant to Arizonans, who will be  dearly missed. The impact Dr. Lopez has left in our hearts, his  community, and our State will be felt eternally.                            ____________________
