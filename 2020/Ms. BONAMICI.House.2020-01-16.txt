 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.J.  Res. 76, which will reverse the Trump administration's harmful new  borrower defense rule.   The initial borrower defense rule was designed to provide defrauded  students with the debt relief they are entitled to receive under the  Higher Education Act. Unfortunately, Secretary DeVos rewrote the rule  to make it nearly impossible for future students who are victimized by  deceptive institutions to get the relief they need and deserve.   According to the Department's own estimate, only about 3 percent of  the loan debt held by defrauded borrowers would be dismissed under the  new rule. That is not justice for victims of fraud.   We must also continue our work to update the Higher Education Act to  prevent unscrupulous institutions from harming students and taxpayers  in the first place. The College Affordability Act will hold  institutions accountable and make college more affordable and equitable  for everyone.   I urge my colleagues to support H.J. Res. 76 today and the College  Affordability Act when it comes to the floor.
