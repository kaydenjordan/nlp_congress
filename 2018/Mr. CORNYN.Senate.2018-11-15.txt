 Mr. President, I know looking back on the last 2 years  since the 2016 election, time has flown, but it is important to reflect  on what we have been able to accomplish, and, really, it is pretty  remarkable. These are not just political accomplishments; these are  things that have improved the lives of our constituents--the American  people.   As time is running out on the 115th Congress leading up to the  holidays, yesterday I spoke about some of our larger accomplishments.  Today I want to highlight some of the other important accomplishments  we have made. Because they weren't particularly controversial, you  didn't see them reported in cable news or in the media or the subject  of massive social media campaigns. In addition, there are the economic  gains we have seen from passing historic tax reform to the regulatory  rollback we have seen, which has unleashed the American economy. We  have also passed important public safety legislation, like the opioid  legislation, which is designed to help thousands of Americans suffering  from drug addiction. It is important to remember the grim statistic  that last year alone, 72,000 Americans died from drug overdoses, 50,000  died from opioid overdoses, which include prescription drugs, fentanyl  and heroin, most of which come from Mexico. I will touch on that in a  moment.   A little over a year ago, the gulf coast of Texas sustained a rain  event the likes of which we hope we will never see again. This was  called Hurricane Harvey, but instead of damaging winds, in addition, we  had incredible amounts of rain, with catastrophic flooding that left  Texans dealing with months-long recovery efforts that are still going  on today.   I was proud to join with not only my Texas colleagues but also  colleagues across the aisle in both Chambers to pass three separate  disaster relief bills totaling $147 billion for Hurricane Harvey aid,  as well as the other natural disasters affecting other parts of the  country. About $30 billion of that, I think, is Texas-specific, more or  less, in terms of the needs, in terms of the resources that were  required not only to recover but also to help mitigate future threats.  We know it does little good to fix the problem today if it is going to  be repeated tomorrow, and we know Hurricane Harvey is not the last  hurricane and the last rain event we are going to have. So we  authorized a coastal study that will ultimately lead us to construction  of a coastal spine that will help protect the important gulf coast  region, where most of the refining capacity in the country is located-- and we know that is a national priority--as well as the flood  mitigation projects I mentioned a moment ago, by authorizing and  funding the Army Corps of Engineers.   We tried to listen--and I did in Texas--to what our constituents said  they needed most, and we passed two other pieces of legislation  particularly relating to the disaster.   First, we made houses of worship eligible for certain FEMA grants to  help  [[Page S7023]]  them rebuild after disasters. The second was a tax relief provision  similar to the one we passed after Hurricane Katrina, which gave Texans  the ability to deduct their property damage costs and access retirement  savings on an emergency basis without penalties. Providing that relief  was a big help to my constituents.   Disasters tend to bring out the best in all of us because it causes  us to do things we didn't know we could actually do. The Texas spirit  was perhaps one of the things that was most reassuring following the  disasters, and it never wavered.   We saw that spirit again rallied around a community after an  unthinkable act of violence at Sutherland Springs, TX, that left 26  people dead and 20 more wounded. Because the U.S. Air Force had failed  to upload a felony conviction for domestic violence into the FBI's  criminal background check system, the shooter in that case was able to  acquire multiple firearms by simply lying about his criminal background  record. So we came together, in a bipartisan way, to pass a bill I  introduced called the Fix NICS Act--NICS is the National Instant  Criminal Background Check System, hence the name--that fixed or at  least took great strides toward fixing our broken background check  system to ensure that violent criminals can't easily acquire firearms  when they are convicted and ineligible under existing law.    We saw that resiliency arise out of another tragedy at Santa Fe High  School, where we passed the STOP School Violence Act. I am not  suggesting that by passing legislation, we are going to magically wave  our wand and stop acts of violence, but we can do things that provide  planning, training, safety infrastructure, and law enforcement support  for our schools to make them a less soft target.   In an open society, I doubt we will ever be able to stop all acts of  violence, but I think these are intended and will have a constructive  effect and actually save lives.   A third way we spoke on the issue of public safety in our communities  was through another bill I introduced called the Project Safe  Neighborhoods Act that was signed into law earlier this year. It passed  the Senate unanimously. People think everything is divided here along  political lines. Well, we actually pass legislation like this  unanimously in the Senate. It authorized the Project Safe Neighborhoods  Program at the Department of Justice, which aims to reduce violent  crimes by pairing local, State, and Federal law enforcement officials  with Federal prosecutors and using tough Federal laws to prosecute gun  crimes. These partnerships are proven to reduce violent crimes and  deserve our full support. We have also come together to provide help to  victims of crime and for the vulnerable.   The President has signed into law three bills I introduced that built  upon my work when I was attorney general of Texas. The first is called  the SAFER Act, which is aimed at reducing the backlog of untested rape  kits in forensic labs. The second is called the Justice Served Act,  which assists law enforcement in prosecuting the most difficult cold  cases using the seemingly magical power of DNA testing in forensic  labs. The third is a bill I championed called the PROTECT Our Children  Act, which reauthorizes important resources combating child  exploitation online.   Perhaps the best news story of the last couple of years has been our  economy, how it has come roaring back. We have tried to reduce the  regulatory burden on employers and job seekers alike, including in the  three bills the President has signed into law.   These were targeted bills not designed to change Western civilization  but to address specific, real problems that will improve the lives of  the people we work for. One of those is the New HOPE Act, which is an  occupational licensing reform bill that gives States the tools to  reduce barriers to certain professions. It makes no sense because of  licensing requirements to basically bar people from doing things they  can learn how to do without overly burdensome licensing and training  requirements which essentially are designed to protect incumbents.   We have also passed the Jobs for Our Heroes Act, which makes it  easier for our veterans to get commercial driver's licenses.   We passed the American Law Enforcement Heroes Act to make sure  veterans can get hired by local law enforcement agencies when they come  out of the military with the very skills that are needed by our local  law enforcement. We know all of our police agencies are working hard to  try to recruit good, qualified people to keep our communities safe.  They struggle with that, and this will help make that better.   In each of these cases, we tried to listen to the needs of Texans and  people across the country and to translate that into legislation that  will improve their lives. They don't get top billing on the national  news, but they deserve our support, as do the people whom I came in  contact with in my State who have inspired these laws.   As we close out the 115th Congress and move into a new Congress in  January, these are the types of things we can continue to do together.  Because of the midterm elections, our friends in the other body, the  House of Representatives--now that Ms. Pelosi will presumably be the  next Speaker--have an important decision to make: Do they want to make  noise, do they want to harass the President or do they want to work  with us to make laws that improve the quality of life for the people we  represent? I hope they choose the latter, and, clearly, there is more  we can and should do together to help the American people.   I know I am running out of time. I am going to come back a little  later on to talk about the caravans that are coming up from Central  America through Mexico and what we need to do together to address  those.   At this time, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I wanted to come back to the floor after  speaking a little earlier this morning about the so-called caravan of  migrants coming from Central America up through Mexico and who are now  located in Tijuana, many of whom will be seeking asylum here in the  United States. Coming from Texas with a 1,200-mile common border with  Mexico, caravans are not unheard of; in fact, we have many caravans  showing up on a daily basis at Border Patrol stations, including  unaccompanied children and families.   What has happened is that the cartels--these transnational criminal  organizations--have figured out, as part of their business model, that  they can make money by shipping migrants up through Mexico into the  United States or they can ship drugs from Mexico into the United States  or traffic in children and women for sex slavery.  [[Page S7028]]  They have figured out that they can make money because of the gaps in  our border security, because of the characteristics of our law that  make it impossible for us to deter many of the immigrants coming from  Central America.   I know that during the recent midterm elections, there was some  thought that President Trump or others were just sort of making this  issue up in order to energize voters leading up to the midterm  elections. Well, I will not comment on the politics of this; I will  just say that this is a phenomenon that has been occurring on a daily  basis in the recent past. It is because of a glitch in our laws that  our Democratic colleagues are well aware of, and that we have tried to  fix, but they simply will not cooperate with us in order to fix it.   Basically, what we would do is treat somebody who enters the United  States from noncontiguous countries the same way we would if they came  into our country illegally from Mexico. That is the long and short of  it. But they will not have any part of it because they feel as though  this advantages them politically because by enforcing our laws, by  securing our borders, they believe that somehow that could be portrayed  as anti-immigrant, which is demonstrably false.   About 40 percent of my constituents in Texas are of Hispanic origin,  many of whom live along that international border. They understand that  the cartels that traffic in people and drugs and contraband are  criminal organizations that threaten their security and safety. So I  feel very strongly about this issue, and I think somebody needs to  speak up and state the facts.   These caravans are bringing thousands of migrants coming from Central  American countries, mostly women and children. But you can imagine, if  one caravan of several thousand people is successful in breaching our  border and entering the United States without regard to our immigration  laws, what that will do to encourage further efforts. So this is not a  one-off; this isn't just something that is going to happen one time.  This will get worse and worse and worse. If you went down to some of  these Central American countries and asked them who would like to  immigrate to the United States, you are going to see not just hundreds  and thousands, but hundreds of thousands, and perhaps millions, of  people who would like to come to the United States.   We have to have an orderly way to deal with immigration.   Somebody asked in this last midterm election: What is your position  on immigration?   I said: It is really simple. Legal immigration is good; illegal  immigration is bad.   So we know that this current caravan is not made up entirely of  asylum seekers or people trying to flee poverty and violence in their  home countries. It is made up of migrants from other parts of the world  who travel to Central America so that they can take advantage of that  porous border and the pathway to the United States. They come from  countries all around the world, including special interest aliens from  countries that, unfortunately, are plagued by terrorism. I am not  saying we have a bunch of terrorists in this pack; I am just saying it  is a vulnerability that could be exploited by anybody who wants to take  advantage of these gaps in our law and our lack of security.   It also includes people who have been arrested in the United States  and deported back to their home countries, who are reentering the  United States in violation of our immigration laws. They have already  committed criminal acts, and they are coming back in, disguised, among  the larger caravan of Central American immigrants.   One thing the Border Patrol has also made clear is that because the  Border Patrol has to deal with this mass of humanity coming up across  the border while somehow treating them in a humane fashion, which we  all would want them to do, the cartels realize the Border Patrol is all  balled up trying to process this caravan of Central American  immigrants, so that opens up avenues by which to import illegal drugs  into the United States, another moneymaking proposition for the  cartels. Ninety percent of the heroin--an opioid--90 percent of the  heroin that comes into the United States comes from Mexico.   Somebody said to me recently: Well, the cartels are commodity  agnostic. I thought that was a pretty good way of expressing it. In  other words, they are into anything that will make them money. No  matter how debased, no matter how cruel, no matter how inhumane, they  are willing to do anything to make money.   By not dealing with this issue in a responsible fashion on a  nonpartisan basis, we are making the cartels rich. More people have  died in Mexico since 2007 than have died in the wars in Afghanistan and  in Iraq combined. Incoming President Lopez Obrador has said that he  wants to deal with the violence in Mexico as part of his new  administration. Frankly, I think we need to help him, but we need to  recognize the reality. This is not benign activity; this isn't a mom- and-pop operation where people who want jobs are coming into the United  States. This is a big business.    The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that two gangs,  MS-13 and Barrio 18 now rule over most of El Salvador, terrorizing that  country's population. These gangs and the cartels that support them  throughout Central America take advantage of a very simple economic  principle: supply and demand. So as long as there is demand in the  United States for heroin and other illegal drugs, as long as there is a  demand for low-wage labor, these gangs will fill that supply. As long  as there is a demand for sex slavery, these gangs and these cartels  will meet that supply.   So this makes our relationship with our friends in Mexico very, very  important. Our two governments need to work more closely together  because U.S. and American interests are interrelated and aligned. This  is not just an illegal immigration or drug smuggling problem; it is all  of them combined. It is a question of whether the Government of Mexico  can actually control or defeat the cartels that threaten the safety and  stability of their people in that country and have this business model  that I mentioned.   So our partnership with Mexico--under the administration of President  Lopez Obrador, who will be sworn in on December 1; I hope to be there  at that inauguration--must continue to grow and evolve because the  gangs, the cartels that hurt and kill people in Mexico and then  threaten our security and safety here in the United States are going to  also evolve and adapt to make sure they can maintain their dominance in  the region. That is why programs like the Merida Initiative are vital  to our collective success in combating this multiheaded monster.   It is clear we should take into account how to combat the flow of  illicit drugs into the United States and how we can help restore the  relationship--our relationship--with those communities and those  countries and law enforcement personnel in Central America.   This crisis extends far beyond how to treat the flood of migrants  that come across the border. This is not a political issue alone, as  some would have it. People act as though the President dreamed this  issue up in order to gain advantage or energize his base during the  recently passed midterm elections.   In Texas, communities along our border rely heavily on legitimate  trade and travel across our ports of entry. It is really important.  That is why NAFTA and the renegotiation of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade  agreement was so important, and it is important to the entire country  because 14 million jobs depend on trade with Mexico and Canada. You can  imagine, if our ports of entry are clogged with caravan after caravan  of tens, hundreds, thousands--maybe hundreds of thousands--of migrants  from Central America seeking asylum in the United States, we are not  going to have much legitimate trade and commerce across those ports of  entry, and it is going to harm not only my State, but the United States  as a whole.   We can't forget that our border communities are critically important,  and any solution we find must somehow balance our normal compassion for  people who are vulnerable and people who are seeking a better life with  the rule of law and our ability to protect our own sovereignty by  securing our borders and controlling illegal immigration into the  United States.  [[Page S7029]]    In the coming weeks, I hope we can work with the administration to  determine a course of action that addresses the real needs of  legitimate asylum seekers without rewarding illegal activity and making  the drug cartels even richer than they are now and encouraging and  condoning more and more violence, which harms people all across the  region. We need to send a message that the United States alone cannot  bear the burden of this mass migration, and we need to ensure that  those who seek to enter the United States do so legally. We will work  with our partners in Central America and Mexico to try to find  solutions that will allow migrants to return safely to their home  countries or find resettlement solutions in safe countries until the  day I know they would hope for, when they could safely return home.
