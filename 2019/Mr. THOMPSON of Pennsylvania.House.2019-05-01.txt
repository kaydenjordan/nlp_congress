 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  former Senator Richard Lugar, who passed away Sunday at the age of 87.   Senator Lugar served the State of Indiana for 36 years in Congress  and was a leading voice on issues at home and abroad.   Senator Lugar was a man of strong integrity who stood by what he  believed in, and Senator Lugar always was willing to work with  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reach a shared goal:  bipartisanship.   In 2003, the State Department established a Kennedy-Lugar YES Abroad  program, named for Senator Lugar and Senator Ted Kennedy. The program  provides scholarships for students from the United States and countries  with significant Muslim populations to spend 1 year in the other's  country. It fosters the same goals that Senator Lugar dedicated his  life to achieving: understanding, collaboration, and friendship with  the rest of the world.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Senator Lugar for his legendary service. Senator  Lugar leaves a long record of legislative accomplishments. I offer my  condolences to his family.   May Senator Lugar rest in peace, and may we learn from the example  that he set.  [[Page H3349]]                                ____________________
