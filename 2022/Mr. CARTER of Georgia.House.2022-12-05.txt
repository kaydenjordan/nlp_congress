 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Larry Evans for his recent selection to the Georgia 40 Under 40 list.   Larry Evans is a successful attorney, who focuses on civil litigation  matters for clients ranging in size from small, local businesses all  the way to Fortune 500 companies.   While many who pursue a profession as demanding as his are unable to  find a balance between work and life, Larry has been able to strike  that balance wonderfully. His drive to contribute to the greater good  has led him to serve on the boards of the Savannah Center for the Blind  and Low Vision and Junior Achievement of Georgia. Both of these  charities are focused, high-impact programs for students in the areas  of financial literacy and career readiness. These programs also focus  on fostering an entrepreneurial spirit in the youth of the First  District of Georgia.   Larry also holds a deep reverence for the outdoors and would rather  be outside than nearly anywhere else. He regularly spends time running,  hiking, paddling, and connecting with nature.   A true example of someone who works hard and fully commits to  everything he does, Larry Evans is someone we can all look up to.   I, on behalf of the entire First District of Georgia, congratulate  him for his outstanding service to this State and his selection to the  Georgia 40 Under 40 list.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  bill, S. 198, the Data Mapping to Save Moms' Lives Act.   Earlier this year, the House passed H.R. 1218, which was introduced  by Representatives Butterfield and Bilirakis. This legislation was the  result of bipartisan work through hearings and markups in the Energy  and Commerce Committee. I am pleased to see that Republican efforts at  changes to improve the legislation are included in the bill before us.   Today's legislation amends the Senate bill to include the House- passed language, which I was pleased to support earlier this year. The  Data Mapping to Save Moms' Lives Act follows other bipartisan work the  Energy and Commerce Committee has done to address maternal mortality in  America.   I am pleased to support this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to  do so, as well.
