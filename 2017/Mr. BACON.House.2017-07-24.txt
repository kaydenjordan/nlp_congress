 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Microloan  Modernization Act of 2017. This legislation will benefit America's  small businesses by improving the Small Business Administration's  Microloan program.   Small business lending has not kept pace with the improving economy  after the Great Recession, and this has been especially true for small- dollar borrowers.   Early stage small businesses do not have the proven financial history  and  [[Page H6181]]  lack access to traditional lending. Unable to borrow money from banks  and credit unions, they often turn to friends, family, or credit cards  to finance their businesses.   The SBA Microloan program provides access to capital through  nonprofit intermediaries that will loan up to $50,000 for their upstart  companies. These intermediaries also offer technical assistance and  counseling to facilitate their business' success.   H.R. 2056 will improve the SBA Microloan program by expanding the  lending volume to microloan intermediaries, by giving them greater  flexibility with their SBA technical assistance grants, to provide more  preloan comprehensive assistance to businesses in their infancy, and by  requiring the SBA to study and report to Congress on the utilization of  the program.   This bill provides meaningful reforms to modernize the SBA Microloan  program, and I am a proud cosponsor. This is a needed bill to support  the engine of our economy: our small businesses.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation.
