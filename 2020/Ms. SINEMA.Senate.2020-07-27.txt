 Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Lt.  Col. (Ret.) James ``Rusty'' Mitchell on his retirement from the  Community Initiatives Team--CIT--at Luke Air Force Base in my home  State of Arizona.   Rusty first joined the Air Force in 1976 and spent years serving his  country around the globe. Rusty also spent a significant amount of his  Air Force career at Arizona military installations, serving as an A-10  jet instructor at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base and  [[Page S4505]]  having several different roles at Luke Air Force Base involving the F- 16 fighter jet. He retired from the Air Force in 1998 after 22 years of  service to his country.   Rusty still had a desire to fly, so after his retirement from the Air  Force, he became a captain for United Airlines, a career that he  enjoyed and continued for 21 years before retiring from that role last  year.   But despite becoming a pilot for United, it became clear that Rusty  wasn't ready to end his service to the Air Force. In 2003, Rusty became  the director of the Community Initiatives Team at Luke Air Force Base.  In this role he served as a liaison between the U.S. Air Force, Luke  Air Force Base, the State of Arizona and 11 of the local cities and  municipalities surrounding the base. He played a vital role in helping  Luke Air Force Base secure the F-35 training mission, bring critical  jobs to the State and boosting the local economy. Furthermore, Rusty  has been personally helpful to me and my staff in our official visits  to Luke Air Force Base, numerous inquiries and countless requests for  information.   Lieutenant Colonel (Ret.) Mitchell has served this country, the Air  Force, and Luke Air Force Base as an airman and civilian for almost 40  years, and he will be missed. On behalf of the U.S. Congress and the  State of Arizona, I want to thank Rusty for his service and  congratulate him on a well-deserved retirement.                            ____________________
