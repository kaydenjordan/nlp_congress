 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Neal) for yielding me this time.   Mr. Speaker, you can put all the lipstick you want on this pig, and  it is still a pig.   Let's be honest, this isn't tax reform. This is a cut on taxes for  corporate America, the corporate friends and my friends on the other  side of the aisle, and they had to squeeze all kinds of things in to  justify it and pay for it. That is why the middle class is going to  suffer. That is why their kids in college are going to start losing  their ability to deduct interest on student loans, and they are going  to pay taxes on waived tuition when they get a teaching assistant  position or a benefit from the university.                                time  1745    That is why your local municipalities are going to lose tax exemption  for private activity bonds that fund tens of billions of dollars of  public improvements all over the United States.   That is why 8.8 million Americans are going to lose the ability to  deduct medical costs. Good luck to families who have to put people in  nursing homes for long-term care, patients suffering dementia. How will  they work that financing out when they lose this deduction, and how  will they feel when they know the reason they are losing this deduction  is to finance a corporate tax rate?   What about homeowners losing the ability to deduct mortgage interest  or to have it capped artificially so corporate America can get the  biggest tax cut in history?   And, by the way, they get to continue to deduct State and local taxes  and other kinds of financial interest-related expenses, but not you,  not you the middle class.   It adds $1.5 trillion, and that is with dynamic scoring. Dynamic  scoring is another way of saying: We kind of fudged the real number. It  is more than that, at least $200 billion more than that.   I thought my friends on the other side of the aisle were fiscal hawks  dedicated to making sure we didn't have deficits.   This is an inconsistent bill. This is going to harm middle class  America.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat this bill, and let's  start over in a bipartisan way.
