 Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Foreign Affairs  Committee, I have closely followed the recent developments in the war  between Saudi Arabia and the Houthi rebels in Yemen.   This is one of the world's deadliest wars. Air strikes and other acts  of war have killed tens of thousands of civilians. Yemen has become a  wasteland, with widespread disease and famine. An estimated 85,000  children have been killed or died from malnutrition. The United Nation  estimates that Yemen is now facing the specter of a famine threatening  14 million people: half of their population. Three-quarters of Yemen's  population now requires urgent humanitarian assistance.   The time has come for us to reconsider our support for this  disastrous war and to consider the moral imperatives that form the  foundation of our values, as well as our strategic interests. In this  instance, I believe both our moral values and strategic interest  require that we reassess our involvement in this tragic human  catastrophe. We must reject war and pursue peace.   The day I was sworn in as a Member of Congress, I joined the House in  passing a resolution calling on all parties involved in the conflict to  increase efforts to prevent civilian casualties and to increase  humanitarian access. In addition, the resolution denounced the conduct  of the war in Yemen that is, directly or indirectly, inconsistent with  the laws of armed conflict, including the deliberate targeting of  civilians  [[Page H9697]]  and the use of civilians as human shields.    It is my fear that our continued support of this war will only  increase resentment of the United States and the region. It will  diminish U.S. security and undermine America's moral authority and  reputation as a champion of our foundational values such as human  rights and civil liberties.   In addition to the horrendous humanitarian costs in Yemen itself, it  makes the entire region less secure and makes humanitarian disasters in  the wider region more likely. But more importantly, what is happening  in Yemen is just simply wrong. It is out of harmony with America's  values. Ironically, the very reason we want to support a strong ally in  Saudi Arabia is to prevent this type of situation, not foster it.   These conditions provide a breeding ground for violent extremism and  for terrorist groups to expand. Prolonging the war in Yemen only  strengthens the Islamic state in Yemen and al-Qaida in the Arabian  Peninsula. Additionally, the conflict undertaken by the Saudi-led  coalition under the objective of ``eliminating Iranian influence'' has  achieved just the opposite.   Iran has been able to use the conflict as an opportunity to establish  a foothold across the Middle East. They send soldiers to prop up a  dictator, Bashar al-Assad, in Syria. Additionally, Iran-supported  Hezbollah is now the dominant political force in Lebanon, and able to  threaten neighboring Israel, our closest ally in the region, with its  growing missile and rocket arsenal. This threat to Israel is in  addition to the ongoing barrage of missiles fired into Israel by Iran- supported Hamas in Gaza.   I welcomed Secretary of Defense Mattis' comments in October, when he  said, ``It's time to stop this.'' He urged all parties to sit down and  pursue peace. Secretary of Defense Mattis' comments were followed by  Secretary of State Pompeo's statement in which he said, ``The time is  now for the cessation of hostilities.''   I echo Secretary of Mattis' further comments when he said, ``We have  got to move toward a peace effort here, and we can't say we are going  to do it sometime in the future.'' We should support the U.N.-led  efforts to bring peace to this devastated country and urge the Saudi- led coalition and Houthis to start peace negotiations immediately.   Ending our support for the Saudi-led coalition highlights the gross  inhumanity of the war and that we do not support the way the conflict  in Yemen is being conducted. It underlines our growing concerns about  the behavior of Saudi Arabia as it affects larger American strategic  interests in the region and our interest in preserving global  humanitarian norms. Ending our support for the war will force the  Saudi-led coalition to reconsider its policies and will signal our  support for peace negotiations as, as called for by the administration.   American foreign policy requires a balance between our national  security and moral values. In the case of the war in Yemen, these  competing imperatives are not in conflict. Ending U.S. support for the  war in Yemen supports both American strategic interests and  humanitarian values.                            ____________________
