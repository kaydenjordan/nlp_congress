 Mr. President, I come forward today to  recognize the  [[Page S7784]]  125th birthday of the Nevada Sagebrush, the independent student  newspaper of the University of Nevada, Reno. Born out of a rebellion  against the university's board of regents, the Nevada Sagebrush has  been a strong and independent voice for the student body since October  19, 1893.   The paper has gone through several name changes throughout its long  history. It was first known as the Student Record, then changed its  name to the Sagebrush before the 18th volume was published in 1910 and  finally, in 2004, became known as the Nevada Sagebrush. The newspaper  has received an Associated Collegiate Press Pacemaker Award several  times, most recently during the 2014-15 school year, and the ACP Online  Pacemaker Award in 2011.   The Nevada Sagebrush alumni have gone on to pursue successful careers  in a variety of prominent fields. Its editorial alumni have  distinguished records in journalism, literature, education, business,  the military, and public service from the local level to the highest  levels of State and Federal Government.   Among distinguished Sagebrush alumni, Alan Bible, the paper's  managing editor in 1929, went on to become a U.S. Senator for Nevada  from 1954-1974. Eva Adams, the woman who ran Bible's Senate office, was  the Sagebrush business manager in 1928 and was appointed by President  Kennedy to head the U.S. Mint, a position she held until 1969. Jim  Joyce, the newspaper's editor from 1957-1958, served as the press  secretary and later executive assistant to Senator Howard Cannon.  Edward Allison, the news editor in 1960, served as chief of staff for  Senator Paul Laxalt. Sig Rogich, an editor of the Sagebrush from 1965- 1966, served as a senior assistant to President H.W. Bush and was also  the U.S. Ambassador to Iceland in 1992.   Many more Sagebrush alumni have gone on to serve and make an impact  in the State of Nevada. Ruthe Deskin and Dondero Elementary Schools in  Las Vegas were named after Ruthe Deskin, assistant to the publisher of  the Las Vegas Sun for 50 years, and Harvey N. Dondero, a teacher and  school principal in Nevada, both of whom wrote for the Nevada  Sagebrush. Rollan Melton Elementary School and Earl Wooster High School  in Reno also owe their namesake to alumni of this great newspaper.   Today, I celebrate the many contributions of the Nevada Sagebrush to  the University of Nevada, Reno and to the State of Nevada. It is with  pride that I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the Nevada  Sagebrush for giving students a strong and independent voice.                            ____________________
