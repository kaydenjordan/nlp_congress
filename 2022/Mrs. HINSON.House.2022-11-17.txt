 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Christina  Schauer, a veteran and nurse from Dubuque, Iowa, whose courage and  dedication to serving others are unmatched.   Christina served our country overseas as a combat medic in Iraq. Our  veterans face immense challenges when returning home, and  unfortunately, our women veterans are often afraid to speak up about  their experiences. They may feel invisible or that their service wasn't  worthy. As a result, they may be less likely to seek the care that they  have earned.   Christina is working to right this wrong by sharing her own story.  She has championed women veteran visibility, empowering her sisters in  sacrifice to talk more about their service and seek the healthcare and  the benefits they deserve.   So, Christina, thank you for your service and for your commitment to  empower women veterans. You are an inspiration to all of us.                            ____________________
