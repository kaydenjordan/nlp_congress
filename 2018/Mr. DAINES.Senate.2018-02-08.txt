 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, Washington, DC, has an addiction problem.  Washington, DC, is addicted to spending. Washington, DC, is addicted to  debt.   This budget deal takes a giant step backward. Instead of shrinking  government, it grows government by 13 percent. In fact, it is the  largest spending increase since 2009, the first year President Obama  was in office.   I spent 28 years in the private sector before I came to Capitol Hill.  I was expected to produce a balanced budget. In fact, better than that,  I was expected to produce a budget that actually took in a little bit  more than was spent. That is called a profit. This budget deal is  blowing our budget. It takes discretionary spending up $300 billion and  only offsets it by one-third.   By looking at numbers, it is pretty clear that Washington, DC,  doesn't have a revenue problem if we look at revenue as a percentage of  GDP, but if we look at spending as a percentage of GDP, we start to see  the real problem. DC doesn't have a revenue problem. DC doesn't need to  ask for more money from the American people. Washington, DC, has a  spending problem. Controlling government spending is a big challenge,  but it is one we have to rise to meet. We must rise to the occasion,  not retreat to trillion-dollar deficits.   Funding our national defense is a fundamental requirement laid out in  the Constitution. The men and women of our military, including our  veterans--absolutely crucial. Funding for our community health centers,  something I have been fighting hard for--important for our States. In  fact, earlier today I supported a reasonable proposal to address both  of these concerns without going rogue on spending.   The question is, At what point is Congress going to look in the  mirror and see that the real long-term certainty, the long-term  sustainability of these programs we all support, is directly tied to  fiscal responsibility?   Even the former Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, ADM Mike Mullen,  once said, ``The most significant threat to our national security is  our debt.'' We have now crossed the $20 trillion debt threshold, and  this bill simply accelerates that.   I left the private sector to run for Congress and came to the Senate  to fight for more jobs and less government. I will tell you, I think if  you look in the dictionary for the term ``more government,'' you would  find this bill. This bill defines ``more government.''   Washington's broken budget process results in bad budget deals like  this one, and we are continuing the cycle of irresponsible budgets  which creates more irresponsible budgets. It is an addiction to  spending. It is an addiction to debt, but it doesn't have to be that  way. Many of our States have figured that out. Many of our States  aren't running deficits and large debts.   The first bill I introduced when I arrived in Congress was the  Balanced Budget Accountability Act. It is not complicated. It simply  says, if Congress can't pass a balanced budget, then we shouldn't get  paid. That is the way it works in the real world. It ought to work the  same way here.   When Montanans look at their own budget, whether in their families or  in their small businesses, they have to make choices. When they take  out a loan, they are expected to pay it back. They can't just borrow  money from China like we do, kick the can down the road, and expect  that someday there will not be a day of reckoning.   Raising the debt ceiling, growing spending, and spending away our  children's and grandchildren's future is irresponsible. We talk about  mortgaging our children's future. We have done that. With this bill, we  had to take out another credit card for our kids. This is not some  glowing bipartisan moment. It is a classic example of disastrous  policy--policymaking that is justified under the well-meaning pursuit  of compromise. Make no mistake, this compromise is deeply irresponsible  and one the Senate should reject. I am ready to work with anyone here  to make the tough decisions necessary to get our budget and our fiscal  house in order.   Now, think about this past year. We were able to cut through redtape,  reducing the Federal Registry by over 30 percent. We were able to put  qualified judges on the benches of our Nation's courts--the most  circuit judges in the first year of a Presidency dating back to 1891.  We were able to pass a once-in-a-generation tax cut package for the  American people. If we can do all that, I think we can balance our  budget here as well and put forward responsible fiscal leadership and  management here in Washington, DC.   Let's roll up our sleeves, and let's get to work. That is what we  were elected to do. Until then, I will continue to stand and continue  to fight against this addiction to spending and debt of Washington, DC.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Shane and Cherry Harrington of Wibaux. Shane serves as  sheriff of Wibaux County and has done so for 14 years. Prior to being  elected sheriff, Shane served as under-sheriff for 6 years. His 20  years of work to keep Wibaux County a safe place to live and work is  greatly appreciated by the community.   Shane's wife, Cherry, is also very active in community life. Just  this past August, Cherry took over the Wibaux General Store after  learning that the original owner was preparing to retire. The store is  a hub for Wibaux's economy and community, offering everything from  farming and ranching supplies to cookware. The thought of the store  closing was a concern for the community. Cherry stepped up to meet the  community's need for a hardware store and is looking forward to making  improvements and meeting the demands of Wibaux County.   That is what Shane and Cherry do; they step up to meet the needs of  the community. Together, they have raised three sons, who all became  ranchers in Wibaux County. Shane and Cherry's contributions to the  community exemplify our way of life--service, hard work, and family.  Their commitment to Wibaux and Montana is a testimony to the strength  of Montana communities, and I am so grateful for their  contributions.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this week I have the distinct honor  of recognizing Paul J. Reeder of Billings, MT. Paul has a fantastic  history of service to Montanans and to the Billings community. He has  served in pastoral ministry and care for decades and has dedicated  himself to the well-being of community members.   Paul pastored churches across Montana prior to becoming the director  of the Friendship House, from which he retired after 22 years of  service in 1996. Paul also began his chaplain ministry in 1978 and has  faithfully served the Billings Police Department as chaplain for the  past 40 years. His unwavering commitment to encouraging officers is  evident in all his actions as he attends morning briefings, learns each  officer by name, sends birthday cards, bakes Christmas cookies, and  hosts an annual breakfast for the officers. Never missing an  opportunity to make officers feel known, Paul keeps a current photo  display of officers updated at the department.   In his spare time, Paul has published booklets on the Underground  Railroad, Buffalo Soldiers, and other various historical figures. He  also repairs Bibles, hymnals, and other books for churches, friends,  libraries, schools, and civic organizations. At 87 years old, Paul  still preaches one Sunday a month at All Nations Church. Paul's  devotion and faithful attendance has encouraged officers and chaplains  alike for the past 40 years, and his encouragement and commitment will  be remembered as he retires this year. Thank you, Paul, for all your  service.                            ____________________
