 Mr. Speaker, this past weekend, we honored the men  and women of the United States military, the veterans that we so much  admire and respect.   I had the privilege of attending a number of veterans'  commemorations, and that is why I intend to reintroduce my Battle Buddy  bill, called the New Battle Buddy bill, to ensure that those leaving  the Armed Forces and those already veterans have a buddy to assist them  in times of crisis.   They are freedom loving, and we are reminded of the words of  President John F. Kennedy who said: The price of freedom is high, but  Americans are willing to pay the price.   That is why I also congratulate freedom-loving Turkish Americans and  express my sadness and disappointment that the President of Turkey now  comes to the United States, where, in his own country, freedom is not  real. The locking up of political opposition, journalists and others,  the question is: Why would he be extended an invitation for a state  visit?   It is important for the United States to stand for her values of  freedom, democracy, and justice. It is time to free the political  prisoners in Turkey and, as well, to respond to the devastation of the  Kurds.                            ____________________
