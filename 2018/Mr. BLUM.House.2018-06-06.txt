 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment that  prioritizes the completion of the flood mitigation project on the Cedar  River in the First District of Iowa.   Ten years ago this week, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, experienced a  devastating flood that resulted in billions of dollars' worth of  damage. In 2014, Congress authorized the Army Corps of Engineers to  complete a flood risk mitigation project on the Cedar River to prevent  future floods. Two years ago, in the midst of another historic flood in  Cedar Rapids, the 2016 WRDA included my amendment that prioritized the  completion of the Cedar Rapids project. However, we are having the same  discussion 2 years later for the 2018 WRDA.   The Federal Government has let down my constituents in Cedar Rapids  and has not fulfilled its duty to provide the necessary resources to  complete the flood mitigation project to protect this city. Working  with my Iowa colleagues in the House and the Senate, I have attended  countless meetings and sent numerous letters to the Army Corps and the  Office of Management and Budget urging movement on this most important  project, but it has yet to start.   It is past time the government fulfills its promise to my  constituents in Iowa. This project is shovel ready, and Cedar Rapidians  deserve completion to protect this vibrant city from future natural  disasters.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
