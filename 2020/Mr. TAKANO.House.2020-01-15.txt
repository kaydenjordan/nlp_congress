 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Julie  Bornstein on her retirement from the Coachella Valley Housing  Coalition.   For more than 30 years, Julie has worked tirelessly as an advocate  for affordable housing throughout the Coachella Valley. She has  dedicated her career to making a difference in the lives of thousands  of individuals in Riverside and Imperial Counties.   Her leadership has been instrumental in raising awareness about the  homelessness issue so many members of our communities face. Through her  efforts, we have seen an increase in the availability of affordable  housing throughout the Inland Empire.   Apart from her work in the Coachella Valley Housing Coalition, Julie  served in the California State Assembly and was chosen to serve as the  chair of the Democratic Caucus.   She went on to serve as director of the California Department of  Housing and Community Development. Later, Julie was appointed CEO and  president of the Campaign for Affordable Housing.   Madam Speaker, Julie's work has not gone unnoticed, and the Coachella  Valley is a better place because of her. We wish her a happy  retirement.                            ____________________
