 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, last year, Congress rallied five times  around historic bipartisan legislation to meet urgent and unprecedented  needs. Our COVID-19 packages reinforced the healthcare frontlines,  fueled the sprint for vaccines, and cast lifelines for the workers and  small businesses hit hardest by shutdowns.   Together, those bills cost about $4 trillion, but none of those  measures passed the House of Representatives with less than a  bipartisan supermajority of about 80 percent--completely overwhelming  support.   Then, last week, House Democrats rammed through the American Rescue  Plan Act on a razor-thin margin of 50.7 percent. The only thing  bipartisan about their bill was the opposition to it. Their bill costs  about $2 trillion. That is roughly the same size as the entire CARES  Act that saved our health system and economy through months of  shutdowns last year. Even liberal experts admit this is far out of  proportion to what is needed now, with vaccines going into arms and the  economy already primed to literally roar back.   Amazingly, Democrats managed to allocate less than 9 percent--9  percent--of their massive bill to the entire healthcare response; 9  percent of the $1.9 trillion related to the healthcare response, and-- listen to this--even less than 1 percent of the $1.9 trillion to the  vaccines that will actually finish the fight.   They needed to save the other 91 percent of the borrowed money for a  vast catalog of liberal spending with basically no relationship  whatsoever to beating COVID-19. For example, they want to send  wheelbarrows of cash to State and local bureaucrats to bail out  mismanagement from before the pandemic. They are changing the previous  bipartisan funding formula in ways that will especially bias the money  toward big blue States. This outraged a bipartisan group of Governors,  largely from middle America, who went on record this week. There are  generous new benefit packages for government employees. There are  provisions to let abortion providers drain money from rescue programs  that were built to save Main Street small businesses. There is a  strange new Acela corridor kickback where they will make Medicare send  more money to just New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Delaware.   Just looking at the timeframe for all of their spending belies any  notion that this is an urgent rescue plan.   Take the K-12 funding which, contrary to science, Democrats say is a  prerequisite for opening schools. Ninety-five percent of that  supposedly urgent money would not be spent this fiscal year but,  instead, over the next 7 years. Let me say that again. Ninety-five  percent of the money for K-12 is not going to be spent this year, but  over the next 7 years. That is not my definition of an emergency.   Grants for rural healthcare would be on a slow drip out through  fiscal 2024. Agriculture-related funds would trickle out over the  next--listen to this--over the next decade. It doesn't sound very  urgent to me.   What the American people need are fast-acting plans to get schools  reopened now, get laid-off workers back into jobs, and finish the fight  against this virus right now. The Democrats have, instead, drawn up a  liberal omnibus to fund miscellaneous government spending over the next  decade.   We are adding all this money to the national debt, and they have a  rescue package with most of the money being spent out far in the  future. That is why there was bipartisan opposition over in the House.  That is why aspects of the House bill are already dropping like flies  before this thing even hits the Senate floor.   A pet project for the San Francisco Bay area is gone. Special  upgrades for a bridge connecting New York to Canada, gone. Even CNN had  to admit these were ``controversial.'' Senator Sanders' far-left  minimum wage policy that would have killed 1.4 million jobs just as we  try to recover appears to be gone, too--at least for now.   According to public reports, right now, as we speak, several of our  Democratic colleagues are frantically trying to trim back other crazy  provisions: the runaway government bailouts, the policies that will  keep workers at home when we should be focusing on rehiring.   Just a few days ago, President Biden's Chief of Staff bragged that  this smorgasbord of borrowed money will add up to ``the most  progressive domestic legislation in a generation.''   So that is what you get when the Democratic leader persuades all of  my distinguished friends across the aisle that their first undertaking  as Senate committee chairmen should be to outsource all their gavels to  the House.   The Senate wrote the CARES Act. In the earliest days of the crisis,  this Chamber took the bull by the horns. I personally assembled  bipartisan task forces that crafted urgent solutions to help America  weather the storm.   This time around, on the substance, the Senate has been largely  missing in action. House Democrats are bristling and publicly pushing  back if our Senate Democratic colleagues even try to make their mark on  this partisan bill in small ways.   So these two radically different processes have generated two  radically different pieces of legislation.   The Democrats had a choice. They chose to go it alone, tack to the  left, leave families' top priorities on the cutting-room floor                            ____________________     Mr. President, on a completely different matter, just  6 weeks into unified Democratic government, we already have another  crisis brewing on our southern border. In January, Customs and Border  Protection logged more than 78,000 encounters on our southwest border,  more than double the figure from January of 2020.   Last week, HHS sources told reporters we just logged the busiest  February in the history of the Unaccompanied Alien Children Program.  The number of kids turning up on our border with no parents is soaring,  and everyone expects the numbers to keep climbing.   Now the Biden administration is reportedly planning to reopen the  same kinds of emergency shelters over which Democrats vilified the  Trump administration a couple of years back. Both President Biden and  his Secretary of Homeland Security have said this week they don't think  this is a crisis. Not a crisis, they say? Well, if this isn't a crisis,  with unaccompanied kids pouring in and exceeding the capacity in a  pandemic, I would hate to see what one looks like.   The cause of this emergency is not some mystery. It is not mysterious  at all. Everybody knows exactly what happened. The new administration  explicitly campaigned on weakening border security, and 6 weeks in,  they have reversed the ``Remain in Mexico'' policy, begun letting more  people in in a haphazard way, and broadcast confusing mixed messages.   The L.A. Times says: ``Biden immigration policy stirs confusion at  Mexico border.'' They interviewed one woman who crossed the Rio Grande  ``on a smuggler's raft'' and was only briefly detained before being  released into our country. She explained she had specifically come  because of the new Biden administration: ``That gave us the opportunity  to come.''   Another reporter put it this way: ``The message received in Tijuana  and other Mexican border cities was  [[Page S1002]]  simpl[e]: Joe Biden was now letting people in.''   We are not just talking about the fine details of border policy. The  big backdrop behind this whole discussion is the sweeping leftwing  amnesty plan that the Biden administration unveiled before they were  even sworn in. They want to fast-track 11 million illegal immigrants  into temporary legal status, then green cards, and then full  citizenship.   The far left loves this approach, but so does a certain cross section  of Big Business. There is a whole lot of cultural power and economic  power pushing the liberal vision. As for the best interest of American  workers, well, that is not as trendy a cause in certain circles.   The truth is that it is not helpful or compassionate to just open up  our borders. It is not fair to American citizens and workers, but  neither is it fair to the people who are being lured into a  humanitarian crisis in the middle of a pandemic because they believe  this Democratic administration just conspicuously turned on a neon  ``Vacancies'' sign.   Republicans just spent 4 years making major headway on the security  and humanitarian crisis at our border. It took serious policy changes.  It took international diplomacy with multiple countries, and it took  border enforcement.   The American people would be better served if the Biden  administration had chosen to build on this progress instead of rapidly  trying to tear it down.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, earlier this year, my home State of  Kentucky said goodbye to Bill Nighbert, a longtime public servant and a  kindhearted friend. Both as a local mayor and a statewide official,  Bill was instrumental to the achievements of communities across our  Commonwealth. Today, I would like to recognize his lifetime of  contributions to Kentucky.   As the Gateway to the Cumberlands, the city of Williamsburg holds a  special significance not just in Southeastern Kentucky but for the  entire Commonwealth. Bill worked several jobs for the city he loved  before being elected mayor in 1993. For the next decade, the people of  Williamsburg put their trust in him. In return, Bill worked around the  clock to deliver for his community. Even in the city's top job, Bill  could still be found helping plow snow, deliver goods, or any other job  that needed doing. A beloved local splash park is just one tangible  example of Bill's leadership and vision for his city.   As a successful mayor, Bill's reputation grew across the  Commonwealth. He was elected president of the Kentucky League of Cities  in 2002, using his talents to improve communities throughout the  Bluegrass. Bill left city hall when Governor Ernie Fletcher tapped him  to be deputy commissioner of the Department of Local Government and  later the secretary of the Transportation Cabinet. Even as Bill served  the entire Commonwealth in Frankfort, he still took care of Whitley  County. For instance, he was a driving force in the construction of a  new interchange over I-75 near Williamsburg.   Apart from his professional work, Bill was legendary for his ability  to make a friend in any situation. I guess you don't become the  president of the Optimists Club without a sunny disposition. He was a  role model and a little league coach, lending whatever free time he  could find to a variety of local organizations.   Of course, Bill's greatest achievement was the love he shared with  his wife of 34 years, Susan, as well as his children and their spouses,  Brad and Monica, Renee and Chris, and Benton. Anyone who was lucky  enough to know Bill could see the immense pride he had in his children  and grandchildren. He said they were the reasons he dedicated so much  of his life to public service. On behalf of the Senate, I send sincere  condolences to Bill's friends and loved ones. We are grateful they  shared him with us for so many years. Kentucky was made better as a  result.                            ____________________
