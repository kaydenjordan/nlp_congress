 Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Colorado.    Thank you. I send a question to the desk from myself and  Senator Schatz and Senator Menendez.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senators Bennet, Menendez, and Schatz is to the  House managers:         If the Senate accepts the President's blanket assertion of       privilege in the House impeachment inquiry, what are the       consequences to the American people? How will the Senate       ensure that the current president or a future president will       remain transparent and accountable? How will this affect the       separation of powers? And, in this context, could you address       the President's counsel's claim that the President's advisers       are entitled to the same protections as a whistleblower?    Mr. Manager NADLER. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate,  privileges are limited. We have voted to impeach the President for,  among other things--article II of the impeachment is total defiance of  House subpoenas.   And the President announced it in advance: I will defy all the  subpoenas. What does this mean? It means that there is no information  to Congress. It means the claim of monarchical, dictatorial power. If  Congress has no information, it cannot act. If the President can  define--now, he can dispute certain specific claims. You can claim  privilege, et cetera. But to defy categorically all subpoenas, to  announce in advance you are going to do that and to do it, is to say  that Congress has no power at all, that only the executive has power.   That is why article II is impeaching him for abuse of Congress. That  is why, for a much lesser degree of offense, Richard Nixon was  impeached for abuse of Congress--for the same defiance of any attempt  by the Congress to investigate.   What are the consequences? The consequences, if this is to be--if he  is to get away with it, is that any subpoena you vote in the future,  any information you want in the future from any future President may be  denied you, with no excuses, announced in advance--I will defy all the  subpoenas. It eviscerates Congress and establishes the executive  department as a total dictatorship. That is the consequence.   I want to also talk about--and the motives are clearly dictatorial.   I want to also take a point, since I have the floor, to answer a  question--to comment on a question that Senator Collins and Senator  Murkowski asked yesterday. They asked about the question of mixed  motives. How do you define--how do you deal with a deed--with a  President who may have a corrupt motive and a fine motive? How do you  deal with it?   Professor Dershowitz said: Well, you have to look at the--you have to  mix. You have to weigh the balances.   Nonsense. Nonsense. We never, in American law, look at decent motives  if you can prove a corrupt motive. If I am offered a bribe and I accept  the bribe for corrupt motive, I will not be heard in defense to say:  Oh, I would have voted for the bill anyway; it was a good bill. You  don't inquire into other motives. Maybe you had good motives, but once  the corrupt motive and the corrupt act was established, there is no  comparison.   All of this is just nonsense to point away from the fact that the  President has been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt--and the defenders  don't even bother, really, to defend; they just come out with  distractions--has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt to have abused  his power by violating the law to withhold military aid from a foreign  country to extort that country into helping his reelection campaign by  slandering his opponent. Corrupt--no question. Violation of the law--no  question. Factually--no question. They don't even make a real attempt  to deny it. Everything is a distraction.   And the one chief distraction is, once you prove a corrupt act, that  is it. You never measure the degree of, maybe he had decent motives  too. Professor Dershowitz, in talking about that and in talking about  the absolute power of the Presidency, was just absent from American law  or any kind of Western law.   I yield back.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.    Mr. Chief Justice, thank you. I would like to send a  question to the desk on behalf of myself and Senator Warner.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senators Bennet and Warner is to the House  managers:         Mr. Sekulow said that if the Senate votes for witnesses, he       will call a long chain of witnesses that will greatly       lengthen the trial. Isn't it true that the Senate will       establish by majority vote which, and how many witnesses       there will be? Isn't it also true that prior impeachment       trials in the Senate commonly have heard witnesses who did       not testify in the House?    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. I thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I thank the  distinguished Senators for their questions.   It certainly is the case that all we are asking the Senate to do is  to hold a full and fair trial consistent with the Senate's  responsibility--article I, section 3 of this Constitution: ``The Senate  shall have the sole Power'' with respect to an impeachment trial. And  this great institution has interpreted that, during the 15 different  impeachment trials that have taken place during our Nation's history,  that a full and fair trial means witnesses, because this institution,  every time it has held a trial, has heard witnesses all 15 times,  including in several instances where there were witnesses who did not  testify in the House who testified in the Senate.   Now, the point was raised earlier about Benghazi. And Trey Gowdy--he  is a good man. I served with him. He is a very talented lawyer. I am  sure he is pleased--the distinguished gentleman from the Palmetto  State--that his name has been brought into this proceeding. But Trey  Gowdy, according to one of the questions, said that the administration  didn't cooperate. The White House, in that instance, and the State  Department turned over tens of thousands of documents pursuant to a  House subpoena. That is cooperation. Several witnesses appeared  voluntarily in Benghazi, including GEN David Petraeus, former CIA  Director; Susan Rice, who at the time was the National Security  Advisor; Ben Rhodes, the Deputy National Security Advisor; ADM Mike  Mullen, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; GEN Carter Ham,  former commander of AFRICOM; Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, he also  showed up; GEN Michael Flynn, former DIA Director. Who else showed up?  The former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton. She testified publicly  under oath for 11 hours. That is cooperation.   What happened in this particular instance in the House? No documents,  no witnesses, no information, no cooperation, no negotiation, no  reasonable accommodation--blanket defiance. That is what resulted in  the obstruction of Congress article.   So all we are asking for is the Senate to hold a fair trial  consistent with past practice. At every single trial this Senate has  held, the average number of witnesses was 33. We cannot normalize  lawlessness. We cannot normalize corruption. We cannot normalize abuse  of power--a fair trial.   Lastly, of the witnesses that did testify, voluntarily showed up,  what did they have to say? These were Trump administration witnesses.   Ambassador Sondland, how did he characterize the shakedown scheme,  the geopolitical shakedown at the heart of these allegations?  Ambassador Sondland, ``quid pro quo''; Ambassador Taylor, ``crazy'';  Dr. Fiona Hill, ``a domestic political errand''; Lieutenant Colonel  Vindman, ``improper''; John Bolton, ``drug deal.''   What would the Framers have said? The highest of high crimes against  the Constitution.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from Utah.
