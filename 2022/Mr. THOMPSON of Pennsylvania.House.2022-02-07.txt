 Madam Speaker, earlier this month I  visited Butler County Community College at Armstrong campus. This  community college is one of the six campuses in the BC3 community.   BC3 at Armstrong is the newest branch and opened to students in 2015.  The college is currently preparing for an expansion which will spur  economic growth and expand education access to underrepresented  communities.   This 15,000-square-foot state-of-the-art facility will provide  current and future students additional educational opportunities.   Students currently enrolled can take classes leading to an  associate's degree in business administration, psychology, and general  studies. With this expansion, BC3 at Armstrong plans to introduce  noncredit workforce development opportunities as well as associate  degree career programs in technical fields.   The educational paths provided by BC3 at Armstrong focus on learning  to earn, ultimately equipping their students with the skills needed to  enter the workforce immediately upon graduation.   It is the efforts of educational institutions like Butler County  Community College that provide high-quality, affordable education,  giving our next generation of learners more opportunities to succeed.                            ____________________
