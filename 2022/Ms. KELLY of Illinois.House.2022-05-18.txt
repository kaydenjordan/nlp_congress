 Madam Speaker, I am sick and tired of standing  up here to say I am sick and tired. I am tired of reminding my  colleagues that we have a gun violence epidemic in this country outside  of mass shootings.   We hold moments of silence. We stand up, we sit down, but we do  nothing. The mass shooting carried out by a racist white supremacist in  Buffalo last weekend was absolutely horrible. I am truly sorry for the  victims' families and for the whole community.   But also know, this weekend in Chicago 33 people were shot and five  died, and we did nothing. I care both about the people who are killed  by guns, whether they are shot alone in a park or next to their  neighbors in a supermarket. I see a lot of colleagues expressing  outrage about the Buffalo shooting, but outrage means nothing until we  start legislating or investing in solutions.   I do not care what the Senate will or won't pass. Let them go on  record and show the American people whether they care about their  safety or not. Just who and how many have to die before we take action?                            ____________________
