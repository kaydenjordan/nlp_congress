 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 2018  honorees of an organization named FACE, or Facts About Cuban Exiles.  The awardees are: Gus Machado, Jorge Santos, and Cesar Pizarro.   These three men embody the drive and spirit of Cuban exiles and have  made outstanding contributions to our south Florida community. Since  its foundation, FACE has been working to highlight the achievements of  the Cuban diaspora in Miami.   FACE has given a voice to refugees like me who had no other choice  but to leave our native homeland in search of freedom and human rights  here in the U.S. It disseminates the truth about what is occurring in  Cuba and ensures that the victims of the communist regime are not  forgotten.   Through FACE, and many other organizations that share the same goals,  we will finally see a free and democratic Cuba, where citizens are  given the opportunity to build up their country, instead of being  forced to flee it.   I would like to thank FACE for its work over these 36 years. Again, I  congratulate Gus, Jorge, and Cesar on this wonderful, well-deserved  honor.                            ____________________
