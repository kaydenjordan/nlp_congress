 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise in support of the INVEST in America  Act, which will help rebuild America's infrastructure. I especially  rise today in strong support of my amendment and other disability  provisions in the INVEST in America Act.   It has been more than three decades since the ADA became law. Yet,  people  [[Page H3530]]  with disabilities still face substantial barriers to transportation.  The INVEST in America Act includes provisions from the Disability  Access to Transportation Act, a bill I authored to break down barriers  in transportation for people with disabilities.   These provisions, among other things, include establishing a one-stop  paratransit pilot program so that riders can schedule an intermediate  stop during their trips, reauthorizing and increasing funding for  section 5310 mobility grants, and streamlining the reporting process  for accessibility complaints.   The bill will also require the Department of Transportation to adopt  the U.S. Access Board's proposed ``Public Rights-of-Way Accessibility  Guidelines'' as enforceable standards, and my amendment will require  the Department of Justice to follow suit.   Mr. Speaker, this amendment and the INVEST in America Act will help  make our Nation more accessible for Americans with disabilities. I urge  my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment, and I thank the  chairman for his leadership on this outstanding bill.
