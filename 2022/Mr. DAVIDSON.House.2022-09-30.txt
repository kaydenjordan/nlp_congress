 Mr. Speaker, I proposed H.R. 8331 to amend the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986 to temporarily suspend required minimum  distribution rules for certain retirement plans and accounts.   I would like to briefly discuss these. These distributions are  generally minimum amounts that retirement plan account owners must  withdraw annually or else they pay a penalty. The amount to be  distributed is calculated based on the account balance as of December  31 of the previous year.   Since the market was nearly at an all-time high at the end of 2021,  and it has dropped more than 20 percent, the distributions from 2022  are disproportionately high. While this administration pushes more  terrible inflationary policies that hurt our market, it is our retirees  who are suffering the consequences most from this downturn.   I have introduced this bill to waive the required minimum  distributions for 2022, much like this body did in 2020 in the CARES  Act when the government shut down our economy.   My office has received countless phone calls, not just from my  constituents, but from American retirees all over the country who are  demanding that Congress address this issue. I hope we can get something  done by the end of the year.                            ____________________
