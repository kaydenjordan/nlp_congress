 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  of Maureen Rosary O'Donnell Scheuermann, who peacefully departed this  world on the eve of her 90th birthday.   Maureen's life was dedicated to love, devotion, and service.   Her journey began as a secretary at Loyola University, where fate led  her to the love of her life, Rags Scheuermann. Their union in 1959  marked the beginning of a lifelong partnership, and her unwavering  support defined the legacy of the Scheuermann family in New Orleans  baseball. From the start of the Delgado Community College athletic  department to her tireless leadership of Rags' New Orleans Boosters,  Maureen became the beloved First Lady of New Orleans Baseball.   Maureen's life of service extended to the city of New Orleans, where  she worked for over three decades in various roles at city hall. Her  dedication as a secretary to three mayors underscored her commitment to  public service.   Maureen's light touched everyone she encountered, and her ``MawMaw''  wisdom, faith, hope, and joy left a lasting mark on our hearts.   Mr. Speaker, Maureen is loved and missed. May she rest in peace.                            ____________________
