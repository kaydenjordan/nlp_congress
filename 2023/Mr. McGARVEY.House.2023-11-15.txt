 Mr. Speaker, Social Security and Medicare are lifelines  for hundreds of thousands of seniors in my district in Louisville,  Kentucky, and for millions of seniors across America.   Unfortunately, the House Republicans continue to advocate for  stripping hardworking Americans of their earned benefits. I stress  ``earned.''   Social Security and Medicare are a contract, a legal and moral  promise that our country has made for people who have paid into a  program, and then we said: Guess what? We will be there for you. We  will be there to provide a safe and secure retirement for you in your  golden years.   For millions of Americans, a Social Security check is the difference  between keeping the lights on or falling behind on bills. Their  Medicare coverage is the difference between taking or not taking their  insulin.   Stripping back these crucial benefits is dangerous, and it is  extreme.   Just a few weeks ago, one of my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle explicitly stated that they wanted to elect a Speaker who has the  courage to talk about ending Social Security and Medicare as we know  it.   My hometown of Louisville, Kentucky, is home to more than 350,000  Medicare beneficiaries. That is over 350,000 Louisvillians who paid  into the program their entire working lives so that they could depend  on those benefits now.   Thanks to Democrats and the Inflation Reduction Act, healthcare is  more affordable and more accessible than ever before. As we speak,  Medicare is negotiating to lower the price of 10 prescription drugs for  part D recipients, with more to come. Out-of-pocket insulin costs have  been capped at $35 a month.   There is more to do, but extremists in the House Republican  Conference are trying to privatize, cut, and end these crucial  programs. House Democrats will continue fighting to protect these  benefits for generations to come.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question.
