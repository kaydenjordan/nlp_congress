 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the importance of SCORE  and stand in favor of the amendment I introduced with Rep. Spanberger  to increase SCORE funding to $21.7 million.   Simply put, this amendment would help build businesses and create  jobs.   SCORE is the nation's largest network of volunteer, expert business  mentors, with more than 10,000 volunteers across 240+ chapters.   They offer free and confidential advice, and free or low-cost  educational workshops to current and aspiring small business owners.   Since 1964, SCORE has helped more than 11 million entrepreneurs to  start and grow their small business.   In FY20, SCORE helped its clients to start 45,027 new businesses and  create 74,535 new jobs.   It is estimated that this increased funding would help SCORE create  over 100,000 additional new businesses and/or jobs, beyond last year's  impact numbers.   Moreover, SCORE is cost-effective.   In 2020, SCORE clients generated $67.35 in new federal tax revenue  for every $1 appropriated to SCORE.   The need is urgent. As we continue to recover from the COVID  pandemic, we need to support entrepreneurs in building businesses and  creating jobs. Our response must meet the moment.
