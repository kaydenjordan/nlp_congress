 Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairwoman Waters and  Representative Axne for bringing forth this legislation, H.R. 3624.   I have to admit that I don't really understand the ranking member's  objection to this legislation. As Americans continue to struggle in an  economy where too many corporations value profits over people, this  legislation grew out of the idea that consumers should know about the  choices their companies are making so they can determine how to use  their purchasing power.   H.R. 3624 would require a publicly traded company to disclose the  number of employees working in the United States and abroad and to  report the differences from year to year.   Too many Americans find themselves out of work because the companies  they have put their faith and hope for the future in decided to ship  their jobs out of this country without a thought for the workers and  communities they leave behind. As these companies look for short-term  gains through outsourcing, they neglect the long-term damage that this  practice does to our economy and to our country.   This legislation would bring real transparency at a time when  consumers are becoming increasingly conscious about where they spend  and invest their money.   Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.
