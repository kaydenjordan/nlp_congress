 Madam Speaker, at a time of  dysfunction and rancor, it is useful to remember a time when America  led the world because of the heroism of everyday Americans. I rise  today to honor the life and legacy of Sergeant Joseph Farina of New  Windsor, New York.   Joe was a regular guy who ran a bowling alley in Newburgh, New York.  He was a 20-year-old and a member of the National Guard when America  was attacked at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. That very night,  Joseph volunteered for service.   During war, he was deployed to the Philippines and New Guinea, where  his service earned him four battle stars, numerous other medals, and  two Presidential citations.   Joseph passed away at his home last month at the age of 97. Next to  him was his wife of 76 years, Elizabeth, whom he had married in  Brisbane, Australia, at the height of the war in 1942. Joseph would  actually work in Australia for many years and pioneer the sport of  bowlin there.    But his legacy is far broader than that, not only to his country  during his service in World War II, but also to the veterans community  in the Hudson Valley and across America.   He was active in many veterans organizations, the Catholic War  Veterans, and he helped to cofound the National Purple Heart Hall of  Honor in New Windsor, New York. The Hall of Honor is dedicated to  collecting and sharing the stories of Purple Heart recipients. No  comprehensive list of Purple Heart recipients exists, and the hall acts  as an important archive and monument to their service.   Joseph, like so many in his generation, knew what it meant to serve  others. Like so many in his generation, he worked in his community and  was a person dedicated to something bigger than himself. What a  powerful lesson for all of us to recall today. He was a model American  citizen, and he will be missed.                            ____________________
