 Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to recognize George  Logothetis, the CEO and chairman of the Libra Group, a private  organization based in my congressional district that is dedicated to  bolstering local communities through educational and business programs.   George is a visionary who recognizes the value of promoting startup  businesses as a catalyst for financial self-sufficiency, economic  development, and job creation. In 2015, George created the American  Entrepreneurship Award, a nonprofit with one goal in mind: to make free  enterprise accessible to every underserved community across our Nation.   This Friday, June 23, George will host AEA's annual awards ceremony  in our home city of Miami, where George will announce the winners of  the 2017 Business Plan Competition from Miami and the Bronx. The  awardees will receive a cash prize as well as vital consultation and  mentorship to get their new business ventures off the ground.   I would like to thank George for his leadership in promoting  innovation, and I look forward to his future success, as well as the  AEA's.                            ____________________
