 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her  leadership.   Madam Speaker, President Trump once said his favorite book is the  Bible. I think he is writing a new book for the Bible called the  ``Apocalypse of Women.'' It is a reverse Genesis.   In the beginning, he divided the country in half with rightwing dog  whistles in his inaugural address. On the second day, he ignored  millions of people who marched across America and the world. On the  third day, he pondered changes to NAFTA and which women's rights to  trade away. On the fourth day, he reinstated and expanded the global  gag rule, risking women's lives worldwide. Today he and his House  mouthpieces are blocking access to domestic reproductive health  coverage trumpeting alternative facts about legal abortions that have  been somehow prevented, some 2 million of them.   Well, prove it.   I shudder to think what will happen tomorrow, and I doubt on the  seventh day it will be devoted to rest.   Madam Speaker, we must fight this madness and oppose H.R. 7.
