 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable  individual who has dedicated four decades of his life to the field of  broadcasting, and in doing so, has become a cherished  [[Page H4418]]  voice for the people of Northern Chautauqua County.   I am proud to address this Chamber to celebrate the retirement of a  true newsman, Dave Rowley. His long career in broadcasting is testament  to his passion for storytelling and his dedication to keeping our  community informed.   Dave has worn many hats over the years, from reporting to anchoring,  producing, and hosting his radio show, ``Viewpoint.'' Through his work,  he has provided a space for meaningful conversations on the issues that  matter most to the people of Chautauqua County.   As we celebrate Dave's retirement, we can't help but feel a sense of  loss as very few journalists possess the same integrity and reliability  he has always displayed.   His commitment to excellence, his passion for the truth, and his  dedication to his community will be a lasting legacy for all that  follow in his footsteps.   Dave Rowley's retirement may mark the end of an era, but it also  marks the beginning of a new chapter in his life, and we wish him all  the happiness and fulfillment in his next chapter.                            ____________________
