 Mr. Speaker, time is of the essence. Our  country has been upended by COVID-19. Businesses have shuttered their  doors, families sitting around their kitchen tables are struggling to  make ends meet, our healthcare workers are stretched thin, and our  economy has been hurt.   Yet, earlier this week, some of my colleagues across the aisle  attempted to commandeer negotiations to advance socialist provisions  that are antithetical to combatting COVID-19. Now is not the time for  political showmanship. The eyes of our nation are affixed to Congress,  and it's our solemn duty to protect the American people.   To our nation's deeply committed healthcare workers who put their  lives on the line to treat and protect patients, our nation's truck  drivers who deliver food and critical supplies to grocery stores and  businesses, manufacturers who have stepped up to the plate to produce  PPE's and other essential equipment, and our steadfast police officers  and first responders on the front lines of this crisis, we truly owe  you a debt of gratitude. May God bless you all.
