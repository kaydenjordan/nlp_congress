 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge this Congress to work  together to avoid a shutdown of the Federal Government this week.   We must pass a clean funding bill that Members from both parties can  support, without any ideological riders. We cannot allow the American  public and central coast families in my district to foot the bill  resulting from partisan gridlock. A shutdown would mean disrupting  economic growth and potentially triggering job losses across the  country, as we experienced in the partisan 2013 shutdown.   A shutdown damages both our economy and national security. It is  vital that this Congress put forward a clean funding resolution. It  would be irresponsible for us to engage in partisan political games  with the funding of our Federal Government.                            ____________________
