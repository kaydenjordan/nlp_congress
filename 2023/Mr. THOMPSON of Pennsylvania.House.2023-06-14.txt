 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  and celebrate Flag Day and the birthday of the United States Army.   On this day, 246 years ago, the symbol of our Nation was born: the  American flag.   Flag Day honors the adoption of our stars and stripes by the Second  Continental Congress. From the time of its adoption until now, the flag  serves as representation of freedom and liberty both at home and  abroad.   Not only is our flag a symbol of our values, but it is also a  reminder of what we can be as a Nation.   As Americans, we should be especially thankful today and every day to  those who fought to protect and defend our flag. So how special it is  that today we also honor the 248th birthday of the United States Army.   Since their founding, the Army has played a major role in supporting  and defending our country, our flag, and our ideals. As an Army dad,  today is very special to me.   Mr. Speaker, let us all take an extra moment to reflect on the  importance of our flag and the Army for making America the land of the  free and the home of the brave.                            ____________________
