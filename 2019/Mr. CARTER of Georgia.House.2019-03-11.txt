 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life  of Mr. Carlton Gill, who passed away on February 18 at the age of 78.   His friends remember Mr. Gill as a man of many talents and an  institution in his hometown of Richmond Hill. Both of these statements  help to sum up Mr. Gill but only serve to remind us of a portion of his  character.   A formidable figure who played basketball at both Georgia Southern  University and the University of Georgia, his many talents included  working as a procurement forester at S.A. Allen for nearly 40 years,  serving as a Bryan County commissioner for five terms, worshipping at  Compassion Christian Church as a deacon, and much more.   For his work in guiding Richmond Hill through periods of significant  growth, a nearby section of I-95 is named in his honor.   Others, though, will remember his imposing stature and the respect he  commanded when entering the room. But he never wavered in his ability  to be fair and honest, and to treat everyone with that same level of  respect. A great leader of his community, Mr. Gill will be missed.   His family and friends are in my thoughts and prayers during this  difficult time.                            ____________________
