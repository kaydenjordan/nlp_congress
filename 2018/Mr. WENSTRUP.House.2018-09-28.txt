 Mr. Speaker, I find it interesting that I keep hearing  that the tax reforms were for the rich. The only phone calls I got  complaining about our tax reform were from the rich.   I had one gentleman call me and actually say: For those of us with  three or four homes, this is going to kill us.   Are you kidding me? And you keep saying this is a tax break for the  rich. They are the only ones complaining to me.   As a former small-business owner, I can tell you how difficult it is  to plan for the future. When you sit down to look at your company's  finances, you may be worried about paying your employees' salaries or  making the rent on time.   So many in this body, historically, have never run a business, yet  they have historically done a very good job of running some businesses  into the ground. The last thing any business owner wants to think about  is: I wonder what the Federal Government is going to do to my taxes 5,  10, 15 years from now.   Constant uncertainty does not work for the American people. High  taxes don't work for the American people. People want to keep their  money.   The House of Representatives is prepared to remedy these concerns for  many years to come. The Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts  Act of 2018 that is on the floor today as part of tax reform 2.0 would  make lower tax rates for all income levels permanent.   Critically, this bill permanently extends a major deduction for pass- through businesses, which make up most of the small businesses in the  U.S. This is significant peace of mind for the barbershop in town, for  your neighbor's lawn care business, for the garage-to-Main Street  startups, and for the millions of business dreams that, for now, are  still dreams.    Mr. Speaker, we now have one of the most competitive tax codes on the  globe. Let's make certain that we keep it that way.
