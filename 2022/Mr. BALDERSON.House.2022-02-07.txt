 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the life  and legacy of my dear friend, Dr. Paul Brown, past President of Zane  State College, and a respected voice for higher education in Ohio. I  was heartbroken to learn of his sudden passing last week.   Among the many accomplishments over his 30-year career was his work  to modernize Zane State for better preparing students for success in  their careers and in life. Under his leadership, Zane State had over 70  percent growth in enrollment and record-setting job placement.   It was an honor to work alongside Paul for so many years. I extend my  heartfelt condolences to his wife, Linda, and the entire Brown family.                            ____________________
