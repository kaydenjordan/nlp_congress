 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 899, the  Veterans Providing Healthcare Transition Improvement Act.   I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano), for helping me,  being the lead Democrat on this. This is bipartisan and bicameral  legislation. Senator Hirono is the sponsor in the Senate. We are the  sponsors in the House.   But, Mr. Speaker, it is great to have a veteran in the chair today.  Mr. Speaker, as a brigadier general in the Ohio Army National Guard, I  know firsthand the incredible sacrifices that our veterans have made in  the service of our country. We owe it to them to provide them time when  they come home to deal with the things they need to work on, their  medical and other conditions.   In 2015, the Wounded Warriors Federal Leave Act was signed into law,  which was great. It gave sick leave to people that are newly hired  Federal employees, rather than waiting on that leave to accrue, if they  had a disability rating, a service-connected disability rating of 30  percent of more. Unfortunately, that bill did not extend those benefits  to title 38 employees.                                time  1645    Those are VA employees, like physicians, physician assistants,  registered nurses, chiropractors, podiatrists, optometrists, and  dentists. They are healthcare providers themselves. It is no small  number of employees. In fact, as we sit here, there are over 14,000  vacancies in title 38 jobs. That means up to 14,000 people can benefit  from this bill.   Again, it is bipartisan. It is a simple change that allows these  title 38 veteran employees to get leave to deal with their wounded  warrior conditions rather than waiting for that leave to accrue over  time. It is a bipartisan bill. I thank Mr. Takano for that.   A lot of veteran organizations have supported it: the National  Association of VA Physicians and Dentists, the Nurses Organization of  Veterans Affairs, the American Legion, the VFW, Paralyzed Veterans of  America, Disabled American Veterans, Association of the United States  Navy, American Federation of Government Employees, National Federation  of Federal Employees, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, AMVETS,  and the Federal Managers Association.  [[Page H6215]]    I thank the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, the  gentleman from North Carolina, the gentleman from Maryland, and the  chairman from South Carolina for their hard work on this. I also want  to thank the Veterans' Affairs Committee and the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Roe) for their expertise as they worked through this  bill. I thank the sponsors of the Senate legislation, and I thank  Representative Takano for joining me in this important effort.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense,  bipartisan legislation.
