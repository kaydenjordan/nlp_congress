 Mr. President, last Thursday, Leader McConnell filed  cloture on four circuit court nominees, including two nominees who had  been voted out of the Judiciary Committee that very morning.   Voting on four controversial circuit court nominees in 1 week is  highly unusual, as is voting on nominees just days after they have  moved out of committee.   Senators who aren't on the Judiciary Committee deserve time to  consider nominees, review their backgrounds, and make an informed  decision for their vote.   But that is not what is happening in the Senate this week. Instead,  Republican Senate leadership is pushing President Trump's judges  through as quickly as possible.   Jamming through as many controversial judges as possible in as short  a time as possible--to lifetime appointments, no less--is  irresponsible. I cannot remember a time when we had cloture votes on  four circuit nominees in 1 week.   It is important to understand the context in which we find ourselves.   After failing to repeal the Affordable Care Act and with the  Republican tax reform plan facing opposition within his own party,  President Trump has turned more and more to Executive orders to  influence policy.   As we have seen, move after move has run into opposition in Federal  courts. So it is really no surprise that Republicans are trying to  stack those courts with ideological judges whom they hope and expect  will uphold the President's harmful policies.   Consider how many Trump actions have or will see time in the  courtroom, and you begin to understand why Republicans are rushing to  fill these vacancies--after allowing countless vacancies to remain  unfilled at the end of the last administration.   In each of the following cases, the President and Senate Republicans  seem to hope that the outcome will be different with a transformed  judiciary.   The President's Muslim travel ban has been struck down by multiple  courts who ruled that the ban is based on religion and suspending the  refugee program is discriminatory, with no basis in fact. The President  went so far as to personally insult some of the judges who heard  arguments on the travel ban.   The President's decision to end the DACA program is also likely to  find its way into the courtroom. Beginning on March 5, 2018, it is  estimated that around 1,000 DACA recipients per day will lose their  protection from deportation. By ending the program and thrusting  690,000 young people into legal limbo, the President ensured that  lawsuits would be filed, and he certainly is hopeful that conservative  judges are on the stand to hear the cases.   We have also seen the Trump administration make moves to restrict  women's access to healthcare. One woman had to go to Federal court  twice to challenge the government's efforts to restrict her access to  reproductive care. The full D.C. Circuit chided the attempt to  ``bulldoze over constitutional lines'' and deny this 17-year-old young  woman court-approved reproductive care. Republicans tried to block  three of President Obama's nominees to this same court and now are  rushing to fill its one vacancy as quickly as is possible. That is not  a coincidence.   President Trump's voter fraud commission will also certainly end up  in legal battles. At least eight lawsuits have been filed against the  President's Presidential Commission on Election Integrity, created to  investigate false claims that 3 million people voted illegally last  year. It is possible the commission has already violated Federal laws  with regard to how it handled sensitive information. This is already  the subject of ongoing litigation.   These are just a handful of Trump actions that will see time in  court. They highlight not only what is at state, but also why the  President is so anxious to hurry judges that he has selected on the  bench.   I would add that Republicans are now rushing to fill judicial  vacancies for this President after spending years blocking President  Obama from filling many of these same vacancies. It actually is the  most egregious effort I have ever seen.   This record of obstruction dates back to 2001 during the Clinton  administration. Senate Republicans used secret holds on nominees to  prevent judicial nominees from receiving committee hearings or floor  votes. This resulted in Republicans ``pocket filibustering'' nearly 70  of President Clinton's circuit and district court nominees, preventing  their confirmation. As discussed by Senator Leahy when he served as  chair and ranking member of the committee, Republicans would block  nominees through pocket filibustering, which meant they would deny  nominees hearings or up-or-down votes in committee. This is a chart  that lists those nominees.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the chart printed in  the Record following my remarks.   In the first 5 years of the Obama administration, Republicans forced  Obama's district court nominees to wait nearly three times as long and  circuit court nominees nearly twice as long as Bush nominees for  confirmation votes. During the final 2 years of his Presidency, Senate  Republicans engaged in a historic blockade of judicial nominees.   It wasn't just the unprecedented decision to block Chief Judge  Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.   During the final 2 years of President Obama's administration, only 22  judicial nominees were confirmed--and just nine in the final year.   That is the lowest number of judges confirmed in a 2-year Congress  since President Truman was in office. Contrast this with the last 2  years of the Bush administration when Democrats were in the Senate  majority and still confirmed 68 of his nominees.   In the last 2 years under President Obama, there were 53 article III  judicial nominees pending in the Senate at the end of 2016. That is 53  nominees who Republicans either refused to hold hearings on or refused  to confirm once they were on the floor.   In fact, of those 53 nominees, 25 had been voted out of committee and  were waiting for confirmation on the Senate floor. All they needed was  for the Republican leadership to bring them up for a floor vote.   Twenty-three of those 25 nominees had been unanimously voice-voted  out of committee with overwhelming bipartisan support. Still,  Republicans refused to confirm them.   Since my colleagues have spent some time noting that three of the  circuit court nominees we are considering this week are women, I would  like to note that half of the nominees Republicans blocked from  becoming circuit and district court judges last year were women.   Here is the point: Republican leadership wanted those seats,  including the Supreme Court, left open in the hopes that a Republican  would be elected President and pick new judges. They ignored the needs  of country and the judiciary for their own political wants.   Two of the nominees we are considering this week--Amy Coney Barrett  and Stephanos Bibas--are filling seats that President Obama had  nominated African-American women to. Neither were confirmed because  Republican home-State senators didn't return blue slips. That is a  fact.   Judge John Bush, who now sits on the Court of Appeals for the Sixth  Circuit, was likewise confirmed only because Leader McConnell refused  to return a blue slip on a well-qualified woman, Kentucky Supreme Court  Justice Lisabeth Tabor Hughes, whom President Obama had nominated last  year.   Republicans exploited the blue slip process during the Obama  Presidency, but today we hear constant rumors that Republicans want to  do away with the process--another tool allowing them to ram through  more judges.   It is worth noting that, even though Democrats had sincere,  legitimate concerns about the writings of John Bush--which included him  equating slavery and abortion--his nomination was rushed through by  Leader McConnell.   John Bush was confirmed just 73 days after he was nominated. In fact,  President Trump's first four circuit court  [[Page S6986]]  nominees waited just 84 days, on average, from nomination until  confirmation. By contrast President Obama's first four circuit court  nominees waited an average of 213 days. That is nearly three times  longer.   The hypocrisy we are seeing on display is stunning. With that in  mind, I want to say a few words about the nominees themselves.   Our Nation's appellate courts are the final deciders of the vast  majority of cases, so a nominees experience matters a great deal to me.  However, the first nominee we voted on, Professor Amy Barrett, who has  now been confirmed to the Seventh Circuit, had very limited experience.   She did not have any experience as a judge, and she only worked on  one trial before becoming a professor.   Practically speaking, this meant the only record on which we could  judge her was her academic writings. In those writings, I was  especially troubled by her position that Supreme Court precedents can  simply be set aside when a Justice disagrees with them.   The National Women's Law Center wrote that these writings ``raise  serious concerns'' about how Professor Barrett, if confirmed, ``would  interpret, apply, and follow precedent, including Supreme Court  precedent.'' In fact, they point out that Professor Barrett's ``prior  writings consistently suggest that she believes precedents like Roe and  Casey should be considered weaker and are susceptible to challenge. . .  .''   That is why I was unable to support Professor Barrett's nomination.   The second nominee we voted on was Justice Joan Larsen for the Sixth  Circuit. Justice Larsen, who currently serves on the Michigan Supreme  Court, has deeply troubling views on Presidential powers.   In fact, she advocated for the Bush administration's view that the  President had the authority to disregard a law that Congress had just  passed, which prohibited the U.S. Government from using torture.   It is no surprise that President Trump, who has shown contempt for  the other coequal branches of government, nominated Justice Larsen. Her  views are undoubtedly part of why the President included Justice Larsen  on his short list of Supreme Court nominees last year.   President Trump repeatedly made clear that he was only considering  nominees for the Supreme Court who passed his litmus tests, including  to overturn Roe v. Wade. Recall President Trump's interview with ``60  Minutes'' immediately after he won the election. He said, ``I'm pro- life. And the judges are going to be pro-life.''   He added that his judges were going to be ``very pro-Second  Amendment.''   We heard from 30 groups who were concerned about Justice Larsen's  nomination, and several highlighted the danger of this litmus test.   As Lambda Legal wrote, ``A decision by this Committee to advance her  nomination will be rightfully understood as not only a threat to Roe  but also to the LGBT cases that were built upon Roe's foundation.''   I opposed Justice Larsen's nomination.   The third nominee we are considering is Justice Allison Eid for the  Tenth Circuit. She was also included on President Trump's short list of  Supreme Court nominees last year.   Since 2006, Justice Eid has served on the Colorado Supreme Court. A  review of her opinions shows why the Denver Post wrote in September  before her hearing: ``On the state's high court, Eid has earned a  reputation as one of its most conservative members.'' Here are just a  couple of examples.   In 2014, the Colorado Supreme Court held that a worker who fell down  a flight of stairs at her workplace and suffered multiple aneurysms as  a result deserved to be compensated under the State's workplace  compensation law. Justice Eid dissented, arguing that the employee did  not deserve any compensation for her injuries, in City of Brighton v.  Rodriguez.   In 2012, Justice Eid was the lone dissenting vote when the Colorado  Supreme Court upheld a new redistricting map that was drawn to protect  residents' constitutional right under the ``one person, one vote''  standard. The old map had unequal populations and was redone with the  extensive work of a trial court.   On appeal, Justice Eid was the only dissenting judge, and she argued  to throw out the trial court's work because she believed it had not  given ``adequate weight'' to one entirely optional factor.   Justice Eid's record has also led a number of organizations to oppose  her nomination, including the AFL-CIO, the Leadership Conference on  Civil and Human Rights--LCCR--and Planned Parenthood.   I opposed Justice Eid's nomination.   The final nominee we will vote on is Professor Stephanos Bibas for  the Third Circuit. Like Professor Barrett, much of his legal career has  been spent in academia, so our job in reviewing his record is to  carefully consider his writings.   Professor Bibas's writings have focused on criminal law, and he has  pushed forward controversial ideas about punishment. His most troubling  proposals were set out in a paper he wrote in 2009.   In it, he argued that, for a wide variety of crimes, ``the default  punishment should be non-disfiguring corporal punishment, such as  electric shocks.''   Bibas also suggested ``putting offenders in the stocks or pillory,  where they would sit or stand for hours bent in uncomfortable  positions. Bystanders and victims could jeer and pelt them with rotten  eggs and tomatoes (but not rocks).''   For more severe crimes, he advocated ``multiple calibrated  electroshocks or taser shots,'' with medical personnel on hand to  ensure ``that the offender's health could bear it.''   These views are shocking and outside of the mainstream. A few years  before Professor Bibas wrote his article, this body had already debated  and passed the Detainee Treatment Act in 2005, which prohibited  ``cruel'' and ``degrading'' punishment of prisoners.   I appreciate that Professor Bibas testified to the Judiciary  Committee that he now understands that his views on use of corporal  punishment for prisoners are, in his words, ``wrong and deeply  offensive.''   He came to this conclusion only after he repeatedly made public  presentations on his paper, including one to a Federalist Society  Chapter entitled, ``Corporal Punishment, Not Imprisonment: The Shocking  Case for Hurting Criminals.''   I cannot support Professor Bibas's nomination and will vote no.   In closing, as my colleagues consider how they will vote on these and  other nominees, I would urge them to consider the broader context in  which we are considering this President's judicial nominees.   We have a President who has demonstrated contempt for the rule of law  and for the independence of the federal judiciary. I am deeply  concerned that this President expects the courts to just rubberstamp  his policy preferences.   For every judicial nomination, we have to consider carefully the  nominee's record and reflect on whether they can truly be fair,  independent, and impartial--whether they will respect the rule of law.  For these reasons and the records of the four nominees I have just  discussed, I cannot support them.
