 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and honor those who  lost their lives on September 11, 2001. On that tragic day, nearly  3,000 innocent Americans were killed in the attacks on the World Trade  Center in New York, the Pentagon in D.C., and those on Flight 93 in  Pennsylvania. Some of those who perished included brave first  responders who ran into the burning buildings as others were running  out.   That horrific day changed our great Nation forever. It became clear  that there was an ever-present threat by those who wish to attack our  country and its citizens.  [[Page H7882]]    Eleven days after these attacks, the Department of Homeland Security  was created to make a more secure America that is better equipped to  confront the range of threats that we face.   As the current chairman of the Homeland Security Appropriations  Subcommittee, I am working to ensure that the Department is provided  with the resources to accomplish their mission. Working to keep our  Nation safe is one of my top priorities, and one of the primary roles  of the Federal Government.   Together, we must work to make sure that terrorist attacks like 9/11  never happen again.                            ____________________
