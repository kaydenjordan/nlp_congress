 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this very  important package, S. 47, the Natural Resources Management Act.   This bill is comprised of dozens of smaller bills, including two that  I have had the opportunity to sponsor: the Emery County Public Land  Management Act and the Endangered Fish Recovery Programs Extension Act.   The Emery County bill has been a locally driven effort and will bring  long-term certainty to the area through various designations and  expanding Goblin Valley State Park for better management. It will also  generate millions of dollars for Utah school kids through the School  Trust Land Exchanges.   Also in this package, the Endangered Fish Recovery Programs Extension  Act will ensure access to critical water sources and continue to  promote the recovery of four endangered species.   There are many, many who deserve praise for their years and decades  of work on these bills. I would especially like to thank Republican  leader Bishop, who has been invaluable in pushing these bills across  the finish line and, on a personal note, has mentored me through very  difficult public lands issues.   Especially today, I would like to give appreciation and recognition  to Emery County commissioners, who had the ability to see into the  future to understand how important this was for their county and to  work through all the difficult issues.   Finally, I would like to thank my colleagues on the Democratic side  of the aisle for their willingness to work with me, to see this through  our eyes and to explain this through their eyes. I am grateful for the  friendships and relationships that I have developed through this  process.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to seeing both of my bills headed to the  President's desk with the passage of S. 47.
