 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Critz Farms in  Cazenovia, New York.   This month the New York State Agricultural Society honored Critz  Farms with the 2018 Business of the Year Award. The award recognizes  the quality, leadership, and innovation demonstrated by State farms and  particularly agribusinesses.   Critz Farms was established in 1985 by Matthew and Juanita Critz. The  family-run farm offers various educational tours for visitors such as  apple cider production, pumpkin patch browsing, and maple sugaring  tours. Their mission is to educate people about farming and the origins  of food, all while providing fun for the whole family.   Critz Farms grows a variety of crops, including apples, strawberries,  blueberries, and conifer trees for Christmas. The family-run farm also  produces apple cider, award-winning hard cider, craft beer, and pure  maple syrup.   Congratulations again to Critz Farms for being honored as the New  York State Agricultural Society's Business of the Year. I am looking  forward to visiting Critz Farms, as I do each year, for maple syrup  season this March. Many of you may be surprised to know that the best  maple syrup in the world is produced in New York State.                            ____________________
