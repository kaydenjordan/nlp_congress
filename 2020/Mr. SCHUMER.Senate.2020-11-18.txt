 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, first, let me join all of my colleagues  in wishing the Senate pro tempore, the senior Senator from Iowa,  Senator Grassley, a speedy and quick recovery. We know he is a strong  man, and we have every confidence he will beat this back, as he has  beaten many other adversities back in the past.   Now, it has been nearly 2 weeks since every major news network called  the Presidential election for Joe Biden. Preparations for the incoming  Biden administration are well under way, and still--still--President  Trump refuses to accept reality.   This morning brought a fresh series of Presidential delusions on  Twitter. President Trump declared--sometimes in capital letters--that  the election was a fraud, a joke, and even unconstitutional. Imagine  that, an unconstitutional election. That is because Trump's ego is  such, when he doesn't win, everything is wrong, false, et cetera.   President Trump, get out of your bubble. You lost. Joe Biden will be  sworn in as the next President of the United States on January 20.  There is nothing you can do to stop it. Get out of the bubble and work  on a transition.   Last night, continuing President Trump's outrageous and dishonest  behavior, President Trump fired our country's chief election security  officer, Chris Krebs, an honorable public servant, because he confirmed  that our elections were secure. This reinforced the No. 1 rule of  working for Donald Trump: You can never tell the truth.   But no matter whom he fires or how many times he tweets, President  Trump cannot change reality. He lost the Presidential election. Joe  Biden will be the next President of the United States, and it is time  for President Trump to quit the nonsense, admit the truth, and move on.  Anytime my Republican colleagues want to tell him that would be fine by  me.
