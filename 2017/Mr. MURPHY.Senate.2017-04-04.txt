 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Thank you, Mr. President.   Mr. President, confirming a Supreme Court Justice is one of the if  not the most important responsibilities we have as Senators. It is a  vote we cast knowing full well that the tenure and the influence of the  nominee who is before us will likely be greater and much more long- lasting than our own in the Senate.   After meeting with Judge Gorsuch and reviewing hours of his testimony  before the Judiciary Committee, I have decided to oppose his  nomination, and I come to the floor this evening to talk about the  reasons why.   I am deeply concerned about the politicization of the Supreme Court  and its recent capture by corporate and special interests. I am  convinced that Judge Gorsuch would exacerbate that slide and continue  the activist bent of the existing Court, and for that reason I won't be  supporting him in the vote tomorrow.   There is no doubt that Neil Gorsuch is a well trained, very  intelligent lawyer who likely has the right disposition to serve on our  Nation's highest Court, but that is not the end of the analysis that I  or any of us are required to conduct. I am concerned about Judge  Gorsuch's record of putting corporate interests before the public  interests. His past decisions demonstrate a resistance on his part to  put victims' and employees' needs above those of large corporations. He  has regularly sided with employers over workers, corporation's rights  over the rights of employees to make personal healthcare decisions.  While he admirably claims to rest his decisions on the law rather than  his political views, his consistent support for the powerful over the  powerless doesn't seem coincidental.   The Roberts Court, in my mind, has swung dramatically in favor of the  rights of corporations and special interests over those of individual  Americans. I would have supported a mainstream nominee, but the risk  that Judge Gorsuch will inject his political judgment over a process  that already too often favors the rights of corporations over  individuals is too great a risk for him to earn my support. That was  the statement I released upon making my decision. I wanted to begin my  remarks with it.   I want to talk a little bit about the elements inherent in my  decision to vote against Judge Gorsuch because I don't take that  decision lightly. I have said throughout the beginning of President  Trump's tenure that I do believe we owe some degree of deference to a  President in making choices as to who will serve him in his  administration, and I think that likely applies to the question of whom  a President chooses for the Supreme Court as well. I think I voted that  way. I certainly voted against many of President Trump's nominees, but  I voted for many of the nominees with whom I had very deep  disagreements with over policy as well. So it is not a question of  whether Judge Gorsuch would be my choice; it is a question of whether I  think he is going to be in the mainstream on the Supreme Court or  whether I think he is going to be an outlier and bring potentially  radical views into the courtroom.   But it is kind of silly for us to pretend this debate is happening in  a vacuum. I am making my mind up on Judge Gorsuch, as I will try to  outline this evening, based upon my review of his record and my belief  about who he will be as a Justice.   We would all be lying if we said as Democrats that we don't remember  what happened on the floor of the Senate all throughout 2016. Merrick  Garland should be on the Supreme Court today, or if not Merrick  Garland, someone else who was nominated by President Barack Obama. The  Supreme Court vacancy occurred with nearly 12 months left in his term-- 25 percent of a term that he was elected to by the people of the United  States. The Constitution doesn't allow for 3-year terms. It  [[Page S2377]]  doesn't say the President becomes illegitimate once he hits the final  12 months. The Framers of our Constitution were hopeful that the  President would be President for all 4 years. That last year was robbed  not just from President Obama but from the American people by  Republicans in the Senate when they treated Judge Garland with such  disrespect.   It would have been one thing to simply vote against him because you  didn't want to let the President of an opposing party fill that seat,  but to not even give him a hearing, to not give him a vote, to not even  take meetings with him, which was the decision of many Republican  colleagues, that was a show of disrespect to Judge Garland that I don't  think any of us could have imagined. It was a show of disrespect to  this Chamber, to the traditions of this body that those of us who may  have supported Judge Garland remember. That bad taste still sits in our  mouth.   So I am here to state that my vote against Judge Gorsuch is not  payback for the way in which Merrick Garland was treated, but I  remember what happened.   To the extent that my Republican colleagues are suggesting that we  should vote for Judge Gorsuch or at least vote for cloture tomorrow as  a means of upholding the traditions of the Senate--spare me. Spare me.  There isn't a lot of interest on this side of the aisle in upholding  the traditions of the Senate if we are the only ones doing it.    Some people say: Well, if you voted for cloture on Gorsuch tomorrow  and let it go to a final vote, then maybe Republicans would keep the  rules as is.   That is belied by the facts. Last year, the Republican majority made  it pretty clear that they were willing to break all tradition, all  precedent, and all comity in the Senate in order to get their person on  the Supreme Court. That wasn't just a 2016 issue; that is the new  normal for Republicans in the Senate. So whenever Democrats raised an  objection to a nominee to the Supreme Court, the rules were going to  change because Republicans made it clear that their first priority is  to get their people on the Supreme Court and their second priority is  to think about and try to preserve the way in which the Senate has run.   I am not voting against Neil Gorsuch because I am mad about what  happened, but to the extent that I have heard Republicans in the Senate  lecture us about violating the traditions of the Senate, it makes my  blood boil because I was here in 2016. I saw what the Republican  majority did to Merrick Garland.   Maybe we can sit down after this is done and talk about how the  Senate just doesn't get into a giant vortex of devolvement, tit for  tat, such that all of the reasons why people run for the Senate--the  individual prerogatives that Senators have, the demand to find  consensus in a way that doesn't exist in the House--all vanish. Merrick  Garland is still here, and it would be silly for us to try to pretend  he isn't.   One of the reasons I am so worried about Judge Gorsuch is because of  his enthusiasm for a brand of judicial interpretation called  originalism. It doesn't sound that radical, right, originalism? The  idea is that one interprets the Constitution as the Founding Fathers  intended it to be; one doesn't place it in the context of today. Simply  think to yourself, what would those White men who wrote those words-- what would they think about the case before us? What did they mean back  in the late 1700s? On its face, it is an absurd way to think about  judging cases because so much of what is before a Justice had no  relevance and did not exist back in the 1780s, so questions about what  these men thought about various questions regarding technology or civil  rights are irrelevant because the Framers of the Constitution simply  weren't thinking about the same things we are thinking about today.   One of our most famous jurists understood this right from the outset.  Justice John Marshall wrote in McCulloch v. Maryland: ``We must never  forget that it is a Constitution we are expounding, intended to endure  for ages to come and consequently to be adapted to the various crises  of human affairs.''   Even those who were judging the Constitution at its outset understood  that, as the questions presented to this country changed, originalism-- the idea that you only look to the thoughts and words and deeds of the  Founding Fathers--probably wouldn't be an efficient way to decide  cases.   Justice Brennan gave a wonderful speech at Georgetown in 1985 that is  worth reading tonight. Justice Brennan said:         We current Justices read the Constitution in the only way       that we can: as Twentieth Century Americans. We look to the       history of the time of framing and to the intervening history       of interpretation. But the ultimate question must be, what do       the words of the text mean in our time? For the genius of the       Constitution rests not in any static meaning it might have       had in a world that is dead and gone, but in the adaptability       of its great principles to cope with current problems and       current needs.    He went on to say:         Time works changes, brings into existence new conditions       and purposes. Therefore, a principle to be vital must be       capable of wider application than the mischief which gave it       birth.    It is a wonderful turn of phrase.   He said:         This is peculiarly true of constitutions. They are not       ephemeral enactments, designed to meet passing occasions.       They are, to use the words of Chief Justice John Marshall,       ``designed to approach immortality as nearly as human       institutions can approach it.''    He said:         Interpretation must account for the transformative purpose       of the text. Our Constitution was not intended to preserve a       preexisting society but to make a new one, to put in place       new principles that the prior political community had not       sufficiently recognized.    Senator Klobuchar asked Judge Gorsuch at his hearing if, because the  Constitution only uses the word ``he'' or ``his,'' it meant that a  woman could not be President. Well, the Constitution doesn't  specifically speak to this question, but if you were an originalist, I  can imagine how many of those Founding Fathers would have answered that  question. Why? Because they didn't believe that women deserved the  right to vote, so why on Earth would they believe that a woman should  be President? At the time, Blacks were considered to be subhuman. They  were granted three-fifths status in the Constitution. They were  slaves. To read a document only through the lens of a group of White  males who did not believe that a woman should be allowed to vote, who  did not believe that Blacks were human beings and on equal footing with  the rest of us, is to freeze this document in a time and ask us to,  consequently, freeze ourselves in that time as well. If you do not  allow the document to move, then you do not allow the rest of us to  move either.    Originalism is a fraud, and what it has become is a mask for  politics.   Now, what do I mean by that?   When you insist on interpreting the Constitution based only on the  ways in which the writers of that document viewed the world, you have  no way to base decisions in current times that are based on any real  text or set of historical facts because, of course, the Founding  Fathers had given no thought to many of the most important questions  that are presented to us today--for instance, questions about what  rights individuals have with respect to government surveillance over  their cell phones, which is a question that the Founding Fathers--the  Framers of the Constitution--could never have considered. It allows you  to, essentially, make it up for yourself because there is no way that  you can find a quote from any of the signers of the Constitution as to  what they thought about these modern questions. You can spin it any way  that you need to.   Originalism is an invitation to bring politics onto the Court because  anybody can make up a reason as to why the people who wrote the  Constitution would, ultimately, have decided the way that that jurist  wants the decision to turn out.   It connects with other troubling writings of Judge Gorsuch's. He  proudly calls himself an originalist. Historically, if we look at the  broad swath of jurists who have gotten on the Supreme Court, it is not  a mainstream school of judicial interpretation, but he has other  radical views as well.   The Chevron deference standard is named for a 1984 case in which the  Supreme Court held that it should defer to regulatory agencies when  they interpret ambiguous laws that are passed  [[Page S2378]]  by Congress. We pass ambiguous laws, sometimes on purpose and sometimes  by accident. But we often do it on purpose because we, ultimately,  leave it to the regulator to fill in the details--to proffer  regulations, to work out the details of enforcement. We often do not  define every single term, in part, because we know that there is going  to be the executive branch and people working for an elected official-- the President of the United States--who are going to carry out that act  and, ultimately, be responsible to the people.   What Judge Gorsuch has suggested is that maybe it is time to overturn  the Chevron deference standard. Maybe we should not give any deference  to administrative agencies any longer. Maybe the Supreme Court, on  every single law, should do a de novo review of its constitutionality  and give no deference to the executive branch.   First of all, that would be pandemonium. It would greatly accelerate  the number of cases that come before the Supreme Court and the number  of major--potentially life-changing--decisions that the unelected Court  is making. Why? Because we are always passing statutes here that leave  room for interpretation. Again, we do it many times intentionally and  sometimes unintentionally, but it happens every single month here that  we pass statutes that leave room for interpretation.   We often do that knowing, as I said, that the Executive will make  some of those secondary interpretations. We are comfortable with that  because, if his interpretation goes wrong, then that Executive is never  more than about 3\1/2\ years from an election.   The executive branch is responsible to the people. The courts are  not. These are lifetime appointments that we make. If every single  statute that we pass is interpreted from the foundation by the Supreme  Court and if they get it wrong, there is no way to get rid of them.  There is no way to roll that interpretation back. In fact, that is one  of the reasons for the Chevron deference--the reluctance of the Court  to make itself an active political player in the process of  interpreting statutes.   So it is radical that Judge Gorsuch is suggesting that, if he were  put on the Supreme Court, he would overturn that 1984 case. Justice  Scalia was one of the primary defenders of Chevron for that very  reason, in that he saw that the legitimacy of the Court--indeed, the  legitimacy of the entire judicial system--would be put in jeopardy if  it inserted itself as the primary arbiter of ambiguous statutes, of  statutes that needed interpretation.   Originalism is an invitation to take your politics onto the Court.  The evisceration of the Chevron deference would, inherently, make the  Court a political body. If you combine the two together, you will start  to see a Justice who will likely continue this trend line of its being  an activist Court that makes political decisions in substitute of the  Congress.    We have all seen it happen, whether it be in the voting rights case,  in which the unelected Supreme Court decided that racism was not  something that we had to think about any longer due to their vast  experience in the South and in dealing with cases of voter suppression,  or in their arbitrary decision that corruption should be very narrowly  defined and that we need not pay attention to the slow, creeping  corruption that happens when donors get access to the political process  through donations of thousands and tens of thousands and hundreds of  thousands and millions of dollars. The Supreme Court is telling the  people of this country and this Congress what corruption is and what it  is not.   Those are political decisions that the Court has made--an activist  Court--that now may have among its members a Justice who has,  effectively, advertised himself as being willing and eager to join that  trend line on the Court.   Individual cases raise concerns as well. In Riddle v. Hickenlooper,  Judge Gorsuch expressed an openness in providing a higher level of  constitutional protection to a donor's right to make political  contributions than the Court currently affords the right to actually  vote--donors having more rights than voters have.   As for the result of applying strict scrutiny, which is the term that  he is referring to with regard to political donations, we do not  exactly know what would happen, but it likely would have the  consequence of making it almost impossible to regulate campaign  finance. Ninety-three percent of Americans, in a recent poll, think  that government should be working to limit the impact that big donors  have on politics today. Yet Judge Gorsuch has suggested that, as a  Supreme Court jurist, he may move the law in the opposite direction,  robbing from both of us--Republicans and Democrats--the ability to do  what 93 percent of Americans want us to do, which is to restrict the  ability of a handful of billionaires to affect the political process.   In the Hobby Lobby decision, yet again, Judge Gorsuch suggests that  corporations, in this case, have more rights under the Constitution  than do the individuals who work for them--that the religious freedom  rights of the corporation trump the religious freedom rights of  employees. Once again, it ruled that those with power--big donors or  corporations--have more rights than those with less power--ordinary  voters, employees of these big companies.   Years ago, Judge Gorsuch wrote in a complaint, according to him, that  liberals were using the Court to try to push their political agenda  rather than to bring it here to the Congress. The reality is that, over  the course of the Roberts Court, the exact opposite has happened. It  has been Conservatives who have brought their complaints to the court  system--their complaints about voting rights, their complaints about  campaign finance, their complaints about the Affordable Care Act-- rather than to have brought them to the floor of this body.   As the House of Representatives abandons, for the time being, the  repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act, their allies  continue to push cases through the court system that would attempt to  unwind it. Judge Gorsuch has been, in his writings at least, blind to  this idea that Conservatives have spent just as much time over the past  20 years in trying to push their agenda in court as have Progressives.  Progressives have done that as well.   Clearly, we have full marriage rights in this country because of  court cases that Progressive groups push. I am not denying that there  is not this trend line on both sides of the political spectrum, but  Judge Gorsuch seems to only recognize it in his writings when it comes  to the liberals who are pushing these causes.   These are the most important decisions we make. Many of us may only  get to vote on a Supreme Court Justice once or twice. This is my fifth  year in the Senate, and this is my first vote. My first vote should  have come in 2016, but it is coming now in 2017. I do not take it  lightly, but there is a reason--when you go back to your apartment here  in Washington--that you are watching TV commercials that are paid for  by big corporations and billionaires who support Judge Gorsuch's  nomination.   He says that he is going to play it straight. He says that he is not  going to be affected by his political agenda. I hope that he is right,  but the folks who are fronting the money for these ads do not believe  him. They think they know how he is going to rule. Believe me. They  would not be putting up all of this money on TV if they did not think  that Judge Gorsuch was going to be a friend to the big companies, to  the billionaire donors who want more and more protection through the  court system.   Donald Trump was right about something when he ran for President. He  was not right that elections are rigged, but he was right that, in  general, the system--our economic state of affairs--does seem to be  pretty rigged against regular people. Economic mobility, which is how  we define ourselves as a country, is further away from the people whom  I represent in Connecticut than ever before, and the statistics bear  that out.   Your ability to move from poverty to prosperity is less today than it  has been at any point in our lifetimes. It does feel like the powerful  and the rich have recovered very nicely from this recession and that  nobody else has. It feels like they have a voice here in Washington  that no one else has either.   If you are President Trump, having run on this promise to unrig the  system, boy, this doesn't seem like the person you should be sending to  the  [[Page S2379]]  bench, somebody who has openly advertised his enthusiasm for voting  with billionaires, with corporations, with folks who have lots of  political power already.   The TransAm case, which has been talked about enough on the floor, is  a unique one. It is the case of a trucker who was being potentially  left to die by his employer on the side of the road, who left his truck  to save his life and potentially the lives of others on the road, had  he chosen instead to operate it. Judge Gorsuch ruled with his employer,  effectively suggesting this man should have risked his life or the  lives of others to comply with the strict letter of the law.   Judge Gorsuch was asked in the Judiciary Committee what he would have  done: What would you have done if you had two options--sit in that  truck and face death or put it back on the road and potentially kill  others? What would you have done? Judge Gorsuch said that he hadn't  thought about it.   I don't want my Supreme Court Justices to be political. I don't want  them to be us. It really is our job to think about, in a real,  tangible, grassroots way, the effect of our laws on their lives. But I  don't want a Justice who doesn't even contemplate the answer to that  question, the impact of the law on regular people. I don't want a  Justice who views the law only through the eyes of a group of White men  who lived in a fundamentally different world. I don't want a Justice  who isn't thinking about how the law applies to people who need a  statute's protection, rather than thinking about those who, frankly,  don't need the protection of statute because they have been handed a  pretty good lot in life from the start.   I am going to oppose cloture tomorrow, and if we eventually get to a  vote, I will oppose Judge Gorsuch on final passage.   My final comment is this: When that moment comes, I do hope that our  colleagues will think twice about changing the rules of the Senate.  They had already broken with precedent once in 2016 in a way that I  think is unforgiveable. To do it twice in a 24-month period puts this  place on a downward spiral that I am not sure we can recover from. If  we just want to be the House of Representatives, let's just do it. But  there is another way to go, to select a nominee who could truly get  bipartisan support.   As my colleague Tim Kaine is fond of saying, there is only one  appointment by the President of the United States that needs 60 votes.  There is only one person the President picks who needs to get more than  60. That is the Justice of the Supreme Court because it is permanent,  because it is important, because it lasts longer than we do. There is  probably good reason for that.   Precedent and comity were broken in 2016. I will never, ever forget  the disrespect shown to Judge Garland and to everyone in this body, but  to double down on that break with precedent, on that break with  tradition, by changing the rules of the Senate permanently with respect  to Supreme Court Justices--I know they can say that Democrats did it a  few years ago. That is true. But the Supreme Court is a different  animal entirely, and the decision is one I hope my Republican  colleagues will rethink.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
