 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk, No. 89.    Mr. Chair, this amendment requires oil and gas companies  operating on our public lands to make one simple pledge to the American  people, that it won't gouge consumers at the pump.   It requires the Secretary of Energy to secure that commitment before  any new permit to increase production on our lands will be approved.   It would help prevent some of the damage that this disastrous bill  would do to our Nation's ability to address skyrocketing energy prices  in the country.   Frankly, the bill before us is nothing more than a shameless attempt  by my Republican colleagues to help increase drilling. If this bill  were titled correctly, it would be known as the big win for Big Oil  act, and it would come at a huge price for the American people.   As the chair of the Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations  Subcommittee in the last Congress, I have been on the front lines to  bring down gas prices in this country. I held a hearing last year with  the top executives from six of the Nation's largest oil producers to  have them explain why Americans were suddenly being asked to pay  record-high prices at the pump and why Americans should be forced to  provide their companies billions of dollars in subsidies each year when  they were reporting record-high profits and hardworking families were  struggling hard to fill up their cars.   Despite what the supporters of this bill will tell you, not one  executive at that hearing claimed that opening up Federal land for  drilling would lower prices at the pump. In fact, one executive at that  hearing even admitted that opening up more land to drilling in the  country would do nothing to bring the cost of gasoline down.   Why? Because there is nothing--and I repeat, nothing--preventing the  oil industry from expanding its production tomorrow if they wanted to.  They just choose not to because of profits.   The oil industry currently leases 26.6 million acres of Federal  lands. Less than half of that land under current lease, 12.7 acres, is  currently being used for production, so there is no relationship  between opening up more Federal lands for the production of oil and gas  and the price that Americans pay at the pump. None.                                time  1630    Instead of helping to bring down prices for consumers, what this bill  does is it really makes it harder for future administrations to  respond.   It takes away the one tool that has been used effectively to help  alleviate the pain consumers were suddenly feeling this past summer and  the one tool we have to prevent it from happening again.   It prevents the President from releasing our Nation's oil reserves on  to the market during a crisis. It prevents the administration from  taking the steps necessary to curb excessive price increases that can  cause real harm to people, family, and businesses across this country.   If Republicans were serious about helping consumers, let's do it, but  let's do it explicitly.   Let's include in this bill a provision that will expressly prohibit  these companies from gouging consumers at the pump.   My amendment requires the Secretary of Energy to secure from any oil  company looking to increase production on Federal lands a commitment  that it will not excessively increase its prices during periods of  future disruption.   It gives the oil companies what the Republicans say the industry  wants, which is the ability to increase production on the public lands.  So all we ask for--all we ask for--Mr. Chairman, is a simple commitment  that they won't gouge consumers at the pump.   Sounds like a win-win to me.   I would urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment to the underlying  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.                                Point of Order     Mr. Chairman, this amendment is focused on the  development of the plan in the underlying bill, and therefore, it is  germane. We actually narrowed this amendment so we didn't get into  actual implementation.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
