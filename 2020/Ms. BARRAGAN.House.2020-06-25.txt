 Mr. Speaker, the time for change is now.   Not next month.   Not after more studies.   Not after more deaths.   Now.   Our country demands it.   We, as a Congress, have listened. Today, we must act.   For George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Eric Garner, and the countless  others, we demand justice. We demand change.   In my very own district, just last week, a young Latino kid, 18 years  old, Andres Guardado, was shot in the back by police. There were no  body cameras. Surveillance video gone. And Andres is gone, with six  police bullets in his back.   The public should not need to call for a third-party investigation  into these deaths. We should be able to trust the system.   More importantly, they should not need investigations because the  killings must stop--today.   Mr. Speaker, we must pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.
