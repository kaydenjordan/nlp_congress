 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the  tenure of my longtime scheduler, director of operations, and policy  adviser, Ruth Ward.   After 6 extraordinary years on Capitol Hill, Ruth is leaving public  service for a new opportunity, and she is also adding a second baby to  the family in the process.   My wife, Kelly, and I have known Ruth for many years and have admired  her work and exceptional talents long before she joined our team after  my election to Congress in 2016.   Ruth has been more than a consummate professional and office  coordinator. She has brought faithful perspective and wise counsel. She  has mentored countless young staffers, and she has opened her home to  those who are away from family during the holidays.   Ruth has been like family to all of us. Everybody on Team Johnson  will miss her presence terribly.   Madam Speaker, we thank her for her invaluable contributions to the  people of our home State of Louisiana and ensure her that she and  Richard and their young family will remain in our prayers as they  pursue the next steps in their journey.   We are grateful, Ruth. Thank you for a job well done.                            ____________________
