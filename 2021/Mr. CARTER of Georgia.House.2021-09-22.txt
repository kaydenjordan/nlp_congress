 Madam Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart  to remember and honor Linda Fisk Morris of Savannah, Georgia, who sadly  passed recently at the age of 77.   Linda spent her life serving her community by sharing her love for  art and nature.   After moving to Georgia's First Congressional District in 1997, Linda  began supporting the Telfair Museums in Savannah, Georgia.   During her career in Savannah, Linda served on the collections  committee and helped direct the acquisition of rare works of art for  the museum.   Linda's passion for her outdoor life and adventures led her to travel  around the world. From the Grand Canyon to the Amazon, her passion for  life was undeniable.   Everyone who knew Linda recognized her giving heart and love for her  community.   I am thankful for the immense impact Linda had on the Savannah  community. I know her legacy will remain.   My thoughts and prayers are with her family, friends, and all who  knew her during this most difficult time.                      Diplomatic Relationship with India     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  important diplomatic partnership between the United States of America  and the Republic of India.   Visits of our nations' leaders are critical aspects of our  relationship, and the United States is honored to welcome Prime  Minister Modi.   The United States and India share deep historic ties that are rooted  in democracy, freedom, and rule of law.   Over the years, our two nations have increased our trade  collaboration which is an important component of our partnership. In  2019 trade in goods and services reached $149 billion between our  countries. Increasing trade between the United States and India will  result in greater prosperity for our people.   It is vital that the world's largest democracy has a strong  diplomatic partnership with this shining city upon a hill that we have  been elected to represent.   Madam Speaker, I thank Prime Minister Modi for being a friend of the  United States.                        Honoring Jonathan Holland, II     Madam Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart  to remember and honor Jonathan Holland, II of Brunswick, Georgia, who  sadly passed away on August 6 at the age of 73.   Jon had a long, distinguished career in the United States military  and as a Federal and State law enforcement official.   After serving in the United States Air Force, Jon worked at the FBI  before moving to the Virginia Alcohol Control Board, where he spent the  next 34 years.   During this time, he was a first responder at the Pentagon attack on  September 11. After assisting on site for 7 days, Jon received a  declaration of valor from the Governor of Virginia.   Jon retired in 2003 and began an 11-year career at the Federal Law  Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick, Georgia.   Jon's service to his country and Georgia's First Congressional  District is extraordinary and will never be forgotten.   My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends, and all who  knew him during this most difficult time.                       Remembering John Robert Paddison     Madam Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart  to remember and honor John Robert Paddison of Savannah, Georgia, who  sadly passed away on August 1 at the age of 98.    Bob dedicated his life to loving and serving both his country and  community.   During World War II Bob enlisted in the United States Air Force and  served as a pilot. He served in Germany for 18 months, aiding in post- war recovery.   Upon returning to Savannah, Bob worked at the Savannah Bank, where he  would work for the next 30 years until retiring as bank vice president.   Following his retirement, he then served his community as a volunteer  teacher for DeRenne Middle School, where he shared his passion for  photography with his students.   Cherished for his contagious laughter and love of life, Bob's immense  impact was felt by everyone he knew.   I am thankful for Bob's lifetime of service, and I know his legacy  will be forever treasured.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I was unavoidably detained.
