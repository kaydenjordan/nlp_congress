 Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues to  speak out and ask for a normal process, for hearings, and for debates.   The Presiding Officer and I have talked about this issue. I know the  Presiding Officer has many good ideas to contribute, and I am hopeful  that we can start over with a bill that would consist of a number of  changes in our existing healthcare system. That is what I think we need  to do, instead of this repeal bill that came to us without hearings. It  is just not the right way to do this.   I have already gotten reactions from my State. Just to use some  quotes from an article in the Minneapolis StarTribune that was just  posted--we have our health plans saying that what matters is Medicaid,  and they are the leaders in our healthcare community, calling this bill  disappointing because of the continued insistence on significantly  cutting Medicaid, the federally paid health insurance program for those  who are the most vulnerable.   They have said things--the big story has been, What is it going to do  to Medicaid? But, in fact, what our experts in our State are saying-- our health plans--is that this is really more of the same from what we  have seen in the House bill, but over a different time period. There is  an argument that in the end, it involves even deeper cuts.   The Minnesota Hospital Association came out and has already, in just  the last few hours, said that the last of the guaranteed benefits  discourages preventive care and that this proposal ``creates a lot of  chaos.''   One of the heads of one of our major hospitals said:         They are shortening up the money. But they're not giving us       the ability to manage the care.    I have long advocated for changes to the Affordable Care Act-- significant changes. I think seniors should be given the ability to  harness their marketing power and negotiate for lower prices under  Medicare for prescription drugs. They are currently prohibited from  doing that. I think that is wrong. I said that when the Affordable Care  Act passed.   I think there are many good things we could do to help with the  exchanges and with small business rates, including doing something  federally on reinsurance. My State legislature, which is a Republican  State legislature, joined with our Democratic Governor and worked out  an agreement on insurance. We are currently awaiting word from the  administration on a waiver, but we think that is a good idea, and there  are things we can do to bring that out nationally. I don't see that  happening with this bill.   In the end, what matters to me is how this bill affects individual  people in my State. Laura from North St. Paul wrote to me about her  concerns about the very similar House bill. Laura recently retired, but  she will not be eligible for Medicare until next year. She has a  daughter with several chronic health conditions. She is concerned that  if these proposals get passed, she will end up paying far more for her  health insurance, and her daughter might lose her coverage altogether.   Take Mike from Grand Marais--that is in the far corner of Minnesota,  right up at the tip. He has been self-employed his whole life and is  now approaching retirement. He told me that just as he is about to  retire, he will not be able to afford health insurance because of the  way this proposal works. Like the House bill, it would increase  premiums for older Minnesotans.   A woman from Andover, MN, wrote to me that she is worried about this  slam dunk attempt to check off a box on a to-do list, when, in fact,  she is squarely in the middle of that box. She asked me to put a face  on the type of person who is affected by rushing through this  checklist, and that would be her 28-year-old son. She said that  Medicaid coverage has been a lifesaver for her son because it helps him  afford the treatment he needs to strive for an independent, productive  life.   I have heard from so many people from all of the corners of my State,  from the old, the young, the middle-aged. I have heard from many people  from the rural parts of my State about the House bill, which, of  course, is very similar to the Senate bill that has been proposed here.  They were especially worried about the billions in cuts to Medicaid,  which is the lead part of the concern from the Minnesota Council of  Health Plans.   The Senate proposal, as I mentioned, would make even deeper cuts over  the long term to Medicaid. Medicaid covers more than 1.2 million  Minnesotans, including more than one-fifth of the people in the rural  part of our State--20 percent of our rural population. This funding is  vital to the ability of our rural hospitals and healthcare providers in  those parts of our State to stay open and serve their patients. Many  people who work in rural hospitals and who are served by rural  hospitals have deep concerns.    Even after seeing the Senate proposal for just these few hours, it is  clear that this healthcare legislation would have massive life-changing  implications for families all over the country.   We know the President of the United States is not known for mincing  words, but we also know he used very direct language when he talked  about the House bill. The reports are that he called it mean, and there  has been no denial that he said that. He didn't need a poll or focus  group. He didn't need to know every detail of the bill. But when you  hear that millions and millions of people could lose their health  insurance, the wealthiest would get tax cuts, and then the people who  need help the most would be forced to pay more, you can see why that  would be a good word to describe a bill like this--``mean.'' What we  don't want to have come out of the Senate is the ``son of mean'' or  ``mean 2.''   Most of us agree that we must make changes to the Affordable Care  Act, as I said at the beginning of my remarks. I would love to see  those changes to prescription drug prices, not only with the Medicare  negotiation I just mentioned, getting rid of that prohibition that  stops 41 million seniors from negotiating for lower prices for  prescription drugs by passing the bill that I have led for years to  allow for that negotiation, but I would like to see more competition in  two other ways. One is bringing in safe drugs from other countries like  Canada. Senator McCain and I have a bill that would allow that to  happen.   The second is allowing for more generic competition and making it  easier to have generic competition--again, not in the House or the  Senate bill. Senator Grassley and I have a bill that would stop ``pay  for delay.'' That is where companies pay generics to keep their  products off the market. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office  has assessed that we would not only save billions of dollars for the  government but also for taxpayers if this passed. I would like to have  that bill come up for a vote, maybe in the form of an amendment,  because I believe it would pass.   We could make improvements in the exchanges with the idea of  reinsurance. There are many ways we could come together to make  sensible changes to the Affordable Care Act. We can never have a bill  that big without making some changes, and I think the time has come.   Instead, we see a bill that was drafted behind closed doors. Yes,  Democratic Senators were not a part of that; that is it the way it is.  But I don't think those doors should be closed to the American people.   Last week I attended the men's baseball game between Democrats and  Republicans. It was an amazing event with over 25,000 people. At the  end, when the Democratic team won, they took their trophy and gave it  to the Republican team, and they asked them to put it in Representative  Scalise's office. We should take the spirit that we saw at that  congressional baseball game. We should take that spirit, and we should  bring it into this Chamber, and we should start working on a bill  together--not this bill. We should start working on a bill that makes  some major changes to the Affordable Care Act. We have ideas on both  sides, and that is what I think we should do.   With that, I yield the floor.
