 Madam President, I join the chorus of Senators Grassley  and Durbin about their proposal.                             Wall Street Profits    Madam President, I want to talk about another issue. Today, the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation--which is the agency that does  such things as every quarter announcing bank profits and bank  profitability--issued an assessment of the banking industry. Lo and  behold, as a number of us have been saying on this floor week after  week, month after month, year and year: It is a great time to be on  Wall Street.   Bank profits this second quarter of 2018--we announce it now--were  $60 billion, with a b. That is 60,000 million dollars--$60 billion in  bank profits. That number is fairly meaningless. It is a really big  number. It is hard to grasp, but think about it this way. These bank  profits this quarter were up 25 percent from 1 year ago, and it is  typical of being able to compare quarter to quarter or year to year  that way.   What is fairly stunning about this is that this Congress can't do  enough for the banks. First, it was a decade ago, when Congress bailed  out the banks. Then, we see bank profits go up and up and up. Congress  last year gave a huge tax cut. The financial services industry did  better than the rest of the economy with this tax cut, and,  interestingly, the big banks did better than the community banks with  the tax cut in terms of percentage, per capita--and anyway you measure  it--in the amount of money or in assets, whatever.   Then, earlier this year, Congress passed another giveaway to the  banks on legislation, another deregulation bill. When you hear  ``deregulation'' think that it means that Wall Street gets away with  even more. Now we are seeing even bigger profits from the banks.   It is like this. Congress thinks it never can do enough for Wall  Street. Every time Wall Street asks for something, Republican  leadership--Senator McConnell's office down the hall, Speaker Ryan's  office way down the hall, the President of the United States, President  Trump--always want to do more for Wall Street, with $60 billion in  profits this quarter and 25 percent greater profits than 1 year ago.   Why does this Congress continue to do the bidding of Wall Street at  the expense of Main Street?   During the 1\1/2\ years of President Trump, we have seen wages go  down. We have seen profits go up. We have seen the stock market go up.  We have seen executive compensation go way up. We have seen the banks  do especially well. Yet wages, literally since President Trump has  taken office, have declined in this country.   So why do we continue to help Wall Street, to shovel more money to  Wall Street--more money, Senator Grassley, to the drug companies--and  the middle class continues to get squeezed.   I just think it is another lesson when bank profits keep going up,  executive compensation keeps going up, profits overall keep going up,  but the middle class continues to get squeezed. There is a lesson  there.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
