 DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, for the past 7  years we have had 62 votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but  Republicans have never once put a plan on the floor for the American  people. Well, today, we all get a chance to go on record of where we  stand on this bill, this shameful, cruel bill.   Here are the facts: 24 million Americans are going to lose their  insurance if this bill becomes law. Over $839 billion gets cut out of  the Medicaid program. The essential benefit package in States, wiped  out. In my State, it is taking care of people with mental illness and  opioid addiction; gone. This takes $117 billion out of the Medicare  trust fund.   This is a healthcare bill--this is really a tax bill masquerading as  a healthcare bill. The plan here is to take this money out of the  healthcare system and use it for tax cuts. That is what this bill is  going to do.   This creates a survival-of-the-fittest health care for America. If  you are young, if you are healthy, if you are wealthy, this bill is for  you; you are going to do okay. But if you are old, if you are sick, if  you are poor, there is no coverage in this bill for you.   If you have a young child with cancer, guess what, those benefits  aren't going to be paid. You are going to run out of benefits.   These high-risk pools are a sham. They are not adequately funded.  This bill must be defeated. The American people will remember who votes  for this bill today.
