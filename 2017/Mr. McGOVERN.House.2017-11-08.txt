 Madam Speaker, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance  Program--  [[Page H8657]]  known as SNAP--provides modest food assistance benefits to families in  need. The program helps to alleviate hunger, reduce poverty, and  improve nutrition across our country on an ongoing basis.   SNAP is also designed to help families put food on the table when  disaster strikes. In response to recent hurricanes, fires, floods, and  storms, officials at the United States Department of Agriculture's Food  and Nutrition Service (USDA FNS) have worked with other federal and  state emergency response agencies to ensure those impacted by disasters  have access to food.   Flexibilities in SNAP, for example, allow states to issue SNAP  benefits early to ensure recipients can stock up on food before a  disaster hits.   In many cases, SNAP recipients impacted by disaster and power outages  are able to request additional benefits to replace food they lost, and  in certain circumstances, are able to use their SNAP benefits to  purchase hot foods if they lost power and are unable to cook.   Disaster SNAP, known as D-SNAP, is a key feature of the program that  provides nutrition assistance benefits to families in major disaster  areas who aren't currently receiving benefits. Importantly, D-SNAP also  provides families currently enrolled in SNAP with supplemental benefits  to help them get by in the wake of disaster.   In addition to SNAP, other federal anti-hunger safety net programs  like the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and  Children (WIC), child nutrition programs, and Disaster Household  Distribution (DHD) come to the aid of those recovering from disaster.   For example, schools in areas affected by disaster can provide meals  to all kids at no charge and can be more flexible in where and when  they serve meals.   DHD is another program to allow food banks and other organizations to  distribute emergency food boxes filled with nutritious food to people  that don't have access to feeding sites or grocery stores in the  aftermath of disaster.   Madam Speaker, when disasters hit the United States--and its  territories--it is imperative that our government effectively and  efficiently helps those impacted by these terrible tragedies.   SNAP and our other nutrition programs are a key component of disaster  response efforts, providing food to families in need. In the aftermath  of recent tragedies that devastated Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin  Islands, Texas, Georgia, Louisiana, Florida, California, and Oregon,  USDA was able to respond.   I'd like to thank my friend and colleague on the Agriculture  Committee, the Chairman of the Nutrition Subcommittee, Mr. GT Thompson,  for raising awareness about nutrition assistance in times of disaster.   I encourage all of my colleagues to join us in recognizing how  powerful and effective SNAP and other nutrition programs are in  responding to natural disasters. We must work to protect these programs  from cuts or structural changes that threaten the ability of these  programs to help families in need.                            ____________________
