 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the historic  75th anniversary of D-Day, June 6, 1944, the heroic Allied invasion of  Europe at Normandy, France.   Let us honor the 180,000 Allied troops who reclaimed liberty for the  modern world, moving across the turbulent English Channel, which ran  red with their blood, including from our beloved uncle, Stanley  Rogowski.   Our troops endured more deadly Nazi shelling from land and air as  they clawed their way up the daunting seawalls and beaches to retake  Europe for the free world.   The weather was harsh. The shores were littered with mines and barbed  wire. From their landing crafts and parachutes, our soldiers were met  with heavy fire.   The work of clearing the five beaches upon which the Allies landed-- Omaha, Utah, Gold, Juno, and Sword--was as difficult as it was deadly.  It was not until June 12 that all five beaches, stretching over 50  miles, were finally conquered.   When the smoke finally cleared, over 4,000 Allied troops had made the  ultimate sacrifice.   Operation Neptune was a decisive victory for the Allied cause. It  remains the largest seaborne invasion in history and a turning point in  the Second World War.   Until that day, Adolf Hitler waged destruction and terror across  Europe, virtually unencumbered on the Western Front. From France to  Poland to Russia, millions died in his wake. But from the Allied  foothold in Normandy, American, Canadian, and British troops spread out  across Europe and liberated German-occupied Europe from Nazi tyranny.   This week, we gratefully remember and honor the men and women who  served and sacrificed for the freedom of Europe and the entire world.  We live in their debt each day.                            ____________________
