 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of Mr.  Everett ``Crusty'' Toler, who passed away last week in his hometown of  Jena, Louisiana.   Crusty was a tugboat captain who lost the use of his legs early in  life, but it did not do anything to cast a shadow on his warm  personality or his outgoing demeanor. He was just a phenomenal  gentleman. A friend to all who knew him, Crusty was a member of the  ``Ole Boys'' club and Pritchard Baptist Church in Jena.   Crusty is survived by his wife, Paula, of 46 years; three brothers;  and several nieces, nephews, and godchildren.   Please join me in bidding Crusty Toler a warm farewell.                            ____________________
