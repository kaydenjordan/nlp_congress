 Madam Speaker, this week we celebrate Medal of Honor  Day, dedicated to the recipients of America's highest military honor.   Today, there are just 72 living Medal of Honor recipients. The 10th  District is home to one of these, Allen J. Lynch of Gurnee, who was  awarded the Medal of Honor in 1970 for his actions in Vietnam.   While serving as a radio telephone operator near the village of My  An, Sergeant Lynch risked his life to move three wounded comrades to  safety and single-handedly defended their isolated position for 2 hours  against an advancing and numerically superior enemy force until they  could be safely evacuated.   Sergeant Lynch's service did not end in Vietnam. He has spent his  entire life serving his fellow veterans with the Federal Veterans  Administration as well as the Illinois State Government Veterans  Department.   In an interview, he said: ``There are many servicemembers, first  responders, and citizens who serve this country above and beyond who  are never recognized for what they do. We hold the Medal of Honor for  all those men and women who have never been recognized for the great  things they did.''   My friend, Allen Lynch, is a true American hero and a role model for  us all. On Medal of Honor Day, we reflect on all those who have acted  above and beyond the call of duty and the hard-fought freedoms we enjoy  because of their service and sacrifice.                            ____________________
