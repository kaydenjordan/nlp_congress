 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Honoring our PACT  Act.   Toxic exposure has devastating health consequences for our veterans,  [[Page H6024]]  including many in my district. I talk to them every week when I am  home.   One is the Michigan president of the VFW, Kevin Hensley, who is a  veteran of the U.S. Air Force who was stationed near open burn pits and  has been diagnosed with several severe illnesses after inhaling that  toxic smoke. Despite his sacrifices and his dedication yet today, he  faces challenges every day receiving care through the VA, and that is  simply unacceptable.   With the passage and enactment of this legislation, we can lift the  barriers that have been blocking veterans from accessing the life- changing care they need. This bipartisan package will expand healthcare  access to veterans across the country, and it will finally ensure that  veterans receive the support they deserve.   I thank the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee for his  leadership in advancing the PACT Act, the ranking member, and all the  members of the Veterans' Affairs Committee.
