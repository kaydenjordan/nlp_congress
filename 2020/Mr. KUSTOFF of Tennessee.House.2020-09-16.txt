 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor a  terrific Tennessee leader, State Senator Dolores Gresham, who will be  retiring from public service this year.   My friend, Senator Dolores Gresham, has been a strong leader in west  Tennessee for many years, and I have great respect for her strong  career of service and her tireless leadership in education. Dolores  Gresham has been highly influential in the political, social, and civic  life in west Tennessee.   Before she entered public service as an elected official, Senator  Gresham proudly served our country as a member of the United States  Marine Corps and retired at the rank of lieutenant colonel.   A champion for education in Tennessee, Dolores Gresham presided over  and led the Tennessee State Education Committee during a time of great  improvement in academic achievement in the history of the Volunteer  State.   Senator Gresham has proved to everyone that citizens can make a  difference by being involved in community service and by leading by  example.    Roberta and I wish her and her husband, Will, the best in their  retirement. We appreciate her friendship, and we greatly appreciate her  public service to the Volunteer State.         Honoring Andy Holt for His Strong Service to West Tennessee     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my  friend and Tennessee State Representative Andy Holt. Andy is retiring  this year from the Tennessee State legislature.   Representative Andy Holt has been a leader and an outspoken voice in  the Tennessee State House since his first term began in 2011.   Representative Holt's work on the Agriculture and Natural Resources  Committee, his involvement with the Tennessee Farm Bureau--and I can't  forget his famous Hogfest--were all critical in bringing national  attention to west Tennessee's agricultural community.   Andy has served as a member of the Finance, Ways and Means  Subcommittee, which is a vital committee that helps craft the Tennessee  State budget.   Andy Holt has also been a strong voice in the Tennessee State Capitol  and has never shied away from speaking and living out his values.   He was part of numerous monumental pieces of legislation, such as the  enhanced concealed carry permit and the heartbeat bill, and helped  successfully repeal a portion of the Tennessee professional privilege  tax.   No matter the politics of an issue, Andy Holt always stood up for  what he believed in and always put his west Tennessee family values  first.   I am honored to call Andy Holt a friend of mine. He truly understands  and cares about the needs of Tennesseans, and he will be sorely missed  in the Tennessee State legislature.   Roberta and I wish Andy, his wife, Ellie, and his entire family well  as he leaves the stage of public service. I thank Andy for his faithful  service to west Tennessee, to Tennessee State government, and to the  State of Tennessee.        Honoring Mrs. Suzette Mink's Public Service to West Tennessee     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Suzette Mink, from Millington, Tennessee, for her strong service to  Shelby County government as she is set to retire in a few weeks.   Suzette's service to Memphis and Shelby County started in 1985 when  she began working for the Shelby County Trustee's Office. From there,  she  [[Page H4434]]  worked for the Shelby County general sessions court clerk, the general  sessions criminal court judges' office, and then the general sessions  civil court judges' office, where she will retire after 17 years of  faithful service to these judges.   In 2019, Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris awarded Suzette with the  Shelby County Shining Star Award. This award is given to someone who  has shown exemplary dedication to their job within Shelby County  government, and this award was much deserved.   I know I speak on behalf of all of Memphis and Shelby County, and the  judges, when I thank Suzette for her service to our community. When I  think of true public servants, we talk about people like Suzette.   I wish her and her husband, Derrick, the best in their retirement.                            ____________________
