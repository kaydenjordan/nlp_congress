 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to celebrate Gordon  Fowler's remarkable 100th birthday, a century of enduring wisdom and  service. Gordon's journey began on a humble Iowa farm in 1923,  instilling in him the values of hard work and resilience during the  Great Depression. His education and involvement in 4-H and FFA set the  stage for a life dedicated to giving back.   In World War II, Gordon followed the path of Charles Lindbergh, his  childhood hero, into the Army Air Corps, joining the brave American  HUMP Pilots Association, who embarked on perilous missions flying over  the Himalayan mountains. After his service, he returned to Iowa, raised  a family with his wife, Sharon, and embarked on a successful 50-year  career in advertising.   Gordon served as a Scoutmaster, a Sunday schoolteacher, and also  supported Junior Achievement, and shaped the lives of countless young  individuals.   May his wisdom continue to inspire us for many years to come. Let's  all wish this World War II veteran a happy birthday.                        Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight Ovarian  Cancer Awareness Month. Ovarian cancer is often referred to as the  silent killer because its early symptoms are subtle and easily mistaken  for other less serious conditions. Once a diagnosis is reached, it is  often in advanced stages, making it one of the deadliest cancers among  women.   Together, we can empower women to take charge of their health, and by  supporting critical research we can hope for a future where this silent  killer has been silenced. Thank you to all the individuals who fight  against ovarian cancer and support the women whose lives have been  changed by this abhorrent disease.   During Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, we continue to encourage women  to learn about the risk factors, familiarizing themselves with the  early symptoms, have conversations and regular checkups with their  healthcare providers, and work together year round to raise awareness  about this deadly disease that affects countless women worldwide.                    Grace Lynn Keller Named Miss Iowa USA     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Grace Lynn  Keller of Coralville, Iowa, for being named Miss Iowa USA. Grace's love  for pageantry began in childhood as a way to push herself out of her  comfort zone as a shy person.   Now, at 24, she works as vice president of production and digital  marketing at Executive Podcast Solutions, a company she helped start as  an intern while studying journalism at the University of Iowa. Grace  credits pageantry for playing a pivotal role in shaping her confidence  and equipping her with invaluable skills for her professional career.   As Miss Iowa USA, Grace has used her platform to promote childhood  literacy through the Reach to Succeed program, where she has focused on  low-income and rural school districts.   Grace's mission is a testament to her dedication to making a positive  impact in Iowa and the rest of the country. Congratulations to Grace  Lynn Keller on this outstanding achievement.                  Congratulating Eagle Scout Spencer Johnson     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Spencer  Johnson of Troop 199 from Bettendorf, Iowa, for completing his Eagle  Board of Review and attaining the rank of Eagle Scout.   Becoming an Eagle Scout is the highest and most prestigious  achievement a Scout can attain, and reaching the Eagle rank is no small  feat.  [[Page H4470]]    Scouts must fulfill leadership roles, exemplify the Scout oath and  law, display exemplary outdoor skills, earn at least 21 badges, and  complete a comprehensive service project for their community. Well  done, Spencer.   I also want to congratulate Spencer's family and everyone who walked  and worked with Spencer on his journey to become an Eagle Scout.  Congratulations, Spencer Johnson, on becoming an Eagle Scout.                      Per Mar Named Business of the Year     Mr. Speaker, today I rise to extend a heartfelt  congratulations to Per Mar, the recipient of the prestigious 2023  Business of the Year award at the Quad Cities Chamber of Commerce  annual meeting.   Headquartered in Davenport, Iowa, Per Mar was opened in 1953 by John  and Eleanor Duffy and has grown into a premier family-owned security  company in the Quad Cities and throughout Iowa.   This achievement is a testament to the relentless pursuit of  excellence by Per Mar's employees, led by president and CEO Brian  Duffy.   What truly sets Per Mar apart is their unwavering commitment to their  employees, a philosophy that has been passed down through generations.  By prioritizing their workforce, Per Mar ensures that their customers  receive exceptional service, resulting in the company's continued  growth and success.
