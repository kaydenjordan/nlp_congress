 Mr. Speaker, last night was a sad day for America. Today,  our Nation mourns the passing of a beloved American; a bold advocate  for family, for literacy; and a devoted wife, mother, and grandmother,  First Lady Barbara Bush.  [[Page H3404]]    Mrs. Bush has brought dignity, civility, and spirit to everything she  did. Her strength--of character, of her principles, of her faith--are a  great gift to our Nation.   Barbara Bush was a woman of exceptional grace, with an unmatched  spirit--again, that spirit--and talent and skill for bringing people  together. She was not only respected, but adored by so many across our  Nation.   Barbara Bush leaves a living legacy in the Barbara Bush Foundation  for Family Literacy and the deep spirit of volunteerism she championed  on behalf of children and families. All who knew Mrs. Bush saw her  immense love and pride in her family. She was a beloved matriarch for  her family and a matriarch for America, and she always put family  first.   We hope that it is a comfort to President Bush--73 years of marriage,  wow--former President George Herbert Walker Bush, that our thoughts and  prayers are with you and your children, including President George W.  Bush. She was the only woman in America, apart from Abigail Adams, who  was the wife and mother of a President.   Our prayers are with her grandchildren, her great-grandchildren, whom  she loved, and the entire Bush family.   We want them to know that so many share in their grief, pray for them  at this sad time, and are grateful to them for sharing Barbara Bush  with the Nation.                            ____________________
