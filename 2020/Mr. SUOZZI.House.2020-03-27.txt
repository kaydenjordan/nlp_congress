 Mr. Speaker, as you know, my father was born in Italy,  and he would say, ``What a country.'' And my grandfather, at family  weddings, would give advice to the new couples and say: ``Non c'e sono  rose senza spine,'' ``You cannot have a rose without the thorns.''   Well, we mourn the thorns in our country right now. So many people  are suffering because of their health, because of their sickness,  because they are worried about their family's finances, and because of  the deaths that have taken place.   But, today, we have to also celebrate the roses, those essential  workers who are working for the common good every single day: the  grocery workers, the postal workers, the healthcare workers, the people  who are out on the front lines every single day, looking out for us  every single day.   I want to celebrate, today, the roses of life: of Democrats and  Republicans coming together for the common good, putting aside  ideological purity and working together to try and help people who are  facing these desperate times.   Mr. Speaker, God bless this country, and God bless all of our  American people.  [[Page H1832]]
