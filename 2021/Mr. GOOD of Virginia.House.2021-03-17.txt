 Madam Speaker, Democrats are using domestic  violence, which is a serious issue, as a front for just their latest  gun control bill. This legislation contains red flag gun confiscation  language and expands the grounds for lifetime bans of firearm  possession.   Red flag gun confiscation laws upend due process. Under this  legislation, an individual could have their guns removed from them  without having the chance to face their accuser in court. That means a  complaint and a judicial order could suspend a constitutionally  guaranteed right, with no chance for the accused to respond under the  law.                                time  1145    This legislation makes it clear that Democrats consider gun ownership  a second-class right, if it is a right at all,  [[Page H1459]]  and view the Constitution as a negotiable suggestion.   This bill would expand the number of nonviolent misdemeanor offenses  that produce a lifetime ban on firearm ownership, which is already  applied to felons.   It is ironic that in the same week that Democrats are voting in  support of amnesty for illegal aliens who have committed up to two  misdemeanors, they are voting to permanently suspend the constitutional  rights of Americans who have committed one nonviolent misdemeanor.   I oppose this attempt to undermine due process, further restrict the  Second Amendment, and expand the left's radical and relentless gun  control agenda.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my distinguished colleague  and fellow Member from Texas for yielding.   Our country's future will forever be changed based on how we manage  or refuse to manage Biden's border crisis. And, yes, it is a crisis.   Steady merit-based legal immigration is stabilizing. It provides a  talented pool of workers, effectively permits patriotic assimilation,  and enriches our culture. We can debate how best to achieve those  objectives and what immigration levels or numbers are in the best  interests of our Nation and our citizens, but what is not open for  honest debate, or at least debate that honestly places the interests,  safety, and security of American citizens first, is the need to secure  our border and eliminate illegal immigration.   President Biden's open border policies threaten our security, overtax  our resources, jeopardize public health, and turn every town into a  border community.   As others have said, without a border, we don't have a country; we  have a landmass, one that is currently under invasion. That is an  invasion that is with complicit approval from the President's policies  and the support of the Democratic Party, and this is especially  egregious and inexcusable.                                time  2045    The fact is that, in the 56 days since President Biden was sworn in  on January 20, illegal immigration has surged and our southern border  has been overrun.   We are not stopping illegal immigrants based on their inability to  provide for themselves and not be a burden on our economy, our social  services,  [[Page H1490]]  our education system, our healthcare system.   We are not stopping illegal immigrants based on whether or not they  test positive for COVID.   We are not stopping illegal immigrants based on whether or not they  have a criminal record.   We are not stopping illegal immigrants based on whether or not they  intend to do us harm.   The bottom line is that we don't even know who is coming, and we  don't even know why they are coming.   Meanwhile, the President sends FEMA to the border, not to help  prevent the emergency crisis of illegal crossing, but actually to help  illegal aliens get into our country.   And how does a Democrat majority respond?   With two new amnesty bills that will incentivize and reward lawless,  illegal behavior with amnesty and citizenship.   Memo to the President and Democrat majority: You get more of what you  incentivize.   We can only conclude this is what they want.   Mr. Speaker, these two bills combined will provide amnesty to some 5  million illegal aliens, including some with criminal backgrounds. These  two bills make it more difficult for law enforcement to detain or  deport illegal aliens. These bills will facilitate chain migration,  leading to more non-merit-based immigration. And these two bills  inexcusably provide no provisions to address the Biden border crisis.   Just today, in apparent recognition that the crisis is not playing  well with the American people--you know, the forgotten citizens of the  country--NBC news--not exactly a conservative news outlet--is reporting  that the Biden administration is telling Border Patrol that they can no  longer talk to the media or do ride-alongs that enable the media to see  firsthand what is happening at the border. Instead, Border Patrol is  supposed to let all communication come from Washington.   The American people are not stupid. They know what is going on, and  they don't want America to be turned into a sanctuary nation.   Mr. Speaker, we, on the Republican side, are going to fight for them.  We are going to fight to protect the country we have today, and we are  going to fight to protect the country we want to have tomorrow.
