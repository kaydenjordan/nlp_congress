 Mr. President, I have a motion to commit at the desk,  and I ask that it be reported.    I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes of  debate, equally divided.    Mr. President, this bill includes an $86 billion no- strings bailout of multiemployer pension plans. It does not belong in  the current package. It has nothing to do with COVID. The bailout is  not coupled with any reforms. Consequently, there won't be any long- term sustainability. It is just a blank check with no measures to hold  plans accountable.   Senator Alexander and I spent the last Congress working on a  responsible proposal to rescue and reform failing multiemployer pension  plans. Without reforms included, the precedent will be that taxpayers,  not the PPGC, will be the ultimate guarantors of private employer  pensions. In that case, the burden on the taxpayers will not be for the  $86 billion. It will be endless as to how much the taxpayers are going  to have to pay.   Please vote in favor of my motion to commit to consider the reforms  necessary to protect the taxpayers and ensure the long-term  sustainability of the multiemployer pension system.    Mr. President, do I have any time remaining?    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 902 and ask  that it be reported by number.    I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes, equally divided.    Mr. President, you folks on the other side of the  aisle, the House Agriculture Committee voted out the bill that Senator  Warnock successfully defended. That same House Agriculture Committee  voted out a bipartisan bill that had the support of Congressman  Feenstra of Iowa and Congresswoman Axne of Iowa.   It got out of committee, and then you know what? The Rules Committee  took it out of this bill that came over here. So I am asking for the  reconsideration of that.   This amendment does this: It makes farmers in Iowa that were hit by  the derecho wind--and that is a wind that you don't predict like you do  a tornado, and it just crops up, 150 miles long and 30 miles wide. It  destroyed 855,000 acres of corn, laid it flat. And if it was meteoric,  you still couldn't harvest it. So most of it was plowed under.    My time is up already? I would like to have it  considered, please.    I request a rollcall vote.    Mr. President, the multiemployer pension system has  been in need of a major overhaul for years. More than 300 plans are  critically underfunded. Moreover, the Pension Benefit Guaranty  Corporation, PBGC, multiemployer insurance fund, which is a backstop  for these plans, is projected to become insolvent in the next 5 years.   If this occurs, 1.5 million retirees, due to no fault of their own,  could see their hard-earned retirement benefits slashed to pennies on  the dollar. This is unacceptable, and it is one of the reasons that,  when I took over as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee in 2019, I  made it a priority to fix the failing multiemployer pension system. To  me, this has always meant helping secure the retirement benefits of  millions of retirees and ensuring that this retirement system is  sustainable over the long term. Working with former Senator and HELP  Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander, I immediately got to work on a  draft proposal, which was released for public input and stakeholder  feedback in November of 2019. We received numerous comments from  workers, retirees, unions, employers, actuaries, academics, plan  officials, and members of the general public that helped me refine my  approach and create a balanced plan.   Yesterday, I reintroduced this version of my plan, which is titled  the ``Chris Allen Multiemployer Pension Recapitalization and Reform  Act.'' This legislation recognizes that, given the severity of the  underfunding issue, some Federal dollars will be necessary to shore up  severely troubled plans in the short term. But, this limited assistance  must be coupled with structural reforms intended to address the root  causes of our current situation. This includes reforms to multiemployer  funding rules to ensure plans are adequately capitalized to make good  on promises made to plan participants. Furthermore, it would increase  PBGC oversight of troubled plans and enhance transparency for plan  participants. Critically, it also overhauls the financing of the PBGC  multiemployer insurance fund so that it can resume its role as the  insurer of last resort for these plans without additional taxpayer  funding.   The fundamental tenet of my plan is that all stakeholders have a role  in fixing the multiemployer pension system. The American taxpayer  shouldn't be expected to simply write a blank check. Stakeholders need  to have skin in the game if the system is to be sustainable moving  forward.   I understand that this is an extremely complex situation. There is no  perfect solution. From the start, I have let it be known I want to work  with my Democratic colleagues to find a bipartisan compromise. In June  of last year, I came to the floor to plead with my Democratic  colleagues to come to the table in hopes we could work toward a  bipartisan agreement prior to the end of last Congress. Unfortunately,  for months I heard nothing. Then, with only a few weeks left in the  116th Congress, my Democratic colleagues took me up on my offer and  negotiations began in earnest. Several weeks of bipartisan negotiations  ensued, but there simply was not enough time to iron out all our  differences to ensure we had sufficient Member support before the end  of the year. However, I found our discussions constructive. They were  focused correctly on securing the retirement benefits of participants  in the failing plans in the near term, while also ensuring the long- term sustainability of the multiemployer pension system without a  Federal takeover.   I hoped our negotiations would provide a foundation for continuing to  work toward a bipartisan solution this Congress. Instead I am  disappointed to see that the majority has include an unprecedented $86  billion no-strings bailout of troubled multiemployer pension plans in  the reconciliation bill currently before the Senate.   As I have discussed, I recognize that Federal funds will be needed to  solve the pension crisis in the short term, but it is equally as  important that essential reforms are enacted to ensure the system can  be self-sustaining in the long term. Otherwise, taxpayers will be  perpetually subsidizing a private sector system of employee-benefit  promises. That is exactly what will occur if my Democratic colleagues  insist on going forward with the reform-free bailout included in this  package. As is, this proposal has been stripped of even the most  rudimentary of reforms or accountability measures. In fact, one  provision even bars the PBGC from issuing regulations to provide for  such measures. As a result, the proposal is likely to breed what  economists call ``moral hazard'' as plan managers and sponsors realize  that there are no consequences to underfunding and overpromising. In  the end, the American taxpayer will be left footing the bill for a  private sector retirement system.   I hope my Democratic colleagues will reconsider moving forward with  their no-holds-bared bailout. Fundamentally, it does not belong in the  current package. The issues plaguing the multiemployer system long  predate the pandemic and are not COVID related. But if it is to be  included, at a minimum, essential reforms along the lines of what I  have proposed must be included. They are essential to protect the  American taxpayer and to ensure the long-term sustainability of the  multiemployer system.   Toward this end, I intend to offer a motion to commit the  reconciliation bill to the Finance Committee with instructions to  report it back with critical reforms to ensure multiemployer plans are  adequately funded and the PBGC's insurance fund is adequately financed.  Without such reforms, the current proposal would set the precedent that  the American taxpayer, not the PBGC, is the ultimate guarantor of  private-employer pension promises. If this is the case, the burden on  the American taxpayer will not be the $86 billion in this package or  even hundreds of billions of dollars. It will be limitless.                            ____________________
