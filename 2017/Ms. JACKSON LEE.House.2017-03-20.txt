 Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the House  Committee on Homeland Security I rise in support of H.R. 1353, the  ``Transparency in Technological Acquisitions Act.''   This bipartisan bill requires the Transportation Security  Administration (TSA) to provide more frequent and detailed updates on  its strategy to invest in security technology.   The five-year investment plan includes information such as:   1. Transportation security risks and gaps that could be addressed by  technology   2. Current and expected trends in domestic and international travel   3. Opportunities for public-private partnerships and collaboration  with small and disadvantaged companies, other government agencies,  university centers of excellence and national laboratories   4. Resources required to protect technology from cyber theft,  diversion, sabotage or attack   5. Potential effects on commercial airline passengers.   This bill would require the updates to be submitted annually and to  include information on acquisitions made during the previous fiscal  year.   Requiring TSA to provide annual updates on the acquisition plan and  to notify Congress and industry stakeholders about any changes to the  plan which will provide much-needed clarity, certainty, and  transparency.   In 2015, TSA screened more than 708 million passengers, which is more  than 1.9 million per day.   Of the 2,653 firearms discovered in carry-on bags, 82.8 percent were  loaded.   Houston George Bush Intercontinental Airport ranked 3rd among  airports with the most firearms discovered in 2015.   This last January, Esteban Santiago shot and killed five people  inside Fort Lauderdale airport using a firearm stored in his luggage.   Terrorism and cyberattacks are likely to remain a reality for the  transportation industry for the foreseeable future.   It is absolutely critical that we invest in minimizing transportation  safety security risks to keep our citizens safe.   I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1353.    Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the House  Committee on Homeland Security I rise in support of H.R. 1249, the  ``DHS Multiyear Acquisition Strategy Act of 2017'', which requires the  Department of Homeland Security to develop a multiyear acquisition  strategy.   H.R. 1249 seeks to streamline the Department of Homeland Security's  acquisition process to promote strategic investment as well as cost  savings for taxpayers.   DHS would be required to provide Congress with the new strategy which  needs to include:   1. A prioritized list of major acquisition programs   2. An inventory of investments and real estate assets   3. A plan to address funding gaps, prevent wasteful purchases,  achieve efficiency, align prices for similar items, and use purchase  timing and economies of scale   4. An identification of tests to support the acquisition of  technology, leverage emerging trends and incorporate technology into  DHS's operating doctrine   5. An assessment of how DHS could encourage appropriate risk-taking  and minimize cost overruns, including when the department identifies  needs, Develops cost assessments, Secures funding, Demonstrates  technology maturity, and establishes its workforce   6. An assessment to improve collaboration with industry, small and  disadvantaged businesses, intra-government offices, university centers  of excellence, certification organizations, and national laboratories   Although the DHS has taken measures to improve acquisition  management, DHS programs still cost taxpayers over $7 billion per year.   In its 2017 list of ``high-risk'' areas, GAO reported DHS needed to  improve the affordability of its major acquisition programs and address  staffing shortfalls.   DHS acquisition programs may continue to be at high risk for waste,  fraud, and abuse.   This bill will assist oversight committees in better preparing men  and women on the frontlines securing our borders, protecting our  airports, and defending our shores by making sure we know what works  and what is needed before taxpayer dollars are spent.   Efficient use of resources within the Department of Homeland Security  is crucial to the safety of all Texans, and all Americans especially in  regards to border security.   The Texas-Mexico border makes up 1,254 miles of the 1,900-mile-long  U.S.-Mexico border.   The more money wasted on unnecessary overhead costs, the less  resources the Department has to fulfill its key mission of protecting  our border and our homeland.   By passing this bipartisan measure, we can ensure that the DHS  operates in a more efficient manner and can better stay ahead of  threats to our country.  [[Page H2219]]    I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1249.    Mr. Speaker, in a methodical questioning of Mr.  Comey today in the Intelligence Committee, let me recount for you and  my colleagues the responses of Mr. Comey.   Mr. Trump's tweet, March 4, 2017: Terrible. Just found out that Obama  had my wires tapped in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing  found. This is McCarthyism.   Mr. Comey said: No, it did not happen.   March 4, 2017: Is it legal for a sitting President to be wiretapping  a race for President prior to an election? Turned down by court  earlier. A new low.   Mr. Comey said: No, it did not happen.   Mr. Comey, the FBI director.   Again on March 4, 2017: I bet a good lawyer could make a great case  out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October,  just prior to election.   Again, Mr. Comey said: No.   And then again on March 4, 2017, Mr. Trump said: How low has  President Obama gone to tap my phones during the very sacred election  process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad, or sick, guy.   Mr. Comey, the FBI director, said: No.   Definitively, Mr. Trump did not tell the truth. More investigations  deliberatively to determine the status of the actions of the President  of the United States accusing a former President of a criminal felony  which did not happen. It did not happen.                            ____________________
