 And you went immediately, and you reported it,       didn't you?        Col. VINDMAN. I did.         Why?        Col. VINDMAN. Because that was my duty.    Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. When Vindman said he reported this  conduct, again, ``because that was my duty,'' he acted as he did out of  a sense of duty and as a Purple Heart veteran, with confidence that in  America he would be protected for doing the right thing even if it  angered the President of the United States.   His father, who fled the Soviet Union to come to this country,  worried about his son fulfilling that duty.   Here was Colonel Vindman's message to his father. Let's listen.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Lt. Col. VINDMAN. Dad, my sitting here today in the U.S.       Capitol talking to our elected officials is proof that you       made the right decision 40 years ago to leave the Soviet       Union to come here to the United States  [[Page S518]]       of America in search of a better life for our family. Do not       worry. I'll be fine for telling the truth.         You realize when you came forward out of a       sense of duty that you were putting yourself in direct       opposition to the most powerful person in the world? Do you       realize that, sir?        Lt. Col. VINDMAN. I knew I was assuming a lot of risk.         And I'm struck by the word . . . that phrase,       ``do not worry,'' you addressed to your dad. Was your dad a       warrior?        Lt. Col. VINDMAN. He did serve. It was a different military       though.         And he would've worried if you were putting       yourself up against the President of the United States, is       that right?        Lt. Col. VINDMAN. He deeply worried about it because in his       context it was the ultimate risk.         And why do you have confidence that you can do       that and tell your dad not to worry?        Lt. Col. VINDMAN. Congressman, because this is America.       This is the country I've served and defended, that all of my       brothers have served, and here right matters.         Thank you, sir. I yield back. [applause].    Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Imagine. He had to tell his father: Do  not worry; I will be fine for telling the truth. It was his duty  because, in America, right matters.   President Trump has suggested that all of the witnesses are Never  Trumpers. That couldn't be further from the truth. As we just saw,  these U.S. officials are brave public servants. It is wrong--just flat  wrong--to suggest they were doing anything other than testifying out of  a sense of duty, as Lieutenant Colonel Vindman testified.   But it wasn't just U.S. officials whose reactions show us that this  was wrong; it is also clear how corrupt this scheme was because Ukraine  resisted it. President Zelensky was elected as a reformer. His first  few months in office lived up to this promise.   Here is Ambassador Taylor testifying on this point. Let's see it.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador TAYLOR. But once I arrived in Kyiv, I discovered       a weird combination of encouraging, confusing, and ultimately       alarming circumstances.        First, the encouraging. President Zelensky was reforming       Ukraine in a hurry. He appointed reformist ministers and       supported long-stalled anti-corruption legislation. He took       quick executive action, including opening Ukraine's High       Anti-Corruption Court. With a new parliamentary majority       stemming from snap elections, President Zelensky changed the       Ukraine Constitution to remove absolute immunity from Rada       deputies, the source of raw corruption for two decades. The       excitement in Kyiv was palpable. This time could be       different, a new Ukraine finally breaking from its corrupt,       post-Soviet past.    Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. So we know that President Zelensky was a  reformer, fighting corruption, fighting for reform, and he got started  early, as soon as he was sworn in. We know that President Zelensky's  agenda was in our U.S. national interest. In fact, every witness  testified that President Zelensky deserved America's support and that  they told President Trump that.   So keeping that in mind, it is extremely telling what President  Zelensky and his aides were saying behind closed doors. They were  concerned about being dragged into President Trump's scheme. They  recognized the political peril of going along with the President's  corrupt scheme. We know that was the case for many reasons, but let's  look at some of the evidence showing that now.   First, the Ukrainians made their concerns clear directly to U.S.  officials. On July 20, just days ahead of the July 25 call, Ambassador  Taylor spoke with President Zelensky's national security advisor. He  then conveyed to Ambassadors Sondland and Volker that the Ukrainian  leader ``did not want to be used as a pawn in a U.S. reelection  campaign.''   Here is Ambassador Taylor explaining what he understood that to mean.  Let's watch.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)
