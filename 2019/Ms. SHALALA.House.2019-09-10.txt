 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Hastings), my good friend and a distinguished Congressman, for yielding  me time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this rule and these three  bills that protect our coasts and our coastal economies.   Mr. Speaker, I particularly want to thank my fellow Floridians, Mr.  Rooney and Ms. Castor, for introducing the bipartisan legislation that  places a permanent moratorium on oil and gas leasing in the eastern  Gulf.   Beyond protecting coastal ecosystems, these bills help ensure  military readiness, given the long history of military training and  activities, particularly in the Gulf.                                time  1245    Offshore drilling is a dirty and dangerous venture that threatens our  fragile coastal ecosystems, and in Florida, offshore drilling threatens  our very way of life.   Mr. Speaker, millions of tourists come to Florida each year to join  us in enjoying our pristine beaches and our clean water. Our  livelihoods depend on a healthy and clean marine environment.  [[Page H7569]]    Offshore drilling threatens nearly 610,000 jobs and roughly $37.4  billion in GDP in Florida alone. The risk of another catastrophe like  Deepwater Horizon is too great to endanger Florida's healthy ocean  resources and thriving coastal economies.   In 2018, Mr. Speaker, Floridians spoke out loud and clear. A State  constitutional amendment to ban offshore drilling in Florida's waters  passed with nearly 70 percent of the vote. In the county where my  district is located, Miami-Dade, it passed with nearly 80 percent of  the vote.   Simply stated: We don't want offshore drilling. Instead, we should be  investing our time and resources in renewable, clean energy that we  know creates jobs and sets us on a course to combat climate change.   Mr. Speaker, we don't need offshore drilling, and we don't want  offshore drilling.
