 Mr. President, first and foremost, the American people  are continuing to hear elected officials talk a great deal about the  humanitarian and security crisis down on the southern border. Both  sides of the aisle have talked a lot about this issue for the past 2  months.   Here is the difference. It is the Republicans who have actually  supported giving the administration and the Agencies the emergency  funding they have been begging for. The Republicans have raised the  alarm about the conditions on the border and have actually wanted to do  something about it.   Our Democratic colleagues have talked a lot about the issue as well,  but for weeks and weeks, talk is all the  [[Page S4526]]  House of Representatives has been willing to do. The House Democrats  have been consistently uncooperative and uninterested in anything  except political posturing. They have talked endlessly about the  suffering at the border but have resisted every effort to actually make  a law and get help on the way.   For 8 weeks now, the men and women and children on our southern  border have learned the hard way that the ``resistance'' does not pay  the bills.   The New York Times' editorial board, of all places, wrote 7 weeks  ago: ``Congress, give Trump his border money.'' This was the New York  Times. Yet, week after week, from the House--nothing.   First, they objected to including the funding in the disaster bill,  and now that they finally passed something last night, it is a go- nowhere proposal that is filled with poison pill riders that the  President has indicated he would veto. They had to drag their bill way  to the left to earn the support of most Democrats. As a result, the  House has not made much progress toward actually making a law--just  more ``resistance theater.''   The Senate has a better and more bipartisan way forward. The bill  negotiated by Chairman Shelby and Senator Leahy won huge bipartisan  support in committee. It is a productive compromise that will go a long  way to beginning to address the border crisis. There are no poison  pills--just a clean bill to provide the emergency appropriations the  White House requested 2 long months ago.   We have waited long enough. We should not wait any longer. We must  pass this measure this week.                                   S. 1790    Mr. President, on another matter, the National Defense Authorization  Act is one of the most significant pieces of legislation we tackle each  year. It addresses many national and international priorities, but,  underneath, there are countless local stories of servicemembers,  families, communities, and installations all across our country.   A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to help cut the ribbon on a  new state-of-the-art chemical weapons destruction facility at the Blue  Grass Army Depot in Madison County, which is in my State. For decades,  this depot has been home to more than a 500-ton stockpile of lethal  chemical agents. Now, following years of hard work and advocacy, it  will be, instead, the place at which this toxic legacy of war will be  finally unwound. Earlier this month, the new facility safely destroyed  its first munition, and this is just the beginning. This work will  continue until the entire stockpile is eliminated.   The Kentucky accomplishment reminds us of the terrible role that  chemical weapons have played throughout history. Mankind has  conscripted science onto the battlefield since warfare's earliest  days--from contaminating water to poisoning arrows and bullets. Yet  this fast-paced industrialization of the early 1900s brought forth a  whole new wave of horrors.   The use of weapons like mustard gas caused devastation in the  trenches of World War I. President Franklin Roosevelt, in responding to  the proliferation of these weapons by our adversaries, mobilized an  unprecedented level of chemical production during World War II. While  neither side deployed chemical agents on the battlefield, their  murderous use in Nazi concentration camps and Japanese experiments rank  among the worst atrocities ever.   Then, during the Cold War, these horrific weapons brought new  challenges to our Nation's strategic defense and to communities like  Richmond, KY. As the first chemical agents arrived in my home State in  the 1940s, they were stored at the Blue Grass Army Depot--only miles  away from schools and thousands of families.   When I joined the Senate in 1985, the Army had recently announced  plans to begin the destruction of Blue Grass' stores through a process  called incineration--literally, burning the agents. Imagine that for a  moment--just throwing a warhead into an oven or a burn pit. Fortunately  and understandably, nearby residents were concerned about the release  of toxins into the air. Those fears only grew as we learned about  numerous nerve gas leaks at the depot that had occurred over the  previous decade.   What happened next was a textbook example of representative  democracy. The people of Kentucky used their voices in the U.S. Senate,  and they changed the policy of the Nation and made the world a safer  place.   It has been my privilege for the last three decades to have worked  alongside this community for the safe destruction of these deadly  chemicals. This effort would not have been possible without having had  allies like Craig Williams, an incredible local leader who pored over  every detail until he became the leading expert on the depot.   Together, we stopped the Army's incineration plans and convinced the  Department of Defense to adopt the safest and most advanced alternative  for the responsible destruction of the stockpile. It wasn't an easy  fight, but it was a fight worth having, not only to protect the  Kentuckians who were potentially in harm's way but also to uphold our  national commitment to destroy these terrible weapons.   In 1984, President Reagan asserted America's leadership in calling  for an international prohibition on chemical weapons. Over the next  decade, we made international progress toward that same goal by joining  the Chemical Weapons Convention. The continued work in Madison County  is part of this historic commitment.   Unfortunately, while the United States has been taking these steps,  these horrific weapons have still been posing a threat to international  peace. Some of our adversaries are choosing a different path by  preserving, modernizing, and using their stockpiles.   Remember that Syrian dictator Bashar Assad's use of chemical weapons  against his own people was the subject of the Obama administration's  failure to enforce its own so-called redline. We also saw Russian  operatives deploy advanced nerve agents in the middle of a residential  neighborhood in the United Kingdom just last year.   Thankfully, President Trump has taken a different approach to  American leadership. On two occasions, this administration ordered  strikes on Syrian military targets after the Assad regime crossed the  redline. As my colleagues will remember, we also deported Russian  agents and put in place new sanctions following the chemical attack on  Sergei Skripal.   The Senate has taken action as well. The first piece of legislation  we passed this Congress, S. 1, included the Caesar Syria Civilian  Protection Act, which holds the Assad regime and its enablers more  accountable for recent atrocities.   The use of chemical weapons is a stain on human history. It is time  for civilized nations the world over to turn the page once and for all,  and the Blue Grass Army Depot is ready to do its part. So this year's  NDAA will authorize the funding that this facility needs and the  resources for countless installations across the country. Each plays an  important role in their own community.   I hope my Senate colleagues will join me in keeping our commitment to  finally finishing this national security mission.                                   Economy    Mr. President, on another matter, speaking of the local impacts of  our work, we are continuing to see evidence that Republican efforts to  roll back harmful overregulation and put more tax dollars back in the  hands of American families and job creators are working.   I am proud to say that my home State of Kentucky is a strong example  of that achievement. With billions of dollars in new investments, a  rising economic tide for working families, and promising, new  opportunities like industrial hemp, it is no surprise that an economic  researcher recently called this moment ``Kentucky's Best Economy  Ever.''   Month after month, more Kentuckians are entering the labor force and  looking to put their skills to work. We are currently experiencing the  lowest unemployment rate ever recorded in our State. Job seekers are  filling out applications, polishing their resumes, and preparing to  clock in.   Employers are ready too. At last count, Kentucky was home to more job  openings than individuals looking for work. The economy in the  Bluegrass State is red hot.  [[Page S4527]]    These are the results of the pro-growth policies advanced by  Republicans in Washington and in State capitals around the country-- generational tax reform, major regulatory reform, big bites out of the  worst parts of Dodd-Frank, eliminating ObamaCare's individual mandate.  All this and more is helping American workers and American small  businesses gain more opportunities, higher pay, and the ability to keep  more of what they earn.   And the good news keeps coming. Just last week, after nearly a decade  of the war on coal, the Trump administration finalized the rollback of  an Obama-era regulation that threatened to shift Kentucky jobs overseas  and send energy bills through the roof. Instead of harnessing America's  abundant resources of reliable and affordable energy, the previous  administration tried to coerce every State to drastically restructure  its electricity systems to conform to Washington's unfeasible and  likely illegal restrictions. It is important to remember that all that  self-imposed economic pain would have produced little to no meaningful  effect on global emissions.   I spent years leading the fight against Obama's anti-coal policies.  And with the help of the Trump administration, we are finally putting a  stop to Washington overregulation. Last week's decision replaces the  so-called Clean Power Plan with a regulation that actually works with  States to encourage energy production while also protecting the  environment.   This President's commitment to Middle America is welcome news after  years of overreach, overregulation, and policies which seem to have  been dreamt up for the benefit of elite coastal areas but which left a  lot of the rest of us way behind.   That wasn't even the only positive announcement from just last week.  After I reached out to the administration, they confirmed that the  Department of Agriculture will continue operating job core centers in  several States, including Kentucky. The three centers that were at risk  in Kentucky provide important education and job-training services to  vulnerable youth in some of my State's most distressed communities.  Their work gives a boost to those who need it most. I made an appeal  directly to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and Labor Secretary  Alexander Acosta, and I am pleased the decision was reached to ensure  these centers remain open and able to offer young people the tools they  need to excel.   These very recent wins are just the latest few examples of  Republicans' focus on new economic growth and job creation throughout  all parts of America, but the list keeps on growing.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, the Senate proceed to the consideration of  H.R. 3401, which was received from the House. I further ask that the  time until 2 p.m. be equally divided between the two leaders for debate  only; that at 2 p.m., the Senate vote on the bill, with 60 affirmative  votes required for passage; that if the bill is not passed, it remain  pending and open to amendment, with the only amendments in order being  the following: Shelby substitute amendment No. 901; the text of S.  1900, as reported; a Paul amendment, No. 902, to pay for spending by  cutting foreign aid; further, that the Senate vote in relation to the  Paul amendment and, following its disposition, vote on adoption of the  Shelby amendment, with a 60-vote affirmative threshold for adoption;  finally, that following disposition of the Shelby amendment, the Senate  vote on passage of the bill, as amended, if amended, with 60  affirmative votes required for passage and that the only debate in  order be 2 minutes, equally divided, prior to each vote.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, following the disposition of H.R. 3401,  there be 10 minutes of debate, equally divided between the managers,  remaining on the cloture motions filed during Monday's session of the  Senate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, the cloture motions filed on Senate  amendment No. 764 and S. 1790 occur at a time to be determined by the  majority leader in consultation with the Democratic leader.    Mr. President, I am glad that the bipartisan Senate  border supplemental has passed with an overwhelming vote. I commend  Chairman Shelby, Senator Leahy, and the members of the Appropriations  Committee for breaking the logjam.                                   S. 1790    Mr. President, on the NDAA, the Democratic leader and I have had  extensive discussions on the path forward on the Defense bill. For the  information of all of our colleagues, we intend to stay in session this  week to finish the NDAA bill and allow for a vote in relation to the  Udall amendment. Senators should plan to vote on Friday on the Udall  amendment. Yet the vote--here is the good news--will start first thing  in the morning and be held open into the afternoon to accommodate as  many Senators as possible.   To be clear, obviously, I believe that the Udall amendment can and  should be defeated--I hope with a resounding vote in the Senate--and  that we should put this issue to rest before we break for the Fourth of  July recess. Holding up the Defense authorization bill is not an  acceptable outcome.    Mr. President, I have 7 requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate.
