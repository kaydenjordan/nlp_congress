 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in honor of the 10th  anniversary of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program or  DACA.   Today, Dreamers are doctors, soldiers, nurses, frontline workers,  police officers, and firefighters, and many, many DACA recipients have  made the ultimate sacrifice for this country.   Here is a picture of one of my constituents, Jose Angel Garibay. Jose  Angel Garibay was killed in action. He was the first marine to make the  ultimate sacrifice in Iraq from Orange County.   There are many, many more soldiers--DACA recipients--that have made  the ultimate sacrifice for their new country. It is time to give them  permanent status in the United States.                            ____________________
