 Mr. President, the beginning of a new session of Congress  provides a good moment to look back at the previous year and take stock  of the challenges ahead, and today what I would like to do is just take  a few minutes to talk about the national security challenges facing our  country and the importance of equipping our military to meet them.   By the end of the Obama administration, our military was facing a  serious readiness shortfall. The Obama administration's failure to  prioritize defense had left our armed services with manpower deficits  and delayed the acquisition of 21st century weapons and  equipment. Military effectiveness had been compromised by a culture of  micromanagement in the Obama administration that seriously hampered the  ability of troops and commanders to respond to conditions on the ground  in a timely fashion, but within days of his inauguration, President  Trump made clear that all this was going to change.    You can look at the situation we faced in the Middle East. The  timeframe I am referring to right here, the mound of ground that is  held by ISIS, that is in January of 2017.   Well, just a week after his inauguration, President Trump issued a  Presidential memorandum on rebuilding the military. He directed a  review of our military's readiness, and he set out an action plan to  address manpower shortfalls, maintenance backlogs, acquisition costs  and delays, and other drains on our military capabilities. President  Trump also acted to free up military commanders to make decisions and  to respond to conditions on the ground.   The fruits of his commitment to rebuilding our military and trusting  our military leaders are already evident, most notably in the  significant gains made against ISIS in 2017.  [[Page S88]]    If you look at the chart I just showed, in January of 2017, and then  you look at December of 2017, in terms of territory held, ISIS has been  routed. In the first 11 months of the Trump administration, over 15,000  square miles were liberated from ISIS control, exceeding the total area  freed in the preceding 2\1/2\ years. ISIS has lost over 98 percent of  the territory it once held, and it hasn't gained any back.   Just a month ago, Iraqi Prime Minister al-Abadi declared his country  ``fully liberated'' from ISIS. In Syria, ISIS has lost control of its  strongholds and now only remains in small pockets of the country.   All told, in the last year, more than 5.3 million people have been  freed from the brutal grip of ISIS--more than double the previous  gains. Families who have spent years fearing for their lives are seeing  a chance for stability, peace, and order. If this year has shown us  anything, it is that we can trust our military to do its job and  deliver results.   President Trump delegated tactical authority and permitted our  military to take action when action was needed, and military leaders  credit this tactical authority for significant gains made on the  ground.   The swift rise of ISIS was enabled, in part, by the Obama  administration's shortsighted desire to withdraw from the fight against  terrorism in the Middle East. The withdrawal of U.S. troops--on a  timeline the Obama administration announced to our enemies--left a  power vacuum in the region, and ISIS stepped in to fill the void. This  is a mistake we cannot repeat.   While we have made tremendous strides against ISIS in the last year,  we cannot simply take these wins and let our guard down. We know ISIS  and other dark actors can operate in the shadows of the internet and  social media, using their extensive networks to recruit and influence  other would-be attackers in the United States and around the world.   As chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, which shares  jurisdiction over some of these matters, I am committed to looking at  what steps we can take to thwart terrorist recruitment and planning  efforts and to keep America safe. Next week, I am holding a Commerce  Committee hearing on what social media companies can do in this fight.   While we focus on combating terrorism, we cannot forget the  conventional threats faced by our Nation and our allies. I mentioned  gains against ISIS and Syria, but there remains the alarming challenge  of growing Iranian influence there. Syria provides a convenient land  bridge to connect Iran with Hezbollah in Lebanon, which is well on its  way to being a proxy for the Iranian Army.   Of course, we continue to see the deadly consequences of Iran's  continued smuggling of arms to Houthi rebels. Iran is a serious threat  to stability in the Middle East and to our allies there, and we need to  keep that in mind as we consider the failed Iran nuclear deal and the  ongoing protests in Iran.   We also have to stay focused on the threat posed by North Korea.  South and North Korea reestablished communications and just met to  discuss the upcoming winter Olympics in South Korea. They announced, in  addition to North Korea sending a delegation to the winter games, the  two countries have agreed to hold military talks, but North Korea said  it will not discuss its nuclear program at this time.   I think North Korea's nuclear program has to be addressed as a  condition of any lasting peace, and the United States should lead its  allies in making that crystal clear. While the talks are a notable  development after 2 years of no communication between the two  countries, we obviously need to be wary of North Korea's motives. We  will have to see what actions follow and if the talks lead to any  substantive steps by North Korea to dismantle its nuclear program.   President Trump and Ambassador Haley have made it clear that North  Korea must abandon its dangerous ambitions, and increased sanctions are  providing additional pressure. We should make no concessions without  fundamental progress. Of course, this will require cooperation from  China to help exert pressure on North Korea and uphold U.N.  resolutions.   China has sought to tip the regional balance in its favor by  objecting to the installation of missile defense platforms that would  defend the United States and our allies against North Korean missiles.  Meanwhile, it has been simultaneously expanding its own military,  continuing to develop islands in international waters and exercising  economic coercion.   President Trump's national security strategy correctly acknowledges  both China and Russia as challengers to American influence, interests,  security, and prosperity.   I have spoken on the Senate floor more than once to denounce Russia's  continued annexation of Crimea, its subversion of Ukrainian  sovereignty, and its efforts to undermine NATO, not to mention its  continued denial of attempting to meddle with our election. Both the  conventional challenges that our Nation continues to face and the  persistent threat of radical terrorism underscore the perennial need to  ensure that our military is the best prepared and the best equipped  fighting force in the world.   I have said it before, and I will say it again. If we don't get  national security right, the rest of what we do here is just  conversation. We have to be able to defend our country and our allies.   Yes, investing in our national security and restoring our military,  especially after years of neglect, will come at a cost, but as Army  Chief of Staff GEN Mark Milley has said, ``The only thing more  expensive than deterrence is actually fighting a war, and the only  thing more expensive than fighting a war is fighting one and losing  one.''   In the next few weeks, the Senate will have a chance to vote to  increase funding for our troops and to take real steps to restore our  military readiness. I hope my colleagues across the aisle will work  with us. If there is any issue--any issue--in this Chamber that should  be bipartisan, it is this one. It is not an exaggeration to say the  security of our Nation, our ability to live as a free people, depends  upon the strength of our military. It is time to make sure our military  men and women have the resources they need to defend our Nation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  stand in recess as under the previous order.
