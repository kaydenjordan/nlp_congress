 Mr. Speaker, I thank my distinguished colleague and  Chairman Roe for yielding.   In November of last year, I joined my colleague and the ranking  member of the Health Subcommittee, Representative Brownley, in  reintroducing H.R. 4451, the Homeless Veterans' Reintegration Programs  Reauthorization Act.   This bill would provide much-needed services to our veterans  transitioning out of homelessness and ensure no veteran falls through  unintended legislative gaps in programs. We do this by reauthorizing  through fiscal year 2022 the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program,  along with programs designed for female homeless veterans and homeless  veterans with children. Additionally, the bill would clarify that those  eligible for housing assistance from either a Federal or non-Federal  entity are also eligible for the Homeless Veterans Reintegration  Program.   Currently, a gap arises because the Department of Labor considers  veterans participating in these housing assistance programs to no  longer be defined as homeless. As such, they are unable to participate  in the Homeless Veterans' Reintegration Program, a program that  provides vital employment assistance and training.   By prioritizing the reintegration of homeless and recently homeless  veterans, we will empower our veterans to reenter the workforce and  help them regain self-sufficiency.                                time  1645    Our veterans have sacrificed so much for our country, and we must  ensure that they have the tools to succeed in civilian life.   I am proud of Chairman Roe's and the House Veterans' Affairs  Committee's commitment to reducing veteran homelessness, and I believe  that this legislation only further supports this committee's goals.   I urge all my colleagues to support this important legislation.
