 Mr. Speaker, there are over 150 medical device companies  in the State of Indiana representing more than 20,000 jobs. These are  high-paying, stable jobs, with more than $1 billion in Indiana  payrolls. But, more importantly, they provide lifesaving products for  the American consumer.   As a physician, I know the importance of the innovation and the  technological advances these companies provide, and the medical device  tax is an onerous tax that is helping to stymie this innovation and  technology.                                time  1330    By defeating the previous question, we can bring up H.R. 2207, the  Protect Medical Innovation Act of 2019, and finally repeal permanently  the onerous excise tax on the sale of medical devices in our country.  This will allow for more treatments, and this will allow for more  cures.
