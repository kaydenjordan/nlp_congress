 Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of New Jersey's  Eighth Congressional District to highlight how the House GOP's debt  limit demands will hurt our families. If the Republicans' bill is  adopted into law, then over 20,000 families in our district will be  affected by cuts to lifelines like SNAP.   While the House Republicans leave town for Memorial Day, they are at  the same time targeting 9,000 veterans in our district whose VA health  resources will be cut, making it more difficult for them to access the  care that they deserve.   The Republicans' legislation would also devastate our public schools,  cutting Federal funds that help support the education of over 100,000  students in our district.   Meanwhile, the 98,000 households in New Jersey that spend more than  30 percent of their income on rent--working families--would face severe  cuts to the Federal housing assistance programs that enabled them to  stay in their homes.    While House Democrats support investing in our communities, the House  Republicans are looking to burn them with deep cuts to these essential  programs.   I stand with House Democrats in opposing the House GOP's reckless and  cruel cuts, and I urge Speaker McCarthy to bring his Members back to  have a vote on this important deal.                            ____________________
