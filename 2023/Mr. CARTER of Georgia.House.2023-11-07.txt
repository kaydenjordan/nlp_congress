 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  achievements of Corporal Leonard Turner who recently celebrated his  100th birthday.   Corporal Turner is a World War II veteran who was part of the revered  Marine Raiders, an elite infantry group that took on the most dangerous  tasks during the war.   As his 100th birthday approached, his children decided to honor him  and celebrate his very special birthday by inviting an array of  veterans, generals, colonels, and dignitaries from the State.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Corporal Turner on reaching this  incredible milestone of 100 years. His journey through life, including  his valiant service during World War II, is an inspiration to us all.   His dedication, courage, and sacrifices have left an indelible mark  on history, and we will be forever grateful for his service to our  country.                  Congratulating William ``Bill'' Easterlin     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Queensborough National Bank president William Easterlin on receiving  the James Collier Award from the Georgia Bar Foundation at their annual  grants meeting in July.   The James Collier Award is reserved for individuals, lawyers or  nonlawyers, who make exceptional efforts to advance the foundation's  primary objective of providing legal assistance to Georgians in need.   Mr. Easterlin has shown extraordinary support for the foundation  through his counsel as a banker and dedication to assisting  disadvantaged Georgians.   From growing his family-owned bank's assets from $106 million to $2  billion and expanding to 27 locations, he is committed to providing  exceptional financial services and giving back to the community he  serves.   Mr. Speaker, Bill has done great work. I look forward to seeing what  else he achieves.                       Remembering Arlie Maxton McNeill     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of  Arlie Maxton McNeill, a resident of Brunswick, Georgia, who passed away  on August 16, 2023, surrounded by his family after battling cancer.   Arlie was born in Seagrove, North Carolina, in 1936. He joined the  U.S. Navy in 1955 where he became a dental assistant and soon realized  he wanted to be a mortician.   In 1961 he married his wife, Sheila McNeill, and the following year  he graduated from John A. Gupton College mortuary school in Nashville,  Tennessee.   Arlie returned to Brunswick and started working at Edo Miller and  Sons Funeral Home where he served for over 50 years and became part  owner with Johnny Wilson.   Arlie was a well-known auctioneer and a 50-year Mason at Lodge 214  F&AM. In 1977 he became an ordained deacon at Norwich Street Baptist  Church. He also served on the Georgia State Board of Funeral Services  from 1998 to 2004. He was the area manager for the Loewen Funeral Group  for 5 years and was a devout Christian.   He will be remembered by all, including his family and the community  that he served well.               Honoring the Life of Mr. George Skarpalezos, Sr.     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  Mr. George Skarpalezos, Sr., an American hero and a father to three  children.   Upon graduating from basic training at Fort Benning, Georgia, First  Lieutenant George Skarpalezos led a platoon of the U.S. Army's 82nd  Airborne during the Vietnam war.    After serving in the military, George returned to his roots of  Brunswick, Georgia, to raise three children.   Mr. Skarpalezos was also a musician. He performed at many local  establishments on St. Simons Island. He also played in several bands,  including the Ascots, the Gypsys, and The Fabulous Sixty Minute Men.   He also found enjoyment in real estate, leading him to open his own  real estate company called Skarpalezos Realty.   While we are all sad that he is no longer with us, we will remember  the life of Mr. Skarpalezos, his service to the United States, and the  contributions to the State of Georgia.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Dawn  Baker on her induction into the Silver Circle.
