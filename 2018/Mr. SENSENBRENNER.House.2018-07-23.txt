 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 1689) to protect private property rights.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1689         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Private Property Rights       Protection Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON EMINENT DOMAIN ABUSE BY STATES.         (a) In General.--No State or political subdivision of a       State shall exercise its power of eminent domain, or allow       the exercise of such power by any person or entity to which       such power has been delegated, over property to be used for       economic development or over property that is used for       economic development within 7 years after that exercise, if       that State or political subdivision receives Federal economic       development funds during any fiscal year in which the       property is so used or intended to be used.        (b) Ineligibility for Federal Funds.--A violation of       subsection (a) by a State or political subdivision shall       render such State or political subdivision ineligible for any       Federal economic development funds for a period of 2 fiscal       years following a final judgment on the merits by a court of       competent jurisdiction that such subsection has been       violated, and any Federal agency charged with distributing       those funds shall withhold them for such 2-year period, and       any such funds distributed to such State or political       subdivision shall be returned or reimbursed by such State or       political subdivision to the appropriate Federal agency or       authority of the Federal Government, or component thereof.        (c) Opportunity To Cure Violation.--A State or political       subdivision shall not be ineligible for any Federal economic       development funds under subsection (b) if such State or       political subdivision returns all real property the taking of       which was found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have       constituted a violation of subsection (a) and replaces any       other property destroyed and repairs any other property       damaged as a result of such violation. In addition, the State       or political subdivision must pay any applicable penalties       and interest to reattain eligibility.       SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON EMINENT DOMAIN ABUSE BY THE FEDERAL                     GOVERNMENT.         The Federal Government or any authority of the Federal       Government shall not exercise its power of eminent domain to       be used for economic development.       SEC. 4. PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.         (a) Cause of Action.--Any--(1) owner of private property       whose property is subject to eminent domain who suffers       injury as a result of a violation of any provision of this       Act with respect to that property; or (2) any tenant of       property that is subject to eminent domain who suffers injury       as a result of a violation of any provision of this Act with       respect to that property, may bring an action to enforce any       provision of this Act in the appropriate Federal or State       court. A State shall not be immune under the 11th Amendment       to the Constitution of the United States from any such action       in a Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction. In       such action, the defendant has the burden to show by clear       and convincing evidence that the taking is not for economic       development. Any such property owner or tenant may also seek       an appropriate relief through a preliminary injunction or a       temporary restraining order.        (b) Limitation on Bringing Action.--An action brought by a       property owner or tenant under this Act may be brought if the       property is used for economic development following the       conclusion of any condemnation proceedings condemning the       property of such property owner or tenant, but shall not be       brought later than seven years following the conclusion of       any such proceedings.        (c) Attorneys' Fee and Other Costs.--In any action or       proceeding under this Act, the court shall allow a prevailing       plaintiff a reasonable attorneys' fee as part of the costs,       and include expert fees as part of the attorneys' fee.       SEC. 5. REPORTING OF VIOLATIONS TO ATTORNEY GENERAL.         (a) Submission of Report to Attorney General.--Any--(1)       owner of private property whose property is subject to       eminent domain who suffers injury as a result of a violation       of any provision of this Act with respect to that property;       or (2) any tenant of property that is subject to eminent       domain who suffers injury as a result of a violation of any       provision of this Act with respect to that property, may       report a violation by the Federal Government, any authority       of the Federal Government, State, or political subdivision of       a State to the Attorney General.        (b) Investigation by Attorney General.--Upon receiving a       report of an alleged violation, the Attorney General shall       conduct an investigation to determine whether a violation       exists.        (c) Notification of Violation.--If the Attorney General       concludes that a violation does exist, then the Attorney       General shall notify the Federal Government, authority of the       Federal Government, State, or political subdivision of a       State that the Attorney General has determined that it is in       violation of the Act. The notification shall further provide       that the Federal Government, State, or political subdivision       of a State has 90 days from the date of the notification to       demonstrate to the Attorney General either that: (1) it is       not in violation of the Act; or  [[Page H6611]]       (2) that it has cured its violation by returning all real       property the taking of which the Attorney General finds to       have constituted a violation of the Act and replacing any       other property destroyed and repairing any other property       damaged as a result of such violation.        (d) Attorney General's Bringing of Action To Enforce Act.--      If, at the end of the 90-day period described in subsection       (c), the Attorney General determines that the Federal       Government, authority of the Federal Government, State, or       political subdivision of a State is still violating the Act       or has not cured its violation as described in subsection       (c), then the Attorney General will bring an action to       enforce the Act unless the property owner or tenant who       reported the violation has already brought an action to       enforce the Act. In such a case, the Attorney General shall       intervene if it determines that intervention is necessary in       order to enforce the Act. The Attorney General may file its       lawsuit to enforce the Act in the appropriate Federal or       State court. A State shall not be immune under the 11th       Amendment to the Constitution of the United States from any       such action in a Federal or State court of competent       jurisdiction. In such action, the defendant has the burden to       show by clear and convincing evidence that the taking is not       for economic development. The Attorney General may seek any       appropriate relief through a preliminary injunction or a       temporary restraining order.        (e) Limitation on Bringing Action.--An action brought by       the Attorney General under this Act may be brought if the       property is used for economic development following the       conclusion of any condemnation proceedings condemning the       property of an owner or tenant who reports a violation of the       Act to the Attorney General, but shall not be brought later       than seven years following the conclusion of any such       proceedings.        (f) Attorneys' Fee and Other Costs.--In any action or       proceeding under this Act brought by the Attorney General,       the court shall, if the Attorney General is a prevailing       plaintiff, award the Attorney General a reasonable attorneys'       fee as part of the costs, and include expert fees as part of       the attorneys' fee.       SEC. 6. NOTIFICATION BY ATTORNEY GENERAL.         (a) Notification to States and Political Subdivisions.--        (1) Not later than 30 days after the enactment of this Act,       the Attorney General shall provide to the chief executive       officer of each State the text of this Act and a description       of the rights of property owners and tenants under this Act.        (2) Not later than 120 days after the enactment of this       Act, the Attorney General shall compile a list of the Federal       laws under which Federal economic development funds are       distributed. The Attorney General shall compile annual       revisions of such list as necessary. Such list and any       successive revisions of such list shall be communicated by       the Attorney General to the chief executive officer of each       State and also made available on the Internet website       maintained by the United States Department of Justice for use       by the public and by the authorities in each State and       political subdivisions of each State empowered to take       private property and convert it to public use subject to just       compensation for the taking.        (b) Notification to Property Owners and Tenants.--Not later       than 30 days after the enactment of this Act, the Attorney       General shall publish in the Federal Register and make       available on the Internet website maintained by the United       States Department of Justice a notice containing the text of       this Act and a description of the rights of property owners       and tenants under this Act.       SEC. 7. REPORTS.         (a) By Attorney General.--Not later than 1 year after the       date of enactment of this Act, and every subsequent year       thereafter, the Attorney General shall transmit a report       identifying States or political subdivisions that have used       eminent domain in violation of this Act to the Chairman and       Ranking Member of the Committee on the Judiciary of the House       of Representatives and to the Chairman and Ranking Member of       the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate. The report       shall--        (1) identify all private rights of action brought as a       result of a State's or political subdivision's violation of       this Act;        (2) identify all violations reported by property owners and       tenants under section 5(c) of this Act;        (3) identify the percentage of minority residents compared       to the surrounding nonminority residents and the median       incomes of those impacted by a violation of this Act;        (4) identify all lawsuits brought by the Attorney General       under section 5(d) of this Act;        (5) identify all States or political subdivisions that have       lost Federal economic development funds as a result of a       violation of this Act, as well as describe the type and       amount of Federal economic development funds lost in each       State or political subdivision and the Agency that is       responsible for withholding such funds; and        (6) discuss all instances in which a State or political       subdivision has cured a violation as described in section       2(c) of this Act.        (b) Duty of States.--Each State and local authority that is       subject to a private right of action under this Act shall       have the duty to report to the Attorney General such       information with respect to such State and local authorities       as the Attorney General needs to make the report required       under subsection (a).       SEC. 8. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING RURAL AMERICA.         (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:        (1) The founders realized the fundamental importance of       property rights when they codified the Takings Clause of the       Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, which requires that       private property shall not be taken ``for public use, without       just compensation''.        (2) Rural lands are unique in that they are not       traditionally considered high tax revenue-generating       properties for State and local governments. In addition,       farmland and forest land owners need to have long-term       certainty regarding their property rights in order to make       the investment decisions to commit land to these uses.        (3) Ownership rights in rural land are fundamental building       blocks for our Nation's agriculture industry, which continues       to be one of the most important economic sectors of our       economy.        (4) In the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in Kelo v.       City of New London, abuse of eminent domain is a threat to       the property rights of all private property owners, including       rural land owners.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       the use of eminent domain for the purpose of economic       development is a threat to agricultural and other property in       rural America and that the Congress should protect the       property rights of Americans, including those who reside in       rural areas. Property rights are central to liberty in this       country and to our economy. The use of eminent domain to take       farmland and other rural property for economic development       threatens liberty, rural economies, and the economy of the       United States. The taking of farmland and rural property will       have a direct impact on existing irrigation and reclamation       projects. Furthermore, the use of eminent domain to take       rural private property for private commercial uses will force       increasing numbers of activities from private property onto       this Nation's public lands, including its National forests,       National parks and wildlife refuges. This increase can       overburden the infrastructure of these lands, reducing the       enjoyment of such lands for all citizens. Americans should       not have to fear the government's taking their homes, farms,       or businesses to give to other persons. Governments should       not abuse the power of eminent domain to force rural property       owners from their land in order to develop rural land into       industrial and commercial property. Congress has a duty to       protect the property rights of rural Americans in the face of       eminent domain abuse.       SEC. 9. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the policy of the United States to encourage,       support, and promote the private ownership of property and to       ensure that the constitutional and other legal rights of       private property owners are protected by the Federal       Government.       SEC. 10. RELIGIOUS AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS.         (a) Prohibition on States.--No State or political       subdivision of a State shall exercise its power of eminent       domain, or allow the exercise of such power by any person or       entity to which such power has been delegated, over property       of a religious or other nonprofit organization by reason of       the nonprofit or tax-exempt status of such organization, or       any quality related thereto if that State or political       subdivision receives Federal economic development funds       during any fiscal year in which it does so.        (b) Ineligibility for Federal Funds.--A violation of       subsection (a) by a State or political subdivision shall       render such State or political subdivision ineligible for any       Federal economic development funds for a period of 2 fiscal       years following a final judgment on the merits by a court of       competent jurisdiction that such subsection has been       violated, and any Federal agency charged with distributing       those funds shall withhold them for such 2-year period, and       any such funds distributed to such State or political       subdivision shall be returned or reimbursed by such State or       political subdivision to the appropriate Federal agency or       authority of the Federal Government, or component thereof.        (c) Prohibition on Federal Government.--The Federal       Government or any authority of the Federal Government shall       not exercise its power of eminent domain over property of a       religious or other nonprofit organization by reason of the       nonprofit or tax-exempt status of such organization, or any       quality related thereto.       SEC. 11. REPORT BY FEDERAL AGENCIES ON REGULATIONS AND                     PROCEDURES RELATING TO EMINENT DOMAIN.         Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the head of each Executive department and agency       shall review all rules, regulations, and procedures and       report to the Attorney General on the activities of that       department or agency to bring its rules, regulations and       procedures into compliance with this Act.       SEC. 12. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that any and all precautions       shall be taken by the government to avoid the unfair or       unreasonable taking of property away from survivors of       Hurricane Katrina who own, were bequeathed, or assigned such       property, for economic development purposes or for the       private use of others.  [[Page H6612]]            SEC. 13. DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT.         If the court determines that a violation of this Act has       occurred, and that the violation has a disproportionately       high impact on the poor or minorities, the Attorney General       shall use reasonable efforts to locate former owners and       tenants and inform them of the violation and any remedies       they may have.       SEC. 14. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act the following definitions apply:        (1) Economic development.--The term ``economic       development'' means taking private property, without the       consent of the owner, and conveying or leasing such property       from one private person or entity to another private person       or entity for commercial enterprise carried on for profit, or       to increase tax revenue, tax base, employment, or general       economic health, except that such term shall not include--        (A) conveying private property--        (i) to public ownership, such as for a road, hospital,       airport, or military base;        (ii) to an entity, such as a common carrier, that makes the       property available to the general public as of right, such as       a railroad or public facility;        (iii) for use as a road or other right of way or means,       open to the public for transportation, whether free or by       toll; and        (iv) for use as an aqueduct, flood control facility,       pipeline, or similar use;        (B) removing harmful uses of land provided such uses       constitute an immediate threat to public health and safety;        (C) leasing property to a private person or entity that       occupies an incidental part of public property or a public       facility, such as a retail establishment on the ground floor       of a public building;        (D) acquiring abandoned property;        (E) clearing defective chains of title;        (F) taking private property for use by a utility providing       electric, natural gas, telecommunication, water, wastewater,       or other utility services either directly to the public or       indirectly through provision of such services at the       wholesale level for resale to the public; and        (G) redeveloping of a brownfield site as defined in the       Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields       Revitalization Act (42 U.S.C. 9601(39)).

(3) State.--The term ``State'' means each of the several       States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto       Rico, or any other territory or possession of the United       States.       SEC. 15. LIMITATION ON STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION.         Nothing in this Act may be construed to supersede, limit,       or otherwise affect any provision of the Uniform Relocation       Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970       (42 U.S.C. 4601 et seq.).       SEC. 16. BROAD CONSTRUCTION.         This Act shall be construed in favor of a broad protection       of private property rights, to the maximum extent permitted       by the terms of this Act and the Constitution.       SEC. 17. SEVERABILITY AND EFFECTIVE DATE.         (a) Severability.--The provisions of this Act are       severable. If any provision of this Act, or any application       thereof, is found unconstitutional, that finding shall not       affect any provision or application of the Act not so       adjudicated.        (b) Effective Date.--This Act shall take effect upon the       first day of the first fiscal year that begins after the date       of the enactment of this Act, but shall not apply to any       project for which condemnation proceedings have been       initiated prior to the date of enactment.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 1689, currently  under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the House is considering H.R. 1689,  the Private Property Rights Protection Act. My bill aims to restore the  property rights of all Americans that the Supreme Court took away in  2005.   The Founders of our country recognized the importance of an  individual's right to personal property when they drafted the  Constitution. The Fifth Amendment states: ``nor shall private property  be taken for public use, without just compensation.''   In Kelo v. City of New London, the Supreme Court decided that  economic development could be a public use under the Fifth Amendment's  Takings Clause. In a 5-4 decision, the Court held that the government  could take private property from an owner--in this case, Susette Kelo-- to help a corporation or private developer--in this case, Pfizer.   The now infamous Kelo decision generated a massive backlash. As  former Justice O'Connor stated: ``The government now has license to  transfer property from those with fewer resources to those with more.  The Founders cannot have intended this perverse result.''   Even in the 13 years since Kelo, polls show that Americans  overwhelmingly oppose property being taken and transferred to another  private owner, even if it is for the public economic good.   The Private Property Rights Protection Act is needed to restore to  all Americans the property rights the Supreme Court invalidated.  Although several States have since passed legislation to limit their  power to eminent domain, and a number of supreme courts have barred the  practice under their State constitutions, these laws exist on a varying  degree.   H.R. 1689 would prohibit State and local governments that receive  Federal economic development funds from using economic development as a  justification for taking property from one person and giving to another  private entity. Any State or local government that violates this  prohibition will be ineligible to receive Federal economic development  funds for 2 years.   The protection of property rights is one of the most important tenets  of our government. I am mindful of the long history of eminent domain  abuses, particularly in low-income and often predominantly minority  neighborhoods, and the need to stop it. I am also mindful of the  reasons we should allow the government to take the land when the way in  which land is being used constitutes an immediate threat to public  health and safety. I believe this bill accomplishes both goals.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in protecting private  property rights for all Americans and limiting the dangerous effects of  the Kelo decision on the most vulnerable in our society.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, there are two flaws in the gentleman's argument. The  first flaw, we ought to go back to why the Kelo case got to the Supreme  Court.    Mrs. Kelo owned a house. She didn't want to sell it. What the city  decided is that the public purpose that was served was by condemning  the house and allowing an office building to be built so that the  community could collect higher property taxes because the office  building would end up being assessed at a greater value than Mrs.  Kelo's house. Now, that was the so-called public purpose.   The thing is, without this legislation, any property that could be  taxed higher if it were condemned and there were a replacement property  that was put up could end up being condemned under the Kelo decision,  and the homeowner would be out of luck and out of their house and have  to find some more housing.   The second complaint the gentleman from New York makes is that the  penalties for violations are too severe. Well, you don't change the  activity of anybody if there are no penalties at all or the penalty is  just a tap on the wrist. Just think of what would happen if we still  had a law that said that everybody had to stop at a red light, but  there was never a fine or any points or any impact on one's insurance  policy because there was no moving vehicle violation. Good luck  everybody in this country getting home from work tonight if that were  the attitude toward traffic violations. There has to be some kind of a  severe violation.   If the city is concerned that they might be violating the terms of  this bill, they can always go to court and ask that their condemnation  action be withdrawn. Hopefully, the judge will grant it to be withdrawn  with prejudice, but at least it can be withdrawn.   The city can stop this procedure any time they want to before there  is an actual condemnation judgment that is entered by the court. This  is designed to slow down and stop legislation when the sole public  purpose is to collect more property taxes because there is a more  expensive structure that is being built there.   Both of these arguments, I think, do not have any merit whatsoever  and that is why this bill ought to pass.   Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte), and I ask unanimous consent that he may  control that time.
