 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 50th  anniversary of the Black Voice News, which has reported on seeking  justice in the Inland Empire through their reporting for decades.   For the last 50 years, the Black Voice News has addressed issues such  as disparities in healthcare, wealth, and education. This dedicated  team of talented journalists has chronicled some of the most important  stories impacting Black lives in my community and given a voice to our  residents.   They have lifted up the stories of middle-class families doing their  best, through joys and sorrows, to carve out a better life for  themselves and their families.   The Inland Empire residents deserve to have access to local news, and  Black Voice News provides that.   I am so proud of everything this publication has accomplished over  the last 50 years, and I am excited to see what is to come in the next  50.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Democratic Caucus, I  offer a privileged resolution and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H.
