 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, first, with apologies to our official reporter, and  directed at you, ``let the good times roll,'' ``laissez les bons temps  rouler.''   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 347, the Responsible Disposal Reauthorization Act  of 2019, was introduced by our Colorado colleague, Scott Tipton, and  cosponsored by my Energy and Commerce Committee colleague from  Colorado, Diana DeGette.   H.R. 347 extends the authorization of the Uranium Mill Tailings  Radiation Control Act of 1978 site in Mesa County, Colorado. The  legislation was passed by the House last September, and the bill today  is identical to what we passed last year, save a change in dates.   The legislation was considered by the Subcommittee on Environment and  marked up through regular order. It was reported by the full committee  with a bipartisan amendment by a voice vote.   Mining and processing of uranium generates a byproduct known as  uranium mill tailings. Congress passed the Uranium Mill Tailings  Radiation Control Act 4 years ago to establish the framework for DOE to  dispose of mill tailings, which are left over from nuclear defense  activities and the development of our commercial nuclear industry.   The act also authorized the Grand Junction, Colorado, site to serve  as a disposal location. This is the only DOE uranium mill tailings  disposal site remaining open in the Nation, so it is necessary for the  final disposition of mill tailings discovered in communities.   H.R. 347 extends the site's current authorization until 2031. The  extension will enable the site to plan long-term operations to protect  public health and the environment.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tipton), the author of the legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1138, a bill to reauthorize the West Valley  Demonstration Project, was introduced recently by our New York  colleague,   Tom Reed. I also see my good friend, Brian Higgins on the  floor, and I know the chairman has been personally involved with this  for many, many, many years.   The House passed an essentially identical version of this bill this  past September on suspension. Prior to that vote, the bipartisan  legislation had moved through the Energy and Commerce Committee by  regular order, including a legislative hearing and markups as part of  our broader nuclear waste management agenda. It was reported by the  full committee with a bipartisan amendment by a voice vote.   H.R. 1138 authorizes appropriations to support the Department of  Energy's environmental remediation at its West Valley cleanup site in  New York through 2026. It also directs a study to help Congress  determine the final disposition of radioactive waste that DOE is  cleaning up at the site.   H.R. 1138 continues the work of Congress to address the Federal  Government's obligations for treatment and disposal of the legacy waste  produced during the Cold War, and through the Federal Government's  early efforts to develop a civilian nuclear energy industry.   The Department of Energy has successfully remediated 92 sites of this  waste, but the most technologically challenging projects remain in  process at 17 locations, one of which is the West Valley site.   In 1980, Congress passed the West Valley Demonstration Project Act to  direct DOE to address legacy environmental issues and authorized  appropriations only through fiscal year 1981. The project has not been  reauthorized since that time, despite Congress funding DOE's work at  the site for the past 37 years.   H.R. 1138 corrects this situation, provides a path to answering  important questions concerning the waste disposition, and ensures  spending at the site is subject to an active authorization.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1138,  and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1630     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Reed), the author of the legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting H.R. 1138, and I yield back the balance of my time.
