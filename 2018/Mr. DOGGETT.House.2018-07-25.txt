 Mr. Speaker, TrumpCare, that is what we are talking  about today.   What is TrumpCare? Well, it is not much care. In fact, it is mainly  indifference from people that don't really care or understand the  plight of thousands of families across this country working to make  ends meet, and suddenly somebody has an accident on the way home from  work or suddenly a child is diagnosed with some dreaded disease, and  they face, without access to affordable health insurance, a  catastrophe.   We know that there are a significant number of American families that  have said they couldn't meet a $400 or $500 emergency. Think about what  happens to them when they face a $4,000 or a $40,000 healthcare bill.  That is what the Affordable Care Act has been all about.   So today we see the chapter in the TrumpCare story that Mr. Roskam  and his colleagues are offering for Trump and all of his cohorts. And  what is it? It is the 5 percent solution, because we know that health  savings accounts have been used by exactly 5 percent of those who earn  less than $100,000.   So, as usual, the Trump approach is let's do more for the few, and to  heck with the many, the many people who are out there for whom health  savings accounts provide little or no protection.   Now, of course, it is a valuable tax shelter for some people who are  a little bit more prosperous in our society, and that is fine, but I  believe we need to make healthcare accessible to more people.   And then there is the additional problem that Mr. Roskam and his  colleagues have decided to pay for their package of bills, $100 billion  of bills, by borrowing just a little bit more. After all the trillions  of dollars that they have borrowed from the Saudis and the Chinese and  people here at home, wherever they can find somebody who will take  their IOU, they want to borrow a little more money, $100 billion,  almost, to finance this package of bills to help that 5 percent of the  families who earn less than $100,000.   I offered an amendment, recognizing that it wouldn't correct all the  flaws of TrumpCare, but that it would address one central problem, and  that is the problem of preexisting conditions.   What is a preexisting condition? Well, it is whatever an insurance  company wants to point to to deny you coverage before the Affordable  Care Act.   I do think that our Republican colleagues are afflicted with a very  serious preexisting condition. It is called amnesia. They have  forgotten what healthcare was like for families before the Affordable  Care Act came into existence and prohibited these preexisting  conditions not only for those who went to the marketplace, but across  the board, to prevent preexisting conditions from being used against  someone to deny them coverage or to limit the coverage that they got.   The kind of people whom I came in contact with as we worked on the  Affordable Care Act who were determined to have preexisting conditions  were a victim of domestic violence, someone who was born with a  disability, and someone who had an accident or an illness and found  themselves with some lingering effects of that. They would either be  denied coverage altogether, or they would find in the fine print of  their insurance policy significant limitations on that insurance. The  insurance would cover them for everything except what they needed  insurance for.   Now, after the Republican attempt--and not just one, but 60 or 70  attempts--to repeal the Affordable Care Act failed in the United States  Senate, thanks to the courage of a few there and of the many across  this country who said, ``We don't want it repealed,''  [[Page H7663]]  now that it has failed, they have devoted the last year to doing  everything in the book to try to sabotage the Affordable Care Act.   They won't stabilize health insurance markets. They won't focus on  reducing premiums. They won't focus on strengthening and correcting any  of the shortcomings within the Affordable Care Act, like the need to  rein in the prescription drug price gouging.   So instead of expanding accessible coverage, what they do is to  expand a healthcare tax shelter for a few people.   Having done so much harm, they tell us today that they are not  advocating junk insurance. Well, let's talk about junk insurance,  because I think they are right in the junkyard on it.   President Trump's administration is out there telling the courts that  they cannot defend the protections in the Affordable Care Act.    Mr. Speaker, they can't defend, and they refuse to  defend, the preexisting conditions provisions that protect, in Texas,  it is almost half of the population who are said to have some type of  preexisting condition.                                time  1715    So the administration won't protect those with preexisting  conditions. They are hoping to erode that protection. And when I  offered a one-paragraph amendment, Republicans refused it without any  decent explanation in our committee to ensure that the preexisting  condition provision was in any policy that would be purchased under  this plan.   So what you will be left with, as my colleague from California  explained, are junk insurance plans. They are the kind that promise  great coverage, but down in the fine print of the policy, you don't  have coverage when you need it. They are skinny insurance plans that  aren't about the size of the person, but the size of the coverage, that  it doesn't cover very much. And those kinds of plans are the kind that  we will end up having.   We have a saboteur-in-chief, not only when it comes to our military  alliances and our friends abroad but, with this President, with  reference to healthcare. These bare-bones, junk insurance policies will  not get the job done.   I think of the many people whom I represent in central Texas, and I  am sure they are not unlike people in the suburbs of Chicago.   They are people like Colleen, who is a bookkeeper. She adopted her  son through the foster care system when he was 18 months old. Unknown  to her, he had a preexisting condition; and she learned that she had a  preexisting condition. And as she said: ``The Affordable Care Act made  my family possible.''   I think of people like Theresa in San Antonio, who says that, before  the Affordable Care Act, she found herself repeatedly digging out of  medical debt because of a preexisting condition.   I think of a constituent who called me during the debate of the  Affordable Care Act because her sister could not get coverage for  cancer.    Mr. Speaker, her sister could not get coverage. Though  she had substantial chemotherapy coverage, it was not enough to cover  the full amount of the treatment that she needed.   We cannot go back. These folks would drag us back along with the  chief saboteur of healthcare in this country. We don't want to return  to the fine print restrictions, to the clever caveats. We need  comprehensive coverage.   The Affordable Care Act can be made better, and I believe we are  going to have a Congress that will do just that if we defeat this  effort.
