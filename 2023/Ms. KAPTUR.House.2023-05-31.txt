 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address an immense burden  being shifted onto Ohio electric ratepayers beginning this week while  Congress works to prevent a national default.   Ohio customers who buy electricity directly from disgraced  FirstEnergy Corporation may see rates increase by as much as 47 percent  starting in June.   If your energy bill is $50, you will now pay $73.50 a month. If your  bill is $100 a month on average, you will pay $147 per month. These new  rates will last through May of 2024.   The State of Ohio seems to have no problem with a system where  FirstEnergy, a criminal nuclear enterprise, can shift $1.3 billion in  their losses to ratepayers. When it comes time to pay its taxes, the  company has an effective tax rate of negative 1.3 percent. Then  FirstEnergy bilks millions more from the Federal Government instead of  paying its fair share.   As Ohio families struggle to keep up with inflation, put food on the  table, and pay for childcare, FirstEnergy is squeezing consumers to pay  for its criminal behavior. For shame. This corruption cannot stand.                            ____________________
