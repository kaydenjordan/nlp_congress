 Mr. Speaker, the House will vote on my bill to rename  the Saint Clair Post Office after Marine Corporal Jeffrey Robert  Standfest. Before we do, I want to tell you a little bit about the life  of this brave young man.   Mr. Speaker, Corporal Standfest was described by those who knew him  as respectful, family-oriented, dedicated, hardworking, and the all- American kid.   He was a runner at Saint Clair High School where he graduated in  2005. His success as a runner, along with his reputation as a leader,  continued during his time at Oakland University. In 2008, wanting to  follow in the footsteps of his grandfather who served our Nation during  World War II, Jeff enlisted in the Marine Corps. He was deployed to  Afghanistan as a combat engineer and a K9 handler. Tragically on June  16, Corporal Standfest and his canine, Sergeant Ruppert, were killed by  an IED. He was only 23 years old.   Mr. Speaker, we must always remember that the rights and freedoms we  as Americans hold dear are only secured through the courage and  sacrifice of those who serve. Eleven years later, his memory, his  courage, and his sacrifice are kept alive by his parents, Timothy and  Karen, and his sister, Jaclyn, all of whom knew him and loved him.   Mr. Speaker, this bill could never heal the wounds of losing him, but  passage of this bill will demonstrate to his loved ones that Congress  and this country will never forget his bravery and ultimate sacrifice.  Passage of this bill will ensure that the residents of Saint Clair will  always be reminded about their high school star runner, the all- American kid who answered the call to serve and gave his life in  defense of this great country.
