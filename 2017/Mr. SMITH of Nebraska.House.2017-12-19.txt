 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  tax reform conference report.   This is our great opportunity to reduce the tax burden on Americans  across the economic spectrum, while modernizing our Tax Code for the  21st century.   I would like to take a few moments to discuss what this bill does for  American agriculture.   First and foremost, this bill cuts taxes for most Americans, while  simplifying compliance and transitioning us to a more competitive tax  system internationally.   In addition to retaining the deduction for State and local taxes for  individuals and families up to $10,000, this bill leaves intact the  full deduction for property taxes on ag land and property.   In addition, I am grateful this conference report includes a solution  to concerns raised by agriculture co-ops and their members about the  repeal of section 199.   With commodity prices low, it is important we ensure the Tax Code  continues to work as intended, with co-ops passing along their profits  to their producer owners.   Finally, while I would have preferred we repeal the death tax in  full, doubling the exemption and keeping a stepped up basis will help  provide certainty for more farmers, ranchers, and small businesses.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and the conferees for their work on  this strong product. I am anxious to pass this bill and get it to the  President for his signature.
