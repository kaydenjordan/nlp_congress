 Mr. Speaker, I stand here today, not only as  a Member of Congress but as a mother, to say that I am outraged, I am  heartbroken, and I am embarrassed by the barbaric activity of our  government on our borders.   The Trump administration's zero-tolerance policy is cruelly ripping  children from the arms of their mothers and their fathers at our  borders. They are separating them for indefinite periods of time, often  in unspeakable, unbearable facilities.   We have seen a lot of ruthless actions from the Trump administration,  but this is as bad as it gets. I call it government-inflicted child  abuse. I stand here committed, with like-minded citizens, millions of  Americans across the country, condemning these actions and committed to  keeping parents and children together when they come to the United  States of America.                            ____________________
