 Mr. President, I rise to address the debate we are  having today over whether to override the President's veto of the Kaine  resolution that reminds the President of the United States about the  fundamentals of the Constitution, about article I, section 8 of the  Constitution, which gives the enumerated powers of Congress and says  that Congress, and Congress alone, has the power to declare war.   No decision is tougher or more important than the decision to go to  war. That is why the Founding Fathers never intended for a single  person to be able to make that decision. They explicitly, after intense  debate and consideration, gave that power solely to Congress, the  people's branch of our government. They didn't want anyone--any one  individual, even the President of the United States--to be able to drag  our Nation to war for personal or political reasons or for  misjudgments, inadequately vetted with the wisdom of the leaders of the  country.   Since President Trump came into office, we have come within a hair's  breadth of war with Iran on more than one occasion because of his words  and his actions. It is why back in February and March, the Senate and  the House debated this resolution, reinstructing the President on the  fundamentals of the Constitution, reminding him that he does not have  the power to take us to war in Iran. It instructed him that any  hostilities with Iran need to come in accordance with the Constitution.   But the President of the United States has responded to our clear  declaration of the essence of the Constitution by tossing it aside, by  vetoing that resolution. And so here we are debating whether to  override that veto.   The Founding Fathers were adamant about not having anything  resembling a King in the new country they were building. The President  was given the power to lead the Nation's Armed Forces as Commander in  Chief, but article I, section 8 of the Constitution stated: ``The  Congress shall have Power. . . . To declare war.''   If there is any real doubt about the Founders' intent, well, let's  return to the comments that they made at the time.   James Madison, father of the Constitution, said this:         The constitution supposes, what the History of all       Governments demonstrates, that the Executive is the branch of       power most interested in war, and most prone to it. It has       accordingly with studied care vested the question of war to       the legislature.    He continued: ``The power to declare war, including the power of  judging the causes of war, is fully and exclusively vested in the  legislature . . . the executive has no right, in any case, to decide  the question, whether there is or not cause for declaring war.''   How about George Washington, commander of our forces in the  Revolution, first President of the United States, father of our Nation?  He said this: ``The constitution vests the power of declaring war in  Congress; therefore no offensive expedition of importance can be  undertaken until after they shall have deliberated upon the subject and  authorized such a measure,'' referring to Congress.   How about George Mason of Virginia? George Mason remarked that he was  ``against giving the power of war to the executive'' because the  President ``is not safely to be trusted with it.''   There is more. How about Thomas Jefferson, one of the most brilliant  minds our country has ever produced? He said this: ``We have already  given in example one effectual check to the dog of war by transferring  the power of letting him''--the dog of war--``loose from the Executive  to the Legislative body.''   And Jefferson didn't just believe that these were important words in  the Constitution. When he was President and when he was being pressured  over a dispute with Spain over the boundaries of Louisiana and Florida,  he wrote to Congress stating: ``Considering that Congress alone is  constitutionally invested with the power of changing our condition from  peace to war, I have thought it my duty to await their authority for  using force in any degree.''   How about Alexander Hamilton, whom many Americans have been hearing  so much about with the play ``Hamilton'' having been such a hit over  the  [[Page S2306]]  last few years? What did Hamilton say about this? He said:         ``The Congress shall have the power to declare war''; the       plain meaning of which is, that it is the peculiar and       exclusive duty of Congress . . . to change that state into a       state of war.''    Abraham Lincoln was not a Founding Father, but he understood  absolutely what the Founders were talking about, and he said this:         The provision of the Constitution giving the war-making       power to Congress was dictated . . . by the following       reasons. Kings had always been involving and impoverishing       their people in wars, pretending generally, if not always,       that the good of the people was the object. This, our       Convention understood to be the most oppressive of all Kingly       oppressions, and they resolved to frame the Constitution [so]       that no one man should hold the power of bringing this       oppression upon us.    But we are in a day and age where we have the President who does not  respect the words of the Constitution, does not respect the vision of  our Founders, does not understand the wisdom that the issue of war and  the associated huge toll in blood and huge toll in treasure is  absolutely too important a decision to be vested in a single person,  that it must be a product--a decision to go to war must be the  product--of a considered debate of the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House  of Representatives. That is why we proceeded to pass the resolution  here in February and in March down the hall, because the President has  been beating the drums of war since he came to office. He started up by  tearing up the Iran nuclear agreement, after the United States had led  the world in creating an effective strategy to end the nuclear programs  of Iran. He followed it with an economic war against Iran that has  inflicted great suffering on the people of that Nation, and, then, so  many other escalatory provocations and responses, that without the  considered response of Congress to remind him that he does not have the  power to go to war, could take us into another Middle East war.   We here in the Senate must not allow that to happen. We saw the  consequences of the last Middle East war and the toll of the blood of  our sons and daughters and of our national treasure. We saw that toll,  and we must not allow a war to occur because of a President who  disregards the Constitution of the United States.   The resolution that the Senate and House passed, the Kaine  resolution, says:         Congress hereby directs the President to terminate the use       of United States Armed Forces for hostilities against the       Islamic Republic of Iran or any part of its government or       military, unless explicitly authorized by a declaration of       war or specific authorization for the use of military force       against Iran.    That, by the way, is exactly consistent with the War Powers  Resolution, which is the law of the United States of America that notes  that the power of the President as Commander in Chief to involve the  United States ``in hostilities is clearly indicated by the  circumstances, are exercised only pursuant to a (1) declaration of war,  (2) specific statutory authorization, or (3) a national emergency  created by attack upon the United States, its territories or  possessions, or its Armed Forces.''   That is the law of the United States of America backing up the  Constitution of the United States of America, founded on the wisdom of  the Founders, as you heard one after another, all conveying that same  message.   But what was the President's response?   The President's response in his veto message said that the resolution  is insulting. Is it insulting to fight for our Constitution to be  followed   No, Mr. President, it is the responsibility of every Member here to  fight for the Constitution to be followed, and the most important issue  we ever consider on the floor of the Senate is the issue of whether or  not we are going to war.   It is not insulting. It is essential--essential--to remind this  President that the wisdom of the Constitution stands today as it has  for more than 200 years.   The President also cited authorities he has under the 2002  authorization for the use of military force. Well, let's see what that  authorization actually said. It said this:         The President is authorized to use the Armed Forces of the       United States as he determines to be necessary and       appropriate in order to--        (1) defend the national security of the United States       against the continuing threat posed by Iraq; and        (2) enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council       resolutions regarding Iraq.    Now, I know people get confused about Iraq and Iran, but, Mr.  President--and I am speaking to the President of the United States-- please, get out a map and understand that Iraq is not Iran, that this  does not give you authority to go to war against Iran.   The President also cites article II of the Constitution, and he goes  on at some length in his veto message saying what limited powers this  gives him.   Well, Mr. President--and, again, I am speaking to the President of  the United States--that is not what is written in the Constitution.  That is not what is embodied in the War Powers Resolution. That is not  what our law and international law provide as a basis for going to  war--that the President has sole power--and it is absolutely contrary  to the complete history and founding of the United States of America,  giving the power of war to this body and the House that is down the  hall.   In fact, international law and U.S. law refer to issues like force  being used as necessary and proportionate, and for the President to be  able to act when there is an imminent threat. And the President takes a  shot at this in his Trump veto message, referring to the fact that he  has powers that go far beyond to respond to an imminent attack, under  article II of the Constitution. In other words, the President of the  United States is saying that his powers are unlimited, as he asserted  in so many other arenas--that his powers are unlimited to go to war.   No, Mr. President, they are not, and a bipartisan majority of this  Senate has said that. A bipartisan majority of the House has said that.  And even if your veto stands and we cannot override it today, it is the  Constitution of the United States that says that. And that should be  the final point that today, when we vote, let's vote with the  Constitution of the United States. Let's vote with the Founders, who so  explicitly gave that power to this Chamber and the Chamber down the  hall. Let's vote to say that the wisdom that has stood for more than  200 years should be the wisdom that prevails today when we vote to  override the veto of the President of the United States.    I yield the floor.
