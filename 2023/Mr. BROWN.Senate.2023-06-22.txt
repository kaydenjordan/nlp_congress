 Mr. President, I rise today to honor a great economist, a  trailblazer, and a friend of mine: Dr. Bill Spriggs.   Bill was born here in Washington, DC, to a professor and a  schoolteacher. He shared his parents' love of learning and went on to  attend Williams College for his undergraduate degree and the University  of Wisconsin-Madison for his PhD in economics. Bill began his career in  academia and brought a new lens to economic policy: calling attention  to the role of race in our economy.   Over the years, Bill mentored thousands of students at North Carolina  Agricultural and Technical College, Norfolk State University, and  Howard University. Bill was committed to lifting up all voices in his  classroom and helping all students, especially people of color, advance  in a field dominated by White men. As Assistant Secretary of Labor  during the Obama administration, Bill worked on a number of issues from  trade to minimum wage, to racial disparities in the labor market. Bill  then transitioned to be chief economist at the AFL-CIO, where he was a  frequent and outspoken advocate for workers, in particular Black  workers. Over his career of service, Bill's advocacy and policy  expertise made a difference for so many. It is simple: Workers are  better off because of Bill.   And his impact extends far beyond the impressive roles he held; at  every step of his career, Bill challenged his colleagues to consider  how systemic racism in our economy hurts working families of color. In  the summer of 2020, following the murder of George Floyd, Bill  published a powerful open letter to his fellow economists where he  criticized the field's approach to race as a factor in the economy. He  called on economists to reflect on and rethink how they study race. And  he asked that they commit to creating policies that uplift workers of  color and their families. The letter served as a starting point for  discussion about the Fed's role in economic inequality.   His work shaped the national conversation. He found that Black  workers were disproportionately hurt by import shocks to the economy,  like NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China. His work  reminded us that just as we were starting to create more jobs that  support the middle class like manufacturing and make them more open to  Black workers, our country's trade policy enabled the shipment of those  jobs overseas. The work that we have to do now to rebuild our country  with a real pro-American pro-worker industrial strategy that is finally  inclusive to all stands on his shoulders. It is up to all of us to  continue that conversation and uphold Bill's legacy.   On a personal note, I had the privilege of working with Bill a number  of times over the years. He testified before the Banking Housing and  Urban Affairs Committee at least four times since I took over as the  lead Democrat. Each time, Bill testified about policies that would help  workers. He offered his support for COVID relief packages to get  families through the pandemic. And he stood up for communities and  people that have been overlooked by economic policy for far too long.   Bill offered thoughtful counsel; he took time to talk to my staff and  share his expertise. He was kind, thoughtful, and a brilliant  economist. Bill understood that worker rights are intertwined with  civil rights. And above all, he was committed to fighting for the  dignity of work; he and I shared a goal that, one day, hard work will  pay off for everyone no matter who you are or what you do.   May we all follow Bill's example to dedicate our lives to service, to  push toward that goal until every worker can count on the dignity of  work.  [[Page S2219]]    Our thoughts are with the Spriggs' family and with all those who knew  and loved Bill.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in  recognizing and celebrating the accomplishments of two Ohioans from  Duncan Falls, Brad Ryan and his grandmother, Joy Ryan. Together, they  visited every National Park--all 63 of them--and they set a world  record along the way. Joy is the oldest woman to visit every National  Park. It took them 8 years and brought them new adventures all over the  country.   In 2015, Brad invited Joy to camp and hike with him in the Smokey  Mountains. Joy was 85 at the time and accepted the challenge. She had  never been to a mountain before, and when they reached the top, she  remembers a group of college kids cheering for them. This was just the  beginning. Over the past 8 years, they have ziplined at the New River  Gorge in West Virginia, where Joyce broke the record for the oldest  person to complete the course. They whitewater rafted at Wrangell-St.  Elias National Park in Alaska. At the Great Sand Dunes National Park in  Colorado, Joy even rolled down a sand dune. Their final trip, to  National Park of American Samoa, took them 6,700 miles from their home  in Duncan Falls, OH.   Brad didn't set out to take his grandmother to every National Park;  he knew she hadn't seen mountains or deserts or oceans, and he wanted  to make sure she had the chance to experience all the natural wonder  our country has to offer. Along the way, they accomplished something  remarkable. Congratulations.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in  recognizing and congratulating the Center for Science and Industry-- COSI--on their National Medal for Museum and Library Science. It is an  outstanding achievement and a testament to the work COSI educators,  curators, and support staff do. It wouldn't have been possible without  their dedication and service. COSI staff engages Ohio's next generation  of thinkers, leaders, and problem solvers. They spark students'  interest in the sciences and in technology with hands-on learning and  interesting exhibits and inspire them to become the leaders who will  continue our State's proud tradition of leadership in innovation for  decades to come.   I am grateful for all COSI does for the Columbus community, and I ask  my colleagues to join me in congratulating these Ohioans on this  achievement.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in  recognizing and congratulating the Toledo Lucas County Public Library  on their National Medal for Museum and Library Science.   It is an outstanding achievement and a testament to the work the  librarians and support staff do. It wouldn't have been possible without  their dedication and service.   The Toledo Lucas County Public Library educates and engages Ohioans  of all ages by creating spaces where everyone can broaden their  horizons with books, technology, and innovative classes. Their  commitment to helping kids learn to read is building Ohio's next  generation of thinkers, leaders, and problem solvers.
