 Madam Speaker, today, the House debated several bills to  address the health and safety of children and newborns, including those  that would ban crib bumpers and mandate stability standards for  furniture that could fall on children.   Unfortunately, this body did not consider any legislation that would  continue to ensure that precious taxpayer dollars are not used to fund  abortions that intentionally kill babies. At a time when this  protection of the unborn may be stripped from Federal funding bills for  the first time in nearly 50 years, it should be pointed out that  abortion ends exponentially more lives than crib bumpers or furniture.   Madam Speaker, I, therefore, ask unanimous consent that the  Committees on Energy and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be  discharged from further consideration of H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer  Funding for  [[Page H2991]]  Abortion Act, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.
