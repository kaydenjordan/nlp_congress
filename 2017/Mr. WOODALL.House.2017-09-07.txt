 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 504 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 504         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for further       consideration of the bill (H.R. 3354) making appropriations       for the Department of the Interior, environment, and related       agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and       for other purposes.        Sec. 2. (a) No further amendment to the bill, as amended,       shall be in order except those printed in the report of the       Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution, amendments       en bloc described in section 3 of this resolution, and       available pro forma amendments described in section 4 of       House Resolution 500.        (b) Each further amendment printed in the report of the       Committee on Rules shall be considered only in the order       printed in the report, may be offered only by a Member       designated in the report, shall be considered as read, shall       be debatable for the time specified in the report equally       divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, may       be withdrawn by the proponent at any time before action       thereon, shall not be subject to amendment except amendments       described in section 4 of House Resolution 500, and shall not       be subject to a demand for division of the question in the       House or in the Committee of the Whole.        (c) All points of order against further amendments printed       in the report of the Committee on Rules or against amendments       en bloc described in section 3 of this resolution are waived.        Sec. 3.  It shall be in order at any time for the chair of       the Committee on Appropriations or his designee to offer       amendments en bloc consisting of further amendments printed       in the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution not earlier disposed of. Amendments en bloc       offered pursuant to this section shall be considered as read,       shall be debatable for 20 minutes equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Appropriations or their respective designees,       shall not be subject to amendment except amendments described       in section 4 of House Resolution 500, and shall not be       subject to a demand for division of the question in the House       or in the Committee of the Whole.        Sec. 4.  At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for       amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill, as       amended, to the House with such further amendments as may       have been adopted. The previous question shall be considered       as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final       passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit with or without instructions.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for  1 hour.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                time  1245                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                time  1245                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Georgia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, it is going to be a good day. It is going  to be a good day.   I don't know if you came down to Washington as a young man. I  remember sitting right up there on the second row of the gallery, and I  came into the Chamber and I was so excited. It was my first visit to  see the people's House.   The Reading Clerk was standing there at that podium and read and  read. I had absolutely no idea what was going on, and here nobody hands  you a pamphlet or anything to tell you what is happening on the floor  of the House. I thought the activity was going to happen down here, and  it was all going on up there at the podium.   That has been 40 years ago now. I now see that however long that  conversation happens, it lays the groundwork for what is going to be an  even greater conversation here on the floor of the House.   Mr. Speaker, I am fond of saying that if you come to this institution  on the right day, you are going to see a festival of democracy take  place right here. Today is going to be one of those days.   If you were on the House floor yesterday, you saw us take up the  first of these divisions in this appropriations bill. Today, because of  the work that my friend from New York and I did with the rest of the  members of the Rules Committee right up there last night, we are  bringing to the floor the remaining four divisions of H.R. 3354; 224  additional amendments. 224 additional amendments. Division A is the  Interior section; division C is the Commerce, Justice, Science section;  division D is the Financial Services section; division F is the Labor,  HHS, and Education section.   When I was on the floor yesterday, Mr. Speaker, I talked about how  proud I was of the work that we have all done here together. This  annual appropriations process has been conducted in a more  comprehensive fashion this year than in any other year in my memory.   When we get jammed, you end up with one of those long-term, yearlong  continuing resolutions that shut out every Member's voice. In a good  year, maybe, you end up with one of those giant leadership-negotiated  White House and the leader of the House and the Senate omnibus  appropriations bills that shut out all but two or three voices.   This year, the Appropriations Committee, beginning its work way back  in April, has worked through every single appropriations bill one by  one at the committee level, and we are seeing the culmination of that  effort here on the floor today.   Mr. Speaker, it has been since 2010 that the House has finished its  work before the September 30 fiscal year deadline. It was the 2009  calendar year. They were doing the work for the 2010 fiscal year. It is  hard to get this done, and it doesn't happen because Democrats are  successful or Republicans are  [[Page H7107]]  successful. It happens because the collaboration that we have together  is successful, and we are seeing the result of that today.   If we pass the underlying rule, we will make in order those 224  amendments, we will begin that process of debating the last four  divisions, and we will have the voices of this House heard.   We went until midnight last night, Mr. Speaker. We went until  midnight the night before that. I suspect midnight is going to seem  early to us where we are headed over the next couple of days. But at  the end of that process, Republicans, Democrats, folks from all regions  of the country, are going to be able to look each other in the eye and  know that--in a way that makes folks back home proud--we worked through  each and every appropriations bill and we got our work done on time.   That is why I ran for Congress, Mr. Speaker, to deliver results back  home, and that is why I am proud to be standing with my friend from New  York today delivering on those promises.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   My friend is absolutely right, there is a lot of work to get done.  That is why we both ran for Congress, to get that work done. I am  incredibly optimistic that we will get that work done.   I wish from time to time we would celebrate our successes as fiercely  as we observe our failures. My friend is absolutely right, there was a  time in congressional history where appropriations bills came to the  floor and any Member could offer any amendment they wanted at any time,  and the process could go on for days or weeks or months.   To my friend's point, we can reminisce about those days and celebrate  them, but we can't do it at the same time we observe the very limited  deadlines that we have now trying to get work done.   It was back on August 24 that the Rules Committee created a deadline  and said: We want to have every Member have their voice heard. We want  to hear from every single Member on every single appropriations bill to  understand what it is you would do differently to have the bills serve  America better.   We created that deadline, Mr. Speaker, for exactly the reason my  friend from New York suggested, and that is so folks would have the  time to look at those amendments, to digest those amendments, to be  thoughtful about those amendments.   Now, it turns out even in a body of 435 Members, you can have some  repetitive ideas. It turns out a lot of us think a single amendment is  a good idea. The Rules Committee looked at amendments and found  multiple Members had exactly the same idea. In order to speed the  process along, we let one of those Members offer the amendment; we  asked the other Members not to.   That is not closing down the process. That is a good use of the  American people's time, because we have so much that we must get done  together.   Mr. Speaker, for folks who care about openness--and I am one of those  Members--I just want to remind you that it is not just the 1,000-plus  amendments we looked at in the Rules Committee. It is thousands upon  thousands that were worked through the Appropriations Subcommittee  process, and then the Appropriations full committee process.                                time  1300    The appropriations process is one of the best opportunities for any  Member  [[Page H7108]]  in this Chamber to make their priorities known, act on those  priorities, change the law of the land for the men and women they serve  back home. Every single Member of this Chamber knows of that process,  avails themselves of that process, and if we pass this rule, we will  make several hundred more amendments in order and complete this process  for the first time since 2009.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Rohrabacher), one of our leaders from the great State  of California.    I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from  California.    I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from  California.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that admonition. As my friends  all know, the truth is, the vote in the Senate was a bipartisan vote  against the consideration of that bill.   We are going to find a bipartisan solution to this difficult problem  and continuing to characterize this as a partisan issue does nothing  but harm to our shared cause.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Mrs.  Roby), one of the great leaders of the big freshman class in 2010.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to associate myself with the comments of my  friend from California. She is absolutely right. When Republicans took  control of this Chamber, they committed themselves to having a more  open process. I was a part of that freshman class that came in to give  Republicans a majority, and we have made good on that process. I want  to talk about that just for a little bit.    My friend from California serves on the Appropriations Committee, and  I thank her for her service, Mr. Speaker. When you want to talk about  an open process, that Appropriations Committee went through every  single bill one subcommittee at a time, hour after hour, day after day,  week after week, indeed, month after month. I am grateful to her for  that service. The bill would not be as good as it is but for the men  and women who serve on the Appropriations Committee.   But I mentioned earlier, Mr. Speaker, that one of the reasons I was  proud to be carrying the rule today is that we haven't gotten the  appropriations process completed on time since Democratic leadership  was able to achieve that back in 2009. They couldn't do it in their  last year in power, 2010. In fact, they didn't do the appropriations  bills at all. They punted it off to the next Republican Congress. But  in 2009 they did.   When I talk about that commitment to openness, let's remember, last  time we had this shared success together and my friends on the other  side of the aisle were leading, they allowed 17 amendments to the  Financial Services bill. We are allowing twice that many today.   When my friends were leading this institution the last time we  completed this process, they allowed 13 amendments to the Interior  bill. We are allowing six times that many.   When my friends on the other side of the aisle were leading this  institution, the last time we successfully completed this process, they  allowed five amendments to the Labor-HHS. We are allowing 10 times that  many.   When my friends on the other side of the aisle were leading this  institution, the last time we successfully completed this process on  time, they allowed zero amendments to the Commerce-Justice-Science  bill. We allow 49--infinitely more.   My friends, can we always do better together? We can. I am grateful  to my friends for the hard work they put in showing up day after day to  do that better. But this bill is better, and if we pass this rule, we  will move to the debate on this bill, and we will complete this process  on time in the most open fashion that any of my colleagues have seen in  decades.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   We have a long and proud history in this House, but it is sometimes  tough to remember exactly how that history goes, Mr. Speaker.                                time  1330    My friend from New York has her picture up on the wall in the Rules  Committee room. If you haven't been up there, Mr. Speaker, you should  go see it.   My friend from New York is the first woman to have ever led the  United States House of Representatives Rules Committee. She led it ably  and proudly for the 4 years that the Democrats were in the majority the  last decade.   It is a hard job because, as the chairman of the Rules Committee or  the chairwoman of the Rules Committee, you have to make decisions. When  the bills come to you from the committees of jurisdiction--the  authorizing committees--you often have to completely reorganize those  bills. You have to meld those bills together. It is a powerful  committee because it has a solemn responsibility.   Yes, in the area of Rules Committee jurisdiction and the melding of  all of those pieces of legislation is what amendments get added and  what amendments get taken away.   My friend from California (Ms. Lee), has an absolutely legitimate  gripe, as does my friend from Virginia (Mr. Scott). Mr. Speaker, we all  think our amendments are the greatest amendments to be known.   Mr. Scott led, to his credit, with saying: I am glad so many of my  amendments were made in order, but I am appalled my one amendment was  kept out.   We all want all of our amendments in. But to my friend from New  York's comment that Democrats don't get a fair shake, I will remind  you, Mr. Speaker, when my friend was leading the committee, the entire  House of Representatives was offered 139 chances to change the  appropriations bill in 2009, the last time we completed it.   With Paul Ryan leading the institution, with my friend from Texas,  Pete Sessions, leading the Rules Committee, we made 214 Democratic  amendments in order. We have made more minority amendments in order in  this process than my friends on the other side made in order for the  entire House.   Mr. Speaker, we have nothing to fear from openness. We have nothing  to fear from a robust debate. I am so glad that we have had a chance to  do that. But history should be reported accurately. The accuracy is: we  can always do better. But we are doing better today than we were just a  few short years ago.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Will the gentlewoman yield?    I will say to my friend that I have no better days than  the days that you and I are working together. I absolutely look forward  to that.    Mr. Speaker, I would say to my friend from New York that  I do not have other speakers remaining, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I don't dispute the polling numbers my friend from New  York cites. In fact, I am as saddened by those numbers, as she is. But  I also feel culpable; not culpable because of the work we are doing  today--I think we should be proud--I feel culpable because we all find  ourselves in conversations with one another where, instead of building  the institution up, we run the institution down.   What my friend from New York said about Ms. Lee's amendment being  changed in the Rules Committee, she is absolutely right, the amendment  was changed. But, Mr. Speaker, let's be clear: it wasn't changed in  some backroom deal with smoke-filled air where no one knows what is  happening and can't read the bill. It was noticed. There was an entire  paragraph dedicated to saying: Hey, this is unusual. This doesn't  happen that often. We want all the cards on the table so everybody  knows. Just understand we made this change this time around.   Mr. Speaker, getting the work done in this institution is hard. It  leads to conflicting goals. You heard folks from the other side of the  aisle say: We are not spending nearly enough time on this bill. We need  to make even more amendments in order. And you heard folks on other  side of the aisle say: This whole bill is an exercise in futility. I  don't know why we are wasting even one moment on it.   It is tough to satisfy both of those concerns simultaneously.   We have got this rule book called the United State Constitution. It  doesn't ask a whole lot of the United States Congress. It does ask us  to appropriate the money. Under the leadership of both parties, Mr.  Speaker, this House has failed to get that done on time year after  year.    This year, the bipartisan Appropriations Committee in subcommittee,  in full committee, worked tirelessly, as I said, not for days, not for  weeks, but for months. One bill at a time. In fact, one line at a time.   That product was brought together by the Rules Committee last month,  August 16, Mr. Speaker. That amalgamation of bills was posted on the  internet for all the world to see and read. Every Member of this  Congress had a chance to bring their ideas about how to make it better.   The Rules Committee got together, looked at those ideas, made more of  those ideas in order for debate than we have seen in decades for bills  that get completed on time.    I yield to the gentlewoman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, I am always compelled to yield to my friend  from New York because I am so fond of her and because her leadership  has meant so much to this institution.   My friend has served on the Rules Committee for even longer than I  have, and so my friend understands how the Rules Committee works even  better than I do.   I don't want to engage my friend in a colloquy, at least not in my  closing statement. We should have this conversation on day 1. Please,  my friend from New York, give us one more word.    Mr. Speaker, I welcome my friend's constructive counsel,  but I know for a fact that her calendar looks just like mine does, and  that means that we are going in in the early afternoon and we are not  getting out till late at night.   Why? Because you and I are sitting just three Members apart listening  to Member after Member make their case, and in the spirit of accuracy,  don't let it be said that our Members coming and testifying doesn't  make a difference because it does. You and I both believe that. We know  it to be true, and it is important that it be true.   Those Members come and they testify, they make their case, and then  we vote up or down on those amendments.  [[Page H7113]]    Mr. Speaker, can we do better? We can. And I will work with  absolutely any colleague of any political stripe of any region to do  better at any time, but let's do recognize that we made a commitment to  ourselves to get this job done for the first time in a decade.   By coming to the floor right now, Mr. Speaker, quarter of 2 on a  Thursday afternoon passing this rule, we are going to get this job done  together for the first time in a long time.   Will we wake up tomorrow and try to do better? You know that we will.  Should we take a moment to thank the folks who helped us get here? You  know that we should.   Mr. Speaker, you are surrounded left and right by Members of the  House team. The parliamentarians worked tirelessly to approve the  amendments, to make sure they are all written and drafted properly. I  want to thank the parliamentarian team for the work that they do.   Mr. Speaker, we kick CBO a lot in this place because we don't like  their score one day, we like it the next. CBO has to go through these  amendments, score these amendments. I am grateful to them for the work  they did to make this possible.   Legislative counsel goes through, with each Member of Congress,  making sure that every ``i'' is in the right place, every ``t'' is  crossed. It is not a small task. It is a gargantuan task, and they do  it on these big bills day in and day out. I am grateful for that.   You are starting to see some of the appropriators come down, Mr.  Speaker. Long after my friend from New York and I have left this  Chamber, the appropriations team is going to be here until the wee  hours of the morning once again going through each and every line and  each and every amendment.   I think about what my friend from Louisiana said about the school  children who are turning on C-SPAN and watching this process. I don't  know what they think goes into making this happen, but what I know goes  into making this happen is a lot of hard work, staff work, Member work,  a lot of big hearts, and a lot of big brains sitting down together  hashing through these issues.   This rule is worth supporting. The underlying legislation is worth  supporting, Mr. Speaker, and I ask all of my colleagues to do exactly  that.   The material previously referred to by Ms. Slaughter is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 504 Offered by Ms. Slaughter         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       3440) to authorize the cancellation of removal and adjustment       of status of certain individuals who are long-term United       States residents and who entered the United States as       children and for other purposes. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 3440.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is ENTITLED to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous  question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.
