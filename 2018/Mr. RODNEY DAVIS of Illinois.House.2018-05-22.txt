 Mr. Chairman, last August, 10 U.S. Navy  sailors were killed when the USS John S. McCain collided with a  commercial tanker off the coast of Singapore. One of those sailors was  Petty Officer Logan Palmer of Harristown, Illinois.   Logan's death was the first casualty from my district since I became  a Member of Congress, and let me tell you, it is an experience no one  prepares you for, and I pray no other family will have to go through  it.   While there is little we can do to lesson the grief of these  families, we can ensure they don't have to navigate a complicated  bureaucracy. I was a little miffed to learn that, if the body of a  servicemember who dies during noncombat operations is flown to Dover  Air Force Base, we do not automatically arrange and cover the travel  costs for their family like we would if that servicemember died in  combat.   This amendment requires the DOD to automatically arrange and cover  travel for family of noncombat service deaths just as they do for  combat operations, instead of making them get a waiver.   An outside organization covered the cost for the Palmer family, but I  think we can make this process easier and ensure these families are  taken care of by including this amendment.
