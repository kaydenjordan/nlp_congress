 Mr. President, I yield back.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.                            ____________________     Mr. President, recently, I was fortunate enough to have  the opportunity to host several veterans who survived the sinking of  the USS Arizona in the attack on Pearl Harbor.   I would like to briefly share an incredible story they told me about  a true American hero named Joe George.   On December 7, 1941, Joe was a 26-year-old Boatswain's Mate Second  Class aboard the repair ship USS Vestal in Pearl Harbor, HI, moored  alongside the USS Arizona.   At 7:48 a.m., many sailors, including Joe, had finished their  breakfast when the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service attacked Pearl  Harbor. As we know, the Arizona suffered a direct hit by a Japanese  bomb that detonated in the ship's powder magazine. The resulting  explosion sank the ship and claimed the lives of 1,177 servicemembers.   During the unimaginable chaos and carnage, Joe George displayed  stunning composure and courage. Joe spotted six sailors trapped in the  control tower of the sinking Arizona. These men were severely burned,  and they were searching for a way to safety. The six wounded sailors  were Seaman First Class Harold Kuhn, Seaman First Class Russell Lott,  Gunner's Mate Third Class Earl Riner, Boatswain's Mate Second  [[Page S4776]]  Class Alvin Dvorak, Seaman First Class Donald Stratton, and Fire  Controlman Third Class Lauren Bruner.   Upon seeing the men, Joe threw a heaving line between the Vestal and  the Arizona to rescue the wounded sailors from the sinking ship.  Suspended 40 feet in the air, the six sailors climbed 70 feet hand over  hand across the rope to safety onboard the Vestal. These sailors did  all this while enduring injuries so severe that two would succumb to  their wounds in the weeks following the attack.   As they struggled across the heavy line, Joe George remained close  by, all the while encouraging the men to push on.   The four sailors who survived their injuries each returned to serve  with honor during World War II and then went on to live long lives.   I spoke with two of them, and hearing about the injuries they had and  that they still were able to return to service in the Second World War  was amazing.   Joe George's legacy of heroism will remain alive forever in the  children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren of the four sailors  who survived the infamous day, thanks to Joe George.   Joe George was never awarded a medal for his role in the rescue of  the six sailors, although his commanding officer commended his  courageous actions. When I met with one of the Arizona survivors who  was rescued by Joe, he told me, ``Joe George was never awarded anything  for his bravery. He is no longer with us, but I believe in his memory  he should be awarded the Navy Cross.''   Lauren Bruner was another survivor whom Joe saved. He said to me:         The six of us would not have survived except for his       courage, in spite of being at high risk himself. He fully       deserves high commendations for his actions. I feel he should       be recognized for this courage and presented the Navy Cross.    In his own words, during an interview in 1978, Joe said: ``I'll tell  you, the only thing I could tell you about that day . . . my conscience  was my guide.''   Well, his conscience was that of a hero. We need more people like Joe  George in this world. That is why I am committed to honoring Joe and  why I rise today with the honor and privilege to submit a resolution  honoring Joseph Leon George.   Joe passed away in 1996, and it is long overdue that the Senate, the  U.S. Navy, and a grateful nation honor the heroism of Boatswain's Mate  Second Class Joseph Leon George.   God bless Joe George, whose immense and astounding composure serves  as an example of the men and women in uniform who follow in his wake.  Let us never forget his heroism and sacrifice.   I would like to also thank my colleagues Senators Gardner, Lee,  Cotton, McCaskill, and Bennet for joining me on this resolution. I look  forward to working with them on its swift adoption.                            ____________________
