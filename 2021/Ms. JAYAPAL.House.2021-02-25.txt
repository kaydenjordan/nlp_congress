 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  Equality Act.   I am the proud mom of a trans kid. I will fight every single day for  every trans person, every LGBTQ person, including my kid, to explore  and express the fullness of their gender without fear or risk of being  fired, denied housing, or refused service because of their sexual  orientation or gender identity.   Mr. Speaker, in 2020, over one in three LGBTQ Americans faced  discrimination, including over three in five transgender Americans. In  the midst of a pandemic, nearly 3 in 10 LGBTQ Americans faced  difficulties accessing medical care, including over half of transgender  Americans.   The Equality Act guarantees protection under the law, no matter who  you love or your gender identity. It was President Abraham Lincoln who  said those who deny freedom for others deserve it not for themselves.   So today, as we pass the Equality Act, we vote ``aye'' for Janak, for  Evie, for so many thousands more of our kids.    We say to every LGBTQ person: We see you. We hear you.
