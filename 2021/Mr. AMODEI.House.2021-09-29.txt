 Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of the life and  memory of my friend, Major General Robert T. Herbert, of the Nevada  Army National Guard.   An adopted Nevadan, Bob began a 42-year career in the U.S. Army in  1975 at the age of 18. After serving along the East-West German border,  Bob moved to Nevada as a test pilot at the age of 25. Later in his  career, Bob served as senior policy adviser and director of  appropriations for Senator Harry Reid, from 2001 to 2017.   Bob loved anything with a loud engine, having accrued more than 7,000  flight hours as a pilot of both fixed and rotary-wing aircraft. He  loved to ride his collection of motorcycles, took great pride in his  customized truck, and was in the process of rebuilding a Pontiac  Firebird.   Both as a civilian and a soldier, Bob was respected and admired by  anyone he interacted with, myself included. Simply put, Bob Herbert was  an all-American consensus at everything he tried.   I offer my condolences to his wife, Karen, his parents and family,  and anyone else who was lucky enough to call him a friend, including  you, Madam Speaker. We will miss you, General.                            ____________________
