 Mr. Speaker, let me thank the ranking member, Mr.  Brady, and acknowledge his longstanding leadership and friendship, and  as well the work that he does with the chairman and for his leadership  as well.   This is a highlight on the floor of the House for the bipartisanship  that it represents, the tone of which we are speaking, even though we  know that this is a matter of urgency and we have seen the telling of  situations that none of us would want to see repeated.   And forgive me for using more of a most recent set of circumstances  just to capture the intensity of the moment, and that is, of course,  the recent trial with a conspicuous and vile sex offender to the 200- plus young women athletes.   Now, this is not the circumstances here in the House of  Representatives, but I think it captures the intensity of silence,  because those young women had to live or thought that that was what  they were obligated to do because they wanted to achieve greatness in  their field, and they were stopped by the wall of silence and,  therefore, could not find relief. The courts have finally given them  relief, but through an enormity of pain.   I think it is important for the congressional standards to be such  that it sets a wide net across the Nation to be able to ensure that the  wall of silence is broken.   Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 4924, to amend the Congressional  Accountability Act of 1995 to reform the procedures provided under such  Act for the initiation, investigation, and resolution of claims  alleging that employing offices of the legislative branch have violated  the rights and protections provided to their employees under such Act,  including protection against sexual harassment, and for other purposes.   Mr. Speaker, this bill will provide a broader subpoena authority to  the Office of Compliance, which adjudicates workplace disputes, and as  well it would expand protections in other areas of antidiscrimination.   Let me say that this is a positive statement made by all of us, and I  ask my colleagues to support H.R. 4924.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support for H.R. 4924, the  ``Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 Reform Act,'' legislation to  amend the Congressional Accountability Act (CAA) of 1995 to reform the  procedures provided under such Act for the initiation, investigation,  and resolution of claims alleging that employing offices of the  legislative branch have violated the rights and protections provided to  their employees under such Act, including protections against sexual  harassment, and for other purposes.   Legislative branch employees who allege sexual harassment or other  workplace violations could use an accelerated claims process under H.R.  4924.   The bill would amend the 1995 Congressional Accountability Act (CAA;  Public Law 104-1).   I celebrate and congratulate Jackie Speier and the women members of  Congress who stood up. Thanks again to the Ranking Member and Chairman  of the House Administration Committee.   The amendments include:   Eliminating a requirement for counseling and mediation before a  legislative staffer could file a civil action in a U.S. district court;   Requiring members of Congress to pay for settlements and awards if  they're the alleged offender;   Giving broader subpoena authority to the Office of Compliance (OOC),  which adjudicates workplace disputes for most legislative branch  offices;   Requiring the OOC to publish more information on claims, awards, and  settlement payments and reimbursements from lawmakers;   The measure follows recent accusations that lawmakers sexually  harassed or otherwise mistreated employees.  [[Page H809]]    Some of those cases went through the OOC process and resulted in  resignations and taxpayer-funded settlements.   The OOC approved more than $17 million in awards and settlements from  fiscal 1997 through 2017.   Many of those cases originated outside of member-led congressional  offices and didn't involve alleged sexual harassment.   The House is also slated to consider a separate resolution (H. Res.  724) that would apply only to House offices and employees.   That measure would establish an office to provide House employees  with free legal assistance during the OOC process, and would bar the  Office of Congressional Ethics from investigating an alleged workplace  violation once a staffer files a claim with the OOC.   These comprehensive reforms will provide a positive change of culture  within the Congress, and improve the overall process of both preventing  and reporting any harassment in the future.   The CAA requires congressional and other legislative offices, such as  the Congressional Budget Office, to comply with about a dozen workplace  protections that apply to private-sector and executive branch  employees.   For instance, the 1964 Civil Rights Act bars discrimination based on  factors such as race, religion, and sex.   The Supreme Court has held that the law also prohibits sexual  harassment in the workplace.   Some CAA provisions don't apply to offices such as the Library of  Congress (LOC), whose employees are covered by other laws and  procedures.   To seek relief for certain workplace violations specified in the CAA,  a legislative employee must go through a multistep OOC process.   Within 180 days of an alleged violation, the employee must bring it  to the attention of the OOC to initiate a 30-day counseling phase and  be informed of his or her rights.   The OOC doesn't notify the employing office unless the employee  waives confidentiality.   An employee can participate by phone and be represented by someone  else.   If a claim isn't resolved during the counseling phase and the  employee wishes to keep pursuing it, he or she must file a request for  mediation, which lasts at least 30 days and can be extended for an  additional period.   Materials prepared for mediation are kept confidential, though an  employee can still discuss the allegations publicly, according to  December 2017 testimony from OOC Executive Director Susan Tsui  Grundmann.   If a resolution can't be reached through mediation, the employee can  file a confidential administrative complaint with the OOC or a public  civil action in a U.S. district court.   Either filing has to be made within 90 days after mediation ends,  though the employee must wait at least 30 days during a ``cooling off''  period.   OOC-appointed hearing officers are authorized to issue subpoenas to  investigate the allegations.   An employee can appeal a hearing officer's decision to the OOC board  and then to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.   For most legislative branch offices, including congressional offices,  settlements are paid from an account in the Treasury general fund.   The bill would still require employees to file a claim with the OOC  within 180 days of an alleged violation. The measure, however, would  allow an employee to file a civil action in a U.S. district court  within 45 days, which would end the OOC investigation.   Otherwise, the matter would go through a revised OOC process.   At the outset, the OOC would inform the employee of his or her rights  and notify the head of the employing office.   Employees could also contact the OOC before filing a claim to learn  about their rights.   The OOC general counsel's investigative authority is limited to  certain types of claims, such as alleged violations of the Occupational  Safety and Health Act.   The bill would expand that authority to cover a wider range of  claims, including alleged discrimination or harassment under the Civil  Rights Act.   The general counsel could issue subpoenas regardless of whether a  party requests one.   The bill would express the sense of Congress that subpoenas should be  issued only if other methods are insufficient.   The general counsel would have to finish the investigation within 120  days.   The OOC would have to conduct an administrative hearing if the  general counsel finds reasonable cause to believe there was a  violation, or if the general counsel is unable to make a determination.   If the general counsel finds no reasonable cause to believe a  violation occurred, the employee would be notified that he or she could  still file a civil action within 90 days.   The general counsel could also recommend mediation, and the parties  could file a joint request for mediation at any time.   The bill would allow an employee to request mediation meetings in  which the parties are separated.   Any investigative reports concerning allegations of discrimination or  retaliation by members of Congress would be referred to the House and  Senate Ethics committees.   The OOC would also refer claims to the committees if there's a final  disposition--such as a settlement or final decision by the OOC or a  court--in a case involving a lawmaker or a senior staffer.   The bill would require current and former members of Congress to  reimburse the government if an employee receives an award or settlement  for the member's alleged act of discrimination or retaliation.   Funds could be withheld from the member's salary or retirement  account if he or she doesn't meet payment deadlines specified in the  bill.   The OOC would have to notify members as soon as a claim is filed that  they may be required to provide reimbursement.   The member could intervene in a mediation, hearing, or civil action  to contest an award or settlement, though the employee who filed the  claim couldn't be subject to an additional deposition.   Non-congressional legislative offices would also have to reimburse  the government for certain award or settlement payments.   The filing and investigation of a claim would be kept confidential,  though an employee or employing office could disclose claim information  during a proceeding.   The bill would also clarify that information discussed or disclosed  during mediation would remain confidential, without barring the parties  from talking about the underlying allegations.   An office could allow an employee to work remotely or grant the  employee a paid leave of absence while a claim is pending.   The provisions wouldn't override the terms of a collective bargaining  agreement for the office.   The bill would rename the OOC as the ``Office of Congressional  Workplace Rights'' and make other changes to the office.   The office publishes annual reports with statistics on employee  contacts with the office, the basis of their claims, and the results of  proceedings.   The bill would require the office to publish semiannual reports  listing each award and settlement in the previous year related to a  wide range of CAA workplace claims if the money comes from the Treasury  account.   The reports would have to specify the employing offices, award  amounts, and alleged violations.   They would also have to indicate whether members of Congress made  reimbursements resulting from cases of alleged discrimination.   Reports couldn't include the names or positions of employees who  filed a claim.   Within 30 days of the bill's enactment, the office would have to  publish a report on all previous payments related specifically to  discrimination claims if the payment involved any public funds.   That report would have to indicate the amount paid and the source of  public funds, including a House or Senate office account, though it  couldn't identify the specific office.   The OOC would also have to establish an electronic system to receive  and keep track of claims, and use the system to provide Congress with  semiannual reports on the time required to resolve claims.   The OOC would collect information from employing offices, including  the Library of Congress, every two years on their workplace environment  and attitudes regarding sexual harassment.   All responses would be anonymous and confidential.   The OOC would consult with Congress on survey procedures and  methodologies and share the survey results.   The office would have to create a program to permanently retain  records of investigations, mediations, hearings, and other proceedings.   The Government Accountability Office would report to Congress on OOC  management practices and cybersecurity.   The bill would expand certain protections--including  antidiscrimination provisions--to cover employees at the LOC, as well  as unpaid legislative branch interns, detailees, and fellows.   Because of these clarifications and expanded protections included in  H.R. 4924, I stand in support of this bill and urge my colleagues to  join me.    I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I associate myself, and I think it is important for my  colleagues and the American people to know, that this body, this  government, this Congress, is controlled by one party: the Presidency,  the House, and the Senate. Just a few minutes ago, the President of the  United States called for a shutdown. I am shocked. I am not calling for  anything but relief.   I am delighted that the gentleman from Dallas was able to craft a  support system for infusion therapy, but it goes to show you who  controls this place. I don't know what Democrat could get any additions  to this particular CR. It is not an appropriation. It is not an  authorization bill.   I am just on the floor begging for what my colleagues, both  Republicans and Democrats from Texas, have been asking for but my  Republican House has not been able to produce, or the Senate. When I  say that, we have not been able to produce a disaster supplemental bill  that is going to respond to the needs of those who are still suffering.   Harris County covers 1,778 square miles. It can fit New York City,  Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago, Seattle, Austin, and Dallas, with room  still to spare; 41,500 square miles of land mass impacted by Hurricane  Harvey and the subsequent flooding that covered an area larger than the  States of Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and  Vermont, combined. This is not puffery. It is to show you the depth of  devastation.   Hurricane Harvey dropped 21 trillion gallons of water on Texas and  Louisiana, most of it on the Houston metroplex. 51.88 inches of rain  fell near Cedar Bayou, and at the peak, on September 1, one-third of  Houston was underwater.   Our headlines: Hurricane Harvey Recovery Goes Ignored in Washington  Yet Again; Republicans Controlling Every Phase of Government; After  Harvey, Houstonians Eye Long Road to Recovery; After Harvey,  Houstonians Have Long Road; Houses Down on the Ground; Long Road to  Recovery; Senior Citizens Suffering; Suffering from Health Conditions.   And you can see, here is the basic point: There is no reason why  Republicans joining with Democrats cannot, one, have an $81 billion  supplemental that goes up. It is not enough. But it is the  administration that has cut into our very life by giving us a skinny  disaster aid supplemental. I am looking for the Senate to plus it up  because this is not enough.   In this bill, if you want to know why we are voting ``no,'' it  doesn't exist. Where is the disaster emergency supplemental money that  is needed?    I left my office with six members of local officials in my office.  They were telling me about the depression of so many in Texas who do  not have the resources. They don't have the housing money. The  infrastructure money has not come. Mold is there. They have bad health.   And these are examples of their situation. This is what the rescues  look like. This is, of course, what the water looked like. And this  gentleman was walking in the water.    This is a house that is evidenced by those impacted  by the hurricane. This is a house of someone who is still waiting for  that house to be rebuilt.   Finally, the city council, wanting to be responsive--and I thank  them--has lifted the permitting to allow trailers. Our people are  begging now for trailers. Most people don't beg for trailers. We are  begging for trailers in urban Houston because people have nowhere to  live.   This is a disgrace. I am not making this personal, but we flooded on  August 27. It is now, today, February 6. There is no reason why this  Republican administration has not been able to work. And all these  additional addendums on this CR should have been done in a bipartisan  effort.   We support infusion therapy. We support federally qualified health  clinics. But you are taking money from prevention. We support CHIP, but  you are taking money from prevention and other things. This is not the  way to do, one, spending; it is not the way to provide for national  security; it is not the way to provide for the Environmental Protection  Agency, the Department of State, Department of Justice, law  enforcement. We are not doing any of that.                                time  1600    And then there are 140,000 DREAMers in my State. Some of them are  impacted by Hurricane Harvey. And let me make mention of the Virgin  Islands, Puerto Rico, Florida, and California. I am not in any way  diminishing their pain. They are likewise suffering.   So if the American people want to know what the ``noes'' are about,  the ``noes'' are because those who are in charge are not doing  anything.   By the way, DREAMers are part of those who sought to rescue many who  were stranded in Houston. We lost a DREAMer who traveled all the way  from Dallas to provide rescue and he died. He died because he loved  this country. He died because he loved his neighbors.   Yet we cannot get that fixed, but we cannot help our neighbors get  the dollars that they need. If you want to know why there is a ``no''  vote, it is because it is long overdue for our friends to do the real  work that needs to be done, and to do disaster supplemental funding and  do it right.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record two articles from the Houston  Chronicle.                [From the Houston Chronicle, Oct. 26, 2017]  Houston ISD Schools With Most Displaced Students After Hurricane Harvey                              (By Shelby Webb)         More than 1300 Houston ISD students are displaced or       homeless after Hurricane Harvey, according to records the       district submitted to the Texas Education Agency.        That number is likely to change after the TEA changed how       districts should categorize displaced students and as Houston       ISD shores up its own internal estimates. But initial data       shows four of the 10 schools with the largest numbers of       displaced students are located in Southwest Houston, three in       Meyerland alone.        Two magnet schools--Carnegie Vanguard High School and Lamar       High School--also saw large numbers of their students       affected by Harvey's floods.        Houston ISD Superintendent Richard Carranza required that       all teachers go through crisis and trauma training during the       first semester of the year to better help students who are       dealing with Harvey-related fears and losses.        Across the Houston area, more than 10,700 students have       been displaced by Hurricane Harvey, according to data       reported to the TEA and given to the Chronicle by 16 local       school districts. But that number does not include estimates       for how many students are displaced in some of the area's       largest school districts, including the Cypress-Fairbanks,       Spring and Pearland ISDs.        Katy ISD had the most students affected by the storm with       2,862. Tiny Stafford MSD had the least, with 32 students       displaced by the storm.                                   ____                  [From the Houston Chronicle, Dec. 6, 2017]             Top Health Official Views Harvey Recovery Efforts                            (By Mike Hixenbaugh)         Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald, the head of the federal Centers for       Disease Control and Prevention, spent most of the day       receiving briefings from officials at Harris County Public       Health, which has been on the front lines helping residents       cope following the historic flooding.        Later, Fitzgerald visited a mobile wellness unit in Galena       Park, where county health  [[Page H828]]       workers provided residents of the flood-ravaged community in       southeast Harris County with free immunizations, cleaning       supplies, bug spray, canned food and other services.        Now Playing: Level of help to expect for Harvey flood       recovery        Harris County dispatched the mobile health units to more 3o       locations in the weeks following the hurricane, part of a       broader effort to help residents care for themselves in the       midst of the devastation. Fitzgerald said she's been       monitoring the county's efforts closely and wanted to see       them firsthand.        ``I wanted to come and see how it's going,'' Fitzgerald       said, ``and also to see what else we can do to make sure       Houston recovers totally.''        Although Harvey's true toll on public health is still being       calculated, Fitzgerald said the CDC is committed to providing       Texas with whatever resources are needed to grapple with the       aftermath.        The visit comes days after the Kaiser Family Foundation       released a sweeping survey that found 17 percent of those who       had houses damaged or suffered income loss reported that       someone in their household has developed a new or worsening       health condition.        Chronic respiratory ailments resulting from mold and       stress-related mental health struggles are of particular       concern after flooding, health officials said, as well as the       threat of mosquito-borne illnesses and other infectious       diseases.        Fitzgerald said she was impressed by the resiliency of       residents and public health workers she met, some of whom       manned mobile health clinics just days after losing their       homes to flooding.        ``The work goes on,'' Fitzgerald said.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in opposition to Rules Committee Print  115-58, legislation extending the Continuing Resolution now in effect  for an additional five weeks, or until March 23, 2018.   But before I proceed further, I want to note--and Americans needs to  know--that this is not a spending bill; it is instead an affirmation of  the House Republicans' inability to govern.   This is the fifth time House Republicans have chosen to kick the can  down the road rather than work with Democrats to come to a necessary  bipartisan agreement to lift the Budget Control Act (BCA) spending  caps, giving appropriators the direction they need for full-year  funding bills.   The reason given for passing each of the prior Continuing Resolutions  was that the extra time was needed to reach a comprehensive agreement  to fund government operations in a fair and balanced way.   Yet, even with the extra time, House Republicans made no progress  during any of the previous extensions.   This should not be surprising; the House GOP is carrying the water  for the president, who a few months ago said ``we need a big beautiful  shutdown.''   Mr. Speaker, I cannot support a CR that does not include full funding  for disaster recovery, extends additional health access for veterans,  provides funding to combat the opioid epidemic, and protects pensions.   Most important, it is outrageous that House Republicans would bring  to the floor and request support for a fifth CR extension that does not  address and resolve the crisis the Republican Administration has  inflicted on 800,000 Dreamers and their families, including 124,000  Dreamers in my home state of Texas.   Instead of acting responsibly to address these issues and fund the  government for the remainder of the fiscal year, House Republicans  continue wasting time.   This is not appropriations; this is a stop-gap funding measure to  save ourselves from collapse.   Although the funding bill before us makes a feeble attempt to address  numerous expired or expiring health priorities, it fails to reauthorize  several key programs including the Maternal Infant and Early Childhood  Home Visiting (MIECHV) and Health Professional Opportunity Grant (HPOG)  programs.   Just as bad, this legislation is paid for the package with partisan  offsets, such as cuts to the Prevention and Public Health Fund before  ending the Prevention and Public Health Fund in 2027.   Mr. Speaker, another reason that this bill should be passed in its  present form is that it includes the same Department of Defense  appropriations bill that the House passed on January 30, 2018, which  increases defense spending by $73 billion more than the $549 billion  allowed under the current BCA defense cap and provides $75 billion in  additional discretionary funding designated for Overseas Contingency  Operations (OCO).   As a consequence, if this bill becomes law it would eliminate any  chance for a bipartisan budget cap agreement for this year.   For months, Democrats have sought an agreement on the discretionary  spending caps that provides parity for both defense and non-defense  appropriations bills, both of which are critical to our nation's  security.   Rather than negotiate a cap agreement that would pave the way for a  defense appropriations bill to become law, Republicans are placing a  bill on the floor that will exempt itself from the BCA defense cap's  sequestration.   This bill is the fifth example of Republicans rejecting bipartisan  compromise.   Mr. Speaker, despite controlling the House, Senate, and the White  House, Republicans have not funded the government for the entire year,  even though we are already four months into the fiscal year.   Democrats, meanwhile, have done the work with which we were tasked.   I am a member of the Budget committee and we Democrats proposed a  budget that:   1. Respected the needs of all Americans, including those who serve  bravely in the Department of Defense;   2. Honored the sacrifice of our heroes in uniform;   3. Protected programs like CHIP, made investments in infrastructure  and ensured that Americans have access to quality healthcare.   Because Republicans refuse to work with Democrats and compromise on  how to provide relief from the BCA's sequester level spending caps,  they are lurching from CR to CR--degrading the readiness of our  military and preventing government agencies from properly serving the  American people.   This is not a responsible way to govern; therefore, I cannot support  this bill, especially when there still remains millions of Americans  still coping with the devastating effects of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma,  and Maria in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands,  and wildfires in California.   The nine-county Houston metro area impacted by Hurricane Harvey  covers 9,444 square miles, an area larger than five states, including  New Hampshire, New Jersey and Connecticut.   Harris County covers 1,778 square miles, enough space to fit New York  City, Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago, Seattle, Austin and Dallas, with  room still to spare.   There was over 41,500 square miles of land mass impacted by Hurricane  Harvey and the subsequent flooding that covered an area larger than the  States of Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and  Vermont combined.   Hurricane Harvey dropped 21 trillion gallons of water on Texas and  Louisiana, most of it on the Houston Metroplex and the 51.88 inches of  rain that fell near Cedar Bayou is the highest total ever recorded for  a single U.S. weather event.   At its peak on September 1, 2017, one-third of Houston was  underwater.   At the peak on August 31, there were 34,575 evacuees in shelters  across Texas.   Hurricane Harvey is the largest housing disaster to strike the U.S.  in our nation's history.   Hurricane Harvey damaged 203,000 homes, of which 12,700 were  destroyed.   Mr. Speaker, people are living in homes with mold.   As recently as this past November, nearly 19,000 hotel rooms in over  1,500 hotels were still occupied by persons displaced by Hurricane  Harvey.   Thousands of others with severe damage to their homes are living with  family or friends.   889,425 people have registered for assistance with the Federal  Emergency Management Agency.   As of December 5, 2017, more than 632,000 individuals or households  in metro Houston had submitted valid registrations for FEMA's  Individual and Households Program (IHP) and 249,259 registrations were  approved for $1.0 billion in assistance.   And because of Republican unwillingness to compromise or govern  competently, disaster victims in my congressional district and all  across the affected areas are still waiting for the disaster funding  assistance they desperately need.   House Republicans need to work across the aisle with Democrats and  get our work done--including. upholding the long-standing precedent of  agreeing to parity when providing relief from sequester caps.    Will the gentleman yield?    The gentleman, we have worked together.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I think the important point is that this has to be a collective  effort of the administration and the bodies of the House and the  Senate. The only point that I would make is that the administration has  not sent forward--yes, the $81 billion--but we are not moving it in the  Senate.   The administration has not been engaged actively to say that they  want to help the people who are impacted, and they have a skinny impact  or skinny impression of what we need of $81 billion for all of the  disaster areas.   And, of course, Mr. Sessions, my good friend, understands that $1  trillion tax cut does not help us in getting the increased disaster  money.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a sense of sadness  but with joyful noise, if you will, to celebrate Mrs. Emma Primas, 112  years old, who passed away last month in the arms of the comforting  Lord and her family.   Mrs. Primas was a historic figure. She was someone who lived through  the suffragette movement; lived through World War I; was a street car  operator in San Francisco; the head of nutrition for the schools of San  Francisco; a businessowner in Houston, Texas, where she owned a store  and was able to provide for others who could not pay for the food.   She paid poll tax to vote. She provided for her grandchildren. She  loved her wonderful daughter and her wonderful grandchildren. She  became an icon in our community. People flocked to her because she was  alert and bright, and she could tell us the history not only of her  life but of this Nation.   How wonderful it was for her to be able to vote for the first  African-American President. When I hosted her in Washington with  President Barack Obama, she said it was the greatest moment in her  life. Obviously, I know the love of her children was even greater, but  she was so excited.   And when, of course, she met the former Secretary of State Hillary  Clinton, she was rejoiceful as well.   To all of her wonderful grandchildren, I know that Saturday at the  Community of Faith, February 10, we will celebrate her life.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in a moment of silence in  honor of this great American, Mrs. Emma Primas, 112 years old. Though  she has gone home to glory, she has celebrated her life as a great  American and a great patriot.                            ____________________
