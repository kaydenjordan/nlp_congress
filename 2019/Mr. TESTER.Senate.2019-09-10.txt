 Madam President, I thank the chairman of the Committee on  Veterans' Affairs for his good work.   Jim Byrne is the right man for the job. We passed the VA MISSION Act  that needs to be implemented. I know Mr. Byrne has ruffled feathers  among some here. In the end, I think he will do the right thing and  that we can hold him accountable. It is critically important we get  these folks confirmed so we can hold them accountable and get them in  front of our committee. I would urge a ``yea'' vote on Jim Byrne.
