 Madam Speaker, I rise this evening to thank Chairwoman  Maxine Waters for including the Restoring Communities Left Behind Act  in her Housing is Infrastructure bill.   This legislation, led by Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib and myself,  would direct $5 billion toward programs for homeowner rehabilitation  assistance, weatherization, improved accessibility for seniors and  people with disabilities, refinancing, and property tax relief.   It will restore quality housing in the cities I represent, such as  Toledo, Lorain, Sandusky, and Cleveland, which have suffered from  decades of job losses, recessions, the foreclosure crisis of 2008, and  chronic housing underinvestment.   Congress must serve as a partner to our on-the-ground organizations  and local leaders who know what resources are needed where and how best  to deploy them to revive their neighborhoods.   These investments will repair homes, stimulate economic growth, and  revitalize communities. I urge all of my colleagues to support its  passage, and I send my thanks to all who have helped us along this  really vital road.                            ____________________
