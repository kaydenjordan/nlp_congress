 Mr. Speaker, first, I extend my wishes and prayers to the  family of Senator Feinstein. Dianne Feinstein dedicated her life to  public service, and her passing is a profound loss for our State and  country.   I also congratulate Laphonza Butler on her appointment to the Senate  by Governor Newsom, and I say that with all sincerity. I harbor no ill  will in any form against Ms. Butler. She apparently wasn't even  expecting this appointment and only learned about it when she got a  call from the Governor, and she agreed to serve. She should be  commended for that.   I should say that there has been raised a question concerning whether  she meets the requirements to hold this office and to represent  California, given that apparently she is a registered voter in  Maryland. I trust that the Senate, which is responsible for judging the  qualifications of its Members, is taking that inquiry seriously.   I will say, however, that we need to, at this point, kind of pause to  reflect on the fact that if Ms. Butler is sworn in, which I believe she  is supposed to be sworn in today, California will now have two Senators  who gained their office not by the authority of voters but, rather, by  the whim of a single individual, Governor Gavin Newsom. We will have  two Senators who gained their office via appointment.                                time  1100    We also, by the way, have a Senator from New Jersey whose own  conference is calling on him to resign, which could create another  appointed Senator in the United States Senate.   This is very much contrary to the spirit of the 17th Amendment, which  calls for the direct election of Senators. When this amendment was  adopted, it was put in place, according to one scholarly article, to  replace a distrusted aristocratic regime of appointed Senators with one  of popular enfranchisement.   Indeed, since the 17th Amendment, which provided for the direct  election of Senators but allowed that governors could appoint Senators  still to fill vacancies, these appointments have been subject to all  manner of abuses. You have had instances of nepotism. Governors have  appointed their children. They have appointed their spouses. Some have  even appointed themselves to the U.S. Senate. Indeed, the appointment  that Governor Newsom has just made demonstrates the risks that are  inherent in an appointment system.   As one headline in today's San Francisco Chronicle reads: ``Newsom's  handling of Feinstein's replacement was a highlight reel of his  political flaws.'' The writer says that he twisted himself into  rhetorical pretzels over the last 2 years because he looked at this  appointment through the lens of what is going to help his Presidential  aspirations as opposed to what is going to be best for the State of  California.   As long as 2 years ago, Governor Newsom made statements about who he  might appoint in the event of a vacancy. Then just a few weeks ago, he  said he was going to appoint an interim Senator. Then a couple days  ago, he walked back that statement and said, no, the person would be  free to run for reelection.   This is just not the sort of dynamic that ought to influence who is  going to hold a position as important as being the United States  Senator from California.   I should also add that it is quite unfair to the candidates who have  been running to hold this position in 2024, three of whom currently  serve in the House, who have been very actively campaigning and now  face the prospect of running against an incumbent who didn't actually  have to get to that office and face voters in order to get there.   For this House, the House of Representatives, every single person who  walks onto the floor of this House is there by the authority of voters,  is there having been elected. There is no reason why it shouldn't be  the same in the United States Senate.   I have introduced H. Res. 57. This is a constitutional amendment that  will simply say that in order to be a United States Senator, just as to  be a United States Representative, you have to get there by an election  of the people. If this really is a government of, by, and for the  people, as Lincoln put it, then we should make sure that those who are  here at this Capitol making important decisions on behalf of the people  are there because the people chose them to be so.                            ____________________
