It is the sense of Congress that--  [[Page H1554]]         (1) honoring current national space commitments and       building upon investments in space across successive       Administrations demonstrates clear continuity of purpose by       the United States, in collaboration with its international,       academic, and industry partners, to extend humanity's reach       into deep space, including cis-lunar space, the Moon, the       surface and moons of Mars, and beyond;        (2) NASA leaders can best leverage investments in the       United States space program by continuing to develop a       balanced portfolio for space exploration and space science,       including continued development of the Space Launch System,       Orion, Commercial Crew Program, space and planetary science       missions such as the James Webb Space Telescope, Wide-Field       Infrared Survey Telescope, and Europa mission, and ongoing       operations of the ISS and Commercial Resupply Services       Program;        (3) a national, government-led space program that builds on       current science and exploration programs, advances human       knowledge and capabilities, and opens the frontier beyond       Earth for ourselves, commercial enterprise, and science, and       with our international partners, is of critical importance to       our national destiny and to a future guided by United States       values and freedoms;        (4) continuity of purpose and effective execution of core       NASA programs are essential for efficient use of resources in       pursuit of timely and tangible accomplishments;        (5) NASA could improve its efficiency and effectiveness by       working with industry to streamline existing programs and       requirements, procurement practices, institutional footprint,       and bureaucracy while preserving effective program oversight,       accountability, and safety;        (6) it is imperative that the United States maintain and       enhance its leadership in space exploration and space       science, and continue to expand freedom and economic       opportunities in space for all Americans that are consistent       with the Constitution of the United States; and        (7) NASA should be a multi-mission space agency, and should       have a balanced and robust set of core missions in space       science, space technology, aeronautics, human space flight       and exploration, and education.       SEC. 202. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) Returns on the Nation's investments in science,       technology, and exploration accrue over decades-long       timeframes, and a disruption of such investments could       prevent returns from being fully realized.        (2) Past challenges to the continuity of such investments,       particularly threats regarding the cancellation of authorized       programs with bipartisan and bicameral support, have       disrupted completion of major space systems thereby--        (A) impeding planning and pursuit of national objectives in       space science and human space exploration;        (B) placing such investments in space science and space       exploration at risk; and        (C) degrading the aerospace industrial base.        (3) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration       Authorization Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-155; 119 Stat.       2895), National Aeronautics and Space Administration       Authorization Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-422; 122 Stat.       4779), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration       Authorization Act of 2010 (42 U.S.C. 18301 et seq.) reflect a       broad, bipartisan agreement on the path forward for NASA's       core missions in science, space technology, aeronautics,       human space flight and exploration, and education, that       serves as the foundation for the policy updates by this Act.        (4) Sufficient investment and maximum utilization of the       ISS and ISS National Laboratory with our international and       industry partners is--        (A) consistent with the goals and objectives of the United       States space program; and        (B) imperative to continuing United States global       leadership in human space exploration, science, research,       technology development, and education opportunities that       contribute to development of the next generation of American       scientists, engineers, and leaders, and to creating the       opportunity for economic development of low-Earth orbit.        (5) NASA has made measurable progress in the development       and testing of the Space Launch System and Orion exploration       systems with the near-term objectives of the initial       integrated test flight and launch in 2018, a human mission in       2021, and continued missions with an annual cadence in cis-      lunar space and eventually to the surface of Mars.        (6) The Commercial Crew Program has made measurable       progress toward reestablishing the capability to launch       United States government astronauts from United States soil       into low-Earth orbit by the end of 2018.        (7) The Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, in its 2015 Annual       Report, urged continuity of purpose noting concerns over the       potential for cost overruns and schedule slips that could       accompany significant changes to core NASA programs.      TITLE III--MAXIMIZING UTILIZATION OF THE ISS AND LOW-EARTH ORBIT       SEC. 301. OPERATION OF THE ISS.         (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) after 15 years of continuous human presence in low-      Earth orbit, the ISS continues to overcome challenges and       operate safely;        (2) the ISS is a unique testbed for future space       exploration systems development, including long-duration       space travel;        (3) the expansion of partnerships, scientific research, and       commercial applications of the ISS is essential to ensuring       the greatest return on investments made by the United States       and its international space partners in the development,       assembly, and operations of that unique facility;        (4) utilization of the ISS will sustain United States       leadership and progress in human space exploration by--        (A) facilitating the commercialization and economic       development of low-Earth orbit;        (B) serving as a testbed for technologies and a platform       for scientific research and development; and        (C) serving as an orbital facility enabling research upon--        (i) the health, well-being, and performance of humans in       space; and        (ii) the development of in-space systems enabling human       space exploration beyond low-Earth orbit; and        (5) the ISS provides a platform for fundamental,       microgravity, discovery-based space life and physical       sciences research that is critical for enabling space       exploration, protecting humans in space, increasing pathways       for commercial space development that depend on advances in       basic research, and contributes to advancing science,       technology, engineering, and mathematics research.        (b) Objectives.--The primary objectives of the ISS program       shall be--        (1) to achieve the long term goal and objectives under       section 202 of the National Aeronautics and Space       Administration Authorization Act of 2010 (42 U.S.C. 18312);       and        (2) to pursue a research program that advances knowledge       and provides other benefits to the Nation.        (c) Continuation of the ISS.--Section 501 of the National       Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of       2010 (42 U.S.C. 18351) is amended to read as follows:       ``SEC. 501. CONTINUATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION.         ``(a) Policy of the United States.--It shall be the policy       of the United States, in consultation with its international       partners in the ISS program, to support full and complete       utilization of the ISS through at least 2024.        ``(b) NASA Action.--In furtherance of the policy set forth       in subsection (a), NASA shall--        ``(1) pursue international, commercial, and       intragovernmental means to maximize ISS logistics supply,       maintenance, and operational capabilities, reduce risks to       ISS systems sustainability, and offset and minimize United       States operations costs relating to the ISS;        ``(2) utilize, to the extent practicable, the ISS for the       development of capabilities and technologies needed for the       future of human space exploration beyond low-Earth orbit; and        ``(3) utilize, if practical and cost effective, the ISS for       Science Mission Directorate missions in low-Earth orbit.''.       SEC. 302. TRANSPORTATION TO ISS.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds that reliance on foreign       carriers for United States crew transfer is unacceptable, and       the Nation's human space flight program must acquire the       capability to launch United States government astronauts on       vehicles using United States rockets from United States soil       as soon as is safe, reliable, and affordable to do so.        (b) Sense of Congress on Commercial Crew Program and       Commercial Resupply Services Program.--It is the sense of       Congress that--        (1) once developed and certified to meet the       Administration's safety and reliability requirements, United       States commercially provided crew transportation systems can       serve as the primary means of transporting United States       government astronauts and international partner astronauts to       and from the ISS and serving as ISS crew rescue vehicles;        (2) previous budgetary assumptions used by the       Administration in its planning for the Commercial Crew       Program assumed significantly higher funding levels than were       authorized and appropriated by Congress;        (3) credibility in the Administration's budgetary estimates       for the Commercial Crew Program can be enhanced by an       independently developed cost estimate;        (4) such credibility in budgetary estimates is an important       factor in understanding program risk;        (5) United States access to low-Earth orbit is paramount to       the continued success of the ISS and ISS National Laboratory;        (6) a stable and successful Commercial Resupply Services       Program and Commercial Crew Program are critical to ensuring       timely provisioning of the ISS and to reestablishing the       capability to launch United States government astronauts from       United States soil into orbit, ending reliance upon Russian       transport of United States government astronauts to the ISS       which has not been possible since the retirement of the Space       Shuttle program in 2011;        (7) NASA should build upon the success of the Commercial       Orbital Transportation Services Program and Commercial       Resupply Services Program that have allowed private sector       companies to partner with NASA to  [[Page H1555]]       deliver cargo and scientific experiments to the ISS since       2012;        (8) the 21st Century Launch Complex Program has enabled       significant modernization and infrastructure improvements at       launch sites across the United States to support NASA's       Commercial Resupply Services Program and other civil and       commercial space flight missions; and        (9) the 21st Century Launch Complex Program should be       continued in a manner that leverages State and private       investments to achieve the goals of that program.        (c) Reaffirmation.--Congress reaffirms--        (1) its commitment to the use of a commercially developed,       private sector launch and delivery system to the ISS for crew       missions as expressed in the National Aeronautics and Space       Administration Authorization Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-155;       119 Stat. 2895), the National Aeronautics and Space       Administration Authorization Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-422;       122 Stat. 4779), and the National Aeronautics and Space       Administration Authorization Act of 2010 (42 U.S.C. 18301 et       seq.); and        (2) the requirement under section 50111(b)(1)(A) of title       51, United States Code, that the Administration shall make       use of United States commercially provided ISS crew transfer       and crew rescue services to the maximum extent practicable.        (d) Use of Non-United States Human Space Flight       Transportation Capabilities.--Section 201(a) of the National       Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of       2010 (42 U.S.C. 18311(a)) is amended to read as follows:        ``(a) Use of Non-United States Human Space Flight       Transportation Services.--        ``(1) In general.--The Federal Government may not acquire       human space flight transportation services from a foreign       entity unless--        ``(A) no United States Government-operated human space       flight capability is available;        ``(B) no United States commercial provider is available;       and        ``(C) it is a qualified foreign entity.        ``(2) Definitions.--In this subsection:        ``(A) Commercial provider.--The term `commercial provider'       means any person providing human space flight transportation       services, primary control of which is held by persons other       than the Federal Government, a State or local government, or       a foreign government.        ``(B) Qualified foreign entity.--The term `qualified       foreign entity' means a foreign entity that is in compliance       with all applicable safety standards and is not prohibited       from providing space transportation services under other law.        ``(C) United states commercial provider.--The term `United       States commercial provider' means a commercial provider,       organized under the laws of the United States or of a State,       that is more than 50 percent owned by United States       nationals.        ``(3) Arrangements with foreign entities.--Nothing in this       subsection shall prevent the Administrator from negotiating       or entering into human space flight transportation       arrangements with foreign entities to ensure safety of flight       and continued ISS operations.''.

Subtitle C--Journey to Mars       SEC. 431. FINDINGS ON HUMAN SPACE EXPLORATION.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) In accordance with section 204 of the National       Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of       2010 (124 Stat. 2813), the National Academies of Sciences,       Engineering, and Medicine, through its Committee on Human       Spaceflight, conducted a review of the goals, core       capabilities, and direction of human space flight, and       published the findings and recommendations in a 2014 report       entitled, ``Pathways to Exploration: Rationales and       Approaches for a U.S. Program of Human Space Exploration''.        (2) The Committee on Human Spaceflight included leaders       from the aerospace, scientific, security, and policy       communities.        (3) With input from the public, the Committee on Human       Spaceflight concluded that many practical and aspirational       rationales for human space flight together constitute a       compelling case for continued national investment and pursuit       of human space exploration toward the horizon goal of Mars.        (4) According to the Committee on Human Spaceflight, the       rationales include economic benefits, national security,       national prestige, inspiring students and other citizens,       scientific discovery, human survival, and a sense of shared       destiny.        (5) The Committee on Human Spaceflight affirmed that Mars       is the appropriate long-term goal for the human space flight       program.        (6) The Committee on Human Spaceflight recommended that       NASA define a series of sustainable steps and conduct mission       planning and technology development as needed to achieve the       long-term goal of placing humans on the surface of Mars.        (7) Expanding human presence beyond low-Earth orbit and       advancing toward human missions to Mars requires early       planning and timely decisions to be made in the near-term on       the necessary courses of action for commitments to achieve       short-term and long-term goals and objectives.        (8) In addition to the 2014 report described in paragraph       (1), there are several independently developed reports or       concepts that describe potential Mars architectures or       concepts and identify Mars as the long-term goal for human       space exploration, including NASA's ``The Global Exploration       Roadmap'' of 2013, ``NASA's Journey to Mars-Pioneering Next       Steps in Space Exploration'' of 2015, NASA Jet Propulsion       Laboratory's ``Minimal Architecture for Human Journeys to       Mars'' of 2015, and Explore Mars' ``The Humans to Mars Report       2016''.       SEC. 432. HUMAN EXPLORATION ROADMAP.         (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) expanding human presence beyond low-Earth orbit and       advancing toward human missions to Mars in the 2030s requires       early strategic planning and timely decisions to be made in       the near-term on the necessary courses of action for       commitments to achieve short-term and long-term goals and       objectives;  [[Page H1559]]         (2) for strong and sustained United States leadership, a       need exists to advance a human exploration roadmap,       addressing exploration objectives in collaboration with       international, academic, and industry partners;        (3) an approach that incrementally advances toward a long-      term goal is one in which nearer-term developments and       implementation would influence future development and       implementation; and        (4) a human exploration roadmap should begin with low-Earth       orbit, then address in greater detail progress beyond low-      Earth orbit to cis-lunar space, and then address future       missions aimed at human arrival and activities near and then       on the surface of Mars.        (b) Human Exploration Roadmap.--        (1) In general.--The Administrator shall develop a human       exploration roadmap, including a critical decision plan, to       expand human presence beyond low-Earth orbit to the surface       of Mars and beyond, considering potential interim       destinations such as cis-lunar space and the moons of Mars.        (2) Scope.--The human exploration roadmap shall include--        (A) an integrated set of exploration, science, and other       goals and objectives of a United States human space       exploration program to achieve the long-term goal of human       missions near or on the surface of Mars in the 2030s;        (B) opportunities for international, academic, and industry       partnerships for exploration-related systems, services,       research, and technology if those opportunities provide cost-      savings, accelerate program schedules, or otherwise benefit       the goals and objectives developed under subparagraph (A);        (C) sets and sequences of precursor missions in cis-lunar       space and other missions or activities necessary--        (i) to demonstrate the proficiency of the capabilities and       technologies identified under subparagraph (D); and        (ii) to meet the goals and objectives developed under       subparagraph (A), including anticipated timelines and       missions for the Space Launch System and Orion;        (D) an identification of the specific capabilities and       technologies, including the Space Launch System, Orion, a       deep space habitat, and other capabilities, that facilitate       the goals and objectives developed under subparagraph (A);        (E) a description of how cis-lunar elements, objectives,       and activities advance the human exploration of Mars;        (F) an assessment of potential human health and other       risks, including radiation exposure;        (G) mitigation plans, whenever possible, to address the       risks identified in subparagraph (F);        (H) a description of those technologies already under       development across the Federal Government or by other       entities that facilitate the goals and objectives developed       under subparagraph (A);        (I) a specific process for the evolution of the       capabilities of the fully integrated Orion with the Space       Launch System and a description of how these systems       facilitate the goals and objectives developed under       subparagraph (A) and demonstrate the capabilities and       technologies described in subparagraph (D);        (J) a description of the capabilities and technologies that       need to be demonstrated or research data that could be gained       through the utilization of the ISS and the status of the       development of such capabilities and technologies;        (K) a framework for international cooperation in the       development of all capabilities and technologies identified       under this section, including an assessment of the risks       posed by relying on international partners for capabilities       and technologies on the critical path of development;        (L) a process for partnering with nongovernmental entities       using Space Act Agreements or other acquisition instruments       for future human space exploration; and        (M) include information on the phasing of planned       intermediate destinations, Mars mission risk areas and       potential risk mitigation approaches, technology requirements       and phasing of required technology development activities,       the management strategy to be followed, related ISS       activities, planned international collaborative activities,       potential commercial contributions, and other activities       relevant to the achievement of the goal established in this       section.        (3) Considerations.--In developing the human exploration       roadmap, the Administrator shall consider--        (A) using key exploration capabilities, namely the Space       Launch System and Orion;        (B) using existing commercially available technologies and       capabilities or those technologies and capabilities being       developed by industry for commercial purposes;        (C) establishing an organizational approach to ensure       collaboration and coordination among NASA's Mission       Directorates under section 821, when appropriate, including       to collect and return to Earth a sample from the Martian       surface;        (D) building upon the initial uncrewed mission, EM-1, and       first crewed mission, EM-2, of the Space Launch System and       Orion to establish a sustainable cadence of missions       extending human exploration missions into cis-lunar space,       including anticipated timelines and milestones;        (E) developing the robotic and precursor missions and       activities that will demonstrate, test, and develop key       technologies and capabilities essential for achieving human       missions to Mars, including long-duration human operations       beyond low-Earth orbit, space suits, solar electric       propulsion, deep space habitats, environmental control life       support systems, Mars lander and ascent vehicle, entry,       descent, landing, ascent, Mars surface systems, and in-situ       resource utilization;        (F) demonstrating and testing 1 or more habitat modules in       cis-lunar space to prepare for Mars missions;        (G) using public-private, firm fixed-price partnerships,       where practicable;        (H) collaborating with international, academic, and       industry partners, when appropriate;        (I) any risks to human health and sensitive onboard       technologies, including radiation exposure;        (J) any risks identified through research outcomes under       the NASA Human Research Program's Behavioral Health Element;       and        (K) the recommendations and ideas of several independently       developed reports or concepts that describe potential Mars       architectures or concepts and identify Mars as the long-term       goal for human space exploration, including the reports       described under section 431.        (4) Critical decision plan on human space exploration.--As       part of the human exploration roadmap, the Administrator       shall include a critical decision plan--        (A) identifying and defining key decisions guiding human       space exploration priorities and plans that need to be made       before June 30, 2020, including decisions that may guide       human space exploration capability development, precursor       missions, long-term missions, and activities;        (B) defining decisions needed to maximize efficiencies and       resources for reaching the near, intermediate, and long-term       goals and objectives of human space exploration; and        (C) identifying and defining timelines and milestones for a       sustainable cadence of missions beginning with EM-3 for the       Space Launch System and Orion to extend human exploration       from cis-lunar space to the surface of Mars.        (5) Reports.--        (A) Initial human exploration roadmap.--The Administrator       shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress--        (i) an initial human exploration roadmap, including a       critical decision plan, before December 1, 2017; and        (ii) an updated human exploration roadmap periodically as       the Administrator considers necessary but not less than       biennially.        (B) Contents.--Each human exploration roadmap under this       paragraph shall include a description of--        (i) the achievements and goals accomplished in the process       of developing such capabilities and technologies during the       2-year period prior to the submission of the human       exploration roadmap; and        (ii) the expected goals and achievements in the following       2- year period.        (C) Submission with budget.--Each human exploration roadmap       under this section shall be included in the budget for that       fiscal year transmitted to Congress under section 1105(a) of       title 31, United States Code.       SEC. 433. ADVANCED SPACE SUIT CAPABILITY.         Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this       Act, the Administrator shall submit to the appropriate       committees of Congress a detailed plan for achieving an       advanced space suit capability that aligns with the crew       needs for exploration enabled by the Space Launch System and       Orion, including an evaluation of the merit of delivering the       planned suit system for use on the ISS.       SEC. 434. ASTEROID ROBOTIC REDIRECT MISSION.         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) NASA initially estimated that the Asteroid Robotic       Redirect Mission would launch in December 2020 and cost no       more than $1,250,000,000, excluding launch and operations.        (2) On July 15, 2016, NASA conducted its Key Decision       Point-B review of the Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission or       approval for Phase B in mission formulation.        (3) During the Key Decision Point-B review, NASA estimated       that costs have grown to $1,400,000,000 excluding launch and       operations for a launch in December 2021 and the agency must       evaluate whether to accept the increase or reduce the       Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission's scope to stay within the       cost cap set by the Administrator.        (4) In April 2015, the NASA Advisory Council--        (A) issued a finding that--        (i) high-performance solar electric propulsion will likely       be an important part of an architecture to send humans to       Mars; and        (ii) maneuvering a large test mass is not necessary to       provide a valid in-space test of a new solar electric       propulsion stage;        (B) determined that a solar electric propulsion mission       will contribute more directly to the goal of sending humans       to Mars if the mission is focused entirely on development and       validation of the solar electric propulsion stage; and        (C) determined that other possible motivations for       acquiring and maneuvering a boulder, such as asteroid science       and planetary defense, do not have value commensurate with       their probable cost.        (5) The Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission is competing for       resources with other critical exploration development       programs, including the Space Launch System, Orion,       commercial crew, and a habitation module.  [[Page H1560]]         (6) In 2014, the NASA Advisory Council recommended that       NASA conduct an independent cost and technical assessment of       the Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission.        (7) In 2015, the NASA Advisory Council recommended that       NASA preserve the following key objectives if the program       needed to be descoped:        (A) Development of high power solar electric propulsion.        (B) Ability to maneuver in a low gravity environment in       deep space.        (8) In January 2015 and July 2015, the NASA Advisory       Council expressed its concern to NASA about the potential for       growing costs for the program and highlighted that choices       would need to be made about the program's content.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the technological and scientific goals of the Asteroid       Robotic Redirect Mission have not been demonstrated to       Congress to be commensurate with the cost; and        (2) alternative missions may provide a more cost effective       and scientifically beneficial means to demonstrate the       technologies needed for a human mission to Mars that would       otherwise be demonstrated by the Asteroid Robotic Redirect       Mission.        (c) Evaluation and Report.--Not later than 180 days after       the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall--        (1) conduct an evaluation of--        (A) alternative approaches to the Asteroid Robotic Redirect       Mission for demonstrating the technologies and capabilities       needed for a human mission to Mars that would otherwise be       demonstrated by the Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission;        (B) the scientific and technical benefits of the       alternative approaches under subparagraph (A) to future human       space exploration compared to scientific and technical       benefits of the Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission;        (C) the commercial benefits of the alternative approaches       identified in subparagraph (A), including the impact on the       development of domestic solar electric propulsion technology       to bolster United States competitiveness in the global       marketplace; and        (D) a comparison of the estimated costs of the alternative       approaches identified in subparagraph (A); and        (2) submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a       report on the evaluation under paragraph (1), including any       recommendations.       SEC. 435. MARS 2033 REPORT.         (a) In General.--Not later than 120 days after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall contract with       an independent, non-governmental systems engineering and       technical assistance organization to study a Mars human space       flight mission to be launched in 2033.

Subtitle D--TREAT Astronauts Act       SEC. 441. SHORT TITLE.         This subtitle may be cited as the ``To Research, Evaluate,       Assess, and Treat Astronauts Act'' or the ``TREAT Astronauts       Act''.       SEC. 442. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) Human space exploration can pose significant challenges       and is full of substantial risk, which has ultimately claimed       the lives of 24 NASA astronauts serving in the line of duty.        (2) As United States government astronauts participate in       long-duration and exploration space flight missions they may       experience increased health risks, such as vision impairment,       bone demineralization, and behavioral health and performance       risks, and may be exposed to galactic cosmic radiation.       Exposure to high levels of radiation and microgravity can       result in acute and long-term health consequences that can       increase the risk of cancer and tissue degeneration and have       potential effects on the musculoskeletal system, central       nervous system, cardiovascular system, immune function, and       vision.        (3) To advance the goal of long-duration and exploration       space flight missions, United States government astronaut       Scott Kelly participated in a 1-year twins study in space       while his identical twin brother, former United States       government astronaut Mark Kelly, acted as a human control       specimen on Earth, providing an understanding of the       physical, behavioral, microbiological, and molecular reaction       of the human body to an extended period of time in space.        (4) Since the Administration currently provides medical       monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment for United States       government astronauts during their active employment, given       the unknown long-term health consequences of long-duration       space exploration, the Administration has requested statutory       authority from Congress to provide medical monitoring,       diagnosis, and treatment to former United States government       astronauts for psychological and medical conditions       associated with human space flight.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the United States should continue to seek the unknown       and lead the world in space exploration and scientific       discovery as the Administration prepares for long-duration       and exploration space flight in deep space and an eventual       mission to Mars;        (2) data relating to the health of astronauts will become       increasingly valuable to improving our understanding of many       diseases humans face on Earth;        (3) the Administration should provide the type of       monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment described in subsection       (a) only for conditions the Administration considers unique       to the training or exposure to the space flight environment       of United States government astronauts and should not require       any former United States Government astronauts to participate       in the Administration's monitoring;        (4) such monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment should not       replace a former United States government astronaut's private       health insurance;        (5) expanded data acquired from such monitoring, diagnosis,       and treatment should be used to tailor treatment, inform the       requirements for new space flight medical hardware, and       develop controls in order to prevent disease occurrence in       the astronaut corps; and        (6) the 340-day space mission of Scott Kelly aboard the       ISS--        (A) was pivotal for the goal of the United States for       humans to explore deep space and Mars as the mission       generated new insight into how the human body adjusts to       weightlessness, isolation, radiation, and the stress of long-      duration space flight; and        (B) will help support the physical and mental well-being of       astronauts during longer space exploration missions in the       future.

TITLE V--ADVANCING SPACE SCIENCE       SEC. 501. MAINTAINING A BALANCED SPACE SCIENCE PORTFOLIO.         (a) Sense of Congress on Science Portfolio.--Congress       reaffirms the sense of Congress that--        (1) a balanced and adequately funded set of activities,       consisting of research and analysis grant programs,       technology development, suborbital research activities, and       small, medium, and large space missions, contributes to a       robust and productive science program and serves as a       catalyst for innovation and discovery; and        (2) the Administrator should set science priorities by       following the guidance provided by the scientific community       through the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and       Medicine's decadal surveys.        (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to       ensure, to the extent practicable, a steady cadence of large,       medium, and small science missions.       SEC. 502. PLANETARY SCIENCE.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--        (1) Administration support for planetary science is       critical to enabling greater understanding of the solar       system and the origin of the Earth;        (2) the United States leads the world in planetary science       and can augment its success in that area with appropriate       international, academic, and industry partnerships;        (3) a mix of small, medium, and large planetary science       missions is required to sustain a steady cadence of planetary       exploration; and        (4) robotic planetary exploration is a key component of       preparing for future human exploration.        (b) Mission Priorities.--        (1) In general.--In accordance with the priorities       established in the most recent Planetary Science Decadal       Survey, the Administrator shall ensure, to the greatest       extent practicable, the completion of a balanced set of       Discovery, New Frontiers, and Flagship missions at the       cadence recommended by the most recent Planetary Science       Decadal Survey.        (2) Mission priority adjustments.--Consistent with the set       of missions described in paragraph (1), and while maintaining       the continuity of scientific data and steady development of       capabilities and technologies, the Administrator may seek, if       necessary, adjustments to mission priorities, schedule, and       scope in light of changing budget projections.       SEC. 503. JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the James Webb Space Telescope will--        (A) significantly advance our understanding of star and       planet formation, and improve our knowledge of the early       universe; and        (B) support United States leadership in astrophysics;        (2) consistent with annual Government Accountability Office       reviews of the James Webb Space Telescope program, the       Administrator should continue robust surveillance of the       performance of the James Webb Space Telescope project and       continue to improve the reliability of cost estimates and       contractor performance data and other major space flight       projects in order to enhance NASA's ability to successfully       deliver the James Webb Space Telescope on-time and within       budget;        (3) the on-time and on-budget delivery of the James Webb       Space Telescope is a high congressional priority; and        (4) the Administrator should ensure that integrated testing       is appropriately timed and sufficiently comprehensive to       enable potential issues to be identified and addressed early       enough to be handled within the James Webb Space Telescope's       development schedule and prior to its launch.       SEC. 504. WIDE-FIELD INFRARED SURVEY TELESCOPE.         (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (referred to       in this section as ``WFIRST'') mission has the potential to       enable scientific discoveries that will transform our       understanding of the universe; and        (2) the Administrator, to the extent practicable, should       make progress on the technologies and capabilities needed to       position the Administration to meet the objectives, as       outlined in the 2010 National Academies' Astronomy and       Astrophysics Decadal Survey, in a way that maximizes the       scientific productivity of meeting those objectives for the       resources invested.        (b) Continuity of Development.--The Administrator shall       ensure that the concept definition and pre-formulation       activities of the WFIRST mission continue while the James       Webb Space Telescope is being completed.       SEC. 505. MARS 2020 ROVER.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the Mars 2020 mission, to develop a Mars rover and to       enable the return of samples to Earth, should remain a       priority for NASA; and        (2) the Mars 2020 mission--        (A) should significantly increase our understanding of       Mars;        (B) should help determine whether life previously existed       on that planet; and  [[Page H1562]]         (C) should provide opportunities to gather knowledge and       demonstrate technologies that address the challenges of       future human expeditions to  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on S. 442, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the National Aeronautics and  Space Administration Transition Authorization Act of 2017. This  bipartisan and bicameral bill grew to maturity through many long and  serious discussions about the future of our Nation's space program.   I am encouraged by the bill's persistent emphasis on the continuity  of purpose and stability. It is crucial that we continue to support  NASA's ongoing human exploration efforts.   I am proud to note the inclusion of the To Research Evaluate, Assess,  and Treat Astronauts Act, better known as the TREAT Astronauts Act,  which will ensure that our Nation's astronauts receive support for  medical issues associated with their service. The language of this bill  is exactly the same as the TREAT Astronauts Act that was passed in the  House on December 7, 2016.   As a medical professional myself, I care deeply about this issue. I  am honored to have sponsored the original legislation, and am proud to  contribute to an important program that will support the brave men and  women of our astronaut corps. Outer space poses many medical  challenges. The human body simply is not designed to thrive in  microgravity, or weightlessness. We know that spending time in space is  risky. We want to understand the reasons why the TREAT Astronauts Act  will ensure the retention of our astronauts' medical data and help to  continue our research in aerospace medicine, while also providing our  astronauts with the medical care that they need and deserve after  risking so much in service to our country.   This bill continues support for the important work on the Space  Launch System, the Orion crew vehicle, and commercial cargo and crew  programs.  [[Page H1569]]                                     time  1815    The future of the International Space Station is another key topic  addressed in this legislation. We are committed to operating the ISS  until 2024. Beyond that date, however, maintaining NASA's current level  of support for the ISS will dramatically affect the rest of NASA's  portfolio, particularly in human spaceflight.   This bill opens the debate about how and under what circumstances  NASA's presence in low-Earth orbit can and should be continued beyond  2024. Balancing NASA's presence and low Earth orbit and beyond low  Earth orbit will require thoughtful and informed decisionmaking. My  hope is that NASA will explore unique partnerships that will maintain  NASA's ability to utilize low Earth orbit in an efficient manner by  leveraging private sector investment. This bill will help inform and  frame that imminent debate.   This bill also addresses NASA's facilities and infrastructure here on  Earth. NASA must develop a plan so that its labs, tools, facilities,  and infrastructure can support a robust exploration agenda. Right- sizing NASA's footprint is a longstanding challenge. We must maintain  critical capabilities but also find efficiencies where they may exist.   The bill before us would call on NASA to develop a policy to ensure  that NASA maintains infrastructure to support bold exploration. If NASA  determines that facilities are not necessary or could be transferred to  the private sector, the bill calls on NASA to do so in accordance with  a transparent and equitable process.   The bill also urges the administration to pursue a sensible policy on  termination liability so that NASA makes the best possible use of  taxpayer dollars rather than the inefficient policy implemented by the  previous administration.   This bill sets out clear intentions for NASA as we move forward into  the next chapter of American space exploration. I invite my colleagues  to join me in supporting this very important bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Smith), the chairman of the full committee.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   I thank all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their  work: our chairman, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith); and also the  ranking gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson); my  counterpart on the subcommittee, Representative Bera; and also  Representative Perlmutter, the gentleman from Colorado; and all of my  fellow members on the subcommittee and our entire committee.   I take a moment to also thank our hardworking staff, and that  includes Tom Hammond, Mike Mineiro, Jonathan Charlton, Ryan Faith,  Molly Fromm, and Chris Wydler from the majority staff. I also thank  Steve Janushkowsky, Jeannie Kranz, Stuart Burns from my congressional  staff, and Allen Li and Pamela Whitney from the minority staff.   Mr. Speaker, it is because of their countless hours of hard work,  negotiation, and finding common ground that we will now send this bill  from the floor of this House of Representatives to the resolute desk of  the Oval Office to be signed into law.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
