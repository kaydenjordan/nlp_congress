 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to pay tribute to my dear  friend, Delaware County Sheriff Russ Martin, who officially retired  this week from his post as Delaware County Sheriff after nearly 34  years of dedicated public service in law enforcement.   Sheriff Martin first began his career in law enforcement as a  dispatcher while attending Bowling Green State University. He later  became a police officer for the city of Delaware and then served 8  years as the city's chief of police.   In 2012, he was first appointed to the Delaware County Sheriff. As  Delaware County Sheriff, he added police body cameras, restored the  department's cold case unit, and advocated for life-saving equipment to  empower citizens and to support first responders.  [[Page H1771]]    Fitting for a man who teaches courses on leadership and ethics,  Sheriff Martin's own legacy is one marked by compassion, integrity, and  devotion.   On behalf of Ohio's 12th Congressional District, I wish Sheriff  Martin the very best as he embarks on new adventures, alongside his  loving family as a grandfather, father, husband, volunteer, and  champion for law enforcement.                            ____________________
