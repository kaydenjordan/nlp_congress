 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this  time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 270, the Brown v. Board of  Education National Historic Site Expansion Act. I thank Senator Chris  Coons for his leadership securing the Senate's unanimous support for  passage of this important legislation earlier this month. I am proud to  lead the legislation here in the House along with our bipartisan  cosponsors, Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester, Congresswoman Eleanor  Holmes Norton, and Congressman  Bob Good.   As a former teacher of history and a student of history, I believe in  the value of learning from our past. Many Americans don't know that the  landmark Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision, that  desegregated public schools in 1954, combined legal challenges from  four States and the District of Columbia. I represent one of those  States and was fortunate to know some of the petitioners from Clarendon  County, South Carolina, who challenged the separate but equal laws.  Many of their photographs hang in my congressional office.   In 2004, I wrote, in cooperation with the Palmetto Conservation  Foundation, the book ``Uncommon Courage: The Story of Briggs v.  Elliott, South Carolina's Unsung Civil Rights Battle.'' That same year,  I was proud to lead the effort to present the Congressional Gold Medal  of Honor to the leaders of that challenge--Harry and Eliza Briggs, Levi  Pearson, and Reverend Joseph A. DeLaine.   Their case, Briggs v. Elliott, was the first of those cases that  later became Brown v. Board. The subsequent cases were in Delaware,  Virginia, Washington, D.C., and, of course, Topeka, Kansas.   Today there is a National Parks site that was created by Congress in  1992 in Topeka that tells the story of the ordinary people who took  this extraordinary action to ensure their children had equal  educational opportunities. However, the other communities involved in  this historic effort have no National Park Service presence  acknowledging their contributions.   This legislation will right that wrong. It expands the Brown v. Board  of Education National Historic Site to include locations in each of the  communities that were part of the lawsuit. When writing this  legislation, I worked with the National Trust Fund for Historic  Preservation who engaged with the communities that would be impacted to  solicit their input.                                time  1515    With the enactment of this legislation, the Brown v. Board of  Education National Historic Site will become more than the Monroe  School building in Topeka. It will add the Summerton School and Scott's  Branch School in Summerton, South Carolina, to represent the Briggs v.  Elliott case; the Hockessin Colored School No. 107 and Howard High  School in Wilmington, Delaware, to represent Belton v. Gebhart; the  former Robert Russa Moton High School, now a museum, in Farmville,  Virginia, to represent Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward  County; and the John Philip Sousa Junior High School in the District of  Columbia to represent Boiling v. Sharpe.   Each of these sites will tell the story of how these communities  fought to overturn the 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson decision that  established the separate but equal doctrine. When Brown v. Board of  Education overturned that decision and ended generations of inadequate  education for Black children, constitutional scholar Louis H. Pollak  hailed it as ``probably the most important American Government act of  any kind since the Emancipation Proclamation.''   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members of this august body to follow the  Senate's lead and vote in favor of expanding the Brown v. Board of  Education National Historic Site to ensure that all the communities  that contributed to this landmark decision receive proper recognition.   Having geographically dispersed historic sites that tell this great  story will enable more students to learn from the past and understand  the importance of making America's greatness accessible and affordable  to all.
