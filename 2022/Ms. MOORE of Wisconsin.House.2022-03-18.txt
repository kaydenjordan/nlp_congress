 Madam Speaker, just let me say that,  unfortunately, I had never taken psychology during my college  preparation, but I do know certain things such as, what avoidance  behavior is.   I tell you, the message discipline on that side is just perfect. You  can talk about the southern border and inflation and all of that to  avoid the topic of discrimination.   Sit down. I have the floor, sir.   You are avoiding the fact, and I know personally, as a person with my  hair, that I have had people tell my employer that I was an  embarrassment sitting in the front office because of the way my hair  looked.                                time  1000    And so, to avoid a big conversation about discrimination that has an  impact, particularly on African Americans, you talk about everything  else. It is wrong. You are not engaging and, quite frankly, you are not  being honest.
