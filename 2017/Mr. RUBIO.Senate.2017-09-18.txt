 Mr. President, due to ongoing efforts from  Hurricane Irma, which devastated many parts of Florida, I am staying in  my state to assess the damage and help marshal the full capacity of  recovery resources available to us. Today I met with U.S. Department of  Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and personally showed him various  parts of Florida's agriculture lands that were damaged by Hurricane  Irma.   (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
