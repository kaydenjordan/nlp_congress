 Mr. Speaker, as the Coronavirus continues to  sweep across our nation, there is nothing more important to me than the  health and safety of the American people. I strongly support rapid  passage of the CARES Act to accelerate much-needed resources to our  nation's health care professionals and provide critical aide to  Americans, small businesses, and families.   As Ranking Member of the MilCon/VA Appropriations Subcommittee, I am  proud to have worked on securing $19.6 billion for veterans' programs  to help combat COVID-19. I'm honored to represent the largest  population of veterans in Texas and am committed to ensuring Congress  continues providing top-level care to the brave men and women who have  sacrificed to keep our nation and free, many of whom are at-risk of  serious complications should they contract COVID-19.   In this challenging time, it is critical that Congress continue  working in a bipartisan manner to provide aid, relief, and economic  security to the nation. Continuing to work across the aisle to provide  our country the resources it needs is the only way forward.   I am grateful to the incredible health care professionals, first  responders and essential service employees who are working tirelessly  to keep our nation healthy. I also salute Americans who are following  guidelines and doing their part to flatten the curve for not only their  own health but for their neighbors.   Together, we will get through this.
