 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the Black and  indigenous soldiers who played a crucial role in winning our Nation's  independence.   Soldiers of color made up a quarter of George Washington's forces by  the time they marched to victory in Yorktown, but they have been  largely erased from the story of our Nation.   At best, the teaching of Revolutionary War history fails to highlight  the contributions of Black and indigenous Americans. At worst, it  actively whitewashes them.   This Black History Month, I celebrate the passage of my National  Liberty Memorial Preservation Act, which President Biden signed into  law as part of last year's omnibus funding package.   My bipartisan legislation will establish a memorial to honor the  soldiers of color who risked everything for American independence.   By establishing this memorial, we can write these brave soldiers back  into the narrative of our American history.                            ____________________
