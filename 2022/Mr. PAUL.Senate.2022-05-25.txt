 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture  vote on the Wainstein nomination be withdrawn and that the confirmation  vote on the nomination occur at a time to be determined by the majority  leader or his designee in consultation with the Republican leader.    Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that the rest  of the votes for this evening be 10-minute votes.    Mr. President, I opposed the confirmation of Bridget Brink  to be U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine because of her support for the  expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO. Ambassador  Brink believes in expanding NATO to any country who would like to join,  including Ukraine.   An important part of diplomacy is understanding your adversary. When  I questioned Ambassador Brink about the eastern expansion of NATO,  however, she expressed her belief that Russian President Vladimir Putin  merely uses the NATO question as a pretext for actions he would take  anyway. I strongly disagree. We must evaluate our leaders' actions, as  well as the actions of our adversaries, on the world stage.   Putin is an aggressor and must be condemned, but we cannot allow our  revulsion for his invasions to blind us to the fact that our  adversaries react to the actions of the West. For years, Putin stated  that any attempt to expand NATO to Russia's borders would be perceived  as a direct threat. Fifteen years ago, Putin asked, ``Against whom is  this expansion intended?'' Yet, a year later in 2008, NATO promised  that Ukraine and Georgia would one day join the alliance. Russia's  invasions of Georgia and Ukraine are not a coincidence, but I left my  meeting with Ambassador Brink believing that she is not willing to  reflect upon the actions of the West and how they would be viewed by  Russian eyes.   Putin has no justification for embarking on a war and invading  another country. I fully support the Ukrainians in their fight against  Russia. Russia's brutal use of its military to achieve its objectives  is unacceptable. But we must understand the reasons why he chose to  invade in the first place.   When the Cold War ended, the United States had the benefit of the  wisdom of foreign policy officials who took Russia seriously. George  Kennan warned that NATO expansion would ignite a new cold war. Henry  Kissinger proposed a peaceful coexistence in which Ukraine pursued a  policy of neutrality, with one foot in the West and one foot in the  East. Jack Matlock, our Ambassador to the Soviet Union from 1987 to  1991, called the current crisis ``predictable'' and, in 1997, warned  Congress that he believed that NATO expansion ``could well encourage a  chain of events that could produce the most serious security threat to  this nation since the Soviet Union collapsed.''   Those wise voices are either gone or retired. Had we listened to  their warnings, today's crisis might have been averted. But the State  Department is now filled with officials who refuse to listen to  adversaries or consider how our actions may make peace more difficult  to obtain.   Although I opposed the confirmation of Bridget Brink to be Ambassador  to Ukraine, I wish her luck in representing the United States and  finding a path to a peaceful end to the conflict.                            ____________________
