 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on H.R. 23.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 5 minutes.   Mr. Chairman, in California, 5 years of historic drought caused  billions of dollars of damage to our economy, destroyed tens of  thousands of jobs, and brought many communities within just months of  literally running out of water, all because we couldn't store water  from the wet years to assure plenty in the drought years.   Then back to back with this historic drought, we have just had one of  the wettest winters on record. Massive torrents of water threatened  entire communities on its way to be wasted in the Pacific Ocean, all  because of the very same problem: we have few reservoirs to store this  superabundance of water for the next drought.   Even before the drought, massive water diversions required by a  growing tangle of laws and regulations had created devastating economic  hardship in California's fertile Central Valley. Those same policies  forced us to release what precious little water we had remaining behind  our dams to adjust river temperatures for fish.   For three Congresses now, the House has acted to fix this folly.  Today, H.R. 23, the GROW Act, by Congressman David Valadao, addresses  the policy, regulatory, and administrative failures that have  mismanaged our water supplies across the West.   The GROW Act includes both short-term and long-term provisions aimed  at restoring water reliability and certainty to cities and farms. It  includes seven titles that expand water storage, improve  infrastructure, protect water rights, and create more abundant and  reliable water resources to benefit both communities and the  environment.  [[Page H5504]]    The GROW Act gives Federal agencies the tools they need to help  safeguard communities from the hardship of future droughts. It codifies  the historic Bay-Delta accord that provided an equitable balance  between human and environmental needs and guaranteed the reliability  and predictability of our water supplies.   It strengthens northern California area-of-origin water rights and  prevents the Federal Government from demanding that people give up  their water rights in order to operate on Federal land.   It streamlines the endlessly time-consuming and cost-prohibitive  environmental permitting that is blocking new reservoir construction by  coordinating Federal agencies and requiring transparency of the science  behind its decisions.   It requires completion of studies for five new reservoirs that have  dragged on for decades.   In the past, we have heard three objections from opponents. The first  is it will decimate salmon fisheries. On the contrary, it saves those  fisheries where the environmental policies of the past 40 years have  utterly failed to protect them.   The GROW Act targets the nonnative predators that are responsible for  90 percent of salmon losses as the smolts try to make their way to the  ocean. It encourages the use of fish hatcheries to assure that salmon  populations will increase dramatically in future years.   The second objection is that it will preempt State water rights laws.  Read section 302 of the bill. ``The Secretary of the Interior is  directed, in operation of the Central Valley Project, to adhere to  California's water rights laws governing water rights priorities . .  .''   It goes on to say that diversions ``shall not be undertaken in a  manner that alters the water rights priorities established by  California law.''   It does have provisions necessary to codify the Bay-Delta agreement  and combat invasive predators, but this doesn't set a precedent for  other States. California is unique among the States in the fact that it  operates with a coordinated operating agreement that combines the  Federal Central Valley Project and the California State water projects  and runs them as a unified system. This was at the request of  California and with its consent.   The third objection is that it rewards powerful agricultural  interests at the expense of consumers. This is nonsense. An average  consumer uses roughly 100 gallons a day to wash the dishes, water the  lawn, everything else we do in our daily lives. But when you purchase a  cheeseburger, you have just consumed 750 gallons of water because that  is what it takes to grow the ingredients in that cheeseburger. Buy a  pair of jeans, you have just used 1,800 gallons of water.   The fact is that all of this water benefits consumers and the tens of  thousands of farm workers and others who provide for their families  from this water.   Droughts are nature's fault. Water shortages are our fault. They are  a choice we made a generation ago when we chose to neglect our  infrastructure and mismanage our water resources. It has led to  increasingly severe water shortages, spiraling utility and grocery  bills, and economic stagnation. The GROW Act chooses a brighter future  of abundance and prosperity that can begin today with our vote.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Nunes), who has been a leader on this issue for more  than two decades.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Valadao), the author of this legislation.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Royce).    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Calvert), the dean of the Republican  delegation to the House.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gosar), the chairman of the bipartisan Western Caucus.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tipton).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Rohrabacher).    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Bakersfield, California (Mr. McCarthy), the majority  leader.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Mrs. Mimi Walters).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Knight).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I think it is time to fact check the fact checker.   The last major reservoir of over a million acre feet was in 1979. It  was in New Melones, 2.3 million acre feet. The two reservoirs that the  gentleman referenced combined are less than a million acre feet. They  would fill New Melones to less than half of that amount.   With respect to water salinity, the Bay-Delta Accord, that is  codified by this bill, guarantees the water necessary to combat salt  water intrusion.   And finally, I would point out that, no, dams don't create water.  Nature creates water. Dams store that water from wet years so that we  have plenty of it in dry years. That is where we have fallen a  generation behind in our needs precisely because of the laws that the  gentleman from California doggedly defends.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Abundance or shortage, that is the question. And I want to thank and  salute Mr. Valadao for his work on this issue and for putting that  choice so clearly before the House today.   It is true, we can choose to continue down this sad road that we have  been on. That means increasingly severe government-induced shortages.  It means higher and higher water and grocery prices and a permanently  declining quality of life for our children who will be required to  stretch and ration every drop of water in their bleak and parched  homes.   With this bill, we choose a different future. We choose abundance. We  choose a future in which water flows again to the fertile fields of the  Central Valley, providing full employment for families and affordable  groceries from America's agricultural cornucopia. It is a future in  which families need not watch their gardens shrivel and die, and towns  and cities need not fear mandatory water rationing and uncertain and  unpredictable supplies.   It is a future in which long-established water rights are safe and  secure from the whims of politicians and bureaucrats. We choose a  future in which thriving populations of young salmon can swim to the  sea unmolested by the non-native predators that now kill 90 percent of  them before they reach the ocean; a future in which new fish hatcheries  assure the release of millions of additional salmon to supply a revived  and rapidly expanding commercial fishing industry.   We choose a future in which great new reservoirs can store vast  amounts of water in wet years to assure abundance in dry ones; a future  in which families can enjoy the prosperity that abundant water and  hydroelectricity and affordable groceries provide, and the quality of  life that comes from that prosperity. Abundance or shortage? That is  the question. We choose abundance.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I just want to say that this is a very  good amendment. The committee supports it, and it is essential to  providing the flexibility that is necessary.   I might point out to my colleague from California, when we originally  developed this bill more than 5 years ago, we consulted more than 60  water agencies throughout northern and central California, including  many in Democratic congressional districts. Senior water rights are  essential to northern California. This bill strengthens them, and Mr.  LaMalfa's amendment adds the management flexibility that is long  overdue.    I yield to the gentleman from California.    Will the gentleman yield?  [[Page H5527]]         Mr. Chairman, I have no objection to this amendment.  I thank the gentleman from Fresno, California, for his constructive  contribution to this process.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment adds a superfluous  provision that requires a study on a subject that we have already  studied to death.   We find the left constantly proposing these technologies to manage  our existing water shortage often as an excuse not to expand our  ability to store new water supplies.   The problem is not complicated. These recycling projects are  typically four times as expensive as traditional water storage,  according to a 2016 study by the California Public Utilities  Commission.   If we had exhausted our existing resources, then these technologies  might make sense if the alternative is no water at all. But that is not  the alternative. The alternative is to develop our resources at about  one-fourth the cost of these technologies the gentleman is trying to  sell us--four times the cost.   No consumer in his right mind would pay four times more for the same  product. Only politicians would do that, and the problem is when  politicians make this choice, consumers end up paying.   Which brings me to my second objection to the gentleman's amendment.  Our traditional water projects are paid for by the users of the water  in proportion to their use, as is the beneficiary pays principle that  has guided our water projects for generations.  [[Page H5529]]                                     time  1815    These policies protect taxpayers from footing the bill for somebody  else's water.   The title 16 recycling projects the gentleman is promoting are not  paid for by the water users but rather by general taxpayers, meaning  these projects literally rob St. Petersburg to pay St. Paul.   If the gentleman would like to confine the provisions of the bill to  require his constituents to pay four times more for their water or that  his constituents pay to subsidize the water for my constituents, I  would be happy to support him. But I sincerely doubt that is what he  has in mind.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would simply cite to my friend the  California Public Utilities Commission report in 2016, and what would  be the cost of future sources of water for California. They say very  clearly that recycling water is nearly four times as costly as  traditional sources of water, and that is being generous.   I support any water project that pencils out. This one does not. This  one would require water bills to quadruple. For California, it is  exactly policies like these that are driving water bills up. The people  of California need to take note of that and to realize the choices they  make at the ballot box have real world implications to the bills they  are paying for simple things like water and power.   Mr. Chair, I ask for a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chair, I object.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the  motion to recommit.    Mr. Speaker, my friends' concerns are well placed;  his amendment is completely misplaced.   The fact is that, for 45 years, our environmental laws have made the  management of our forests virtually impossible. After 45 years of  experience with these laws, imposed with the explicit promise they  would improve our forest environment, I think we are entitled to ask:  How is our forest environment doing? And the answer is damning; our  forests are dying.   Timber harvests of surplus timber have fallen 80 percent in those  years. The result is severe overcrowding in our forests. An acre  normally supports between 20 to 100 trees, depending upon the  topography; but because of these laws, average density in the Sierra  has now ballooned to 266 trees per acre.   In this crowded condition, these trees fight for their lives against  other trees trying to occupy the same ground. And in this crowded and  stressed condition, they fall victim to disease, pestilence, drought,  and, ultimately, catastrophic wildfire.   The answer is not this amendment that seeks to derail this needed  water storage; it is to restore scientific management to our forests to  restore them to a healthy condition.   When I visited the command center of the Rim Fire several years ago  that threatened Yosemite Valley, I asked the firefighters: What answer  can I take, in your name, back to Congress? And the answer was:  Treatment matters. We need proper forest management.   The good news for my friend from Santa Barbara is he will soon have  the opportunity to vote on just such a bill, the Resilient Federal  Forest Act, by Mr. Westerman of Arkansas. It treats this problem  comprehensively. It passed the House Natural Resources Committee. We  hope to bring it soon to the floor of the House. It will address the  problems that plague our forests by restoring proper scientific  management to our public lands.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Clerk  be authorized to make technical corrections in the engrossment of H.R.  1719, to include addition of an enacting clause.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, our current defense spending is about  where it was at the very peak of the Reagan defense buildup after  adjusting for inflation. It is about the same as the next eight most  powerful military forces on the planet, combined. Six of those eight  are already our allies.   The President has proposed adding $54 billion to this. That is the  equivalent of adding more than the entire military establishment of  Great Britain to what we already have.   Yet we are told, and I do not doubt, that much of our military force  is ill equipped and unready for combat. If that is the case, it is not  a fiscal problem; it is a management problem. We seem to care how much  money is being spent, but not how it is being spent. That is a  catastrophic failure of congressional oversight.   In recent years, the Pentagon has warned that its infrastructure is  22 percent bigger than necessary. It has asked Congress for another  round of Base Realignment and Closure reviews. Just last month,  Secretary Mattis urged resumption of BRAC. He believes it will save $2  billion a year and $20 billion over 10 years. That is enough money to  buy 120 FA-18 Super Hornets, 300 more AH-64 helicopters, or four  Virginia class submarines if only Congress would get out of the way and  allow unneeded bases to close or consolidate.   The Pentagon has the authority to close or consolidate bases on  foreign soil, but in the NDAA Congress blocks its authority to close or  consolidate unnecessary bases on our own soil.   My amendment removes the NDAA prohibition on this needed process and  allows BRAC to move forward as our President has requested. His  Statement of Administration Policy on NDAA is crystal clear: ``While  the bill contains many promising reforms, it fails to authorize a Base  Realignment and Closure round, which would result in substantial  recurring savings and allow DOD to align infrastructure with force  reduction.''   I have heard three objections:   First, we are told the upfront costs of consolidation can be high.  But the results are now in, and the first four  [[Page H5736]]  BRAC rounds are saving us $7 billion a year.   Second, we are told local economies depend on these bases, but  experience tells us that communities rapidly recover by freeing these  assets for productive commercial use.   Third, we are told to wait until we finished expanding our forces,  but the excess capacity estimate already assumes force expansion, and a  new round of BRAC will only wring out a small portion of the  overcapacity.   When we squander billions of defense dollars keeping obsolete  military bases open in order to satisfy congressional constituencies,  we directly rob our military forces of the resources that we are  constantly reminded that they desperately need.   There is an old saying that you can't fill a broken bucket by pouring  more water in it. At some point, you have got to fix the bucket. That  is our responsibility. We need to take it more seriously.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Washington (Mr. Smith), the ranking member.    Mr. Chairman, to vote against these measures, to vote  to rob our military of $20 million ofsavings over the next 10 years for  military bases the Pentagon itself says are unnecessary, it comes down  to that. You cannot provide for the common defense if you cannot pay  for it, and the ability of our country to do so is being called into  grave question.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
