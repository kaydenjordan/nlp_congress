 Mr. Speaker, this week, torrential rains caused record  flooding in many parts of Illinois, and, in particular, in my district.  I had the chance to visit some of the affected areas over the weekend,  joined by my colleagues from Illinois, Mr. Hultgren and Mr. Roskam, as  well as Senator Durbin, Fox Lake Mayor Donny Schmit, and Lake County  Chair Aaron Lawlor. We spoke with residents and saw firsthand some of  the many challenges these communities are facing.   I rise today, however, to recognize the many unsung heroes who have  stepped up to help their neighbors, and often helped total strangers,  in the wake of this disaster. This includes our first responders,  dedicated government workers, and volunteers, many coming from towns  far away and unaffected by the floods.   As the rains fell and then in the days after, these people worked  tirelessly around the clock to lend a hand and try to hold off the  rising waters. We are not out of the woods yet, and the people who  serve our communities day in and day out in our local governments, our  police and fire departments, and our emergency agencies are continuing  to work with professionalism and quick coordination.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to use my time today to say ``thank you''  to these people working behind the scenes without due recognition. They  represent the very best of our communities and our Nation and make us  all very proud.  [[Page H6135]]                                ____________________
