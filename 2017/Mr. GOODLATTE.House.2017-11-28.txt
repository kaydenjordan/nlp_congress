 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2228) to provide support for law enforcement agency efforts  to protect the mental health and well-being of law enforcement  officers, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H. R. 2228         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

(b) Case Studies.--The Director of the Office of Community       Oriented Policing Services shall submit to Congress a       report--        (1) that is similar to the report entitled ``Health,       Safety, and Wellness Program Case Studies in Law       Enforcement'' published by the Office of Community Oriented       Policing Services in 2015; and        (2) that focuses on case studies of programs designed       primarily to address officer psychological health and well-      being.

SEC. 3. SUPPORT FOR MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS.         The Attorney General, in coordination with the Secretary of       Health and Human Services, shall develop resources to educate       mental health providers about the culture of Federal, State,       tribal, and local law enforcement agencies and evidence-based       therapies for mental health issues common to Federal, State,       local, and tribal law enforcement officers.       SEC. 4. SUPPORT FOR OFFICERS.         The Attorney General shall--        (1) in consultation with Federal, State, local, and tribal       law enforcement agencies--        (A) identify and review the effectiveness of any existing       crisis hotlines for law enforcement officers;        (B) provide recommendations to Congress on whether Federal       support for existing crisis hotlines or the creation of an       alternative hotline would improve the effectiveness or use of       the hotline; and        (C) conduct research into the efficacy of an annual mental       health check for law enforcement officers;        (2) in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security       and the head of other Federal agencies that employ law       enforcement officers, examine the mental health and wellness       needs of Federal law enforcement officers, including the       efficacy of expanding peer mentoring programs for law       enforcement officers at each Federal agency;        (3) ensure that any recommendations, resources, or programs       provided under this Act protect the privacy of participating       law enforcement officers; and        (4) not later than one year after the date of enactment of       this Act, submit a report to Congress containing findings       from the review and research under paragraphs (1) and (2),       and final recommendations based upon those findings.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on H.R. 2228, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Today we are voting on H.R. 2228, the Law Enforcement Mental Health  and Wellness Act. This bill is designed to equip local law enforcement  agencies with information and resources to address mental health  challenges faced by officers.   Our policemen and -women report for duty every day, facing and  responding to danger on our behalf. We often see them and we always  appreciate them. However, we often don't consider the mental aspect of  the challenges facing our officers who put themselves in harm's way to  protect our communities.   Today we consider the toll their jobs take on their psychological  well-being. Every day, these brave men and women face some of the  highest stress situations one can imagine. When officers hang up their  badges at the end of a shift, they cannot easily hang up the lingering  effects of their high-stakes encounters. As this stress accumulates, it  can lead to serious physical and mental health problems. Research has  shown time and again that police officer occupational stress is  directly correlated to heart disease, divorce, alcohol abuse, and major  psychological illnesses, including acute stress disorder, post- traumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety disorders.   Over 900,000 men and women serve as sworn law enforcement officers in  the United States. Each year, more of them die from suicide than from  gunfire and traffic accidents combined. Many departments have started  mental health programs as preventative measures. These programs have  been successful in reducing the number of police officer suicides from  300 in 1998 to 126 in 2012. But in departments where mental health and  wellness programs remain absent, these problems continue. We must  address this gap.   H.R. 2228 directs the Department of Justice, in consultation with the  Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, to equip local law  enforcement agencies to address mental health challenges faced by  police officers. It also permits DOJ's Office of Community Oriented  Policing Services to award grants to peer mentoring pilot programs, and  it directs the Attorney General to make recommendations on how to make  these and other programs more effective.   Mr. Speaker, we all recognize the profound challenges faced by law  enforcement in this country. Today we also acknowledge the unseen toll  that these challenges can take on the health of these brave men and  women.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Brooks from Indiana for introducing this  bill, and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for this important  step in providing law enforcement agencies with the resources to treat  severe mental and physical stress. Our men and women in blue deserve  the appreciation and support of all of us.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks), the chief sponsor of this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I want to again thank the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks) and  the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Demings) for their leadership on  this issue.   I will say again how much I appreciate the work of the gentlewoman  from Texas on a whole host of law enforcement and criminal justice  reform issues; and it is my hope that we will move a great many of  these reforms through this House in the very near future. The  gentlewoman certainly has my support for working together in a  bipartisan way to accomplish that. This piece of legislation is a great  step in that direction.   You can't expect law enforcement to keep all of us safe if we are not  looking out for their mental health, which I  [[Page H9454]]  can only imagine how stressful the job is. I have had the opportunity  to do several ride-alongs over the years with police officers in my  district, and they have my utmost respect.   I hope that every Member of this House will vote for this important  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
