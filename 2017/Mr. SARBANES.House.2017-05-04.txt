 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, President Trump and the Republicans are looking for a  win. They want to put points on the scoreboard. But why would you want  to win by taking healthcare coverage away from 24 million Americans?  Why would you consider it a victory to raise premiums and copayments  and deductibles on millions of Americans, including millions of older  Americans? Why would you view it as a success to eliminate protections  for preexisting conditions?   If I could vote against this bill 100 times, I would do it. If I  could vote against it 1,000 times for the thousands of my constituents  that will be hurt by this bill, I would.   It is wrong, it is immoral, and it is inhumane.
