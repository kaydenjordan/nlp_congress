 Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 8, the  Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019, which will extend the current  Federal background check requirement to unlicensed sellers of guns.   It is about time that Congress takes this issue seriously, and I am  pleased that this bipartisan bill has been brought to the House floor  with the urgency this issue deserves.   In recent years, our Nation has experienced an increase in mass  shootings, and our Nation is appropriately horrified. However, mass  shootings are just one symptom of our gun violence epidemic. The daily  toll of shootings occurs in communities across our country, on our  streets, in our schools, and even in our houses of worship.   As Aalayah Eastmond testified before the Judiciary Committee earlier  this month, 1 year after the terrible shooting that took the lives of  17 students and staff and injured 17 others at her high school in  Parkland, Florida: ``Minority communities bear the heaviest burden of  gun violence in this country.''   The impact on our young people is simply unacceptable. Every day, 47  children and teens are shot in this country. Eight of these young  people die, and 39 are shot and survive.   Citizens across this country such as Diane Latiker, who also  testified before the committee, are taking it upon themselves to  organize and engage in community-based efforts to reduce gun violence  and to assist the young people it affects. We in Congress must match  their courage and commitment with action of our own.   I support H.R. 8 because it will reduce gun violence by narrowing the  avenues for criminals and other prohibited persons from obtaining guns.   Certainly, there is no single change to our gun laws that will  prevent every shooting, but enacting measures that will help prevent  some of them is clearly the right thing to do.   Mr. Chair, that is why I support this bill, and I ask my colleagues  to do the same.
