 Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Hoyer), my friend, the majority leader, to talk about the schedule that  will be taken up next week.  [[Page H7138]]         Mr. Speaker, I agree that we need to continue these  negotiations and get a resolution, and, hopefully, we will in the  coming week, both on COVID relief and on the funding of government.   We have agreed on caps already. Hopefully, we will maintain that and  get that done to give certainty to all of our agencies that we know how  much money is involved.   It costs the Defense Department, for example, every week that we are  in a continuing resolution, potentially billions of dollars just in  procurement and in the loss of those efficiencies.   I share the gentleman's optimism that we can get it done. Obviously,  we need to continue working through these final issues.   I do want to thank the gentleman, as we talked last week at the  colloquy about the ALS Disability Insurance Access Act, and I thank the  gentleman for scheduling it this week. It passed without opposition.  This is one of those examples where we do work and come together and do  something that actually helps people.   This will help hundreds, possibly thousands, of people struggling  with ALS to be able to get access to the tools that they need that  they, under the current law, are being denied. To see the House come  together so overwhelmingly to do that shows that we can, when we put  our minds to it, actually help people.   This will help people in all of our districts, and I thank the  gentleman, again, for getting that done, getting that bill to the  floor, and, ultimately, now all of us coming together to pass that bill  on to the Senate and the President.   I want to again bring up the Paycheck Protection Program bill by  Congressman Chabot. This is a bill that we have been talking about at  this colloquy since September. Each week that goes by, we know that  there is a list--unfortunately, it is a long list--of areas where we  have disagreement.   There is also a list of areas where we have full agreement if you  look at the number of items where we have already decided we both,  Republicans and Democrats, want to do this. Then, there are those items  that we are strongly opposed to on our side or that they are strongly  opposed to on their side.   I would just continue to emphasize that these small businesses can't  wait for us to get agreement or never get an agreement, while there are  things we can do to help them today, to save them today.   And we continue to hear the heartbreaking stories. Over 100,000  restaurants in America have closed for good. Gone. I know K-Paul's  restaurant in New Orleans, one of the world-famous restaurants.  International Chef Paul Prudhomme invented blackened redfish at that  restaurant. It is gone.   There are too many other stories to mention. We see heartbreaking  stories of a restaurant owner in Los Angeles who is being told she  can't operate, and literally, in the same parking lot next to her tents  are tents of a film studio that is able to operate.   It is not about science in those cases. It is about some government  official picking winners and losers. Unfortunately, the losers are  America's small businesses.   This needs to stop. I would just encourage the gentleman to bring the  Chabot bill, a bill that has wide bipartisan support that would save  small businesses. Today, we are going to lose, just today, about 150  restaurants, and that number is even higher for other small businesses.  There are hundreds a day.   Friday, we will lose 150 restaurants. Saturday, we will lose 150  restaurants. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, we will lose 150. We will lose  over 700 restaurants between now and when we come back Tuesday.    We don't have to do that. If that bill was put on the floor today, it  would have passed overwhelmingly, maybe unanimously, because it is an  area of agreement.   This idea of holding hostage these small businesses that are dying on  the vine while we try to get agreement that we haven't been able to get  since August, why can't we just do the things that we agree on now  while we negotiate the other things?   Some of those things will never become law, yet it is holding up the  things that we agree on that would save small businesses today. 150  restaurants today will go under that shouldn't have gone under. We  could have saved them.   There are thousands of jobs tied to this at Christmastime that don't  need to be gone if we just pass the things we agree on while we  negotiate the things we don't; because we may never get agreement on  those things. But don't let it hold these families hostage. Don't let  it hold these small businesses hostage.   I would just urge, again, that the gentleman bring the Chabot bill to  the floor as soon as possible. We know it would pass overwhelmingly.   I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, we will continue to push to get that  relief, starting with the Chabot bill--hopefully, with other things.  But at least let's bring those items that we are in agreement on to the  floor. Millions of jobs are at stake.   Finally, I want to ask the majority leader about reports that have  come up about a member of the Intelligence Committee, Mr. Swalwell,  having some kind of ties to a Chinese spy.  [[Page H7139]]    There are alarming issues that are being raised. We haven't gotten a  lot of answers. I know many are asking: Was it known prior to the time  he was put on the Intelligence Committee that there was this  relationship with a Chinese spy?   There are also reports that the Chinese spy also was able to  infiltrate his office and possibly put other spies in his office.   Was the gentleman aware? Maybe it was just the Speaker that was  aware, but were you all aware of this tie to a Chinese spy prior to him  being put on the committee? And why is he still on the Intelligence  Committee?   I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I hope we get  those answers. These are serious questions that have been raised. And  we are talking about a committee that deals with the most sensitive  intelligence information.   In fact, most Members of Congress don't have access to that level of  intelligence that members of the Intelligence Committee get, and  possibly their staffs have the ability to see some of that.   If an office was infiltrated by spies from a foreign country,  especially China, at a time when we are investigating China and raising  serious questions about them, these are questions that need to be  answered, and I hope we get answers soon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   Clearly, President Trump has expressed his concerns about some items  in and not in the National Defense Authorization Act. Ultimately, we  will see soon if he signs it or vetoes it. He has, obviously, got to  weigh all of those decisions, as he is doing right now.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I will continue  to work on these items that we need to get resolved--hopefully, will  get resolved--in the coming days.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
