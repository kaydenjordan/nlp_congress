 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share the story of Mary and  her son, two of my constituents from the Lakeview community of Chicago.  Mary wrote to me on her son's behalf, expressing their deep  appreciation for the Affordable Care Act and what the law has meant for  their family.   In 2001, Mary's son was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disease  called Addison's disease. It occurs when your body produces  insufficient amounts of certain hormones produced by your adrenal  glands. When left untreated, Addison's disease can be life-threatening.   At the time of his diagnosis, Mary's son was fully insured through  his employer. Then, in 2011, Mary's son left his employer to pursue the  American Dream of entrepreneurship and start a small business on his  own. Leaving his employer to bravely chase the American Dream meant  leaving behind his insurance coverage, too. He did not anticipate being  denied coverage due to a preexisting condition.  [[Page H57]]    Up to this point, because of treatment covered by his insurance plan,  he had been able to work to provide for himself and to live  independently. As he got his new business off the ground, he went  uninsured and, as a result, encountered several crises with his health.  He avoided going to the doctor due to high costs and eventually ended  up in the emergency room. As we all know, preventable emergency visits  are a major contributor to the overall high healthcare costs that harm  the entire system.   Thanks to the President and Congress passing the Affordable Care Act,  Mary's son was finally able to obtain affordable care when the health  insurance marketplace first opened in October 2013.   Mary wrote me to share her son's story. He is one of tens of millions  of Americans who have directly benefited from the ACA's improvements to  coverage, consumer protections, costs, and quality. Today, Mary is  fearful of what the repeal of ACA will mean for her son.   Unfortunately, despite having 7 years to produce an alternative, the  majority has failed to offer a true replacement. And what about the  parts of the ACA that share bipartisan popularity?   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle and the President-elect  insist they will craft a plan that maintains popular parts of the law,  while rejecting the less popular components. Of course, that sounds  great, but there is one real problem: they have offered absolutely no  way to pay for any of it.   In reality, repeal and replace is more simply repeal and go back to  before--tearing down a much-needed house before a new one is built,  back to a time when 47 million Americans--nearly 18 percent of the  population--were uninsured. Mary's son and countless others like him  cannot afford to go back in time. Repealing ACA will leave 20 million  Americans, including her son, without affordable health insurance,  effectively disrupting their care and potentially putting their lives  at risk.   To remind us all of the high stakes riding on the ACA repeal, Mary  wrote, saying: ``As a former Republican and now an Independent voter, I  am speaking from my heart. The 2016 election result has me truly  frightened for the health of my son and for my husband and me.''   Repealing the Affordable Care Act will create a chaotic situation  that will put real lives in danger. We all share in the responsibility  to protect the health care of all Americans. Empty rhetoric of  repealing the ACA is dangerous, but when transformed into real  legislative action, it can be catastrophic for the constituents that  elected us to serve and represent them in this body.   On behalf of Mary's son and other Americans in districts across the  country, I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to abandon  their efforts to strip health care from those who need it and, instead,  work with us to make our country a healthier place for all.                            ____________________
