 Madam Speaker, let us be clear. My  colleagues across the aisle want to raise the debt ceiling to pay for  their 3.5 trillion tax and spending spree.   In my home State of West Virginia and across the country, people are  paying more for gas, groceries, and other everyday items because of the  liberals' reckless spending.   Taxpayers are sick of footing the bill for the terrible policies  which continue to make the problem of inflation even worse.   Americans shouldn't have to pay for the consequences of Democrats'  out-of-touch actions. Democrats are responsible for the spending, and  they need to take responsibility for the borrowing. This entire  Congress, House Democrats have chosen to go it alone and push through  liberal items without any Republican input.   The liberals have managed to spend trillions by themselves. They can  raise the debt ceiling alone, too. Socialism has a price tag. It is  time the Democrats learn that lesson.                                time  1445
