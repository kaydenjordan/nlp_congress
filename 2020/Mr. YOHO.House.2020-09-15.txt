 Mr. Speaker, in this time of great chaos, uncertainty, and  fear, today's Abraham Accords provide us with a clear path to the  normalization of relations between the State of Israel and her regional  neighbors, Bahrain and the UAE.   Not only was this peace achieved without abandoning or weakening our  Israeli ally, but it is a peace that recognizes the ever-present and  growing threat posed by militant extremists, including the Islamic  Republic of Iran, to all regional neighbors. No longer will Iran take  advantage of a region divided against itself. Instead, an increasing  number of Arab nations are choosing to join a united front against  terror led by the United States and Israel.   I was honored to be present for this historic signing ceremony at the  White House, and I pray that we can use this unifying moment to  recognize that no matter the danger before us, peace will prevail. It  is a good illustration of why President Trump is being recognized and  considered for the Nobel Peace Prize.                            ____________________
