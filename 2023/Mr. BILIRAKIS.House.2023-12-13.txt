 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2365) to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services  to carry out a national project to prevent and cure Parkinson's, to be  known as the National Parkinson's Project, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2365         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 2365, the newly  titled Dr. Emmanuel Bilirakis and Honorable Jennifer Wexton National  Plan to End Parkinson's Act, and I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.   First, I thank Chair Rodgers for her support of this bill and passing  it out of markup last week unanimously by a vote of 47-0. I am also  grateful to my good friend and co-lead on this bill, Representative  Paul Tonko, for his support and for working with me on this particular  piece of legislation.   Mr. Tonko has been a true partner in this effort to provide hope for  patients living with Parkinson's disease, and I commend him for his  advocacy on behalf of the community.   Mr. Speaker, in that spirit, The Michael J. Fox Foundation has been a  champion for this mission to fund research for better treatments and  cures for over 23 years. Michael J. Fox has been able to use his own  diagnosis and celebrity status to channel over $1 billion to  translational research.   We have a letter of endorsement from his foundation and 30 other  Parkinson's and neurological advocacy groups and organizations. I truly  could not thank them enough for their support and grassroots efforts on  this particular bill.   H.R. 2365 is no-cost legislation--I want to repeat, no-cost  legislation--that will unite experts from government and the private  sector to develop a national Parkinson's project with the goal of  preventing, treating, and ultimately curing Parkinson's disease.   Parkinson's affects almost 1 million Americans nationwide, and it is  the fastest growing neurological disease with no cure available,  unfortunately.   It costs our healthcare system over $52 billion annually, and that  number is projected to increase over the next decade to $80 billion. We  must do all we can to change that trajectory.   Sadly, many of my close family members are among those who have been  diagnosed with this horrific disease. This year, in particular, has  been very difficult for my family. I lost my brother, Dr. Emmanuel  Bilirakis, to Parkinson's disease in May. As a primary care physician,  my brother cared for his community and his family. He really did.   I am so thankful that my friend and colleague, Anna Eshoo--she is a  godsend--suggested we rename the title of the bill after him in his  honor. I thank her for her strong support on this bill.   My brother was an outstanding individual. In my opinion, he was a  saint. May his memory be eternal.   Further, my mother-in-law, Theodora Lialios, also passed away just  this past October after her yearslong battle with the disease. She was  a strong and wonderful woman.   My uncle also had a diagnosis and passed away a few years ago.   My father, Congressman Mike Bilirakis, who was chairman of the Health  Subcommittee under the Energy and  [[Page H6918]]  Commerce Committee--Peter worked with him--was diagnosed just recently.  This is for my dad and all of my constituents.   Given these personal connections, I have made it a mission to enact  legislation that will help Parkinson's patients around the country.  H.R. 2365 is the first step in that direction.   Thankfully, we have been able to come together in a bipartisan  fashion to move this bill forward. I am hopeful we will get broad,  bipartisan support in the House today.   Mr. Speaker, this could also not come at a more critical time.  Earlier this year, researchers were able to newly discover a  Parkinson's biomarker that will help reveal pathologies and provide  better understanding in research and development efforts.   I truly believe we are on the brink of new breakthroughs for  treatments and cures and that one day we will completely eradicate this  dreadful disease.   We must be proactive. We cannot afford to wait any longer. This  national Parkinson's project will provide an integrated strategy to  support and coordinate research efforts, collaborate to prevent  duplication, encourage development of safe and effective treatments,  and review the impact on patients and their caregivers and families.   Mr. Speaker, with passage of this bill, HHS will be tasked with the  creation of a new advisory council comprising of experts in the field  across the Federal Government in every related agency, combined with  non-Federal members. This is how you do it, a public and private  partnership. There will be non-Federal appointed members represented by  the patient advocates, specialist providers, clinicians, and  researchers working in the Parkinson's space.   This advisory council will focus its efforts on an annual report to  the Secretary and to Congress with an evaluation of the current efforts  to prevent, treat, and cure Parkinson's once and for all.   It will also provide recommendations for ways to reduce the  escalating burden of this disease on patients, families, and  caregivers. It will provide recommendations on ways to reduce costs and  improve health outcomes and quality of care for Medicare and Medicaid  beneficiaries and our Nation's true American heroes, our veterans, and  better research the underlying causes of this terrible disease.   Lastly, H.R. 2365 will incorporate other neurodegenerative  Parkinson's-related diseases, including the rare disease, progressive  supranuclear palsy, PSP. PSP is an extremely aggressive disease that  progresses rapidly, with life expectancy of 6 to 9 years after  diagnosis. It has no known cure or cause. Like Parkinson's, we can  change that if we act now.    Mr. Speaker, I was so saddened to learn that our friend and House  colleague, Jennifer Wexton, was diagnosed with PSP. Our thoughts and  prayers are with her and her family. Her bravery is to be commended for  continuing in Congress on behalf of her constituents while battling  this horrific disease.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Wexton for her bipartisan  support. She did so much. I couldn't do this without her. We are  absolutely honored to be able to add her name to the title of this  legislation, as well.   In the end, there has never been a better time to move forward with  H.R. 2365, the Dr. Emmanuel Bilirakis and Honorable Jennifer Wexton  National Plan to End Parkinson's Act.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, Majority Leader   Steve Scalise,  for helping put this bill on the suspension calendar this week. We  really appreciate accelerating the process.   It is a no-brainer. We have to cure this disease as soon as possible.  We need to save lives, and quality of life is so very important, as  well.   Let's do the right thing for the Parkinson's community by getting  this bill through the House floor to the Senate and enacted into law as  soon as possible.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2365, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Idaho (Mr. Fulcher).    Mr. Speaker, we will find a cure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H6920]]         Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, first of all, the reason the Lord brought us here today  was to do good things, and that is why our constituents elect us--to do  good things and work together for our constituents and, of course, for  our wonderful country.   I thank Jennifer Wexton, my colleague, for really helping me with  this. We could not have done this without our bipartisan support, and I  appreciate the gentlewoman (Ms. Wexton) so very much.   I want to thank my staff and the committee staff for not giving up  and being resilient in getting this done in a timely fashion. We urge  the Senate to do the same.   I want to also salute some family members: my sister-in-law, Maria,  who took care of my brother Emmanuel for so many years. He took care of  everyone in our community really as an old-fashioned family doctor and  called patients every night to make sure that they were okay. He  worried about us on a regular basis, the family, and never really cared  about himself. God bless  [[Page H6921]]  him for what he has done for our community and, again, for this bill.   I also thank my nieces, Evelyn and Stella; and my lovely, wonderful  wife for taking care of my mother-in-law for so many years.   This is quite an accomplishment. Again, we couldn't do it without  Representative Tonko, Representative Anna Eshoo, Ranking Member Pallone  and, of course, Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers, who has been wonderful.   Mr. Speaker, I urge unanimous support for this wonderful bill that  will do so much. I thank Michael J. Fox for his help. He has done so  much. We will find a cure. I encourage a ``yes'' vote on this  particular vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
