 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I want to add to the voice of so many  Senators today who expressed their prayers and concerns for the five  Americans who were wounded today in a terrible shooting in Alexandria,  VA: Steve Scalise, a friend of mine from the House of Representatives,  someone who took a bet on me early in my first campaign, as a  neighboring State, aspiring young candidate, and with whom I served for  2 years; Matt Mika, who represents the Tyson Foods, a great Arkansas  institution, and whom I have known since the beginning of my days of  politics; Zack Barth, a young House staffer; and Crystal Griner and  David Bailey, two brave Capitol police officers who were on the scene.   We don't yet know all of the details of what happened this morning.  Here is what we do know: If it weren't for the bravery of those Capitol  police officers--not just Crystal and David but the others present-- there might have been many more killed.   We all sit here safely engaged in the great debates of American  democracy--whether we are a Senator or whether we are Americans  watching it--because there are brave men and women literally standing  guard at our doors with guns, willing to put their lives on the line to  defend all of us.   I want to join so many other Senators today to express my gratitude  to the Capitol Police, not just for protecting us--535 elected Members  of Congress--but also for protecting all of the hundreds of thousands  of Americans who come here every single day of the year to see their  Congress and their Representatives doing the people's business.                  Honoring Private First Class Larry Roberts    Mr. President, speaking of men who guard us with guns, I want to turn  our attention to Arlington National Cemetery. After 74 years, an  American patriot has finally come home.   PFC Larry Roberts, of Damascus, AK, was only 18 years old at the time  of his final mission. It was November 1943--the height of World War II.  Private Roberts had been assigned to the Special Weapons Group, 2nd  Defense Battalion, Fleet Marine Force. U.S. forces were making their  way across the Pacific, island by island. That month, those marines  landed on tiny Betio in the Tarawa Atoll of the Gilbert Islands. The  mission? Take the island and advance on to Tokyo and victory. Private  Roberts and his battle buddies performed brilliantly, but the fighting  was fierce. One thousand marines and sailors were killed and 2,000 were  wounded. The Japanese fought to the last man standing. In the end we  won but at steep cost.   Private Roberts, like so many others, was killed on November 25,  1943. In the 2 years after the war, the 604th Quartermaster Graves  Registration Company tried to recover all of the remains on the  battlefield, but they never found any sign of Private Roberts. In 1949,  a military review board declared his remains nonrecoverable.   Just 2 years ago, the nonprofit History Flight discovered an until- then unknown burial site on the island and recovered remains of 35  marines who had died there. It took 2 years, but thanks to the amazing  work of the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, we were able to identify  the remains of Private First Class Roberts. It was heartening news,  especially to the Roberts family.   I am happy to say he has been laid to rest on American soil on our  most hallowed ground--Arlington National Cemetery. I had the honor of  attending his funeral earlier today. Now he rests amid the rolling  green hills and the ghostly white crosses of that cemetery. I think it  is more than fitting because his burial there is a symbol of what this  one person, this young man so far away from home, did for our country.  He gave his all-too-brief life in service to something greater than  himself. He gave his life and service to his country. He gave all his  tomorrows so you could have today and tomorrow.   I wanted to recognize him and his service on the Senate floor  tonight. Standing here, I think of the words of the great British  Parliamentarian William Gladstone: ``Show me the manner in which a  nation cares for its dead and I will measure with mathematical  exactness the tender mercies of its people, their respect for the laws  of the land, and their loyalty to high ideals.''   To the men and women of our Armed Forces, I want you to know that if  you are ever separated, captured, missing, or killed in action, our  country will spare no expense and will suffer any burden to bring you  back too.   PFC Larry Roberts died fighting for that highest ideal, that of  freedom. He would have been 92 years old this year. It is because of  him and his bravery and millions of Americans like him that our country  is still here, still standing, still free, as it has been for 241  years.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
