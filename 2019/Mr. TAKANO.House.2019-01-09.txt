 Madam Speaker, I rise today because nearly 500 Amtrak  workers in Riverside are being forced to uproot their lives or lose  everything they worked so hard for, a good, stable union job that pays  them well and gives them benefits.   This nightmare scenario is born out of a sudden decision by Amtrak to  shutter its call center in Riverside in what amounts to a union-busting  maneuver to outsource jobs and replace these employees with contractors  for lower pay.   Today, I want the Amtrak CEO to hear, not from me, but from Theresa  Kolaras, an Amtrak employee in Riverside, and U.S. Army veteran, who  will be losing her job on January 18 if Amtrak moves forward with this  call center closure. And here is what Theresa had to say:         Growing up, it was my dream to serve my country. That's why       I joined the JROTC program in high school. And after 9/11, I       enlisted with the U.S. Army with hopes of making a difference       and happy to have a career. My job wasn't glamorous. I was a       Unit Support Specialist, MOS 92 Yankee. But I was proud to be       serving during a difficult time for our country.        Unfortunately, just as my platoon was readying to deploy, I       suffered successive fractures in my foot that wouldn't heal.       I was honorably discharged due to the injury and, just like       that, my dreams were cut short. At the time, nothing saddened       me more than having to watch my friends deploy without me.        Saddled with my foot that wouldn't heal, I now had to       figure out what to do with my life. Jobs were hard to find       due to having to choose ones that kept me off my feet so       much. I found many odd jobs here and there and, within a few       years, I finally started a family and continued my education.        In 2014, I was ecstatic to find out I was hired with       Amtrak, as I come from a railroad family, and was proud to       continue that tradition. Being able to work at our call       center in Riverside was a blessing for my family and me.        Amtrak's reputation for its passengers and its employees       gave me hope for a brighter future. Living in California is       nearly impossible, with its high cost of living, especially       being a single mother of two boys.        I was able to take care of my kids on the great benefits       and wages at Amtrak. My boys love the train and enjoy our       many trips we were able to take.        Now, on November 14, I got a sudden awakening as I got       notice that Amtrak would be closing our call center in       Riverside.        Amtrak reassured us employees our jobs were secure. As       months went by, Amtrak started closing stations, putting       employees out of work, and many of us in Riverside started to       worry about our jobs.        Now that feeling of worry is a reality, and we're left       wondering why Amtrak has been so dishonest.        Amtrak sent out a letter to us stating that they are not       laying us off, but we are able to go to its Philadelphia call       center.        Now, I count myself among the great majority that just       can't pick up on short notice and leave. I have small       children and share custody, and I can't legally move my kids       out of state.        I honestly have no idea where my children and I will go. We       have a month to figure out where to live, as I can't pay rent       without a job, along with this injury that I still deal with       every day.        I am one of the many employees who are at a hardship, and a       few days away from closing we still don't have any real       answers or hope that we will at least have a severance       package.        Amtrak has been quiet, and I am still in disbelief that       this was once a company that was known for its employee and       customer loyalty. Many of us loved our jobs because we were       proud of the railroad, proud to wear the name, and proud to       help our customers plan their trips.        Now, at work these last few days, I see people with despair       in their faces and loss of hope in their eyes.        I still have hope that Amtrak will wake up and realize that       the direction they are going is hurting its customers and its       employees, which are their biggest fans. This decision is       both ethically and morally wrong.    I would like to thank Theresa for allowing me to read her powerful  statement to Amtrak's CEO.   As of today, 39 of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle, and I,  as well as Senator Feinstein and Senator Harris,  [[Page H294]]  have joined the Amtrak workers in this fight. We will do everything we  can do to fight this closure until the bitter end.                            ____________________
