 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join my Republican and Democratic  colleagues in both the House and the Senate in this effort to  demonstrate our commitment to the people of Taiwan and to affirm  Congress' constitutional authority on trade.   Every Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee has cosponsored this  bill, and just last week, this legislation passed out of the Ways and  Means Committee unanimously. I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.   Before turning to the substance of the bill today, I remind my  colleagues that the House Democrats improved the USMCA. Congress  improved both the substance of the trade agreement, especially on  matters related to labor, environment, and enforcement, and also the  process.   Our commitment to building a modern, proworker deal led to a trade  agreement that was endorsed by labor, the business community, and, most  importantly, the American people.   Congress' fierce leadership on the USMCA brought about an agreement  that reflects the priorities of House Democrats. For instance, we  fought hard to establish new structure for aggressive enforcement of  the USMCA and to back it up with funding for enforcement actions.   USMCA now stands as a powerful beacon for what is possible when it  comes to durable, enforceable trade agreements. I credit that to the  work and consensus building of Congress. It is the collaboration  between Congress and the executive branch that allows trade policy to  live up to its fullest potential and, in this critical moment, that  cannot be forgotten. This brings us to the legislation before us today,  the Taiwan Implementation Act.   This is a matter of standing up for the prerogatives of the Ways and  Means Committee. Congress is charged with trade responsibilities, and  trade falls to the Ways and Means Committee. I believe that you get  better outcomes when Congress is included in the trade negotiations,  and I believe that going forward making sure Congress is fully included  is not only sensible but will lead to a better outcome.   In short, Congress, and within Congress the Ways and Means Committee,  oversees trade policy. We should continue to defend that position.   I will now turn to our strong support for the people of Taiwan.  Congressional Democrats are unwavering in their support for the people  of Taiwan, a people who have built a robust and thriving democracy that  serves as a beacon in the region. As Taiwan faces incredible pressure  from its authoritarian neighbor, it is vital that this institution  stand and support our Democratic partner.   Strengthening bilateral trade relations with Taiwan also strengthens  our shared determination to preserve democracy at home and abroad. As  we see growing aggression by certain countries toward Democratic values  and troubling erosions of the rule of law, it is critical that American  trade policy reflect our global commitment to promoting democracy and  peace.   The Biden administration has reflected this commitment by  prioritizing America's economic and trade relationship with Taiwan, a  priority undoubtedly shared by Congress.   The Taiwan Implementation Act demonstrates Congress' strong support  for strengthening our bilateral trade relationship with Taiwan and our  commitment to ensure trade agreements are durable.   The U.S. Constitution gives Congress exclusive authority to regulate  foreign commerce. This legislation approves what the administration has  negotiated with Taiwan and sets forth strong consultation and  transparency requirements that ensure future trade agreements with  Taiwan carry the will of the American people behind them.   Trade impacts every part of people's lives; from the food we eat, to  the clothes we buy, to the cars we drive. It is critical that Congress  act to support this first trade agreement with Taiwan and ensure that  future trade agreements are subject to a congressional approval  process. The Ways and Means Committee is an important gatekeeper of our  trade priorities and the American people expect us to lead on these  matters.   The Taiwan Implementation Act affirms our authority to do just that,  while underscoring our shared commitment to furthering the deep,  economic, and people-to-people ties America enjoys with Taiwan.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I emphasize this bicameral,  bipartisan legislation affirms Congress' constitutional authority on  trade and will not only support Taiwan's democracy but strengthen our  bilateral trade relations.  [[Page H3054]]    I thank my colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, on the Ways  and Means Committee for supporting this legislation. I thank Senator  Wyden and Senator Crapo for working with the committee on this bill.  The people of Taiwan have built a robust, thriving democracy, and both  the Biden administration and Congress have recognized that deepening  our economic connection is a top priority.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1930
