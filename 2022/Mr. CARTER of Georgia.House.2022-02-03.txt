 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  of Georgia's very own college football legend, Larry Bruce Yawn.   Bruce was a native of Americus, Georgia, eventually moving to  Statesboro in 1959 where he would graduate from Statesboro High School  with a full scholarship to play for the University of Georgia's  football team.   While playing for the University of Georgia, Bruce was inducted into  the National Football Foundation College Hall of Fame, having played in  the Cotton Bowl, Liberty Bowl, and Sugar Bowl, and being a member of  the All-Academic SEC Team.   After graduating, Bruce went on to become the owner of the well-known  and community-loved Snooky's Restaurant in Statesboro until its closing  in 2012. Bruce went on to manage the Willow Pond Senior Center for  several years before retiring. His remaining years were spent with his  wife, Carol, and his children, who I know miss him dearly. His love for  his community, family, and friends is something we should all work to  build in ourselves.   Madam Speaker, having been a prominent member in his community and  church, Bruce's passing is felt by the entire community. My thoughts  and prayers are with his family and all who knew him during this time.                            ____________________
