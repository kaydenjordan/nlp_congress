 Madam President, today I honor a superb leader, liaison,  and soldier for his tireless commitment to the U.S. Army, which  includes 2 years of service with the Army Office of the Legislative  Liaison, as the chief of the Army's Senate Liaison Division. As COL  Nathan E. Cook II prepares to retire after 28 years of dedicated and  distinguished service to our Nation, I believe it is fitting to  recognize his exceptional service and relationship with this Chamber.   Colonel Cook's congressional liaison assignment is only the capstone  to what has been an outstanding career of service to the Army and our  Nation. Colonel Cook is a 1993 graduate of The United States Military  Academy at West Point. He was commissioned into the Army as a field  artillery officer and has served in command and staff positions from  the tactical to the strategic level in the 2d Armored Division, 4th  Infantry Division, 8th Army, 3d Infantry Division, 1st Cavalry  Division, Headquarters Resolute Support, and Headquarters Department of  the Army. He has led our Nation's soldiers during multiple combat tours  in Iraq and Afghanistan during OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM, OPERATION NEW  DAWN, and OPERATION RESOLUTE SUPPORT. Likewise, he commanded our  soldiers in combat as the commander of the 3d Battalion, 82d Field  Artillery Regiment from Fort Hood, TX, and the 75th Field Artillery  Brigade from Fort Sill, OK. Prior to his assignment as the chief of the  Army's Senate Liaison Division, he served as the senior advisor to the  Afghan Minister of Defense, where he provided timely and critical  advice across the Ministry of Defense and the NATO coalition. The Army  has continuously relied upon Colonel Cook for his exceptional  leadership and unparalleled work ethic throughout his career.   Over the course of the last few years, Colonel Cook's tireless  efforts proved invaluable in broadening the understanding of Members  and staff on Army priorities, policies, and initiatives that ultimately  provided resources and authorities for the Army and enhanced trust and  confidence across the Senate. He managed all of this while leading and  managing numerous congressional delegations to various locations around  the world. Colonel Cook has become a trusted adviser and friend to many  of us, distinguishing himself by continuously going above and beyond  the call of duty to serve the needs of Congress.   This Chamber will feel Colonel Cook's absence. I join many past and  present Members of Congress in my gratitude and appreciation to Colonel  Cook for his outstanding leadership and unwavering support. There is no  doubt that the strength of our soldiers comes from their families.  Colonel Cook's strength comes from his wife Traci and his two sons,  Nathan and Joshua. This Nation is grateful for their commitment and  personal sacrifices made throughout Colonel Cook's career.   On behalf of the U.S. Senate and the United States of America, I  commend Colonel Cook for his tireless efforts in the support of our  Army, our military, and our Nation. As Nate and his family transition  from the military, I congratulate him on completing an extremely  successful military career and wish all of them the best in all their  future endeavors.                            ____________________
