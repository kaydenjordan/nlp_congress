 Mr. President, as the American people  continue to show great strength and perseverance during this  coronavirus crisis, I would like to take this opportunity to highlight  those very American ideals by commemorating the 100th anniversary of  the Jones Act.   The Jones Act has enhanced American prosperity and national security  ever since its enactment on June 5, 1920. It puts America first over  subsidized foreign shipbuilders and foreign vessel operators that do  not pay U.S. taxes or comply with U.S. regulations. It continues to  preserve our role as the world's leader in commerce and thousands of  precious jobs for our American citizens. When it comes to the Jones  Act, there is an overwhelming sense of pride from the American people,  especially from Mississippians.   Mississippi has a long and storied shipbuilding tradition of which we  are very proud. Mississippi is home to multiple shipyards that continue  to grow domestic jobs exponentially, increase overall positive economic  impact, and produce a multitude of vessels to fortify national security  and commerce. With more than 13,000 domestic maritime jobs, Mississippi  ranks 15th in the Nation for jobs related to the domestic maritime  industry.   In addition, Mississippi ranks second nationwide in per capita  shipyard jobs, meaning that one out of every 75 Mississippians has a  job directly or indirectly related to the shipyard industry. When  looking at the total economic impact from domestic maritime activity,  Mississippi accounts for more than $3 billion annually. It is  sufficient to say Mississippi is one of many States that continues to  reap and sow the rewards of the Jones Act.   Mr. President, there are more than 40,000 vessels in America's  domestic fleet, which is one of the largest in the world. The domestic  maritime industry accounts for 648,220 jobs, $41.6 billion in labor  compensation, $154.8 billion in economic output, $72.4 billion in value  added, and $16.8 billion in taxes.   The Jones Act is an integral part of our Nation's success, and I am  proud to recognize its longstanding contributions to our Nation and to  advocate for its continued influence in the decades to come.                            ____________________
