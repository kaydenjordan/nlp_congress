 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call out the  blatant racism in the President's tweets.   I believe his rant and his defense of that rant merit censure from  this body.   The phrase ``Go back where you came from'' is a racist trope that has  been used by segregationists, neo-Nazis, White nationalists, and the Ku  Klux Klansmen to create a framework in which non-White people are not  truly American.   Describing non-White countries as ``broken'' and ``crime infested''  echoes the racist trope the President has used before that such  countries are dysfunctional, dirty, and violent because their  populations are Black.   His comments are indefensible, and so is the silence from my  colleagues across the aisle.   Mr. Speaker, I wouldn't bother seeking an apology from him, but I do  hope Republicans here will join us in fully and roundly condemning his  words, and I would remind them that history won't look kindly on those  who refuse to stand up for what is right.   It is not lost on me, however, and I hope not my colleagues either,  that this is simply a distraction from the President's friendship with  a documented pedophile and news reports that he lied to the Supreme  Court about his census question.
