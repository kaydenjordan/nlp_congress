 Madam Speaker, September is Peripheral Artery Disease  Awareness Month.   Known as PAD, it is a life-threatening and chronic circulatory  condition. It causes blood vessels from the heart to the legs to  narrow, slows or blocks blood from getting into the legs of sufferers,  and could lead to unnecessary amputation.   Far too little is known about an illness that afflicts almost 20  million  [[Page H7549]]  Americans today and could lead to 3.6 million Americans losing a leg in  the next 30 years, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins  University.   It is a personal battle for me as an African American who suffers  from diabetes. The disease is three times more likely to affect African  Americans, and diabetes is one of the high-risk factors.   Fortunately, it is easy to prevent. That is why I started the  Congressional PAD Caucus in the House with my colleague, Gus Bilirakis  from Florida.   Amputation is one of the most physically and emotionally damaging  injuries a person can experience, especially if it is unnecessary. We  need to focus more attention and resources to a problem with a clear  solution and save sufferers and families an unnecessary trauma.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, let me first thank the gentlewoman from  California for those kind remarks. She has been a consummate fighter  for equality for all people across this world, a true humanitarian in  her own right, from Oakland, California.   I had the great honor, during the time we celebrated her birthday, to  see a picture of her with this Afro that was indicative of the times.  It was perfect, and I was not surprised.   But her work in the Congress is second to none, and she has been a  true role model for me, a true friend to my father. He always had high  accolades for the gentlewoman from California, and now that I am her  colleague, I understand why.   Madam Speaker, this year marks what I would call ``America's Great  Economic Shame.''   In 1619, the first boats filled with victims of human bondage reached  our shores. When they docked, the very first African Americans walked  off a plank and into American history. They would create a dilemma for  the leaders and citizens of this new republic that has not been solved  to this day.   They were considered unequal in a country where all men were created  equal. Their existence would cause otherwise pious and moral men to  engage in the most immoral behavior. And they came together to fight  for one goal: the belief that one day, someday, they would be free at  last.   As we commemorate the 400th anniversary of enslaved Africans reaching  this land, America, it is important to discuss how far African  Americans have come as a culture and a community and how far we have  yet to go.   When I look around this Chamber, I see the results of how far we have  come. There are now 55 African Americans in the United States House of  Representatives, led by a champion of our commitment to freedom,  Congressman   John Lewis.   This representation would have seemed impossible 400 years ago. Back  then, African Americans were considered property. Back then, families  could be torn apart for a greater economic interest. Back then, African  Americans in slave States could be killed for something as simple as  learning to read.   We did not ask to be slaves, yet we triumphed in spite of it. We knew  they might own our bodies, but they would never control our spirit.   We have succeeded in every area of American life. Let us look at just  a few ways that we have altered America for the better.   It is easy to talk about how almost every original American music  style comes from our community, everything from jazz to blues to hip- hop, but there are several inventions we use daily that came from  African Americans.   We invented America's first clock and then the first automatic  elevator doors.   We invented the traffic light.   We invented the clothes dryer and the electric lamp.   We invented the ice cream scoop, the lawnmower, the mailbox, and even  the heart pacemaker.   We have triumphed over tragedy, but we still have a way to go.   Right now, local, State, and national politicians are trying to  reverse our civil rights. They could work to support us; instead, they  want to deny us our vote. That is why we need to stick together and  avoid the desire to focus on our differences.   It is important that we remember that it was coming together as a  community that helped us survive the horrors of slavery; that it was  our commitment to the common ideals of brotherhood, sisterhood, and  family that helped us succeed. We need to remember that.   In these times where forces try to tear us apart, it is our common  ancestry that can bring us together. It was true 400 years ago, and it  is true today.
