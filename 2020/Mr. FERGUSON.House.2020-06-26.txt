 Madam Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of  the majority leader the schedule for the week to come. I yield to my  friend from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the majority leader.    Madam Speaker, I very much appreciate that update.   Question: Does the gentleman expect to consider amendments to H.R. 2,  the transportation bill, on the floor next week?   I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Madam Speaker, I am happy to hear that. But it seems  kind of odd that this week, when we were considering the police reform  bill, there were no amendment considerations.    I believe the majority leader, Madam Speaker, said on the floor that  we have constraints on amendments because of the coronavirus. So I ask,  if there were amendment constraints this week, do those same  constraints exist next week?    Well, I certainly appreciate that, but I was a little  disappointed this week, in the fact that I thought we had a chance to  make the police reform bill better. It was a genuine effort on both  sides of the aisle to have this discussion.   But once again, the Republican voice was left out. There were some  really good amendments and ideas from my side that simply did not gain  consideration on the floor, and they should have.   One such example was the Cline amendment that really would have  discouraged collective bargaining agreements with organizations that  really kind of had poor officer disciplinary tactics, something that  could have fundamentally changed how departments operate in big cities.   But anyway, it is a disappointment. I hate that we did not get to do  that.    I yield to the gentleman.    Reclaiming my time, those words are fine now. But when  we talk about having agreement and talk about having those discussions,  Madam Speaker, clearly, the committee and this body should be  considering it as an entire body. The opportunity for us to consider  those amendments here on the floor of the House is really important.   But we understand that the minority in the Senate blocked debate and  continuation of Mr. Scott's bill, Senator Scott's bill, which was,  quite candidly, an excellent piece of legislation. If anyone has not  seen his remarks on the Senate floor and his speech, I would highly  encourage you to do it.   That was a disappointment. But then, to hear the majority leader say  that we are going to eliminate debate in this House simply to do it in  conference, I think we deserve a better opportunity than that.   But I understand. You are in the majority, and that is the way that  you all have chosen to do that. But, hopefully, we can get to that  point where we can have those honest debates right here on the House  floor.    For just a minute.    It seems to me that I voted on a lot more amendments  last year than I have this year. We probably did have more closed  bills, but we seemed to have a lot more legislative activity. It seemed  to be a lot more productive.   But anyway, Madam Speaker, another thing that is concerning to me is  that I am disappointed about what has transpired in the House over the  recent weeks. For the first time in 230 years, Members had to elect to  come to D.C. to represent their constituents, but they no longer need  to do that. Instead, they can now turn their voting cards over to  another Member, including Speaker Pelosi, or any other Member, and have  them vote in their place using this new proxy vote scheme.   One thing that I am thankful for is that the covered period for this  laid out by the Speaker comes to an end July Fourth, and we look  forward to seeing all the Members come back to do their jobs.   Since many States are fully reopened, and even here in D.C., phase 2  reopening is in its place, and you can go to restaurants and gyms. As a  matter of fact, we can even now go to the House gym again. And most  employees are returning to work.   With that said, I would like to confirm with the gentleman that he  does not plan to extend the July Fourth covered period and continue  this absurd proxy voting scheme.    Well, certainly, we want to be safe and thoughtful  about what we do. But I think America--I think we have done an  excellent job of what we set out to do, which was not to stop the  spread of this virus, but it was to slow the spread of the virus.   Not a single one of us, not a single person in America, wanted to see  one of our fellow Americans suffer because there was no room for them  in a healthcare facility where they needed it. And I think that we have  done that. I think America has shown that they have had the discipline  to say at home and to bend the infection rate curve down.   So, sure, there will be more Americans that contract COVID. But thank  goodness that our healthcare system is strong enough and intact that we  have the capacity to take care of the most vulnerable.   Speaking of that, I think, as I have watched a lot of the news, a lot  of the data, I am very, very, very concerned about the most vulnerable  in our Nation. I think one of the most horrific things that has  happened seems to be the blatant disregard for rules from CDC and CMS  by some Governors, where they returned COVID-positive patients to the  nursing homes, where they were able to infect the most vulnerable.   So, I would ask the majority leader, do you think that there will be  legislation considering how to protect our patients in nursing homes  and also to really hold those accountable that violated the rules and  were reckless with our fellow Americans' lives?    I yield to the gentleman.    Reclaiming my time for just a minute, sir, I would  refer you to the special committee led by the gentleman from South  Carolina, Mr. Clyburn. And I would refer you to the data that is coming  out of that committee that clearly indicates where those particular  States are.    And every one is a tragic loss.                                time  1515     Madam Speaker, reclaiming my time, I am certainly glad  to hear that my colleague from Maryland is truly committed to making  sure that every single American stays as safe as they possibly can.  When those incidents occurred where rules were violated, regulations  were disregarded, there was, in fact, harm caused to our fellow  Americans.   I tell my friend I am glad to know he is as committed to getting to  the bottom of that as well, because I believe he is a man of honor and  integrity. I believe his commitment to lead it to going to where the  data and facts are, I tell my friend I am awfully glad to hear that.    I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Oh, Madam Speaker, not only is there an expectation,  there is gratitude for the work that the President and the  administration have done to get information out, to expand testing, to  go out to make sure that the resources were delivered to our colleagues  in the great State of New York, resources there to build extra hospital  beds that nursing home patients could have gone to but, unfortunately,  were sent back to their nursing homes.   Yes, I am grateful not only for his commitment to America, but I am  grateful for the fact that he has helped lead this country and will  continue to lead this country back. So, yes, we should all expect a lot  of ourselves. We should be committed to the greatness of this country,  as I know that we all are.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
