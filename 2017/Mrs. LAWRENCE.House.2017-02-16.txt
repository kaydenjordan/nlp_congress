 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to  H.J. Res. 43, yet another partisan attack against women's health care.   For more than four decades, title X has helped some of the most  underserved women in our country get access to family planning services  that otherwise would not have been received.   Once again, some of my colleagues believe that they have the right to  impose their beliefs on a nonpartisan issue. Instead of allowing women  to choose family planning services that are right for them, this  Chamber is voting to take that choice away. Instead of attacking  legitimate title X qualified providers who serve women across our  country, our Chamber should be working to ensure that all Americans  have the right to quality health care.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stop this attack on women's  health care. I urge my colleagues to defeat this resolution.
