 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment would exempt from the bill any  regulations that pertain to nuclear reactor safety. In other words, my  amendment would allow the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or the NRC to  continue to issue rules under the current system, thereby making it  easier to protect Americans from potential nuclear disaster.   The underlying legislation, the REINS Act, would grind the gears of  rulemaking to a halt by requiring all major rules to be affirmatively  approved in advance by Congress. A regulation would be blocked from  being implemented if even one Chamber declines to pass an approval  resolution. The goal of this legislation, quite simply, is to stop the  regulatory process in its tracks, regardless of the impact on public  health and safety.   One example that highlights the risks and dangers of this legislation  is  [[Page H142]]  the subject of this amendment: Nuclear power.   The world watched in horror when an earthquake and resulting tsunami  devastated the area around Fukushima, Japan, a few years ago. That  disaster then caused its own disaster--the meltdown of three reactors  at the Fukushima nuclear power plant. The meltdown led to the release  of radioactive isotopes, the creation of a 20-kilometer exclusion zone  around the power plant, and the displacement, consequently, of 156,000  people. Just last month, seaborne radiation from Fukushima was even  detected on the West Coast of the United States.   The same year as the Fukushima meltdown, Virginia was struck by a  relatively rare but strong earthquake, felt up and down the eastern  seaboard. While the region was spared a similar disaster, the  earthquake required a nuclear power plant near the epicenter to go  offline as a precaution and served as a wake-up call that our nuclear  reactors needed additional safety protocols.   For me, this concern hits close to home. A nuclear power plant,  Indian Point, which has suffered numerous malfunctions in recent years,  lies just less than 40 miles away from my New York City district, about  30 miles away from the city. Twenty million people live within a 50- mile radius around the plant, the same radius used by the NRC as the  basis for the evacuation zone recommended after the Fukushima disaster.                                time  1645    Indian Point also sits near two earthquake fault lines and, according  to the NRC, is the most likely nuclear power plant in the country to  experience core damage because of an earthquake.   Because of the catastrophes that can result from disasters, be they  natural or manmade at nuclear power plants, prevention of meltdowns is  absolutely vital. Since Fukushima, the NRC has issued new rules  designed to upgrade power plants to withstand severe events like  earthquakes, and to have enough backup power so as to avoid a meltdown  for a significant length of time.   The NRC must retain the ability to issue new regulations to safeguard  the health and well-being of all Americans. However, this bill is  intentionally designed so that new and important regulations, including  those to prevent a nuclear power plant meltdown which could affect  millions of American, will likely never be put in place, thwarted by  either chamber of Congress.   Congress delegates authority to executive agencies because we do not  have the expertise or time to craft all technical regulations  ourselves. We should defer to the engineers and scientists at the NRC  who determine, after careful study, that a particular regulation is  critical to our safety and to the safe operation of a nuclear power  plant. This bill, however, would all too easily allow Members of  Congress to substitute their own judgment or, most likely, the wishes  of a narrow group of special interests.   This week we began a new Congress. Later this month we will have a  new administration, all controlled by Republicans. Between this bill  and the Midnight Rules bill we passed yesterday, they have chosen to  make their first order of business the dismantling and destruction of  the regulatory process, regardless of the impact on public health and  safety. This gives us a good idea of the priorities we should expect to  see in the next 2 years.   The least we can do is to try to ensure that the antiregulatory  agenda of the Republicans does not have devastating consequences such  as a nuclear meltdown. I urge my colleagues to support the Nadler  amendment to exempt nuclear safety regulations from the onerous  requirements of the underlying bill.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, nuclear meltdowns are a tremendous danger  to the life and safety of millions of Americans. The Congressional  Review Act provides if the NRC makes such a regulation, Congress can  say no. That is appropriate. But to say Congress has to approve any  regulation in advance, when there may be thousands of regulations or  hundreds of regulations from different agencies, they may not get to  it. We may not have time to study it, and lives are at stake. It does  not make sense. That is why this amendment at least cuts out nuclear  meltdown regulations, nuclear safety regulations, to say Congress can  veto them if they don't agree. But the agency should be able to  promulgate it in the absence of congressional veto.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
