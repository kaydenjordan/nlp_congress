 Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague from Arkansas, Mr.  Westerman, for his hard work on the Resilient Federal Forests Act.   I would like to be able to submit that if you actually care about  helping our forests, if you care about our watersheds, if you care  about wildlife habitat, if you care about outdoor recreation, if you  care about responsible job development, if you care about being able to  provide funding for our schools, this is a piece of legislation to be  able to try and achieve a win-win-win, literally, for our communities.   We have seen 7 million acres, Mr. Chairman, burn in the West in 2017  alone. We have seen our forests devastated. We have seen over half of  the budget of the Forest Service being used to fight forest fires.   Is there a better way?   The better way can be found in this piece of legislation, to be able  to not only address what we must address, in terms of fighting forest  fires when they break out, but also to be able to have a responsible,  proactive management forest to be able to make sure that we are  creating healthy forests.   Mr. Chairman, as I travel throughout my district, I am now looking at  forests that my great-grandchildren will not see as I saw them as a  young boy growing up. It is time that we actually have legislation that  doesn't just be reactive to the problem that we face when it comes to  forest management but be proactive. This legislation will achieve that  goal.   And, again, I applaud Mr. Westerman and the Committee on Natural  Resources for their hard work on this.                                time  1615
