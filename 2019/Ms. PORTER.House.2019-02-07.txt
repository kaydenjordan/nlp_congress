 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island  (Mr. Cicilline), my friend and a member of the Judiciary Committee, a  leader in responding to the American people who broadly support gun  violence prevention.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Cicilline for his words and his  passion and his leadership on this issue.   As he said, one of the most basic functions of our government doing  our jobs is to keep American families safe and secure. For too long,  Congress has put fealty to the special interest of the gun lobby ahead  of our safety.   Mr. Speaker, the prevalence of gun violence in our country is  horrifying. For 15- to 24-year-olds, the gun murder rate here in  America is 49 times higher than our peer nations. Our children and my  children go to school with the fear that their school, that their  classroom, could be the next mass shooting site.   Guns are the second leading cause of death for our American children  and teens. Nearly 1,700 children are killed by guns each year. Our  country's gun violence epidemic is not normal. While we have about 5  percent of the world's population, we have about 15 percent of  noncombat-related gun violence.   The fact is that no other country on this planet even remotely comes  close to ours on the problem of gun violence.   It has been almost a year since the Parkland school shooting and more  than 6 years since the Sandy Hook shooting. And until this Congress,  there has not been any change coming out of Washington.   Yesterday, we took an important first step. As my colleague, Mr.  Cicilline, recognized, the House held its first hearing in 8 years on  taking action to prevent gun violence in America. It is a shame, Mr.  Speaker, that it took 8 years to hold that hearing.   Next week will be the markup of historic legislation, H.R. 8, the  bipartisan background check bill. Now more than ever, we need to insist  that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle stand up to the gun  lobby and stand up to join in the fight to end gun violence.   Six of the deadliest mass shootings in our Nation's entire history  happened in the last decade, a decade in which Congress did nothing to  reduce preventable gun deaths.   We cannot continue, we should not continue, to ignore the demands of  mothers, of grandmothers, of grandparents, of teachers, of nurses, of  emergency room physicians who are concerned, like all of us, about  violent gun deaths and about children being killed in their schools and  in their communities.   We need to be leaders, not shills for the gun lobby, not cowards  afraid of losing an A rating. Our children deserve courage. They  deserve the courage of this Congress. Our children deserve leaders who  will fight to ensure that families are safe at school, at movie  theaters, at concerts.   I will not be bought, and I will not be silenced by the gun lobby or  by the President.                                time  1815    The midterm elections made clear that voters want lawmakers to put  the safety of our children and our families first. We must end the  insidious buying off of politicians by the gun lobby.   Americans overwhelmingly support commonsense gun safety reforms like  H.R. 8, which implements mandatory background checks on all gun sales  and transfers. Ninety-seven percent of Americans want laws like this  implemented.   Since the Brady Bill was passed 25 years ago, over 3 million attempts  to purchase firearms have been blocked because of background checks.  Yet, one out of five guns is still sold without a background check.   We also need commitment and action by Congress to reinstate CDC,  Centers for Disease Control, funding to study how best to prevent gun  violence. More than three-quarters of Americans support the CDC  conducting research on gun violence as a public health issue.   Yet, for decades, Republicans in Congress have prevented us from  studying the factors that contribute to accidental deaths, suicides,  and homicide by firearms. And without that information, without that  research, we cannot have a full understanding of how to exercise our  duty to keep American families safe and to prevent unnecessary loss of  life.   These are not radical ideas. They are commonsense American solutions  that are being held hostage by the gun lobby.   My home, Orange County, has made its feelings heard time and again,  that it wants to strengthen gun violence prevention laws. Keeping our  families safe is at the heart of our values.   I am particularly inspired by the advocacy of those in our community  who have experienced loss and suffering from gun violence and, yet,  found the strength to dedicate their lives to making sure that others  don't experience similar tragedies.  [[Page H1440]]    I would like to highlight the story of one such couple, Mary Leigh  and Charlie Blek, from Orange County, California. These loving parents  led the fight in my district and in California, for commonsense gun  legislation.   Mary Leigh and Charlie's son, Matthew, was only 21 years old when he  was shot and killed. He was a victim of an armed robbery by teens using  a small handgun, also known as a ``Saturday Night Special'' or a ``junk  gun.''   In memory of their son, the Bleks founded the Orange County Citizens  for the Prevention of Gun Violence in 1995. For five long, hard-fought  years, they advocated for safety regulations that would rid California  of the type of gun that killed their son, and they succeeded.   California used to produce 80 percent of the junk guns for the  Nation. California no longer produces these junk guns, and has enacted  safety standards for handguns that are working to reduce gun violence  deaths.   Still today, the Bleks are vigilant in preventing the gun lobby from  finding new ways to sell dangerous handguns in California. They now  lead the Orange County Chapter of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun  Violence, and I am personally very grateful for their efforts, their  leadership, and their courage.   No family should ever have to go through what the Bleks suffered, but  too many in our own communities have. Since the beginning of 2014, in  California, over 14,000 people, 14,000 people, including 120 law  enforcement officers, have been injured or killed from gun violence.  Forty-seven of those people hurt or killed were in my district, the  45th district. We have lost 34 members of our communities in just 4  years, all to gun violence.   This is a public safety problem, and, Mr. Speaker, doing nothing is  unacceptable. This issue affects all of us, young and old alike.   Just last week, I received 60 letters, 60 letters from constituents  living at Heritage Point, a senior community, each letter asking me to  take action to prevent so many senseless deaths. These letters said:  ``Most of us have families, children, grandchildren, and even great  grandchildren. We have much anguish due to the recent and terrible  shootings taking place almost in our own backyard.''   Gun violence destroys families and communities. We must work together  to keep dangerous weapons out of the hands of dangerous people.   We cannot allow the frequent news of gun violence to desensitize us  into believing it is the norm. It is not the norm, and it is not  unavoidable. There is something we can do to prevent gun violence.   If Congress puts people first, people ahead of the gun lobby, we can  save hundreds of lives each year. Our role, as elected Representatives,  is to prioritize and fight for the well-being of our constituents and  our communities, not the score we are assigned by the gun lobby.   Standing up to powerful special interests is a radical transformation  of how Congress operates, but that change is long overdue.   We need commitment and action by Congress to pass commonsense gun  laws like H.R. 8, to expand background checks. We need to fund CDC  research on firearms and the impacts of gun violence.   Without Congress' action, if we simply offer thoughts and prayers,  but do nothing, our children, our families, our communities, will  increasingly suffer from preventable injuries, preventable suicides,  and preventable homicides, preventable shooting massacres, and the fear  and trauma associated with gun violence.   Gun violence is an epidemic, and we can no longer afford to point  fingers or to place blame. We must act. On both sides of the aisle, we  must have the courage to fight gun violence for the common good of the  American people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
