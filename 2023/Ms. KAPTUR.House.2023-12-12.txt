 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material in the Record.    Madam Speaker, I rise tonight as co-chair and a founding  member of the bipartisan, 94-member Congressional Ukraine Caucus. Our  caucus supports the immediate consideration of legislation that will  provide further supplemental funding for Ukraine to support our partner  in liberty against the aggression of Putin's tyranny.   This is a moral struggle for liberty in our era. Liberty faces a new  era of conflict being forced upon the free world by a burgeoning axis  of tyranny and terrorism, including the likes of Russia, China, Iran,  Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis. Ukraine is the scrimmage line of  that conflict for liberty. Their fight is our fight. The America I know  does not cower in the face of tyranny.   Many Americans believe that the history of the struggle against  global tyranny ended with the defeat of Nazi Germany and the fall of  the Soviet Union. I am here today to tell them that liberty's history  is still being written. We face not a new enemy but an old one. This is  not a new struggle but one which America and our alliances of free  nations have fought for nearly a century. Ukraine has fought for its  liberty for centuries.  [[Page H6844]]    Let us not forget a key reason why there is a war in Ukraine. When  the Soviet Union collapsed, as a newly independent nation in 1991, it  became the third largest nuclear power in the world. However, as a  responsible nation, Ukraine signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation  of Nuclear Weapons at the behest of the United States and the demand of  Russia and gave up its stockpile of nuclear weapons.   In exchange, Ukraine's security was to be guaranteed under the 1994  Budapest Memorandum signed by the United States, Russia, and the United  Kingdom. However, Russia, even though it was the recipient of Ukraine's  nuclear arsenal, betrayed its commitments when it invaded Ukraine in  2014. We must not betray ours.   Ukraine has been building her fledgling democracy since 1991  following the collapse of the Soviet Union's tyranny that President  Ronald Reagan called the ``evil empire.'' That remains one of the most  consequential moments in world history. Liberty won. Ukraine has faced  many challenges in her endeavor for liberty as it steadfastly moves to  join the European Union of free nations, America's closest allies.   To thwart Ukraine's desire for liberty and independence from Russia's  malevolent influence, Putin first invaded Ukraine in 2014, 4 days after  Russia's hosting the international Sochi Olympics with all of that  fancy publicity. Now, 8 years later, Putin launched his war of  unprovoked aggression on Ukraine in 2022. Much of the world was  convinced there was no way the Ukrainian David could defeat a Russian  Goliath. Ukraine's entire territory encompasses only 3 percent of the  territory of Russia and its population is only 25 percent of Russia's,  and yet Ukraine fights and fights hard. She has never asked us to fight  for her, only for global allies to arm her so she can defend herself.  So far, we have done so, and to great effect. We must stay the course,  not waiver.   President Zelenskyy, who is again visiting Washington today, and the  Ukrainian people have stood up to Putin. Ukraine's valiant soldiers  have actually moved their military to liberate 50 percent of all the  territory that was once occupied by Russian tyranny and decimated as  much as 40 percent of Russia's military capacity.   It is important to put the resources that we have provided for  Ukraine's defense against Russia into perspective. To date, Congress,  in a repeated bipartisan fashion, has appropriated roughly $113 billion  for Ukraine, of which every penny has been accounted for.   Furthermore, we know that at least 60 percent of the money that is  appropriated for Ukraine is spent right here in the United States, not  in Ukraine, to purchase important commodities. It is funding that is  going directly toward bolstering our diminished military industrial  base, and our American workforce benefits, including those in Lima,  Ohio, which produces the greatest tank in the world, the Abrams tank.  Every dollar spent is closely and appropriately accounted for to ensure  none of the funds fall into the wrong hands.   During the Cold War, we spent $13 trillion measured in 1996 dollars  to combat Russian aggression, equivalent to $26 trillion today. The sum  per year that we provide supporting Ukraine is no more than 20 percent  of what we spent each year for four decades to contain Russia.   America's alliance with our NATO partners has helped ensure European  nations have bolstered our support to Ukraine with their own. As a  percent of GDP, 15 European countries have so far provided a higher  level to Ukraine than the United States.   This is the costliest war in human casualties and plunder since World  War II in Europe, the continent on which over 500,000 U.S. soldiers are  buried from World War I and World War II. They bequeathed liberty to  us, and we must never fail their memory. The murderous dictatorships of  Nazism, communism, and imperialism lay dead, and the 20th century's  most consequential achievement was, in fact, that. Now, that cost in  blood is being borne by Ukraine and the Ukrainian people alone.   The fact remains that if America were to end its support of Ukraine,  Russia would be able to defeat it. Putin is not counting the numbers of  rubles or Russian lives he is spending on this conflict. What he  is counting are the number of votes for Ukraine that remain in this  U.S. Congress. He knows that American support will decide the victor of  this conflict. So should we.    If Putin succeeds in Ukraine or if we grow tired of a forever war we  are not even fighting in, then we allow tyranny to ascend over liberty.  Putin has made clear he would then test our resolve over smaller, much  harder-to-defend NATO members, a move that would force the United  States and our NATO allies into direct war with Russia. America and the  free world have much at stake.   As one European ambassador reminded me, there is an old saying that  states: If you think you are an isolationist, if you take no interest  in foreign affairs, take my word, foreign affairs will find you.   We face a choice now. America can repeat the mistakes of the 1920s by  withdrawing our nearly century-long support for liberty, inevitably  forcing the free world to pay a higher price for freedom as tyranny  deepens its roots in our world, or America must take a stand now and  provide further funding for Ukraine to help secure liberty for a new  generation.   I call upon the Speaker and my colleagues in the House to choose the  path of liberty.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Rogers).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York  [[Page H6845]]  (Mr. Meeks), the esteemed ranking member of the Foreign Affairs  Committee.

Madam Speaker, I make a plea to Speaker Johnson and our  colleagues on both sides of the aisle, please give Vladimir Putin no  succor. Stand up for liberty. This is the moment for Ukraine. Let us  seize it. Let us seize it.                            ____________________
