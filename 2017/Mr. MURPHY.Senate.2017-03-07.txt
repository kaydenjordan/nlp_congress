[[Page S1622]]         Mr. President, I ask unanimous request that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.  [[Page S1622]]         Mr. President, TrumpCare is here, and you are going to  hate it. This replacement for the Affordable Care Act has been 7 years  in the making. On a cursory overview, it appears that when you ask the  question as to who gets hurt under the replacement plan, the answer is  everyone, with the exception of insurance companies, drug companies,  and the very wealthy.   I hope we are able to step back and take our time to analyze what  this replacement plan is going to do to Americans who badly need  healthcare, who believed Republicans when they told them that they were  going to repeal the bill and replace it with something better, and who  believed President Trump when he said that he was going to repeal the  Affordable Care Act and replace it with something that was wonderful,  that insured everybody who was insured under the Affordable Care Act  and did it at lower costs.   I know that my colleagues who are well meaning in this Chamber cannot  read this replacement plan and understand it to do anything but strip  coverage away from millions of Americans and to drive up costs for  millions of Americans. There is no credible way to look at this  replacement plan without seeing the devastation that will be wrought.   I want to spend just a few minutes, now that we have had this plan to  look at for 24 hours, talking about how dangerous it is and pleading  with my Republican colleagues to take their time and, hopefully, decide  instead to work with Democrats to try to strengthen the Affordable Care  Act, fix what is not working as well, but preserve the parts that are  working.   Here is what I mean when I say that everyone, with the exception of  insurance companies, drug companies, and the superrich, is hurt by the  GOP replacement plan. First, this idea that we are going to end the  Medicaid expansion--that is what this replacement plan does. It says  that in 2 years, effectively 2020, the Medicaid expansion will go away.  That means in my State, 200,000 people will lose healthcare. Millions  across the country will lose healthcare. They are, by and large, the  poor and the lower middle class--largely women and children who can't  get insurance other than through the Medicaid expansion--who will no  longer be able to get it. Medicaid has been expanded in Democratic  States, Republican States, blue States, red States. Letting Medicaid  expansion hang around for 2 years is no solace to people who will jam  into those years as much healthcare as they can get, but then be  without it afterwards.   Even more insidious is the part of the GOP healthcare replacement  plan that would turn Medicaid into a block grant after 2020. This has  been talked about in conservative circles for a long time, but has been  resisted, again, by Democrats and Republicans who understand what that  means. It means Medicaid will eventually wither on the vine and will  become a State responsibility. No longer will the Federal Government  help States pick up the costs for insuring the most vulnerable  citizens.   Remember who Medicaid covers. Medicaid covers 60 percent of children  with disabilities in this country. Of the tens of millions of kids  living with disabilities, 6 out of 10 of them get their insurance from  Medicaid. If Medicaid is turned into a block grant, let me just tell  you, let me guarantee you that healthcare will end for millions of  those kids. If it does not end, it will be dramatically scaled back  because States cannot afford to pick up 60, 70, 80 percent eventually  of the cost.    Thirty percent of non-elderly adults with disabilities are covered by  Medicaid. Sixty-four percent of nursing home residents are covered by  Medicaid. Two out of every three of our senior citizens who are living  in nursing homes are covered by Medicaid. If you block-grant Medicaid,  all of a sudden States will not be able to pick up those costs and will  not be able to deliver healthcare to people in nursing homes. That is  just the truth.   The Republican bill effectively ends coverage for 11 million people  all across this country who are covered by the Medicaid expansion after  2 years, and then it jeopardizes care for tens of millions more by  dramatically cutting the Medicaid Program and the Medicaid  reimbursement to States. This is not a game; this is 11 million people.   Remember, it is not a guess because in 2020 you will be reverting  back to the rules before the Affordable Care Act. Before the Affordable  Care Act, 11 million fewer people were covered under Medicaid. Even if  States maybe hang around and decide to front the billions of dollars  necessary to cover a few million of those, you are still talking about  5, 6, 7, 8, 9 million people who will lose insurance--again, people who  can't buy it anywhere else. This is people's lives we are playing  with--as I mentioned, 200,000 in Connecticut alone.   Do you know who else gets hurt by this replacement plan? Older  Americans. It seems that older Americans are really targeted in this  plan because although the underlying Affordable Care Act says that you  can't charge older Americans more than three times that of younger  Americans, this replacement plan changes the rules. It allows insurance  companies to jack up prices on older Americans. So a 60-year-old would  have their premium go up by about one-quarter. That is roughly $3,000,  according to an AARP study. I don't know about the Presiding Officer,  but a lot of adults getting ready to qualify for Medicare in  Connecticut don't have $3,000 sitting around.   But it gets worse. Because the premium support is so skimpy, under  this plan, that same 60-year-old in Connecticut would have their  premium support--their tax credit--cut in half, from $8,000 down to  $4,000. Do the math. That is a $9,000 increase in healthcare costs for  a 60-year-old resident in Connecticut. That is unaffordable. There is  just no way for anybody to say that for that 60-year-old living in  Connecticut or living in Nebraska or living in California, that is  better healthcare. Nine thousand more dollars out of pocket for a 60- year-old is not better healthcare.   The claim is that this bill will cover people with preexisting  conditions, but because there is no minimum benefit requirement, the  plans don't have to cover anything that you need for your preexisting  condition. So, yes, they can't technically charge someone with cancer  more, but they don't have to cover chemotherapy. The Affordable Care  Act says insurance has to be insurance. There has to be some minimum,  basic level of benefits so that everybody knows that when they buy an  insurance plan, they are basically getting coverage for maternity care,  for cancer treatment, for mental illness. Because this legislation  strips away any requirement that insurance be insurance, maybe you get  insurance if you have cancer, but it may not cover anything you have.   Of course the cruelest piece of this bill says that if you lose  insurance, you then get charged more. Republicans are right that in the  Affordable Care Act as it exists today, there is a penalty if you don't  buy insurance. Republicans just do their penalty differently. What this  replacement plan says is that if you lose insurance and you try to get  it later on, you will pay 30 percent more. I admit that there is a  penalty in the underlying Affordable Care Act and there is a penalty in  the Republican bill, but the problem is that under the existing  Affordable Care Act, the help you get to buy insurance allows you to  buy insurance. That is why 20 million people have insurance today. But  because the tax credits are basically cut in half under this proposal,  it will render healthcare unaffordable; thus, more people will have  gaps in coverage; thus, more people will pay the penalty.   So in the end, this bill really does not provide protection for  people with preexisting conditions because they are not going to be  able to buy insurance in the first place. They are going to fall into  that gap, and then they are going to have to pay more. Even if they do  have insurance, it may not even cover what they need.   All of this is made harder to understand because it seems to be one  big excuse to deliver a giant tax cut to the wealthy. The Joint  Committee on Taxation estimates that this bill would cut taxes by $600  billion for the wealthiest Americans. The Affordable Care Act was  financed in part by a tax on unearned income for people making over  $250,000 a year. I live in a pretty wealthy State--Connecticut--but  people who are making $250,000 and a whole lot of unearned income are  not amongst the most needy in our society. The average tax cut under  this bill  [[Page S1623]]  would be $200,000. Why? Because we are taxing so few people who are  making such big amounts of money, the average tax cut would be  $200,000.   It is so hard to understand because when you do the sum total of  parts that are moving under this replacement plan, it seems as if the  biggest parts that are moving are care away from millions of poor  people and the elderly and money going to the wealthiest 1 percent of  Americans. That is not hyperbole; that is just how this bill works out.   The biggest net result of this bill from the status quo is that  millions of people who are on Medicaid today in a few years won't have  it--those are kids; those are the disabled; those are the elderly--and  a handful of very wealthy Americans will make out with enormous tax  cuts under this legislation.   I guess it is no secret that this bill was crafted behind closed  doors. Seven years in the making, and this bill was hidden from public  view until yesterday. Now House Republicans are saying they are going  to give the American public 1 week to look at this. No estimate of the  cost--they are going to ram it through as quickly as they can.   I held half a dozen townhalls in the summer of 2009, when the tea  party tempest was at its highest, where people really wanted to talk to  me about how upset they were with the way the healthcare debate was  going. One of the refrains that I heard in those townhalls was that  Democrats were ramming through the Affordable Care Act. Everybody heard  it. Ramming through the Affordable Care Act. It was on FOX News every  night. It was part of our townhalls regularly.   Well, let me tell you what happened in 2009. The House process  spanned three committees: the Energy and Commerce Committee, the Ways  and Means Committee, and the Education and Labor Committee. The House  had 79 bipartisan hearings and markups on the health reform bill--79  bipartisan hearings and markups. House Members spent nearly 100 hours  in hearings, heard from 181 witnesses, and considered 239 amendments  and accepted 121. The HELP Committee had 14 bipartisan roundtables, 13  bipartisan hearings, and 20 bipartisan walkthroughs on health reform.  The HELP Committee considered nearly 300 amendments and accepted 160  Republican amendments. The Finance Committee held a similar process.  When the bill came to the floor, the Senate spent 25 consecutive days  in session on health reform--the second longest consecutive session in  history.   So don't tell me that the Affordable Care Act was rushed through when  during that time the HELP Committee considered 300 amendments, held  dozens of hearings, and in 2017 there are going to be no committee  meetings, no committee markups, no committee amendments, and barely a  week for the public, for think tanks, for hospitals, for doctors, for  patients to be able to consider the chaos that will be wrought if this  healthcare plan goes through.   So I am on the floor today to plead with my Republican colleagues to  step back from this potential debacle. This seems like it was written  on the back of a napkin in order to rush something out into the public  so that Republicans can claim they are fulfilling the promise they  made, without thinking through the consequences.   Over and over again, I heard my Republican friends and President  Trump say they are going to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace  it with something better. I heard the new Secretary of Health and Human  Services say that no one was going to lose insurance, that costs were  not going to go up, and that the insurance protections were going to be  preserved. None of that will be true under the current plan under  consideration. Everybody knows it, which is why it is being hidden from  public view.   Politicians love praise. We love good press. So if Republicans  thought this was a praiseworthy plan, they would not be hiding it. They  would not be trying to rush it through. They would be celebrating an  achievement they have been crowing about for years--replacing the  Affordable Care Act with something that is better.   This is worse for everyone except for insurance companies, drug  companies, and the superrich. The superrich get a big tax cut, and all  of the fees that were levied on the insurance companies and drug  companies that were used to pay for additional expansion go away.   Tucked inside here, there is even a very specific tax cut for  insurance company CEOs. I mean, think about that. Tucked into this bill  is a specific tax cut for a select group of individuals--insurance  company CEOs. I represent a lot of those CEOs, but it does not make it  right.   I hope we will find a way to work together to try to strengthen the  Affordable Care Act and fix what is wrong. The plan that was unveiled  yesterday--I understand not by the Senate but by the House--hurts  everybody except for a select few. I think most of my colleagues know  we can do better.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.
