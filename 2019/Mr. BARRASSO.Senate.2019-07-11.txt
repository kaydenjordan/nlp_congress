 Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, whether  you support the ObamaCare law or oppose it--and let me be clear, I  oppose it--it remains the law.   This week, a Federal appellate court heard arguments related to the  case of Texas v. United States, and I expect it will eventually end up  before the U.S. Supreme Court.   Regardless of the outcome, our commitment remains to protect people  with preexisting conditions. As a doctor, as a husband of a breast  cancer survivor, I know the importance of making sure patients can have  access to high-quality healthcare at an affordable cost.   Since the Obama healthcare law passed, this has not happened for many  families to whom I speak at home in Wyoming. They keep telling me that  ObamaCare made their insurance unaffordable, and it has made it more  difficult for them to get the care they need. Simply put, they know  that the Obama healthcare law has failed because they have personally  experienced the law's sky-high premiums and fewer choices.   It has taken Washington Democrats a little longer to figure that out.  Now they are clamoring for a one-size-fits-all healthcare plan. They  want a healthcare system controlled by Washington bureaucrats, and as a  doctor, my focus is on making healthcare better for patients, period.   Republicans in the Trump administration are taking on the tough  issues facing patients across the country. We eliminated the individual  mandate so that patients aren't punished for refusing to buy insurance  they cannot afford. We support more insurance choices, such as  association health plans, so folks can find the best coverage for  themselves and their families. We are taking on the drug companies.  Congress has already eliminated gag clauses, and more reforms are on  the way. Finally, with the President's support, we are going to end  surprise medical bills. Simply put, Republicans want patients to pay  less for the coverage they already have.   Democrats want to take away people's health insurance, especially the  coverage they get through their work. It is simply wrong. The question  is whether Washington Democrats are interested in actually solving the  problem or playing politics.   Therefore, I object.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to complete my  remarks on this nominee before the vote.    Mr. President, today the Senate is considering the  nomination of Peter Wright to serve as the Assistant Administrator of  the Environmental Protection Agency for the Office of Land and  Emergency Management. If confirmed, Mr. Wright will lead this critical  EPA office that provides policy, provides guidance, and provides  direction for the EPA's emergency response and waste programs. Mr.  Wright will play a crucial role in helping the Agency respond to  disasters and cleanups.   The Office of Land and Emergency Management oversees the Superfund  Program, which is a priority for this administration.   There are currently about 1,300 listed Superfund sites across  America. On top of those, there are roughly 450,000 brownfield sites  that need to be addressed. The EPA needs an Assistant Administrator in  place to prioritize those cleanups. Peter Wright is ready for the task.  He currently serves as a special counsel at the EPA. Previously, Mr.  Wright worked as managing counsel to Dow Chemical Company for nearly 20  years. His nomination has been endorsed by 18 current and former chairs  of the American Bar Association's Section of Environment, Energy, and  Resources, including John Cruden, former Assistant Attorney General in  President Obama's administration.   John Milner, the current chair of the section, writing on behalf of  the former chair, said this of Mr. Wright: ``Peter's career, his  selfless commitment to the American Bar Association's Section of  Environment, Energy, and Resources and the members it serves, and his  well-recognized personal integrity exemplify the high standards of the  legal profession.'' He goes on to say: ``We enthusiastically and  without reservation support the consideration of Peter as Assistant  Administrator for OLEM, and believe Peter will serve the office with  distinction and honor.''   He is ready to take on this responsibility, and he has been ready for  well over a year. President Trump originally nominated Peter Wright to  serve in this important role on March 6, 2018. That was 493 days ago.  What is the reason for so long of a delay? Obstruction by Senate  Democrats. We have seen it before. For over a year, this important EPA  office has been without confirmed leadership because of political games  being played by Senate Democrats. Now the games have ended, and it is  time to get serious.   Senate Democrats are now saying they would delay this vote further  because of an error Mr. Wright included on his disclosures. According  to career EPA ethics officials, Mr. Wright made an inadvertent error  and immediately corrected it. EPA ethics officials found that he did  not violate any Federal ethics laws or regulations.   Justina Fugh, who is a career ethics official at the EPA, concluded  in her memo reviewing Mr. Wright's action:         In my opinion, Mr. Wright adhered to the federal ethics       laws and regulations. When he became aware of the inadvertent       error, he notified me immediately and corrected that error.    The delays must end. Superfund sites need to be cleaned up,  emergencies must be responded to, and this important office needs its  Senate-confirmed leader in place. It is time to confirm Peter Wright to  be Assistant Administrator of the EPA for the Office of Land and  Emergency Management, and I strongly encourage Senators to support this  nomination.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.
