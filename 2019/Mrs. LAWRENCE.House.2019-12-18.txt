 Madam Speaker, today, history is being written. The  facts are conclusive: The President attempted to use the power of the  powerful Office of President to force Ukraine to influence our 2020  election.   In the process, President Trump jeopardized our national security and  withheld vital military assistance intended to prevent further Russian  aggression in the region.   However, as our committees--including the Committee on Oversight and  Reform, of which I am a member--sought to interview additional  witnesses and obtain documents, the President ordered, from the power  of his office, that the executive branch not participate and obstructed  the congressional oversight.   Article I provides the House of Representatives with the sole power  of impeachment, as well as the authority to conduct oversight of the  executive branch.   What did he have to hide?   When the Framers met over 200 years ago, they went to great lengths  to ensure future Presidents will be forced to answer to their  constitutional responsibility. I stand today in support of the two  Articles of Impeachment.
