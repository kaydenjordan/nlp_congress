 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the opportunity to  express my thoughts about the rising trend in socialism.   We have seen the effects of socialism, and you need not look very far  to see the disastrous results that socialism has brought to countries  across the globe.   From the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 to the political and  humanitarian crisis unfolding in Venezuela, socialism has brought about  mass suffering, human rights violations, and rampant corruption. No  other form of government has brought about such tragic results.   Capitalism has stood the test of time, fueled by individual freedom  and free market competition. The United States has flourished because  of capitalism, becoming the world's largest economy and providing  economic opportunity for hundreds of millions of citizens.   We must stand for capitalism. Without it, humanity will recede and  our progress will slow.   I call your attention to the thousands of men and women who have  served in uniform and some who gave all in an effort to protect the  freedoms that we enjoy.   Mr. Speaker, I never thought that I would feel the need to speak out  against socialism before this great body, but I will do so so that  generations to come will enjoy the same opportunities for prosperity  that my generation was afforded.    I thank the gentleman again for this opportunity.
