 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise to urge support for my amendment to H.R.  3621.   Mr. Chair, I want to start by thanking Chairwoman Waters, Ranking  Member McHenry, Representative Lawson, and Representative McAdams for  working with me to reach this commonsense agreement on this amendment.   As my colleagues know, for certain jobs, employers are required by  law to review the financial history of prospective employees. For  instance, in some States, insurance commissioners require companies to  review an agent's financial condition and history prior to granting a  license.   This is a consumer protection issue. It is important to ensure that  the professionals who consumers trust to carry out major financial  transactions on their behalf aren't themselves in financial distress.   This amendment clarifies that an employer may use a credit report  when it is necessary for a financial background check, required by  Federal, State, or local laws or regulations.   By clarifying this issue, my amendment ensures that the underlying  bill does not conflict with important consumer protection laws that are  already on the books. Failing to address this conflict will be bad for  workers and consumers.   I again urge support on this amendment, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate my colleague's remarks regarding  this amendment. I think this is the commonsense solution that we need  to make sure that employers are protected as they are looking for their  employees as it relates to this.   I appreciate the gentleman's work and Mr. McAdams' work on this  amendment, and I urge my colleagues' support.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
