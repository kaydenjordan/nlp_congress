 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Domestic  Terrorism Prevention Act. Over the weekend, we witnessed one of the  deadliest racial attacks in recent memory. A man consumed by hateful  conspiracy theories targeted the Black community in Buffalo, killing  ten innocent people in a grocery store.   He posted a manifesto that was filled with hateful conspiracies and  anti-Semitic propaganda, including the racist great replacement  conspiracy theory promoted by white supremacists. White supremacy and  anti-Semitism are poison to our society.   Today, with these forces on the rise, they are turbocharged by social  media which spreads these dangerous ideologies to more people around  the world, creating a toxic blend of misinformation and hate.   We can't afford to look the other way when individuals are inspired  by hateful ideologies to attack our fellow Americans. That is why we  must immediately pass the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act to empower  our government to confront the threat of domestic violent extremism  head-on.   I thank my friend, Representative Schneider, for his tenacity in  pursuing this important bill, which I am proud to cosponsor.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  critical legislation to combat anti-Semitism, white supremacy, and all  forms of hateful violence which threaten all of our communities.
