 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Let's be frank, Senate leadership has already said they are never  going to vote on H.R. 3. Earlier today, President Trump made it clear  that he would veto it. So what are we doing here?   If lowering the costs of prescription drugs were really a priority  for Democrats, they would vote to adopt H.R. 19, the bipartisan  alternative, instead of this politically charged bill. H.R. 19 has 35  bipartisan provisions that passed out of the House committee. It  includes 90 percent of the bipartisan Grassley-Wyden bill in the  Senate.   H.R. 19 will not only lower drug prices, but it will protect  innovation and research into new medicines and cures for diseases like  Alzheimer's, rheumatoid arthritis, ALS, diabetes, and Parkinson's.   The Congressional Budget Office and the Council of Economic Advisers  have both concluded that H.R. 3 will prevent hundreds of new cures from  entering the market. Therefore, I have to ask the supporters of H.R. 3:  Which cures for our loved ones are you willing to sacrifice?
