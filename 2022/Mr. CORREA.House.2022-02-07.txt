 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the bill and  the amendment.   Sex crimes, including sexual harassment, are some of the most brutal  and heinous crimes, causing irreparable damage to their victims. Beyond  the physical pain, the psychological trauma usually scars the victim  for life. And let us not forget that the vast majority of victims bear  this pain silently since these crimes usually go unreported.   I want to thank Mrs. Bustos for the bill and the amendments to  prohibit forced arbitration when it comes to sexual assault. But I say  to you, Madam Speaker, this is not enough. We must also address secret  settlements and nondisclosure agreements. These agreements allow sexual  predators to continue to victimize other victims for a long, long time.   To remedy this loophole, I will be introducing legislation to  prohibit secret settlements when it comes to sexual crimes.
