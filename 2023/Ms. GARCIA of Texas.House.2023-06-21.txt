 Mr. Speaker, Adam Schiff is tough. Adam Schiff  is smart. Adam Schiff gets the job done. Adam Schiff holds the powerful  accountable.   That is exactly why we are here today. Extreme MAGA Republicans are  trying to punish our colleague for doing his job, holding the twice- impeached, twice-indicted former President accountable.   The MAGA wing of the Republican Party can't stop Adam. My friend Adam  Schiff will always fight to defend our democracy. He will always do  what is right.   Trump's pals in Congress can create whole committees to defend him.  They can try threatening outrageous fines. They can try to outright  waste all of our time trying to prop up a man that has threatened our  democracy over and over again.   It is no surprise that former President Donald Trump was in a Miami  courthouse last week, and we are here today discussing this topic.   Mr. Speaker, we have to stop enabling this nonsense. When the whole  House entertains conspiracy theories, nonsense, and political  vendettas, it is the entire GOP that is responsible.
