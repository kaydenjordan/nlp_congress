 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate being allowed to speak to the  Members of the House.   On May 8, 2015, Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Paul Zukunft  proclaimed Cape May County a Coast Guard Community, an honor claimed by  only 18 cities and only one other county in the entire Nation.   The designation, which is confirmed by the United States Coast Guard  and the United States Congress, is in recognition of a strong and  special relationship between the people of Cape May County and the  local Coast Guard personnel, making Coast Guard men and women and their  families feel a sense of community in their home away from home. It is  an invaluable contribution to morale and service excellence.   South Jersey is honored to have Cape May and the Coast Guard as part  of its community.   Most of all, we should remember all that they went through during the  recent shutdown. Our Coast Guard should never have to suffer through  that set of circumstances ever again. That is why we have sponsored  legislation to protect our Coast Guard in the future.                            ____________________
