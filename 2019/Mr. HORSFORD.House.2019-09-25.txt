 Madam Speaker, I rise today in overwhelming support of  the SAFE Banking Act of 2019.   Almost 3 years ago, Nevada voters went to the polls and voted to  legalize recreational marijuana, making Nevada one of five States to  legalize marijuana in the 2016 election.   After its legalization, local business owners invested in Nevada's  legal cannabis market, creating jobs and opportunity. The Nevada  marijuana market quickly exceeded expectations, growing rapidly to  become a burgeoning industry.   Within 10 months, Nevada also exceeded the initial 1-year projection  of tax revenue, bringing in more than $55 million in taxes for our  schools, money that would have otherwise flooded the illicit drug  market. Today, Nevada raises more revenue from cannabis excise taxes  than alcohol excise taxes.   Interestingly enough, the marijuana industry did this without  incurring vast detriments to society, creating an addiction crisis, or  serving as a gateway drug, as marijuana opponents have long argued.                            ____________________
