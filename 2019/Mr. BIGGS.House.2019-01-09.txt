 Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight the distinguished  career of Jay Tibshraeny, who has served the community of Chandler,  Arizona, for more than 30 years. He has just completed his seventh term  as mayor after being elected as a judge in the Maricopa County Justice  Court. The city of Chandler experienced tremendous growth under Mayor  Tibshraeny's leadership.   Mayor Tibshraeny has not only served in office for decades, he has  faithfully served his community his entire life. Chandler would not be  the same without his presence and his tireless efforts to leave his  city better than when he found it.   Madam Speaker, Chandler will miss his leadership. It was my honor and  privilege to work with him for the benefit of our constituents. I wish  him and his family the best in their next chapter of life.                            ____________________
