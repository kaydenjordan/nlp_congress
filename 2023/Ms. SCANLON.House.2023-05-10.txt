 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for  yielding the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is now after 4 o'clock in the afternoon. We were  scheduled to be on the floor today around noon, but when I came to the  floor prepared to debate this rule, we were told first to wait and then  that the House would recess so the Republicans could go back behind  closed doors to negotiate among themselves.   This is becoming a pattern in this Congress. For the second session  week in a row, the Rules Committee met far into the night and reported  out completely closed rules that allow no amendments on the floor.   Now, after Speaker McCarthy realized that he couldn't pass his own  bill, he spent all day negotiating in secret to twist people's arms to  get enough votes from his own party to get this bill or the rule passed  on the floor.   No one has seen what is coming out of the backroom deal today and  allegedly moving to the floor under this very rule.   This isn't how you run the people's House, although it is apparently  how the new House majority runs the people's House--backroom deals that  prioritize politics or policy over people.   Turning to the matters at hand, this rule moves two bills to the  floor. The first bill is H.R. 2, although, as mentioned, we still don't  know what the final version of that bill will be.   We should all be able to agree that immigration and border security  present vast and complex issues. Despite my colleagues' pronouncements  to the contrary, we all want a secure border that protects our national  security, but we also need to address the realities of migration, the  forces that are driving families, even young children, to flee their  homes, and the serious workforce shortages confronting businesses in  our country and elsewhere.   Given the complexities of these issues, they require comprehensive  and nuanced solutions. H.R. 2 is neither. It is a great example of the  old adage: For every complex problem, there is a solution that is  simple, clear, and wrong.   During my legal career, I spent decades working on immigration cases  and within our immigration system. I know it is underfunded and  dysfunctional and has been for many years. We also know that American  businesses, small and large, are asking for immigration reform so that  they can hire the healthcare, agricultural, research, and food service  workers they need.   Solving these issues is not simple, but I am extremely disappointed  that my Republican colleagues want to create more chaos by bringing an  extremist, cruel, and completely unworkable bill to the floor today.   The truth is, this isn't responsible or serious governance. Without  any real proposal, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle resort  to conspiracy theories, fact-free rhetoric, and political theater  designed to stoke fear and chaos to distract from their lack of real  solutions.   We have seen how the failed and inhumane immigration policies of the  prior administration weakened our economy, undermined our moral  standing in the world, inflicted unimaginable cruelty upon defenseless  migrant children, and did not make us any safer.   However, Republican extremists want to take us back there again. Once  more, they would rather fixate and waste American taxpayer dollars to  build a wall that the experts, including Customs and Border Patrol,  agree will not solve the issue.   I must call out the dishonesty of claiming that families seeking  legal asylum are a source of the very real scourge of fentanyl and  other dangerous drug trafficking. We know from Customs and Border  Patrol data that over 90 percent of fentanyl seizures occur at U.S.  ports of entry in trucks or cargo ships, not in areas that a border  wall might cover.   Despite this fact, the bill fails to provide needed resources at  ports of entry to fight fentanyl smuggling where it is actually  happening.   Just last month, House Republicans voted to cap nondefense  discretionary funding, which, according to DHS, would result in the  cutting of 2,400 Customs and Border Patrol officers and agents that do  this work fighting the scourge of fentanyl.   How can we begin to craft measures to address either the fentanyl  crisis or humanitarian issues at our border if our Republican  colleagues insist on starting from a place of misplaced blame and  misguided policies?   Additionally, this bill, or at least the most recent version of it  that we have seen, enacts a nationwide E-Verify system without  providing other reforms that give meaningful pathways for undocumented  workers to legalize their status, which employers across this country  are screaming for.   In doing so, this provision has the potential to wipe out half of our  agricultural workforce, cause huge disruptions in our Nation's food  system, allow a mass offshoring of jobs, and sink American farms from  California to Pennsylvania and throughout States across the Nation.   This isn't the first Congress in which Republicans have tried to move  forward on this E-Verify proposal. In every Congress, it faces  opposition from the small business community, civil liberties groups,  religious organizations, agricultural organizations and growers,  privacy advocates, libertarian think tanks, and immigration reform  groups because it fails to address our broken immigration system in a  meaningful way. This time around is no different.    H.R. 2 also bans Department of Homeland Security funding for critical  nonprofit and religious partners that provide shelter, food, legal  assistance, and other aid to vulnerable immigrants.   That means a faith-based NGO that helps an Afghan refugee to find  housing or gives support to a woman here on a U visa, a special status  set aside for victims of crimes, will no longer get assistance to do  that important work.   How can our Republican colleagues say this bill is only about border  security when it clearly and cruelly rips resources away from those in  the country legally, too?   When it comes to this bill, the immoral policies do not stop there.  This legislation puts children in harm's way--the very ones the other  side of the aisle claims they want to protect.   Children come or are brought to the U.S. because the conditions in  their home countries are so horrific, whether due to poverty, violence,  corruption, or climate change and how it is destroying their way of  life.   This is a situation that has been building for decades, and H.R. 2  does nothing to address it.   During my legal career, I represented many of those children, those  who were orphaned, those who were fleeing gang violence, starvation, or  abuse.   If we really want to protect child victims of trafficking or children  separated from their parents who arrive at our border, we don't limit  their access to representation, as this bill does. We give them the  tools to make the case that they are eligible to stay in this country,  which a child simply cannot do unless they have a qualified attorney  with them.                                time  1630     Mr. Speaker, I have seen up close how important  representation is to anyone trying to navigate our immigration system,  but especially kids.   When our colleagues say they want to send unaccompanied children home  to safety, they are turning a blind eye to reality. The reality for  most of these kids is there is no safe home. Their parents are dead or  otherwise unavailable, and country conditions are so dangerous that the  journey to our border is a safer alternative.   This bill would expose children to the very harms and exploitation my  Republican colleagues hollowly insist they want to prevent. In addition  to  [[Page H2186]]  limiting children's access to counsel, the bill allows them to be  jailed. It guts the protections of the Flores settlement agreement,  which has governed the conditions of children held in government  custody for 26 years.   In doing so, the bill upends a carefully crafted system to minimize  the detention of children due to the grave impact that it has on their  physical and mental health. The evidence is clear: No amount of  detention is safe for kids. Even a short period can cause long-term  harm like psychological trauma and mental health risks.   Despite knowing this, my Republican colleagues wrote a bill that  allows the long-term detention of minors who arrive in the U.S. and  that jails kids and their families indefinitely.   I want to describe for a moment a tragic situation this bill creates.  A mother and her child fleeing violence or starvation at home come to  America in search of safety and legal asylum. When she finds the ports  of entry are closed, which this bill would do, that mother takes her  child and crosses between them. She then follows the rules and applies  for asylum.   To be clear, she is not a risk for flight or violence. Even so, this  bill requires that she and her young child could be jailed for what  could be years if she is prosecuted for the misdemeanor of unlawful  entry, a result that is prohibited by current law and the Flores  litigation.   This legislation falsely states it is consistent with the Flores  decision; although, it is clear that it is not, and that the Court has  already ruled on that precise point.   If my colleagues want to come together and meaningfully work on  immigration reform, it can't start from a place of cruelty against the  most vulnerable. Instead, we need to recognize both the horrific  conditions that cause migrants to flee their homes and the meaningful  contributions that immigrants make to our country and, critically, we  must provide functioning pathways for people to enter the U.S.  lawfully.   Mr. Speaker, the second bill here is H.R. 1163. In addition to their  misguided immigration plan, today House Republicans are bringing up a  harmful bill that hinders antifraud programs, opens up new pathways to  fraud in unemployment insurance programs, and opens workers up to  surprise bills through no fault of their own.   My colleagues want to attack unemployment insurance, a benefit that  helped millions of Americans stay afloat during the depths of the  pandemic. Of course, it is important that we prevent fraud in our  public programs and instances of fraud in unemployment insurance  absolutely should be addressed and prosecuted.   In fact, just this morning, we learned that a Republican Member of  this Chamber was indicted in New York on charges that, among other  things, he allegedly stole public funds by fraudulently collecting  pandemic unemployment benefits.   I hope all my colleagues agree that stealing public funds, especially  during a global pandemic when so many working people lost their jobs  and needed the support to keep their families healthy and fed, is  unacceptable and absolutely should disqualify someone from serving in  the United States Congress.   However, although my colleagues across the aisle claim that they want  to fight fraud in unemployment insurance, their leadership continues to  welcome the votes of this alleged fraudster in order to push a deeply  unpopular and extremist agenda and they want to pass a bill that makes  it harder to catch the kind of cross-State fraud that their colleague  has allegedly committed by slashing $400 million in critical funding  for Department of Labor antifraud programs.   It opens up opportunities for fraud in UI programs by halting the  roll out of new identification verification systems and the legislation  allows States to send surprise bills to workers for accidental  overpayments of unemployment insurance benefits made during the  pandemic.   These overpayments were made to workers who did nothing wrong and did  not know they had been overpaid. These people spent their unemployment  insurance on necessities like food for themselves and their children.  They returned to work as soon as they could, but now Republicans, with  this bill, want to send these working people a bill and punish them for  an error that they didn't commit.   Ultimately, both of these proposals from my Republican colleagues are  unserious and unworkable. They will wreak harm on America's economy,  especially businesses unable to find workers to grow or even survive.  They will wreak harm on working families, law-abiding immigrants, and  terrified refugees who have the right to seek asylum at our borders.   These bills are political stunts to stir up extremist supporters, not  serious solutions to complex problems, problems that require  comprehensive and nuanced solutions. We are eager to work with  responsible legislators from any party on an immigration bill that  truly secures the border, protects Dreamers, and solves the workforce  challenges we are seeing from farms to pharmacies. Such a bill would  grow our economy, help our communities combat crime, and stem the flow  of illegal drugs into our country.   We firmly believe that we can reach an agreement that secures our  border and reforms our immigration system in a way that reflects  fundamental American values, and we are ready to work on that now. We  welcome assistance in that from the House majority.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I do find it a little hard to credit the  expressions of concern for the migrants who are crossing our border  when yet again, today, the Governor of Texas sent a busload of migrants  from the border after announcing he was providing free transportation  to them.   He refuses to tell the cities where they are headed, but the migrants  are on their way. So as has occurred multiple times over the last year,  people were dumped in Philadelphia at 6 o'clock in the morning. Thank  God that the weather has turned because when they were dumping them on  New Year's Eve, it was pretty darn cold. So please spare me the  crocodile tears for the humanitarian concerns when you are not willing  to help ease that process.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Mexico  (Ms. Leger Fernandez), a very distinguished member of the Rules  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I just have to push back a little bit on  this idea that somehow immigrants coming to this country are taking  advantage of our police and different parts of our society. I mean, the  Cato Institute, of all places, has recently published a study that  shows there is a net economic benefit for several generations when we  have immigrants come to this country.   Of course, there is also the continuing inaccurate characterization  of these folks coming here illegally when they are applying for asylum.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the distinguished  [[Page H2188]]  ranking member of the Committee on Rules.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. McGovern raised a few good points, but one in particular: We  haven't seen the bill that we are allegedly supposed to be considering  with this rule.   Last night, Mr. Norman, who just spoke, correctly criticized this  closed process. He said, ``That's a problem going forward, a huge  problem because that is not the process we think is fair to everyone.''   I would simply say to the gentleman that the process has only gotten  worse. Reportedly, there will be an amendment offered to this rule that  we haven't even seen yet. Although, I guess the fact is we may know why  we had to delay the hearing until this point; so that your Member could  return from New York.   I wonder when we are going to see the open and transparent process  that some of our Rules Committee colleagues have spoken so much about.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I apologize to my colleagues across the  aisle. I didn't realize that I needed to delay my remarks until the  next round.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert into the Record a  letter from the Department of Labor, which states that H.R. 1163 would  hinder efforts to tackle unemployment insurance fraud, delay payments,  and undermine State efforts to modernize and protect the system from  fraud.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Mississippi (Mr. Thompson), the distinguished ranking member of the  Committee on Homeland Security.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to provide for consideration of a resolution  which states that it is the House's responsibility to protect and  preserve Social Security and Medicare for our future generations and  reject any cuts to these essential programs.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment into the Record, along with any extraneous material,  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, Social Security and Medicare are vital to  many of our constituents' economic and health security. Many of my  Republican friends across the aisle were calling for major cuts to  these critical programs but recently some have changed their tune.   If they truly believe in a new position, I am offering my friends the  opportunity to back it up with a vote in the people's House. This vote  will give Members the opportunity to reassure Americans that the House  won't eviscerate these foundational programs that our constituents rely  upon.  [[Page H2191]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr.  Magaziner) to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Correa).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  closing.   Mr. Speaker, since the aftermath of World War II, the United States  has championed its duty to uphold the international right to seek  asylum by providing those fleeing persecution with safe haven here in  America.  [[Page H2192]]    However, the Republican immigration plan in H.R. 2 and the rhetoric  we have heard about it today does nothing more than sow chaos, anger,  and fear about this important humanitarian system.   It puts the blame for our broken immigration system on the backs of  families and children fleeing poverty and violence, instead of  recognizing the complexity of the issues involving immigration and  border security and blaming Congress for failing to address our broken  system for decades.   It is clear that jailing families indefinitely or sending  unaccompanied children back to dangerous and exploitive situations and  refusing to provide working legal pathways to residents will not make  us any safer; neither will wasting American taxpayer dollars to build a  discredited and ineffective border wall, decimating our agricultural  sector, or defunding trusted nonprofit organizations that provide  support to immigrants.   These are not the comprehensive, multiprong solutions we need, the  kind of solutions that Democrats have been imploring our Republican  colleagues to come to the table on, solutions that secure our ports of  entry, expand legal pathways, and address the root causes of migration.   A long and impactful history of immigration is at the heart of our  American story. As such, we should meaningfully fix our immigration  system so it works better and can continue making our county stronger.  We shouldn't gut it or attempt to destroy it altogether. I want a  better future than that for the United States and all of those who call  it home.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the previous question and  the rule, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
