 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a  vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jim Moyer,  associate dean of research at Washington State University, and to  congratulate him on his retirement. Jim graduated from Washington State  in 1971 and went on to pursue several higher degrees and academic  achievements.   He is prominently renowned as a plant pathologist, having served as  the president of the American Phytopathological Society, and his  research contributions have earned him both national and international  recognition. He received the USDA Agricultural Research Service's  Morrison Medal before he returned to Pullman to serve as the associate  dean of research for WSU's College of Agriculture, Human, and Natural  Resource Sciences.   In this position, he advocated for agriculture stakeholders and  supported research in Washington State and across the country. He  testified before the House Agriculture Committee and has led WSU to be  number one in USDA research and development expenditures in fiscal year  2016.   Jim and I have worked closely together since I came to Congress, and  I am grateful for all he has done for my alma mater. I urge my  colleagues to join me in celebrating his successful career, and I wish  him the best in his retirement.   Go, Cougars.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the good gentleman from Virginia  for yielding me some time today.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the balanced budget  amendment, offered by my friend and colleague, Congressman Goodlatte.   Reining in the Federal debt is not a partisan issue. In fact, the  majority of Americans are united in consistently supporting a  requirement to balance the Federal budget.   Our national debt has surpassed a record $22 trillion. You have heard  that several times today. That is more than $64,000 for every man,  woman, and child in this country. It is more than $174,000 of debt for  every U.S. taxpayer. If we continue to let this number grow, we will  continue to dig a deeper hole for our children and our grandchildren.   Since I came to Congress in 2015, I have worked to ensure the  government does not spend above its means. I have cosponsored several  resolutions in support of an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to  balance the budget and am proud to be an original cosponsor of this  legislation that we consider today.   In the 114th Congress, my colleagues and I offered an amendment to  the Debt Management and Fiscal Responsibility Act requiring the  Secretary of the Treasury to appear before Congress and submit a report  with solutions to control the national debt before raising the debt  ceiling.   I have also consistently voiced my strong concerns about fiscally  irresponsible spending packages, as I did earlier this year with the  deal to bust our budget caps and send our Nation further into debt.   Mr. Speaker, we are on a high-speed train heading towards a very  large fiscal cliff, and soon it may be too late to slow this train  down. This insurmountable debt threatens our Nation's economic and  national security, as well as future generations.   The people of this country and of Washington State's Fourth  Congressional District demand better and expect their representatives  to promote fiscal responsibility.   Over 20 years ago, when the Federal deficit was at $5 trillion, a  balanced budget amendment failed by a single vote in the U.S. Senate.  It is time to put a stop to the Federal Government's out-of-control  spending and use our authority in Congress to prioritize spending. This  balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution is a great step in  the right direction.
