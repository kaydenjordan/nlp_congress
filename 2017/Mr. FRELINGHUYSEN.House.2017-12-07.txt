Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material in consideration of H.J. Res.  123.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Bacon). Is there objection to the  request of the gentleman from New Jersey?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 647, I  call up the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 123) making further continuing  appropriations for fiscal year 2018, and for other purposes, and ask  for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 647, the joint  resolution is considered read.   The text of the joint resolution is as follows:                               H.J. Res. 123         Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the       United States of America in Congress assembled,          DIVISION A--FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018       SEC. 101. FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS.         The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 (division D of       Public Law 115-56) is amended by striking the date specified       in section 106(3) and inserting ``December 22, 2017''.        This division may be cited as the ``Further Continuing       Appropriations Act, 2018''.     DIVISION B--CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM (CHIP) ALLOCATION                        REDISTRIBUTION SPECIAL RULE       SEC. 201. CHIP ALLOCATION REDISTRIBUTION SPECIAL RULE FOR                     CERTAIN SHORTFALL STATES DURING FIRST QUARTER                     OF FISCAL YEAR 2018.         Section 2104(f)(2) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.       1397dd(f)(2)) is amended--        (1) by amending subparagraph (B) to read as follows:        ``(B) Determination of redistributed amounts if       insufficient amounts available.--        ``(i) Proration rule.--Subject to clause (ii), if the       amounts available for redistribution under paragraph (1) for       a fiscal year are less than the total amounts of the       estimated shortfalls determined for the year under       subparagraph (A), the amount to be redistributed under such       paragraph for each shortfall State shall be reduced       proportionally.        ``(ii) Special rule for first quarter of fiscal year       2018.--         ``(I) In general.--For the period beginning on October 1,       2017, and ending December 31, 2017, with respect to any       amounts available for redistribution under paragraph (1) for       fiscal year 2018, the Secretary shall redistribute under such       paragraph such amounts to each emergency shortfall State (as       defined in subclause (II)) in such amount as is equal to the       amount of the shortfall described in subclause (II) for such       State and period (as may be adjusted under subparagraph (C))       before the Secretary may redistribute such amounts to any       shortfall State that is not an emergency shortfall State. In       the case of any amounts redistributed under this subclause to       a State that is not an emergency shortfall State, such       amounts shall be determined in accordance with clause (i).        ``(II) Emergency shortfall state defined.--For purposes of       this clause, the term `emergency shortfall State' means, with       respect to the period beginning October 1, 2017, and ending       December 31, 2017, a shortfall State for which the Secretary       estimates, in accordance with subparagraph (A) (unless       otherwise specified in this subclause), that the projected       expenditures under the State child health plan and under       section 2105(g) (calculated as if the reference under section       2105(g)(4)(A) to `2017' were a reference to `2018' and       insofar as the allotments are available to the State under       this subsection or subsection (e) or (m)) for such period       will exceed the sum of the amounts described in clauses (i)       through (iii) of subparagraph (A) for such period, including       after application of any amount redistributed under paragraph       (1) before such date of enactment to such State. A shortfall       State may be an emergency shortfall State under the previous       sentence without regard to whether any amounts were       redistributed before such date of enactment to such State       under paragraph (1) for fiscal year 2018.        ``(III) Application of qualifying state option.--During the       period described in subclause (I), section 2105(g)(4) shall       apply to a qualifying State (as defined in section       2105(g)(2)) as if under section 2105(g)(4)--         ``(aa) the reference to `2017' were a reference to `2018';       and        ``(bb) the reference to `under subsections (e) and (m) of       such section' were a reference to `under subsections (e),       (f), and (m) of such section'.''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:        ``(D) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this paragraph may       be construed as preventing a commonwealth or territory       described in subsection (c)(3) from being treated as a       shortfall State or an emergency shortfall State.''.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Frelinghuysen) and the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey) each will  control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today to present H.J. Res. 123, a continuing resolution that  maintains funding for Federal Government operations and prevents a  shutdown.   Current funding legislation expires tomorrow, Friday, December 8.  Congress must act now to prevent a government shutdown and preserve  vital Federal programs that Americans rely on. This action is critical  to our Nation's stability, our national security, our economic health,  and the well-being of the American people.   This simple, clean extension of funding provides fiscal year 2018  funding for government programs through December 22, an additional 2  weeks, and will allow time for leadership to reach a deal on overall  topline spending levels for the 2018 fiscal year.                                time  1430    I would note that the executive branch supports adoption of this  continuing resolution. Yesterday's Statement of Administration Policy  says: ``This legislation funds the Federal Government at current  spending levels without unnecessary extraneous provisions.''   It concludes that his advisers would recommend that the President  sign the bill into law.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the December 6 Statement of  Administration Policy regarding H.J. Res. 123.                     Statement of Administration Policy      h.j. res. 123--further continuing appropriations act, 2018--rep.                            frelinghuysen, r-nj         The Administration supports House passage of H.J. Res. 123,       the Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018.        This legislation funds the Federal Government at current       spending levels without unnecessary extraneous provisions       through December 22, 2017, while the Congress continues to       work on a longer-term funding agreement. The legislation also       includes language to ensure that States and Territories have       adequate funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program       (CHIP) through December.        The Administration believes that funding for national       security, including for our military, to secure the Southern       Border, and to enhance missile defense capabilities, must be       prioritized in a long-term funding agreement, and will       continue working with the Congress to achieve that goal.        If H.J. Res. 123 was presented to the President in its       current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the       bill into law.     Mr. Speaker, the House has completed our  appropriations work over 80 days ago, passing all 12 bills before the  end of the last fiscal year for the first time in nearly a decade. This  included critical, important funding for national defense and other  important matters.   Unfortunately, the Appropriations Committee cannot proceed without an  agreement with the Senate on overall funding levels. The reality is  that we are running into a deadline this week, and this resolution is  our best and only option at this time.   Once a broader budget agreement has been reached, which I hope will  be soon, the committee will continue its work to complete final  negotiations with the Senate on all 12 of the regular appropriations  bills that will fully fund the Federal Government through September of  next year.  [[Page H9733]]    Our committee is also moving quickly to act on a third emergency  supplemental funding bill to help our communities across the Nation  recover from recent major disasters.   In the meantime, Congress must do its job and pass the continuing  resolution and then another one into the new year to keep the  government open and ensure that all important Federal services are  available to all Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this necessary and responsible  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers), my colleague, and the distinguished  chairman of the State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Alabama (Mr. Aderholt), the chairman of the Agriculture, Rural  Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies  Subcommittee on Appropriations.  [[Page H9734]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Granger), the chairwoman of the Appropriations  Subcommittee on Defense.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Idaho (Mr. Simpson), the chairman of the Energy and Water  Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Culberson), the chairman of the Commerce, Justice,  Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.     Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Culberson), the chairman of the Commerce, Justice,  Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Carter), the chairman of the Homeland Security  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Calvert), the chairman of the Committee on  Appropriations Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to  the gentleman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), the chairman of the Labor, Health and Human  Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart), the chairman of the Transportation,  Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, I want to first thank the chairman for,  again, bringing the 12 bills, once again, through the process. This is  just a short-term continuing resolution. It is a clean date extension,  and this CR will give an opportunity to continue to move forward  quickly, by the way, towards finalizing appropriations bills.   It is important to note that, for example, in the Transportation and  HUD bill, we considered 22 amendments in committee, 39 amendments here  on the floor. You see, this has been an open and fair process the  entire way. Now we must--we must--move quickly to finish the job and  conference all 12 of these bills.   In the meantime, however, we must keep the government open and  funded. This is especially, by the way, important now that our  communities are pulling together to recover from three devastating  hurricanes, as well as the thousands of families threatened by raging  wildfires in California.   Look, we can't take the risk of shortchanging our first responders,  our military, given the natural disasters at home and the threats from  our adversaries abroad. A vote against this CR would do just that.   Again, just for the Transportation and Housing segment, this CR will  support ongoing transportation and safety missions, air traffic  control, housing for vulnerable citizens, including our veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge a ``yes'' vote on the CR. We cannot let  those folks down. We cannot shut the Federal Government down, and it  allows us to finish the job, and I thank the chairman for his steadfast  leadership.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Dent), the chairman of the Military  Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Oregon (Mr. Walden), the distinguished chairman of the Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Oregon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Burgess), chairman of the Health Subcommittee of the  Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer).    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I strongly urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this responsible, necessary legislation.  Let's keep the Federal Government open for business to serve our  constituents across the Nation.   I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I voted against H.J. Res. 123, a stop-gap  resolution that keeps the government open for another two weeks,  through December 22, 2017. Once again Republicans, who control both the  House and the Senate, cannot get their work done. Instead they continue  to kick the can down the road.   The resolution keeps funding transportation at last year's levels  rather than the higher funding levels provided by the FAST Act for  2018, meaning it cuts the mandated increases in transportation  investment by more than $950 million for Federal-aid highways and  almost $200 million for public transit investment. As a result, this  bill withholds $1.2 billion from Federal highway, public transit, and  highway safety investments--preventing States, local governments, and  public transit agencies from making critical investments, letting  contracts, creating good-paying jobs, and working to relieve the  Nation's crippling traffic congestion.   A two-week resolution gives Republicans more time to complete their  massive tax scam bill, which benefits corporations and the wealthy at  the cost of middle class workers, seniors, students, and our national  debt. Paul Ryan has said after the bill passes, Republicans will move  to cut Medicare and Medicaid benefits.   Further, the resolution does not reauthorize the Children's Health  Insurance Program (CHIP). Instead, it includes a technical fix to  ensure no state runs out of CHIP funding in December. If Congress does  not reauthorize CHIP by December 31st, Oregon will not have enough  funds to fully fund CHIP on January 1, 2018.   The resolution does not include a permanent fire borrowing fix or  additional disaster aid for communities devastated by wildfire or other  natural disasters. Oregon suffered through one of the worst fire  seasons in decades. Congress has twice provided USFS emergency funding  to repay non-wildfire accounts this year. Without a permanent fire  borrowing fix, USFS will continue to have to rob forest management  accounts to pay for fire suppression--meaning our forests will continue  to be overgrown and infested with insects and disease, powder kegs  waiting to burn next year.   Finally, the resolution does not include any solutions for the  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Roughly 800,000  law-abiding individuals are at risk of deportation otherwise. Congress  must work together to ensure that individuals who were brought  illegally into this country as children, through no fault of their own,  are not targeted for deportation.   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it is extremely  disheartening that this Congress is once again debating the merits of a  temporary funding measure to keep the federal government funded. The  American people sent their elected representatives to Washington to  fulfill basic promises to fund the federal government and provide for  the safety and prosperity of all Americans. A stopgap funding bill like  the two-week extension before us today falls drastically short of our  responsibilities to properly serve our constituents.   A continuing resolution should only be used as a temporary measure.  Instead, the passage of CRs has become regular order. That is not how  Congress was intended to work. This continued inaction is costing  taxpayers billions in wasted dollars, not to mention the opportunity  costs associated with short-term extensions. I find the complete lack  of bipartisan talks in Congress alarming, particularly since countless  families, seniors, and others rely on these programs for their  wellbeing and safety.   In addition to our basic responsibility to fund the government, it is  vitally important that we work to lift the crippling budget caps that  have  [[Page H9739]]  been holding back critical investments in our nation's infrastructure,  benefits for our veterans, and other defense and nondefense priorities.  Democrats in Congress were promised an opportunity to negotiate new  spending caps after the last CR was adopted in September. Instead, the  only spending measures we have seen leave this Chamber are partisan  bills that can never reasonably expect to make it into law.   There also needs to be a recognition that many Americans have come to  rely on the federal government for basic services or benefits they were  promised after serving in our military. For example, I was deeply  troubled by the Administration's recent effort to eliminate $460  million for the HUD-VA Supportive Housing program, which provides rent  assistance to homeless veterans and their families. It was only until  veterans' advocates, state officials, and Members of Congress protested  the dramatic reduction did VA Secretary Shulkin reverse course on the  planned cuts.   Mr. Speaker, Republicans in Congress are putting politics over the  wellbeing of our nation by passing temporary spending bills while also  proposing dramatic cuts to social programs. Ultimately, it will be the  American people and the U.S. economy who will be stuck dealing with the  consequences. I urge my colleagues across the aisle to come together to  engage in good-faith negotiations with me and my Democratic colleagues  on bipartisan, full-year legislation to fund the federal government.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.   Pursuant to House Resolution 647, the previous question is ordered on  the joint resolution.   The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the joint  resolution.   The joint resolution was ordered to be engrossed and read a third  time, and was read the third time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the joint  resolution.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________
