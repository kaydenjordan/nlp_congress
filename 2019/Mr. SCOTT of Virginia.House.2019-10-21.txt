 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join the chorus of admirers of Elijah  Cummings and to mourn the passing of our distinguished colleague.   Congressman Cummings served with passion for the rule of law, and  always governed in a respectful manner, even when dealing with some of  the most critical and controversial issues facing Congress today.   It is rightly noted that when Congressman Cummings spoke, he spoke  with moral authority, frequently reminding us that ``we are better than  that.''   He was an invaluable leader for civil rights, justice, and  fundamental fairness. He believed in the promise of America and served  as an example of it every single day. We are better off because of his  leadership in Congress and the tremendous contributions he made over  his life of service.   Mr. Speaker, I send my deepest condolences to Dr. Maya Rockeymoore  Cummings, his three children, and all of his loved ones. I hope they  will find comfort in knowing that so many people across the country are  mourning their loss with them.
