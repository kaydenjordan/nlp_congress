 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4760,  the Securing America's Future Act. This bill provides the tools needed  to enforce our immigration laws, secure our borders, and begin the  process of reforming our legal immigration system while also ensuring a  generous protection for DACA recipients.   Enforcement remains the key to our system. Without enforcement, our  laws have little effect. This bill targets criminal gangs, dangerous  aliens, and the sanctuary policies that allow these public safety  threats to thrive.   The bill also provides a permanent solution for DACA recipients. They  can apply to receive a 3-year, indefinitely renewable visa so they can  live and work in the United States forever, as long as they abide by  the laws. This permanent status gives DACA recipients more surety than  President Obama's temporary program ever did.   The bill will finally make good on our commitment to grant our  growers and other workers a workable agricultural guest worker program.  The lack of a reliable source of labor when an American workforce is  simply not available is imperiling the future of American agriculture.   The bill's H-2C program will be a true guest worker program that will  allow the current agricultural workforce to participate on the same  terms and conditions as any other worker around the world. The program  is endorsed by the American Farm Bureau. It is a critical part of this  bill.   Finally, it closes the loopholes that have allowed fraud to destroy  the integrity of our asylum system by raising the credible fear  standard and sending a clear message that fraud and frivolity will not  be tolerated in the United States.   This is a good bill, and I encourage every Member to support it.
