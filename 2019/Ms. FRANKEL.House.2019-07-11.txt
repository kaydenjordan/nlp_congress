 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I think there are a few of us here in  Congress who are old enough to remember a time when we actually did  nuclear bomb drills in school. It probably would have been a futile  action had there been a real attack.   And although nuclear warfare is still an existential threat to all of  us and our allies around the world, it has been arms control that has  let us go about our lives daily without that worry of nuclear war:  agreements like the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, known as  the INF Treaty, signed in 1987 between the United States and the Soviet  Union, which led to the elimination of thousands of United States and  Russian nuclear missiles.   In recent years, it has become apparent that Russia has been  violating this treaty. And in response, in February, the Trump  administration announced its withdrawal to the consternation of our  European friends, giving both the United States and Russia freedom to  produce more nuclear weapons.   And it is the general consensus of the arms control community that we  should be working with Russia to bring them back into compliance  instead of adding to our nuclear arsenal and sidestepping NATO.                                time  1545    Once again, this administration is alienating allies who don't want  to be targets for Russian attacks. The NATO Secretary General said,  clearly: We do not intend to deploy new land-based nuclear missiles in  Europe.   In recent testimony before Congress, General Paul Selva, the Vice  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated: There are no military  requirements that we cannot currently satisfy due to our compliance  with the INF Treaty.   In other words, the world has enough nuclear weapons to destroy  civilization.   It is clear that our withdrawal from INF has been driven by extreme  elements in our administration who have made their careers out of  destroying arms control agreements.   To stop this nuclear escalation, my amendment would prohibit funding  for missile systems noncompliant with the INF Treaty unless the Defense  Department demonstrates an ally has agreed to host the INF missile and  that we have exhausted all other diplomatic options.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to prevent a dangerous  and costly nuclear arms race. Enough is enough.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Chair, let me just respond by saying, according to  the Department of Defense, there is nothing in this amendment that  would impact missile defense test systems.   Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Engel).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Garamendi).    Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Chairman, let me just say this.   The Department of Defense says that nothing in this amendment would  impact missile defense cooperation with Israel.   I just want to end by saying: Enough is enough. Diplomacy, not more  nuclear weapons.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
