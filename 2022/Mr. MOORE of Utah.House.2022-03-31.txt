 Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the previous  question so we can immediately consider H.R. 6858, the American Energy  Independence from Russia Act.   I am a proud cosponsor of this bill that will strengthen our energy  security, bolster our economy, and position ourselves to counter  Russian aggression in Ukraine.   This morning, gas near my district office in Ogden, Utah, is $4.30.  For the average family driving the average vehicle in Utah, this means  that each fill-up will cost over $110. For Utah's hardworking  agricultural industry, this means thousands of dollars more will be  spent on fuel so they can feed the rest of America.   These skyrocketing prices are unacceptable. I share my constituents'  outrage over how the Biden administration's policies have contributed  to this painful situation. This is a self-imposed tax on all Americans.  For those of us who come from energy producing States, we know we can  do better.   It is past time we get back to what we were doing in 2019 when the  United States was a net exporter of energy. It is better for our  economy and our environment when we produce domestically. In Utah, we  understand this because we do this.   Instead of allowing Americans to do their jobs, the Biden  administration has shut down new oil and gas leasing. Instead of  helping our communities grow, he has asked the oil cartels in the  Middle East to pump more oil. Instead of investing in America, he has  made us more dependent on energy imports from Russia and other foreign  adversaries. We can do better.   Passing the America Energy Independence from Russia Act today will  put us on a path toward energy independence. I encourage my colleagues  to join me in rejecting the previous question so we can lower prices  for all.
