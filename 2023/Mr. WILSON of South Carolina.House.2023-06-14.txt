 Madam Speaker, Biden and liberal  Democrats are trying to ban gas cooking appliances as part of their  Green New Deal.   This subverts legitimate environmental concerns by giving up all your  money by way of taxes and all of your freedom with the promise that  there will be catastrophe avoided in 50 years, but actually it would be  dependency on China.   This manufactured mandate would negatively affect 40 percent of  American families. High electricity bills, and costly new appliances  would force 187 million Americans to switch from gas to electricity as  families would spend an extra 23 hours a year waiting for water to  boil, lose $1,000 annually, and emit over 22 percent more carbon  dioxide.   House Republicans are promoting families by introducing Congresswoman  Debbie Lesko's-led Save Our Gas Stoves Act and Congressman Kelly  Armstrong's-led Gas Stove Protection and Freedom Act.   Happy birthday, U.S. Army. Happy birthday, Donald Trump.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America with open borders by  President Biden.                            ____________________
