 Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters from the  United Steelworkers, the AFL-CIO, and the International Brotherhood of  Teamsters in relation to this bill.                                             United Steelworkers,                                                        May 3, 2017.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the members of the United       Steelworkers union (USW), I continue to urge you to oppose       the American Health Care Act (AHCA), despite proposed       amendments. This legislation will adversely affect every       American's health insurance benefits including workplace       plans, Medicare, Medicaid, and the individual market.        This harmful and partisan legislation will cause tens of       millions to lose insurance coverage over the next decade.       Deductibles and premiums are expected to rise. In short,       rather than reducing costs of health care, this bill will       simply shift costs to working Americans and their families       while cutting taxes for the wealthy and corporations.        The MacArthur Amendment allows states to opt out of certain       protections under the Affordable Care Act such as the       requirements that insurers provide plans with a minimum       package of services and don't discriminate against people       with pre-existing conditions. The amendment also lets states       allow insurance companies to charge older people up to five       times what they charge younger people. This amendment will       allow for an uneven patchwork of insurance coverage across       the country and will make insurance cost prohibitive for many       working and retired Americans. Although lawmakers are working       to address the treatment of individuals with pre-existing       conditions, none of the proposals have adequately addressed       the costs associated with removal of the Affordable Care       Act's protections for those individuals.        Overall, the AHCA is a transfer of wealth from working       Americans to the very wealthy and to corporations including       the pharmaceutical industry, insurance companies, and medical       device manufacturers. It removes taxes on the very wealthy       and on corporations, giving the wealthiest 400 household an       average tax cut of about $7 million each. Meanwhile, the bill       retains the ``Cadillac Tax'' which puts the burden of the       cost of this legislation squarely on the backs of middle       class working families.        Most of our members are covered under employer-negotiated       insurance plans. However, the AHCA removes the employer-      mandate included in the Affordable Care Act. This       dramatically changes the incentive and landscape for       employer-sponsored insurance, which threatens the system that       provides insurance for millions of hard-working Americans.       CBO estimated that 7 million people will lost their workplace       coverage as a result of this bill.        The AHCA also undoes protections and assistance for older       Americans and our members who are retirees with dramatically       increased out-of-pocket costs to Americans who are older but       not yet eligible for Medicare. For those who will or       currently rely on Medicare this bill reduces the solvency of       the program by three years by repealing taxes on the wealthy       and on corporations.        Additionally, this bill makes perilous cuts to Medicaid       which provides health care to low-income Americans who have       been laid off, work at low-paying jobs, are disabled, or are       elderly. This will strain already limited state budgets,       restrict the needy Americans who are eligible for assistance,       and eliminate needed services.        Our members who work in the health care industry may also       be affected by job losses and strained budgets caused by the       passage of this bill. Providers (our employers) may be       subjected to lower reimbursement rates from state Medicaid       programs as a result of the federal cuts. Also, the costs of       uncompensated care will rise as millions of Americans lose       health insurance but still need health care treatment for       illnesses and injuries. Once again, hard-working middle class       health care workers will have to bear the costs of this       harmful legislation.        The amendments to the bill do not change the fundamental       flaws in the legislation enough to make it worthy of your       support. Harmful tax cuts are retained, and the bill would       not do anything to reduce costs or to prevent Americans from       losing health insurance--in fact, this bill would make those       problems worse.        The American Health Care Act is a harmful piece of       legislation that does not solve the problems in our current       health insurance system. Despite amendments, the costs of       this bill would still be borne by working families, making       health care less affordable and less accessible. The United       Steelworkers strongly opposes the AHCA and we urge you to       vote against it.            Sincerely,                                                     Leo W. Gerard,      International President.                                   ____                                                          AFL-CFO,                                                        May 4, 2017.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 12.5 million working       people represented by the AFL-CFO, I urge you to oppose the       American Health Care Act (AHCA, H.R. 1628). In a stunning       fashion, this bill takes health coverage away from about 24       million people while providing massive tax cuts for the       wealthy and large corporations. No one in good conscience can       support this legislation.        It is important to understand what is driving Republicans       to pursue a massive roll back in health coverage. While it is       packaged as health care reform, a straightforward look at       this legislation shows that it is fundamentally designed to       pare back public commitments to health coverage in order to       benefit the wealthy.        House Speaker Paul Ryan publically boasted that the AHCA is       a ``trillion dollar tax cut'' that will benefit corporations       and pave the way for further tax ``reform.'' He made clear       that repealing the Affordable Care Act (ACA) taxes is a major       aim of the bill. The tax cuts, however, largely go to higher       earners and corporations. The one ACA tax left intact is the       only one that predominantly impacts working people--the so-      called ``Cadillac'' tax on workplace health benefits.        There are terrible human costs to this upward       redistribution of wealth. Millions of individuals will again       face the dilemma of choosing between getting life-saving       medical treatment and meeting their families' basic financial       needs.        The AHCA replaces ACA subsidies that support a minimum       level of coverage with tax credits so small that at least 3       million people will be unable to afford coverage in the       individual market, according to the Congressional Budget       Office (CBO). Millions more will find that they can only       afford skimpy coverage that will leave them exposed to       substantial costs should they face major sickness,       undoubtedly increasing the number of medical bankruptcies.       The bill allows insurers to require that seniors in the       individual market pay five times as much in premiums as       younger adults, imposing an ``age tax.''        The bill also decimates Medicaid, ending the program as we       know it--placing seniors, people with disabilities, and       children in jeopardy of losing access to care. The AHCA       slashes the program by $839 billion dollars over ten years,       and CBO estimates that these cuts will result in 14 million       people losing their coverage. In using the program as a  [[Page H4162]]       piggy bank, without efforts to improve the services it       provides, the AHCA manages to shift resources away from many       of the nation's most vulnerable people as part of its       redistribution project.        Medicare is not spared either. The bill pulls approximately       $77 billion from the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund       to provide a tax cut to the wealthy, shortening the lifespan       of the fund. An additional $28 billion is extracted from       Medicare's trust fund for outpatient medical services, to       provide a tax break for pharmaceutical companies.        Employer-based health insurance, the nation's major source       of coverage, also gets hit. The AHCA preserves the so-called       ``Cadillac'' tax on workplace health coverage that will       impact more than 42 percent of large employer plans when it       goes into effect. Economists predict the tax will cause       employers to hollow-out the coverage provided in their plans,       exposing workers to higher out-of-pocket costs, such as       deductibles and copays. In some cases, employers are expected       to drop coverage altogether. The bill also eliminates the       penalty that employers face when they do not comply with the       ACA's employer shared responsibility requirements. 030       estimates that seven million people will lose employer-based       coverage under the AHCA.        These sacrifices in health coverage finance stunning tax       cuts for the very wealthy and corporations. The legislation       provides the 400 highest-income households with an average       annual tax cut of $7 million each. Large corporations see       impressive windfalls. The AHCA gives insurance companies       alone $145 billion in tax relief, while medical device makers       get $20 billion, and pharmaceutical companies benefit by       paying less into Medicare.        The reasons for opposing this legislation, which sacrifices       health coverage for millions to support tax cuts for the few,       are clear. We hope you stand with working people when you       make your choice.            Sincerely,                                                 William Samuel,                                                           Director,      Government Affairs Department.                                   ____                                           International Brotherhood                                                    of Teamsters,                                                        May 4, 2017.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.4 million members       of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and their       families, I urge you to vote no on the American Health Care       Act (AHCA) today. The Teamsters have long opposed proposals       to tax worker health benefits and this legislation retains       the 40 percent excise tax on high quality health care plans       which would ultimately reduce the health benefits that hard       working Americans receive and increase their out of pocket       costs. The amendments added to the bill do nothing to allay       Teamster concerns nor address the fundamental flaws of the       underlying bill. The amendments make the bill worse than       before by opening the door to the erosion or elimination of       minimum coverage and pre-existing condition protections and       by allowing insurers to charge older adults much higher       premiums. It does not change the fact that the millions of       American families will lose health insurance.        Congress should be looking for ways to strengthen the       middle class instead of promoting policies that will       ultimately take money from their hard earned paychecks and       reduce, and make more costly, the health care benefits they       receive.        The American Health Care Act remains fatally flawed       Accordingly, I call on you to oppose and vote no on the       American Health Care Act when it comes to the floor today.            Sincerely,                                                    James P. Hoffa,                                                 General President.     Mr. Speaker, this is not how Washington is supposed to  work. We are supposed to improve the lives of hardworking people.  Instead, this reckless and dangerous TrumpCare bill would undermine  both the health and the economic security of millions of Americans,  people like Emily Carlson.   Emily is a small-business owner and mother of two from rural  Abingdon, Illinois. She lives with MS, a lifelong and very expensive  preexisting condition. Before healthcare reform, Emily and her husband,  Kevin, a farmer, often had to sit around the table at night, go over  their bills, and decide between sickness or debt from one month to the  next. If this bill passes, that is a choice they are going to have to  face once again.   For families like the Carlsons, TrumpCare means higher costs, fewer  choices, and worse coverage.   TrumpCare is a bad deal for Americans, but it is devastating for  rural Americans. Right now, there are nearly 700 rural hospitals at  risk of closure. This bill will pull the plug on far too many of them,  killing thousands of jobs and ripping the economic heart out of small  towns across our Nation.   It is time to put hardworking families first. Do the right thing, and  vote against this bill.
