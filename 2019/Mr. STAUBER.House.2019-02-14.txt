 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the critical need  to replace Enbridge's Line 3, an aging pipeline dangerously corroding  and operating at only 51 percent.   Line 3 pipeline replacement project is on its fourth year of review  and has met or exceeded every single required environmental standard.  The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission unanimously voted to issue  its certificate of need last year.   The project will create more than 4,000 construction jobs and enjoys  the support of construction trade unions throughout the State of  Minnesota. The project is supported by dozens of elected officials and  thousands of Minnesotans. It will also generate an additional $19  million in property tax revenue, providing a significant funding  increase to rural schools.   With all this benefit, it was greatly disappointing to hear we would  have further delays. Unfortunately, certain State officials in  Minnesota feel beholden to, in the words of our operating engineers,  ``environmental extremism.'' These environmental extremists are the  same folks who vandalized the current pipeline just last week,  ironically creating a dangerous situation for themselves and the  environment.                            ____________________
