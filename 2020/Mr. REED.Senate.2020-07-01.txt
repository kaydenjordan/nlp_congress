 Madam President, I rise to support efforts by my Democratic  colleagues to pass much needed and delayed economic measures by  unanimous consent.   It is painfully obvious that the economy is in bad shape. Families  and small businesses continue to struggle and there is a real need for  further Federal assistance. In order to get our economy back on track,  this body must take action in crafting another comprehensive,  bipartisan COVID relief package, and it must include additional help  for families and communities including eviction and foreclosure  prevention assistance, as well as additional help for State and local  governments.   Last night the Senate unanimously extended the PPP application  window. This was a tiny but needed step in recognizing the depth of the  economic crisis Americans are facing. Now the question before us is,  will Republican leaders allow this body to work its will and provide  needed, targeted, and effective rescue assistance, or will it continue  to delay and deny assistance which will only prolong the pandemic,  deepen the financial hole, and make the remedy costlier and recovery  steeper?   Strong State and local governments are critical to our economy.  Indeed, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, State  and local governments provide about 20 million jobs and contributed 8.5  percent to the national GDP in 2019. They did so by not only serving as  customers and clients for our local and national businesses, but also  by providing the essential services, such as public infrastructure, a  strong education system, and other necessary functions that provide the  business certainty that make our country attractive to businesses and  investors throughout the world. We should do everything possible to  maintain our country's comparative advantage relative to other  countries.   But today, as a result of the tremendous economic shock created by  the coronavirus and the lack of a coherent public health strategy from  the Trump administration, estimated State revenue shortfalls will total  about $615 billion over the next 3 fiscal years, not including the  added costs of fighting COVID-19. This is just for the States--$615  billion.   This is why I initially fought for $750 billion in the Coronavirus  Relief Fund when negotiating the CARES Act and introduced S. 3671, the  State & Local Emergency Stabilization Fund Act, which would provide an  additional $600 billion to State and local governments to supplement  the $150 billion in coronavirus relief funds I secured in the CARES  Act.   Madam President, would it surprise you to learn that the Trump  Treasury Department has needlessly created a bureaucratic regulation  that makes it difficult for States to use these coronavirus relief  funds? And that this regulation is standing in the way of what should  have been an immediate $150 billion boost to our economy, which even  the Chamber of Commerce thinks is burdensome. Because of this onerous  Trump rule, States can't use the coronavirus relief funds to replace  lost or delayed tax revenues in order to maintain public services.   That is what Neil Bradley, the U.S. Chamber's chief policy officer  said in an interview, ``Part of our conversation with Republicans on  Capitol Hill is  [[Page S4113]]  that, ironically, if your concern is big State government, then the  last thing you need to do is force States to replace one-time lost  revenue with permanent tax increases.''   As the primary author of the Coronavirus Relief Fund, I can tell you  that it is fully within the Treasury Secretary's authority and the  intent of the CARES Act for these funds to be used to replace lost or  delayed tax revenues and maintain public services. To prevent the  flexible use of these relief funds is a choice that is neither required  nor intended by law.   Unfortunately, this completely unnecessary choice has already created  avoidable economic harm.   Since February, State and local governments have cut a total of 1.5  million jobs, an 8-percent drop that is twice the decline seen during  and after the 2007-2009 recession. In addition, the Center for Economic  and Policy Research reports that ``job losses forced on State and local  governments by pandemic-related shortfalls will disproportionately  impact the African American workforce . . . 14 percent of state and  local employees were African American compared to 11.7 percent of  private sector employees, a margin of 20 percent.''   As the Wall Street Journal reported in a May 24, 2020, article titled  ``State and Local Budget Woes Create Drag for Economic Recovery  Prospects":         Based on evidence from the last recession, Mr. Chodorow-      Reich, a Harvard economics professor, estimates that every       dollar in cuts costs the economy $1.50 to $2. He also said       every additional dollar in spending adds $1.50 to $2 to the       economy.    Of all the regulations that this administration seeks to cut, it  should start with this one if it really wants a healthy economy. With  just one stroke of the Treasury Secretary's pen, our economy can  receive a direct multibillion dollar jolt today.    But to be clear, this administrative fix is by no means sufficient  because of the massive revenue shortfalls our State and local  governments are facing. Congress still needs to provide additional and  flexible fiscal relief to our State and local governments as part of  its next fiscal package, and it is my hope that S. 3671, the State &  Local Stabilization Fund Act, is included.   As I indicated earlier in my remarks, keeping families in their homes  also must be included in the next package.   According to Nicholas Chiumenti, with the New England Public Policy  Center in the research department at the Federal Reserve Bank of  Boston:         If current economic activity does not improve       substantially, without an extension of the CARES Act,       unemployment insurance or additional stimulus money or other       fiscal relief, up to 13 percent of homeowners and 33 percent       of renters in Rhode Island are at the risk of being unable to       pay their mortgage or rent payments. This represents over       80,000 Rhode Island households.    Nationally, according to census survey data, 23 percent of all adults  reported being housing insecure in mid-June, meaning that they had  missed last month's rent or mortgage payment or had slight or no  confidence that their household could pay next month's rent or mortgage  on time.   We know that behind each one of these numbers is a family that can be  homeless at the worst possible time in the middle of a public health  emergency.   For some, given their current health situations and age, there will  be an additional human toll that we surely should strive to avoid. We  implore our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to work with us  to keep our constituents in their homes so that they too can make it to  the other side of this public health emergency.   In that spirit, I draw your attention to S. 3620, the Housing  Assistance Fund. This legislation expands the existing ``Hardest Hit  Fund'' model and provides it with additional resources for each State  to keep families in their homes, the utilities on, the internet  connected, and the property taxes paid. As a result, landlords who are  also struggling to pay their own bills would receive some assistance.   Madam President, it is not every day that the Independent Community  Bankers of America and the Credit Union National Association support  the same legislation with consumer rights and affordable housing  organizations, such as the National Housing Conference, the National  Low Income Housing Coalition, the Center for Responsible Lending, and  the National Consumer Law Center, among others. As we work toward this  next fiscal relief package, I hope you and our colleagues will consider  joining with us in enacting S. 3620, the Housing Assistance Fund.   But we can't stop there. We must also immediately, among other needs,  increase SNAP benefits to help the almost 150,000 Rhode Islanders who  are food insecure during this crisis; boost public health efforts to  help keep the virus at bay, from more testing and contact tracing to  supporting our healthcare providers, to developing effective vaccine  deployment systems; help childcare centers, public schools, and college  campuses to safely reopen and support libraries in keeping our  communities connected; provide relief for the hardest hit small and  mid-sized businesses, many of which will continue to be shut down for  the foreseeable future; and safeguard our election infrastructure, as  Russia and other foreign actors seek again to use voter suppression,  hacking, and disinformation in the 2020 elections.   What exactly are we waiting for? Is it not enough that, according to  a June 29 CNBC article, ``the employment-population ratio--the number  of employed people as a percentage of the U.S. adult population-- plunged to 52.8 percent in May, meaning 47.2 percent of Americans are  jobless, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics?   Is it not enough that 46 percent of Business Roundtable CEOs expect  employment at their companies to decrease in the next 6 months?   We don't need to inflict any further unnecessary economic pain and  suffering. I would also urge my colleagues to consider the costs of  inaction.   Indeed, during an April 29, 2020, press conference, Federal Reserve  Chairman Powell stated:         I have long-time been an advocate for the need for the       United States to return to a sustainable path from a fiscal       perspective at the Federal level. We have not been on such a       path for some time, which . . . just means that the debt is       growing faster than the economy.        This is not the time to act on those concerns. This is the       time to use the great fiscal power of the United States to do       what we can to support the economy and try to get through       this with as little damage to the longer-run productive       capacity of the economy as possible.    This week we are also considering the National Defense Authorization  Act, and every year for the last 59 years, Democrats and Republicans  have come together to strengthen our national security and to help all  Americans. We have proven that we are more than capable of working  together productively on the most complex and controversial issues in  service of our constituents, and we would like to continue that not  just in the context of national defense but in the context of economic  prosperity and security.   One final point. We also need to extend unemployment compensation  insurance because we know it will run out, and everyone has told us  that unemployment rates will not drop dramatically. They will stay  persistently high. People will need this assistance going forward.   We must do more, and I hope we can do much more going forward.   I yield the floor.
