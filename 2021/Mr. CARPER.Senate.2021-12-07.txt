 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2  minutes, if I may.    Madam President, 234 years ago today, the State of  Delaware became the first State to ratify the Constitution. For 1 whole  week, Delaware was the entire United States of America. And we opened  it up, and 49 other States have joined us since then. For the most  part, I think it has turned out well.   But the preamble to the Constitution didn't say that we are going to  form a perfect union when they adopted it all those years ago. They  said, ``in Order to form a more perfect Union . . . ''--acknowledging  that we are not perfect, haven't gotten it right, and we may never get  it right.   But today, we take a big step--or perhaps we can take a big step  towards making our Union a bit closer to perfection.  [[Page S8945]]    The Constitution lays out a balance of powers that certain  responsibilities fall on the executive branch--the President--and  certain responsibilities fall on us; and, of course, the courts have  responsibilities of their own.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
