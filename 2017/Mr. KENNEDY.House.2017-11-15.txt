 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and mentor in the  House, the dean of our delegation from Massachusetts (Mr. Neal), for  his leadership on this issue and so many others.   Madam Speaker, I am always heartened by the quotes of President  Kennedy offered by any Member of this body. I would like to think that  they would seek to emulate him not just on the marginal tax cuts that  were put forth some 50 years ago, but also on his stance on  immigration, on civil rights, and on Russia.                                time  1845    But those are issues for another day, Madam Speaker.   The issue today is a vote that we will take on this floor tomorrow to  rewrite an American Tax Code that will touch every single American  life.   True tax reform is complicated, it is cumbersome, and, above all  else, it is deeply personal. But this bill is none of those things. It  is a massive, permanent handout to corporations passed off on American  families. It is a terrifyingly precise attack on patients with chronic  illness, a heartless roadblock for low-income students, and a choice to  value inherited wealth more than hard-earned income.   It is a gift to corporations paid to the richest among us, and it is  paid for by long nights, by double shifts, by vacations not taken, and  of hardworking American families sacrificing for their hope for a  better tomorrow.   You are asking them to fortify your tax cuts and stock options with  their classrooms, your corporate profits with their roads and bridges,  your balance sheets with their hard-earned retirement and healthcare  benefits.   For all the talk about the boost to corporate profits, 80 percent of  the stocks in this country are owned by 10 percent of Americans. Ask  yourself who is going to actually be the beneficiary of all that money.  That is what this bill does.   You have heard from my Republican friends over the course of the past  couple days about how much this will save the average American family,  but not about the 36 million people and families who will experience a  tax hike.   What they aren't telling you is what is going to happen the moment  this bill is passed. Luckily for the American public, one of the chief  economic advisers to the President has said so. He said that after this  bill is done, they are turning directly toward welfare cuts, Social  Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. So when you hear questions about how  much this bill is going to save you, ask how about your retirement.  These cuts go right to Social Security.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Madam Speaker, ask them how much more money that $1,000  is going to save you when your healthcare benefits are taken away. By  the way, that clause just got added over in the Senate.   Ask them how much more some savings might go for one family when you  gut and shred a social safety net that has powered the greatest  expansion of economic growth that this country has ever seen.   That is what your bill does. That is what this bill means. That is  what this bill is about. It is about the values envisioned of an  America, about a tax structure that should reflect the values of the  American family, not the values of corporate balance sheets.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to address their  remarks to the Chair.
