 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman who is the  chairman of our Judiciary Committee for recognizing me.   I really do wish we could concentrate on other issues as well, and I  think that we are. I think that creation of 6.5 million jobs, of unity  around the world, of restoring dignity and respect among our people,  trying to put our attention onto things as important as Build Back  Better and taking care of the economy, recognizes that Joe Biden, this  administration, this Democratic majority in the House of  Representatives, can chew gum and walk at the same time.   If my colleagues don't think this is worthy of debate, then they  should have gone on and done what they did 2 years ago and vote for the  bill a couple weeks ago.   But here we are today. Here we are today standing on behalf of those  individuals, whether my colleagues on the other side recognize it or  not, who are discriminated against as children in school, as adults who  are trying to get jobs, as individuals who are trying to get housing,  as individuals who simply want access to public accommodations and to  be beneficiaries of federally funded programs.   Why are they denied these opportunities? Because there are folks in  this society who get to make those decisions who think that because  your hair is kinky, it is braided, it is in knots, or it is not  straightened blond and light brown, that you somehow are not worthy of  access to those issues. That is discrimination.   There is no logical reason that anyone should be discriminated  against on any level because of the texture of their hair or the style  of their hair.   I understand that my colleagues on the Republican side don't get the  vast array of discriminatory practices because they spend so much time  trying to perpetuate an all-White society here in the most diverse  country in the world.   Nonetheless, this bill is vitally important. It is important to the  young girls and the young boys who have to cut their hair in the middle  of a wrestling match in front of everyone because some White referee  says that your hair is inappropriate to engage in your match. That  young man engaged in his match and he won it.   It is inappropriate for our girls to be sent home disciplined or  pushed out simply because they have got braids in their hair. And it is  doggone sure discriminatory to deny someone employment, housing, or  public accommodations because of the way they are wearing their hair.   That is why we are standing here today. It is unfortunate that we  have to, but we do.   With that in mind, I thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee  for giving me this opportunity to speak on behalf of a bill that I  think is vitally important, that represents movement and understanding  in the 21st century, what discrimination can look like and what it can  do to people.   I urge all of my colleagues, including those on the Republican side  that voted for it a couple weeks ago, to vote for it today.                                time  0930
