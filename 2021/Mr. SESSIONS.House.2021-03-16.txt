 Madam Speaker, one month ago, the entire State of Texas  was blanketed with a polar vortex that plunged temperatures to single  digits for over 120 hours. Six inches of ice, combined with nine inches  of snow, were common as far south as San Antonio, Texas. Within a day,  all 254 counties in Texas were under a State and Federal emergency  declaration.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to give thanks to heroes who heard and  saw this crisis and did something about it.   Two heroes--Chairman Lew Cohen, and his partner, Magnes Glenn, from  Hawaiian Springs Water--sprung into action. A simple call as a result  of our friendship resulted in over 8,000 water bottles being shipped to  Leon County, Texas; and 8,500 bottles of water being shipped to  Freestone County, Texas.   Help they were. Thank you to so many who were just like these two  heroes who helped Texas in her time of need.                            ____________________
