 Mr. President, I rise today with deep sadness, but  also with reverence to remember Jack Powell, who died on May 12, 2018.  Jack Powell was a beloved coach and educator in Alabama. He was revered  by his students and players and often regarded as a second father to  many. Until his 95th birthday, regular reunions were held by former  high school players to honor Coach Powell and reminisce with former  teammates. His accomplishments on and off the course touched thousands  of lives.   Coach Powell was born on March 20, 1922, in Andalusia. He was one of  10 children born to George Bennie and Lilla Lawson Powell. He played  basketball in the State tournament for 3 years as a student at Pleasant  Home High School. They went undefeated during the regular season of his  senior year. Coach Powell went on to Auburn University to play for  coaches Bob Evans, Ralph ``Shug'' Jordan, and V.J. Edney. While at  Auburn, he was a letterman 2 years in a row and cocaptain of the team  in 1946.   After his college career, he served as an educator for approximately  40 years. He worked at Lockhart and Eufaula high schools from 1947 to  1966, then Livingston University, now the University of West Alabama,  from 1966 to 1972, and finally at Sparks State Technical College in  Eufaula until his retirement.   During his time as a high school coach, he received several Coach of  the Year Awards and won district, area, regional, and State  championships. He coached three Alabama All-Star Games, including the  inaugural game in 1963. He served as coach to 11 All-State players.  While at Eufaula High School, his team went to the State tournament  nine times, finishing in the top four positions. During his 20-year  tenure, he amassed an impressive winning record of 406-193.  [[Page S5264]]    When he entered the college coaching scene in 1966, he led Livingston  University to its first Alabama Collegiate Conference championship and  two consecutive ACC Tournament Championships. In 1969, he was named ACC  Coach of the Year and in 1971 was again named ACC Coach of the Year, in  addition to Alabama Small Colleges Coach of the Year and NAIA District  27 Coach of the Year.   In 1992, after decades of hard work and commitment to teams, he  became one of the first inductees in the Alabama High School Sports  Hall of Fame. One of his greatest honors was having a gymnasium named  after him in Eufaula, where it served as the home to Eufaula's youth  basketball leagues for many years. He also established a Tri-State  basketball tryout clinic where players came from Alabama, Florida,  Georgia, and Tennessee. As a result, more than 60 young athletes earned  scholarships to play in college.   Aside from teaching and coaching, Coach Powell was an avid  outdoorsmen who loved to fish, hunt, and garden. He also served in his  churches in both Eufaula and Livingston. He was a Sunday school teacher  for more than 50 years in addition to serving as a deacon and chairman  of the board for more than 12 years.   My wife, Louise, and I extend our sincerest condolences to Coach  Powell's two sons, five grandchildren, seven great-grandchildren, and  the entire extended community of athletes and fans on whom he made a  positive impact. His legacy lives on in each of us.                            ____________________
