 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include any extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?  [[Page H2457]]    There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include any extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?  [[Page H2457]]    There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, today's Special Order is going to be about  the theme: What do we have to lose?   That was something that you heard during the Presidential campaign.  Specifically, we want to focus on what do we have to lose: $54 billion  in domestic spending.   Earlier this month, President Trump released his budget named America  First, a Budget Blueprint to Make America Great Again. After reading  Trump's budget, I can't help but wonder: Is this truly a mirror of his  campaign to put Americans first?   The easy answer to that is ``no.''   According to the Trump budget, America comes dead last. In fact, this  budget proposal is all talk when it comes to helping U.S. students  access education and well-paying jobs. One of the most alarming things  about the budget is how it affects the education of students at  minority-serving institutions.   Mr. Speaker, HBCUs, Historically Black Colleges and Universities,  were first created in 1964 to educate Black Americans excluded from  segregated public and private universities, and this budget will  perpetuate the inequalities that currently exist for Black students.   Today, HBCUs continue to provide students--no matter their race or  their economic background for that matter--the ability to receive a  quality education. According to the United Negro College Fund, 70  percent of all HBCU students rely on Federal grants and workstudy  programs to finance their education.   After Trump pledged to support and strengthen HBCUs during a meeting  with the presidents of HBCUs in the Oval Office, the budget at hand is  another unfulfilled promise. A recent letter from the president of the  UNCF, United Negro College Fund, explained the complete elimination of  the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, as proposed  under the Trump budget. This would negatively impact more than 55,000  HBCU students.   Helping low-income students achieve higher education is very serious,  and we know that these cuts would hurt. Proposed reductions would also  hurt the Federal workstudy initiatives, and it would eliminate another  26,000 students the ability to pay for college expenses or to improve  their employment prospects.   I knew a lot of students who worked under the college workstudy  program when I was a student in college, and I can tell you just how  critical that program is. For a lot of kids, that is the difference  between going to college and not being able to go to college. Having  that job on campus allows you to earn money, but stay on campus,  affording you more time to be able to study and do other things that  you need to do in order to be a successful student.   Also, according to the Center for American Progress, the Trump budget  will hit minority communities the hardest. The budget also calls for  $200 million in cuts to Federal TRIO programs, which help low-income,  first-generation, and disabled students; and GEAR UP, a program that  helps prepare low-income middle and high school students for college.   It shouldn't be any surprise to us that President Trump would want to  gut funding to help disabled students succeed. We saw this sort of  nastiness on the campaign trail, and we really do need to see how we  can, again, boost these programs because they have been helping so many  kids for a long time.   I can tell you of someone who utilized a Pell Grant Program. I am  sure there are many Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle that  had to use the Pell Grant Program. Similarly, the Trump budget keeps  the Pell Grant Program, but it cuts $3.9 billion in critical funding  for many students.   According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the Pell  Grant Program is the largest Federal grant program. The same study  found that the program sends up to $5,900 to students and families that  earn less than $40,000 a year and prioritizes funding for families  earning closer to $20,000 or less.   Again, if you are a low-income family, being able to utilize that  money, particularly at that level--$40,000 and below, $20,000 and  below--even if you were doing a little bit better than that, you know  that that is not a lot of money, and that is why these Pell Grant  Programs are so important.    Pell Grant continues to be an important program that helps level the  playing field for African Americans and helps to minimize student loans  after graduation.   A study by Brookings reported that Black students who graduated, as  of October 2016, owed over $52,000 in student loan debt, compared to  White graduates who owed approximately $28,000. By reducing funding,  Trump is limiting a child's ability to achieve economic mobility and  move toward the American Dream.   I am going to ask that my colleague from the great sunshine State of  Florida (Mrs. Demings), who is going to help lead this Special Order  hour, talk a little bit about how important a lot of these programs are  to her State. Her State has many great universities, including, in  Tallahassee, Florida A&M University, one of our Historically Black  Colleges and Universities that have produced so many great graduates  from that school. Although the African-American students may not go to  FAMU--but they may go to Florida State, they may go to Gainesville to  the University of Florida, they may go to the University of Miami--they  need this money in order to be successful.   In the gentlewoman from Florida's work as a Member of Congress and  her previous work in law enforcement, the gentlewoman works closely  with families, with kids who are trying to pull themselves up and make  a difference. I think that America would love to hear from the  gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Demings) just because she has seen  firsthand, again, what these grants, this job training, TRIO, and these  other programs mean to these students.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Demings).    Mr. Speaker, we have a lot to talk about tonight dealing  with HBCUs, dealing with TRIO, dealing with these programs like GEAR  UP, Pell Grants, jobs and job training, college workstudy.   I want to invite one of our colleagues up, one of our leaders,  Representative Jim Clyburn from the State of South Carolina. One of the  demographics that often go overlooked in this debate is the plight of  rural African-American students. Representative Clyburn, not only does  he understand and empathize with the plight of the urban African- American student, but he also understands again some of the struggles  that the rural African-American student faces and how their ticket out  of their hometown to be able to go experience something different is  education. Many of these kids, Representative Clyburn will tell you,  have never had the opportunity to get far outside of their hometowns in  rural America.                                time  1945    These programs give them the opportunity to do so. So I want to  invite our assistant leader to come up. He is a graduate of South  Carolina State University, the Bulldogs, one of our esteemed HBCUs, and  again, I just appreciate his voice on this topic.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.  Clyburn).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the assistant leader. I really  appreciate his comments, and I want to thank him for standing up for  these students and everyone else out there who is trying to do  something to help eliminate poverty.   The gentleman's 10-20-30 plan was really hailed as something that we  should all take a closer look at. It was a bipartisan approach and a  look at poverty because it affected so many different people's  districts. I just want to thank the gentleman for being an advocate in  this area.                                time  2000    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the great State of  California (Ms. Bass).   Karen Bass also is someone that really takes these topics seriously.  She has always been someone who has delved very deeply into the budget  and into domestic spending and how it impacts our communities. I just  really appreciate her taking part to really share what we think is  important as it relates to this budget.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Bass very much for  her comments and remarks. I really appreciate the gentlewoman always  taking this subject to task very seriously and to heart.   Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Budd). The gentleman has 26 minutes  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Bass very much for  her comments and remarks. I really appreciate the gentlewoman always  taking this subject to task very seriously and to heart.   Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Budd). The gentleman has 26 minutes  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Evans), who has really made this, again, one of his priorities  also. Philadelphia is one of those cities where many people have  benefited by a lot of these domestic spending programs, including  students like I talked about a little earlier. I would now like to hear  from my esteemed colleague from the State of Pennsylvania, Mr. Dwight  Evans.    Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate Representative Evans'  thoughtfulness and his participation on the topic.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine  Waters), who is my colleague from Los Angeles County. The gentlewoman  is known as a fighter in her district not only on these domestic  spending issues and not only in her district, but throughout the entire  United States.   I am very happy that she is participating, and I know that she has  been very vocal about those developments, dealing with the budget and  dealing with other issues that affect us here in Washington, D.C. I  really appreciate the gentlewoman's participating in tonight's  discussion.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I do appreciate the  time that I have been allotted here this evening, joining with my  colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus to answer the question  that was posed to us by this President. I rise to answer President  Trump's question to the Black community.   Now, all throughout his campaign, President Trump declared that Black  people all across this country just live in hell and fear each day, and  we may be shot on the street. He basically said that we have nothing,  our education is no good, on and on and on. Then he went on to say that  only he can solve the challenges African Americans face.   Unfortunately, this kind of talk is typical of this President:  boasting, bragging, and making promises. This President will say  anything and promise anything, of course, with no intention of living  up to his promises. One should not believe anything he has to say.   As a matter of fact, the African-American community understands very  well when these kinds of empty promises are made. As a matter of fact,  I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the presidents of  the Historically Black Colleges and Universities organized, put  together, a proposal, and they went to meet with the President at the  White House.  [[Page H2461]]                                     time  2015    They didn't even have an opportunity to present the proposal. They  were just ushered around in a photo op, and that was all that happened,  without any real conversation, without any proposals being produced.  They were treated in a disrespectful way.   This, basically, is what I have decided we can expect from the  President. His budget and policy priorities reveal his true intentions  and what so many of us already know about this President. He really  doesn't care about the issues facing the African-American community,  and he doesn't care to learn about those issues or advance any  meaningful legislation to provide jobs and economic opportunities for  our Nation's most vulnerable communities.   If you take a look at Trump's HUD budget, you find a $6 billion  reduction. He wants to eliminate the Community Development Block Grant  program, which supports our cities and various urban renewal projects.  He wants to eliminate the HOME Investment Partnerships Program. This  President wants to eliminate the Choice Neighborhoods program. He wants  to eliminate the homeownership program and on and on and on.   Just last week, this President tried and failed to repeal the  Affordable Care Act. If that unconscionable bill had passed, 14 million  people would have lost insurance coverage next year, and the American  people would have seen billions of dollars in Medicaid cuts.   Trump's empty promises do not end with the budget. He has also filled  his Cabinet with millionaires and billionaires who don't have a clue  about the challenges facing the African-American community.   Trump's Treasury Secretary was known as the ``Foreclosure King,'' who  profited off the backs of vulnerable homeowners during the 2008  recession.   Trump's Education Secretary knows nothing about public education, did  not attend public schools. Her children didn't attend public schools.  She was not chosen to repair public education; she was chosen to break  it.   Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who lied under oath before the  Senate, opposed the Violence Against Women Act. He has taken hardline  positions against our efforts to reform the criminal justice system,  which disproportionately incarcerates African Americans. Of course, we  knew about his background and his history and what he is known for, and  that is discrimination, disrespect for African Americans.   Mr. Speaker, my position against this President and his  administration is clear: I oppose this President. I do not honor this  President. I do not respect this President. He has disrespected the  office and offended so many people across this country and around the  world with his disgusting and indecent rhetoric against women, the  Black community, Muslims, immigrants, and disabled Americans.   Mr. Speaker, it is not just the African-American community who will  lose under this President. It is everyone who isn't a millionaire or  billionaire that stand to lose under this administration. I will  continue to oppose him and fight him every step of the way.   While I am talking about where he has put his priorities--and, of  course, I think the budget really does reflect your priorities--he has  reduced the education budget by 13 percent, or $9 billion less than  last year; a $168 billion increase for charter schools, 50 percent  above current levels.   Let's take a look at labor. It reduces the budget by 21 percent, a  $2.5 billion decrease from last year. Health and Human Services,  decreased funding by $15 billion, the lowest in 20 years.   It reduces funding for the National Institutes of Health by 19  percent. For the Environmental Protection Agency, it reduces the budget  from $8.1 billion to $5.7 billion. Housing and Urban Development,  again, reducing the budget by just about $6 billion, or 13.2 percent.   He claims he cares about small businesses. He reduces the SBA budget  by 5 percent, or $43.2 billion less than last year. It goes on and on  and on.   Homeland Security, increases the budget by only 6.8 percent, to $44  billion, even though he claims he cares a lot about the security of  this country.   What am I saying? I am simply saying that African Americans have  struggled and fought, historically. Many African Americans have paid a  huge price fighting for justice and equality in this country and have  died for it. I don't have to call the names of Martin Luther King and  all the others. We have paid a price. We have fought.   But guess what? Despite the fact that America has not always been  there for us, we have always been there for America. We have fought in  America's wars. We have suffered discrimination. We have suffered  isolation and undermining. But we stand up for America, oftentimes when  others who think they are more patriotic--who say they are more  patriotic--do not.   When we fight against this President and we point out how dangerous  he is for this society and for this country, we are fighting for  democracy. We are fighting for America. We are saying to those who say  they are patriotic but they turn a blind eye to the destruction that he  is about to cause this country: You are not nearly as patriotic as we  are.   We not only have fought in America's wars, have stood up for America,  have been there whenever this country was threatened in any way, we say  now that this country is threatened with a President who does not  belong there, a President who does not understand how this government  works, a President who goes down to Mar-a-Lago every weekend and plays  golf. He is not huddling with Members of Congress and trying to figure  out how to form a consensus. Rather, he thought he could come in here  and run roughshod over everybody. But that is how he works, that is how  he acts.   He is not good for America. African Americans know this. The Black  Caucus understands this. And for those members of the Black Caucus  representing our leadership who went to meet with him, they have laid  out to him all of this, what our care and concerns are all about. But  in the final analysis, we really don't expect anything from him. My  mission and my goal is to make sure that he does not remain President  of the United States of America.     I thank Representative Waters for her comments on this  very timely matter.   Mr. Speaker, how much time do we have remaining?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has 9\1/4\ minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Scott), my good friend, who is also a leader on education issues and  domestic spending. I thank him very much for participating tonight.    Mr. Speaker, before I close out this Special Order hour,  I do want to thank my colleague from Florida, Representative Val  Demings, for participating, and I want her to just share some last  words on this subject: What do we have to lose? I know she has a few  more things that she wants to share with everybody.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Demings for her words  and inspiration, and I really appreciate her perspective, again. Now  she is getting an opportunity to see this as a Member of Congress, but  the 27 years that she spent in law enforcement, it gave her a bird's- eye perspective on what happens when we don't invest in education, when  we don't invest in health care, when we don't invest in things that  help families uplift themselves and give themselves opportunities to  pull one another out of poverty. I just want to thank her again for  participating in tonight's Special Order hour.   Mr. Speaker, we have a lot to talk about because we do have a lot to  lose, and I thank everybody for participating.   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, when President Trump  spoke on the campaign trail, his message to the African American  community was clear: ``What do you have to lose?'' Today, just 9 weeks  into his presidency, we now know that in a Trump Administration, the  American people stand to lose their access to robust medical care,  jobs, and more than $54 billion used to fund critically important  programs and Departments through the Federal government.   President Trump's fiscal year 2018 budget proposal to Congress seeks  roughly $54 billion in dramatic cuts to social programs and domestic  spending in order to accommodate an equal increase in spending through  the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, and Veterans Affairs.  His proposal is a poor reflection of the priorities that we hold as a  nation and undermines--or eliminates entirely--many of the very  programs that millions of Americans rely on the most.   For example, the President's budget proposal slashes funding for  education by cutting grants for after school programs and reduces  financial aid for low-income students, such as Pell Grants. The  Department of Housing and Urban Development will also see a thirteen  percent--or $6.2 billion--reduction in its budget, which is reflected  in the elimination of the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)  program, the HOME Investment Partnerships program, and Section 4  Community Development and Affordable Housing.   I cannot help but notice that there is a certain degree of hypocrisy  reflected in the President's budget proposal when comparing to what he  has touted during the campaign. For example, the Department of  Transportation will suffer significant cuts to programs such as TIGER,  which has been an incredibly successful discretionary grant program  used to fund projects of nation significance in communities all across  the country. President Trump's budget proposal also looks to eliminate  funding for the Capital Investment Grant program, which the Dallas Area  Rapid Transit (DART) in Texas has utilized for many years to respond to  the explosive population growth within my district and build up our  transportation infrastructure. This moves our nation further away from  the $1 trillion in transportation infrastructure spending that the  President has proposed during the campaign.   Mr. Speaker, I cannot support the President's budget proposal in its  current form. The cuts included in his proposal are irrational and  ignore the dire needs of our people to bolster our transportation  infrastructure, create jobs, and pave the way for greater economic  opportunity for all Americans--not just a select few. President Trump  also wants to slash taxes for the wealthy and our biggest corporations.  He will pay for those tax breaks by placing the burden on lower- and  middle-class Americans. Just months into his presidency, it is already  crystal clear that the American people have a lot to lose under his  vision for America and I am proud to join my colleagues in the  Congressional Black Caucus to oppose these devastating cuts and the  entire Trump agenda.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from  engaging in personalities toward the President.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 29 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Tuesday, March 28, 2017, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
