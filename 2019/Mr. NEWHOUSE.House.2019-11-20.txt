 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Native American  History Month and the contributions of Native Americans in my  congressional district in central Washington.   With 29 Federally recognized tribes across the State, Washingtonians  live alongside Native Americans who serve our communities through  entrepreneurship, military service, and sharing their rich and storied  cultural history. They are our friends, family, neighbors, and  coworkers.   While we recognize that one month out of the year to remember the  historical and cultural contributions of our Native friends, we must  support them as they face a crisis that has affected Native women for  decades. That crisis is of missing and murdered indigenous women.   In Washington, Native Americans make up about 2 percent of the  population, but indigenous women account for 7 percent of the State's  reported missing women. This includes 31 open cases on or near the  Yakama Nation Reservation.   During Native American History Month, I challenge this body to honor  the heritage of our Native friends by taking up legislation that will  help ensure that missing and murdered loved ones are not part of the  history of another generation of Native women.                            ____________________
