 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I want to associate myself with the remarks  of the Senator from Iowa and just say that it is long overdue that this  institution gets back to regular order when it comes to processing  appropriation bills. If you look at the way that you govern a country  and have as much spending and debt on an annual basis as this country  does, you need to do it in a way that reflects each individual bill  being considered so that individual Senators--not just those on the  Appropriations Committee but those in the entire Senate--have an  opportunity to have their voices heard.   In the last few years, we have ended up with, as the Senator from  Iowa pointed out, a huge omnibus spending bill at the end of the year  put together, cobbled together, by a bunch of people in a back room.  That is not the way to run a government, a government of this size and  scope, with as many moving parts as we have. We need the oversight that  comes with the annual appropriations process, and we need the fiscal  responsibility and restraint, hopefully, that comes with a regular  appropriations process.   So I would echo that and am pleased that the Senate Appropriations  Committee has reported the bills out to the floor of the Senate. I  would hope, now, that the Democratic leader will ensure that that is  job No. 1; that is, taking up these bills and passing them in a way  that reflects not only the will of our constituents, which is to have  more visibility and transparency and accountability when it comes to  government spending, but also a way that reflects the rights and the  prerogatives that their elected representatives have to consider these  things in the light of day and to have their voices heard whether they  serve on the Appropriations Committee or not.                  School Hunting and Archery Program Funding    Mr. President, since taking office, President Biden has not hesitated  to use the power of the modern regulatory state to advance his far-left  agenda, at times in contravention of the clear intent of Congress.   Take his recent decision to cancel oil and gas leases in Alaska in  defiance of congressional direction or his radical interpretation and  implementation of the Green New Deal provisions of the so-called  Inflation Reduction Act, which has left one of the bill's Democratic  authors deeply frustrated with the White House.   But today I want to talk about another instance of Presidential  overreach, and that is the Biden administration's decision to use the  Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to deny Federal funding to school  hunting and archery programs. The provision of the bill the  administration is citing as justification for its decision denied  Federal funding for training or arming teachers and school resource  officers. It was not intended to prevent hunting safety training or  deny students the opportunity to participate in archery programs. In  fact, neither hunting nor archery is ever mentioned in the legislation.  But, characteristically, the Biden administration has decided to make  use of this provision to further advance its far-left agenda.   Mr. President, for the sake of the Biden administration, which  frequently seems completely out of touch with rural America, let me  just talk about hunting for a minute. Hunting is a venerable  institution in rural communities. It is about gathering meat to fill  the freezer, yes; but it is also about much more than that. It is about  community, tradition, coming together around the table, conservation,  and respect for the land.   My dad taught me and my siblings to hunt, and while we learned how to  bag roosters, we also learned a lot of life lessons, from patience to  perseverance to gun safety. I cherish those times with my dad and the  times I spend today hunting with my family, friends, sons-in-law, and  people on an annual basis, just to get together for an opportunity to  spend time together, quality time together, in the beautiful outdoors  in South Dakota.   School districts should have the choice of spending their Federal  extracurricular dollars on programs that teach kids how to carry on  this venerable tradition safely and responsibly.   HuntSAFE for Schools, which teaches hunting safety in South Dakota  schools, uses nonfunctional guns to teach kids about hunting, with ``an  emphasis on firearm safety and responsibility.''   These kinds of programs have an effect. Learning to safely handle  firearms results in a decrease in firearm-related injuries and  accidents. Hunting education programs have contributed to a steep  decline in hunting accidents. Funding these programs in schools seems  like a good thing to do to promote safer communities.   As for archery, I am going to tell you, I am at a complete loss as to  why the Biden administration would seek to deny Federal funding to  these programs. The National Archery in the Schools Program, which has  1.3 million students in nearly 9,000 schools in 49 States enrolled in  archery programs, offers students the opportunity to experience all the  benefits of an accessible and inclusive sport that teaches everything  from personal excellence to perseverance.   The National Archery in the Schools Program reports that 58 percent  of participating students say they feel more connected to their school,  40 percent feel more engaged in the classroom, and a whopping 91  percent pursue or want to pursue other outdoor activities as a result  of their archery participation.  [[Page S4424]]    Once again, school districts should have the choice of spending their  Federal extracurricular dollars on programs like this that  unquestionably--unquestionably--meet the goal of helping to offer  students a well-rounded education. And it is a use of those dollars  that Congress never sought to ban, as I suspect the Biden  administration is well aware and already knows.   There have already been reports of schools canceling plans to include  hunting or archery education in their curricula as a result of the  Biden administration's directive. The Biden administration needs to  immediately reverse its decision before more programs are canceled and  more kids lose out on opportunities to develop the confidence, the  skills, and the sense of community that come from participating in  these programs.   I have little hope that the Biden administration will rein in its  radical agenda or stop using its regulatory power to impose its far- left visions, but I am grateful that both Democrats and Republicans are  raising questions about this particular instance of Biden  administration overreach. I hope we can continue to work to curb the  Biden administration's regulatory excesses and prevent Americans from  suffering the painful consequences of this President's radical  policies.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
