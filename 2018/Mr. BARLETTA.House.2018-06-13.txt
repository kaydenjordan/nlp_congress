(b) Clerical Amendment.--The analysis for chapter 145 of       title 40, United States Code, is amended by inserting after       the item relating to section 14509 the following:  ``14510. Drug abuse mitigation initiative.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 5294.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5294, the Treating Barriers to Prosperity Act,  positions the Appalachian Regional Commission, or ARC, to better serve  communities across Appalachia that struggle with the ongoing opioid  crisis.   In 2015, there were 5,594 overdose deaths in Appalachia, a drug- related death rate 65 percent higher than the national average. Sixty- nine percent of those deaths were a result of opioid abuse.   The majority of the lives lost were individuals between the ages of  25 and 44, people who were in their prime working years.   In my home State of Pennsylvania, the statistics are striking. The  Drug Enforcement Administration reported that more than 4,600  Pennsylvanians died in 2016 from drug overdoses, with thousands more  affected by addiction.   This is an increase of 37 percent from 2015, with opioids accounting  for 85 percent of the overdoses.   These troubling statistics make it clear that the opioid crisis is  not only destroying lives, it has created a significant challenge to  workforce and economic development throughout Appalachia.   In distressed communities like many in Appalachia, economic  development programs must adapt and become real partners in addressing  this crisis. One approach is ensuring our economic development agencies  have the clear authorities they need.   H.R. 5294 clarifies that ARC funds may be used to facilitate best  practices among the Appalachian States and support programs designed to  reduce the harm of opioids to the workforce and economic growth.   The bill also clarifies funds can be used specifically to attract and  retain healthcare businesses and workers.   This is critical, as it will focus on both job creation and, at the  same time, provide much needed access to healthcare services for those  struggling with addiction.   Finally, the bill recognizes that in many areas of Appalachia,  infrastructure, such as broadband, must be developed to support these  businesses and innovations like telemedicine.   I want to thank the gentlewoman from Nevada for cosponsoring this  important legislation with me, along with the gentleman from Kentucky  (Mr. Rogers) for his leadership on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill and take an  important step in combating a national epidemic.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Rogers).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 263.
