 Madam Speaker, tonight, Congress opens back up for the  first time in 49 years without Congressman Don Young, and this Chamber  is going to feel a big hole, especially, off to my left in the back  side in that chair. No one in here has assigned seating, except our  dean did.   For the first time in 49 years, we will not hear Don's booming voice  yelling ``regular order.''   For the first time in 49 years, we won't see that big smile or  friendly laugh.   For the first time in 49 years, we won't hear that strong voice when  it comes to an issue about Alaska. But we will never forget him or the  legacy he leaves behind.   Don taught all of us, and especially me, three big lessons.   First, he taught us how to fight for what you believe in, regardless  of party.   Second, he taught us how deep a love can be for your own family, and  savor every moment together.   Third, he reminded us of what an honor it is to serve our  constituents.   We will miss Don deeply. But more importantly, we will not forget  him.   Madam Speaker, I ask that the House rise to observe a moment of  silence for our dean, Congressman Don Young.

The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1004         Resolved, That the House has heard with profound sorrow of       the death of the Honorable Donald E. Young, a Representative       from the State of Alaska and beloved Dean of the House.        Resolved, That the Clerk communicate these resolutions to       the Senate and transmit a copy thereof to the family of the       deceased.        Resolved, That when the House adjourns today, it adjourn as       a further mark of respect to the memory of the deceased.    The resolution was agreed to.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
