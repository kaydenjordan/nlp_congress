 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate National  Apprenticeship Week.   I am proud the Trump administration has, once again, placed an  emphasis on these crucial skills development and employee advancement  programs.   The Department of Labor has continually recognized the importance of  apprenticeships to the future of work in our Nation and, for the fifth  year in a row, dedicated a week to highlighting the need for expanded  access to these educational and career opportunities.   It is essential we increase awareness of the benefits of these  crucial programs which link our education system with our workforce  development initiatives.   As I travel throughout Kentucky's First Congressional District, I  hear from employers of all sizes and industries that say they are  unsatisfied with recent graduates' credentials and they are lacking  workers with the skills necessary to perform the duties of their job.   As a new member to the Committee on Education and Labor this  Congress, I am proud of the bipartisan pieces of legislation we have  advanced and look forward to future opportunities to support employers,  provide skills development for those already employed, and enhance the  jobs and generations of the future.                            ____________________
