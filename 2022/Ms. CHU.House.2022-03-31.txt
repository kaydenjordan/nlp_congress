 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 6833,  the Affordable Insulin Now Act.   I will never forget the day a constituent in my district showed me  his bottle of insulin. He told me that one day while traveling in  Canada he found he forgot it, so he went to a pharmacy. He found that  that same bottle of insulin that he buys here in the U.S. for $200 cost  only $25 in Canada, the exact same product.   He started calculating how much it would cost him to fly to Canada  once every 3 months, and then asked himself: Why are Americans the only  ones paying these exorbitant prices?   Nobody should have to sacrifice just to afford medicine. That is why  today's bill is so important. By capping the cost of insulin at $35 a  month, this bill will ensure that monthly costs for millions of  families are truly affordable. It is time to prioritize the needs of  our people so that every American can afford to stay alive.
