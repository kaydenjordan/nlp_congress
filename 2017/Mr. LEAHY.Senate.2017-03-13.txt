 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, there are a couple of issues that I will  speak on, but I was asked earlier this morning about what President  Trump has tweeted, basically charging former President Obama with  having spied on him in a way that would be plainly illegal. Of course,  President Obama's advisers have denied any such thing happened. If it  did happen, of course, it would be a grave constitutional issue, and if  such a thing did happen, it would be criminal conduct. Now, many people  are saying: Well, is it true or not? Was Mr. Trump telling the truth in  the tweet or not? There is a very simple response on this. There is one  person who knows whether it is true or not, and he has been totally  silent on this.   They asked Attorney General Sessions. Attorney General Sessions made  it very clear in his confirmation hearing--well, he said a number of  things in his confirmation hearing, but one was, of course, that he  would be independent. President Trump has leveled very serious charges  against former President Obama. I happen to feel the charges are false,  but let's have a definitive voice. The Attorney General should have the  courage and independence to simply say whether Mr. Trump is telling the  truth or not. It is a very simple matter. I would hope that the press  and everybody else would keep asking because eventually somebody has to  answer that question, and the Attorney General can.    Madam President, as the Senate continues to consider  nominees to lead Federal agencies, I am concerned that once again there  is a nominee before us with a stunning lack of expertise to run an  agency that affects so many American lives. Seema Verma is another such  nominee.   The Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,  CMS, has an incredible responsibility to ensure some of America's most  important programs run smoothly. For decades, Medicare and Medicaid  have offered coverage to some of our Nation's most vulnerable  populations. Medicare and Medicaid currently cover more than 100  million Americans--nearly one in three patients. The Administrator is  responsible for overseeing more than $1 trillion in annual spending and  a staff of about 4,000 people. This is a position of vital importance  where a new Administrator should hit the ground running, instead of  learning on the fly.   And learning on the fly is what she will have to do, as evidenced by  her testimony before the Finance Committee. When asked to name a  specific program she would commit to improving as Administrator, she  could not identify even one. She also demonstrated a lack of commitment  to protect healthcare for women, saying that coverage for prenatal and  maternity care should be optional and paid for separately. Does Ms.  Verma really want to return us to a time when women are discriminated  against in healthcare solely because of their gender? It appears so.  When asked about provider payment systems, she stumbled to answer,  showing little knowledge about a system that directly impacts millions  of providers across the Nation. Furthermore, the only fact she could  name about Medicare Part D, a benefit that supports more than 40  million seniors, was about an online plan finder tool.   Supporters of her nomination point to her involvement and design of  Indiana's Medicaid program as her qualification to run CMS. Directed by  then-Governor Mike Pence, Indiana's plan requires even the poorest  patients to pay a monthly fee in order to access health insurance. The  plan also restricts those who miss a payment to be locked out of care  for 6 months. Instead of working to find ways to help Indianans gain  insurance coverage, she contributed to a system that bars access to  vulnerable patients. Conversely, Vermont also has a Medicaid waiver  that, combined with Vermont's All Payer Waiver, has a goal of insuring  all Vermonters. Vermont's is the standard that we should all be trying  to meet. I am not confident that Ms. Verma is up to the task.   What is more concerning is how Ms. Verma fits into a world where  Republicans are engaged in an effort to not only rip apart the  Affordable Care Act, but also to end the Medicaid Program as we know  it. The current proposals before the House of Representatives would cut  hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicaid, leaving States in the  lurch and causing millions to go uninsured or to have substandard care.  As Republicans continue these efforts, it will be critical for the  Administrator of CMS to understand and care about the impacts of such  efforts on the millions of Americans who rely on these health  protections day to day.   Confirming someone with such a lack of experience to run a trillion- dollar  [[Page S1764]]  agency would be unfair to the American people. And as a core player in  the effort to unravel the Affordable Care Act, she demonstrates values  that are counter to the very agency which has been supported and  improved by key provisions in the law. I do not believe Seema Verma is  qualified or fit to serve as the Administrator of CMS, and I encourage  all Members to join me in opposing her nomination.   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam President, the Centers for Medicare and  Medicaid Services, or CMS, is a major part of the Department of Health  and Human Services. A third of the Nation--more than 100 million  Americans--get access to quality healthcare through CMS's programs-- Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program, and the  Affordable Care Act Marketplace. CMS also includes the Center for  Medicare and Medicare Innovation and several other activities to  improve access and affordability in our Nation's health system for all  Americans--regardless of income, gender, or health status.   President Trump, Secretary Price, and congressional Republicans seek  to drastically restructure our Nation's healthcare, threatening to  leave millions without coverage. In the face of that threat, we need a  CMS Administrator who knows how to lead CMS and is willing to do  whatever she can to protect Americans' healthcare. After hearing from  several organizations that deal directly with CMS and familiarizing  myself with President Trump's nominee, I cannot support the nomination  of Seema Verma for this important role.   Ms. Verma does not have the experience or appropriate knowledge  needed to head this vital agency. Her limited scope of experience with  just Medicaid, lack of familiarity with Medicare, and willingness to  restructure CMS's rules that protect millions are cause for deep  concern.   If confirmed, Ms. Verma would manage 85 percent of the HHS's $1  trillion budget, which in turn is more than a quarter of the Federal  Government's, and Ms. Verma would oversee 4,000 employees. Running CMS  requires significant experience with healthcare and is best done by a  person who has held significant positions in private industry and  government.   But nothing in Ms. Verma's career shows her to have the skills to  operate a budget or team of this magnitude. She has never managed a  large organization and has little experience with Medicare. Ms. Verma  has operated a small, 10-person company, SVC, Inc., and consulted on  various State Medicaid programs. Her experience is inadequate for the  important role for which President Trump nominated her.   The next CMS Administrator will have an important voice forming  healthcare policy. HHS Secretary Price has been on the forefront of  efforts to slash Medicaid and turn Medicare into a voucher program.  President Trump, Secretary Price, and congressional Republicans have  made it a priority to repeal the Affordable Care Act. We need a CMS  Administrator who will provide a reality check in the face of these  reckless proposals. We need a CMS Administrator who will work to uphold  President Trump's promise that ``there will be no cuts to Social  Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.''   Ms. Verma, however, could not make that commitment during her Senate  Finance Committee confirmation hearing. To the contrary, during her  hearing, Ms. Verma expressed openness to block-granting Medicaid or  instilling per-capita caps--putting the coverage of nearly 70 million  vulnerable Americans at stake. These policies would end the Federal  guarantee of matching funds to States and would dramatically cut  Federal funding to States. Analyzing a 2012 congressional Republican  block grant proposal, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found  that, for States to manage their Medicaid programs at reduced funding  levels, they would have to limit Medicaid eligibility, reduce benefits,  cut payment rates, or increase out-of-pocket costs for beneficiaries.  These proposals would result in the denial of healthcare and long-term  care to millions of vulnerable Americans.   We need a leader at CMS who will defend the historic gains of the  Affordable Care Act The Affordable Care Act set standards for consumer  protection and significantly expanded coverage. Repeal could cause 22  million Americans--and 400,000 Marylanders--to lose quality, affordable  health coverage. Repeal would imperil new access to life saving  substance-use-disorder and mental health treatment Repeal would  endanger coverage for children who now have access to comprehensive  health services. Repeal could significantly raise premiums and erode  consumer protections for Americans who have coverage outside of the  Marketplace.   Under the Affordable Care Act, insurance plans must provide maternity  care as an essential health benefit. But during her nomination hearing,  Mrs. Verma said that, while some women want maternity coverage, ``some  women might not choose that,'' signaling her view that the law should  not require insurance companies to provide this critical coverage. This  is unacceptable. Ms. Verma's position would put the health of mothers  and families at risk and drive up costs for plans that did provide the  coverage. We will not turn back the clock to when maternity coverage  was optional. We need an Administrator who will stand with mothers and  families on this issue.   Because of Ms. Verma's lack of adequate healthcare experience and her  willingness to consider rash policies that are far out of the  mainstream, I do not believe that she is equipped to appropriately  advise the President and Secretary on these policies that affect  millions of Americans. I will not support her nomination to head CMS.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.    Mr. President, Vermont is known far and wide as a tourist  destination for all seasons. From our celebrated ski slopes to our  stunning and world-renowned fall foliage, Vermont draws travelers from  near and far, from nearby States and from Canada, our neighbor to the  north. What many don't realize is that Vermont has also become home to  refugees and asylum seekers from Iraq, Syria, Bosnia, Sudan, and  elsewhere. These men, women and children enrich our communities and  inspire us all.   One Vermont community, Rutland, last year announced that it would  welcome refugees fleeing the catastrophic civil war in Syria. The town  was preparing to welcome 100 refugees. Nine arrived. When President  Trump issued his appalling and disastrous executive order banning  admission to refugees from Syria and six other nations, the remaining  91 individuals were prevented from coming to Vermont.   I have heard from hundreds of Vermonters outraged by President  Trump's Executive actions to close our borders to those seeking refuge.  Also deeply concerning is the President's clear intent on targeting  Muslim refugees. The freedom of religion, enshrined in the First  Amendment of our Constitution and defended through the ages by  generations of Americans, should not be squandered to promote an  unfounded fear.   The voices raised in opposition to these executive orders cross the  spectrum. I want to include in the Record some of those voices:  students at Rutland High School, some of whom have formed the New  Neighbors Club, to help welcome refugee students who will attend  Rutland City Public Schools.   Emma writes: ``I am a 9th grader from Rutland High School. We should  continue to support immigration in Vermont and the United States. These  people deserve a good life and don't deserve what they have to go  through.''   Carolyn writes: ``I'm from Rutland, Vermont, and I believe that  refugee resettlement is an important issue. We have the opportunity to  make a change in these people's lives and make new relationships and  bonds in our lives. They need a support system so why can't that be  us?''   Lea writes: ``This immigration ban is a big problem to me. I don't  like that our country is stopping people from coming to our country. I  know many people are afraid of what could happen to us. But we are all  human and they are humans looking for safety.''   Lily writes, ``Everyone deserves the same amount of respect and  understanding that we afford to anyone. The refugees obviously need our  help and we are completely capable of building a community that is  ready and willing to accept the refugees.''   Jessica writes: ``I can understand these fears, but they also clearly  come from an inhumane and misinformed point of view. Without  immigration in the past, no one would be here, and it is simply un- American to deny freedom from persecution to refugees and other  immigrants.''   Emma writes: ``With all of the recent stigma regarding the Refugee  Resettlement Plan, Rutland's program has recently gone static. At  Rutland High School, we have a club that helps raise money and  eventually welcome the refugees. Please make all the movement possible  to make these people feel welcome in our state. We don't want to be  stuck on the wrong side of history.''   Victoria writes: ``I feel that it is incredibly important for us to  help refugees who are in desperate need of a second chance at life. As  a global superpower of a country, it seems absurd to me that we are  accepting so few refugees to our communities, as we could be helping  with the global refugee crisis a whole lot more by actually trying to  mitigate it.''   Ian writes: ``The refugees should come to Rutland because we are  devoted to helping integrate them into our community. Several of the  students here are devoting every Friday to getting together and coming  up with great ideas on how we can incorporate them.''   Kjersti writes: ``As a citizen in the United States, I believe the  diversity is what makes this country beautiful, and the fact that  someone is exempt from the freedom and is turned away because of their  diversity is not what this country stands for.''   Noah writes: ``I believe we should let people immigrate to Vermont  because the people in these countries are living in terrible living  conditions. Everyone in this world is equal so there's no reason not to  let them in. They just want a chance at a safe life.''   Ashleah writes: ``We should continue to support immigration for the  Syrian refugees into our community. This is such a great opportunity  for Rutland to experience more diversity and more culture. Our small  city would benefit greatly from allowing refugees to come and live with  us.''   Kelsey writes: ``People who are safe and living comfortably should do  their best to help those that need it. I feel by turning them away and  denying them help we are being inhuman and cruel.''   Caitlin writes: ``I believe immigration should be accepted in all  areas of this country. I strongly support the idea of people wanting to  make a better life for themselves. I choose to take a stand against  anti-immigration for I believe it is essential to make America  better.''   Greta writes: ``These Syrians are people who have gone through  atrocities and deserve our help. They will also promote understanding  and diversity in our community amidst this political climate of fear  mongering. Welcoming Syrian refugees will only be beneficial for  Rutland and United States, and is upholding the value of America and  human rights.''  [[Page S1775]]    And Elizabeth writes: ``I am disappointed with how our current  administration is portraying our nation to the rest of the world. I  think the people of the United States are stronger, more loving, and  kinder people than what is being shown, and I think we need to take  individual action in order to show this.''   The voices of these young Vermonters are emblematic of what I hear  from Vermonters across our State. We all want to keep our country safe;  of that, there is no question. But President Trump's travel ban ignores  the clear fact that refugees are the most stringently vetted travelers  to the United States. His Executive order provokes and plays on fear.  It does not make us safer.   Benjamin Franklin once famously said, ``Those who give up essential  liberty, to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty  nor safety.'' I hope all Senators will listen to the words of these  young Vermonters. President Trump's Executive order does little to  enhance our security, but does great damage to the freedoms that are  the cornerstone of our good and great Nation.                            ____________________
