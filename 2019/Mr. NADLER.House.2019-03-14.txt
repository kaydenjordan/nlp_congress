 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 208, I call up  the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 24) expressing the sense of  Congress that the report of Special Counsel Mueller should be made  available to the public and to Congress, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on H. Con. Res. 24.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H. Con. Res. 24 expresses the sense of Congress that any  report Special Counsel Robert Mueller delivers to the Attorney General  should be released to the public and to Congress. This concurrent  resolution is important for several reasons.   First, transparency is fundamental to the special counsel process,  especially when dealing with matters of national security involving the  President.   In January 2017, the U.S. intelligence community unanimously reported  that ``Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign  in 2016 aimed at the U.S. Presidential election'' and that ``Putin and  the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect  Trump.'' As a result of the importance of this charge and the clear  conflict of interest in a matter involving the President, Robert  Mueller was appointed as special counsel by the Acting Attorney General  ``in order for the American people to have full confidence in the  outcome.''   This is why in the only other instance involving the appointment of a  special counsel under the regulations, concerning the Waco tragedy, the  special counsel's report was released in full by the Attorney General.   Second, this resolution is critical because of the many questions and  criticisms of the investigation raised by the President and his  administration. It is  [[Page H2724]]  important that Congress stand up for the principle of full transparency  at a time when the President has publicly attacked the Russian  investigation more than 1,100 times and counting. Among other things,  the President has repeatedly referred to the investigation as a ``witch  hunt'' and called it a ``hoax,'' ``rigged,'' and a ``scam.''   This resolution is also needed because high-ranking DOJ officials  have indicated that they may not release information about individuals  who are not indicted. Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein stated last  month that ``if we aren't prepared to prove our case beyond a  reasonable doubt in court, then we have no business making allegations  against American citizens.''   This normally salutary policy must not apply in the event the  Department adheres to its policy that it cannot indict a sitting  President. To maintain that a sitting President cannot be indicted no  matter how much evidence there is because he is a sitting President,  and then to withhold evidence of wrongdoing from Congress because the  President cannot be charged, is to convert DOJ policy into the means  for a coverup.   Third, releasing the Mueller report, even in its entirety, does not  absolve the Department of Justice of its obligation to provide Congress  with the underlying evidence uncovered by the special counsel. This  expectation is well grounded in precedent set by the Department just in  the last Congress in connection with three Republican-led  investigations into Hillary Clinton's emails, the dismissal of former  FBI Acting Director McCabe, and allegations of bias concerning the  Russian investigation.   With respect to the investigation involving Secretary Clinton's  emails, this included the Department of Justice releasing to Congress  more than 880,000 pages of documents regarding the FBI's  decisionmaking, identifying to Congress the names of career officials  involved in the charging decision, identifying to Congress specific  court cases relied on in the charging decision, and making numerous DOJ  and FBI personnel available to Congress for transcribed interviews.   With respect to the dismissal of former Acting Director McCabe, this  included releasing to Congress all documents relied on by the Office of  Professional Responsibility in making its decision.   With respect to claims of bias in the Russian investigation, this  included not only releasing to the public an otherwise classified  foreign intelligence application, but also releasing to Congress: one,  all underlying documents and communications involving the FISA  applications; two, four memos detailing the former FBI Director's  communications with the President; three, materials pertaining to  classified briefings involving the Trump and Clinton Presidential  campaigns; and four, making even more DOJ and FBI officials available  for a total of 21 transcribed interviews and hearings.   These precedents make clear the obligation of the Department of  Justice to release all evidence with respect to the Russian  investigation.   A vote for this resolution will send a clear signal to both the  American people and to the Department of Justice that Congress believes  transparency is a fundamental principle necessary to ensure that  government remains accountable to the public.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join  me in supporting this commonsense resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Waters), the distinguished chairwoman of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Schiff), the distinguished chair of the Intelligence  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Ted Lieu), a member of the Judiciary Committee.                                time  0930     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Neguse), a member of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen), the distinguished chairman of the Subcommittee  on Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal), a member of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett), the sponsor of this legislation to ensure that the  work of the special counsel is not suppressed and will offer valuable  assistance on today's resolution.    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Connecticut (Mr. Himes).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a member of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished majority leader.   (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, contrary to what the gentleman from Georgia implied a  few  [[Page H2729]]  minutes ago, that we shouldn't be wasting our time on this because it  only restates what the regulations require and the Judiciary Committee  ought to be spending its time more productively, I simply want to say,  first, that the Democratic House majority and the Judiciary Committee  are not focused on the President to the exclusion of our legislative  priorities.   In the 2 months since we organized, the Judiciary Committee has  passed H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019, through  the House and has passed H.R. 1112, the Enhanced Background Checks Act  of 2019, through the House. H.R. 1585, the Violence Against Women  Reauthorization Act of 2019, passed through the committee. We have  passed H.R. 1, the For the People Act of 2019, through the House.   The Judiciary Committee has also held a hearing to begin the process  of reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act and held a hearing to examine  the state of competition in the healthcare industry, as well as the T- Mobile-Sprint merger.   We have introduced H.R. 5, the Equality Act; H.R. 1327, the Never  Forget the Heroes: Permanent Authorization of September 11th Victim  Compensation Fund Act; and the American Dream and Promise Act of 2019,  the so-called Dreamers bill.   These are some of the things we have been doing besides looking into  the possible misconduct by the President.   In closing, I would like to include the following items in the  Record:   First, the U.S. Intelligence Community report concluding that  Vladimir Putin ordered a misinformation campaign directed against the  2016 Presidential election and displayed a clear preference for then- candidate Donald Trump.     Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections                             (January 6, 2017)                                key judgments         Russian efforts to influence the 2016 US presidential       election represent the most recent expression of Moscow's       longstanding desire to undermine the US-led liberal       democratic order, but these activities demonstrated a       significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and       scope of effort compared to previous operations.        We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an       influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential       election. Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in       the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and       harm her electability and potential presidency. We further       assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear       preference for President-elect Trump. We have high confidence       in these judgments.        We also assess Putin and the Russian Government aspired to       help President-elect Trump's election chances when possible       by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting       her unfavorably to him. All three agencies agree with this       judgment. CIA and FBI have high confidence in this judgment;       NSA has moderate confidence.        Moscow's approach evolved over the course of the campaign       based on Russia's understanding of the electoral prospects of       the two main candidates. When it appeared to Moscow that       Secretary Clinton was likely to win the election, the Russian       influence campaign began to focus more on undermining her       future presidency.        Further information has come to light since Election Day       that, when combined with Russian behavior since early       November 2016, increases our confidence in our assessments of       Russian motivations and goals.        Moscow's influence campaign followed a Russian messaging       strategy that blends covert intelligence operations--such as       cyber activity--with overt efforts by Russian Government       agencies, state-funded media, third-party intermediaries, and       paid social media users or ``trolls.'' Russia, like its       Soviet predecessor, has a history of conducting covert       influence campaigns focused on US presidential elections that       have used intelligence officers and agents and press       placements to disparage candidates perceived as hostile to       the Kremlin.        Russia's intelligence services conducted cyber operations       against targets associated with the 2016 US presidential       election, including targets associated with both major US       political parties.        We assess with high confidence that Russian military       intelligence (General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate or       GRU) used the Guccifer 2.0 persona and DCLeaks.com to release       US victim data obtained in cyber operations publicly and in       exclusives to media outlets and relayed material to       WikiLeaks.        Russian intelligence obtained and maintained access to       elements of multiple US state or local electoral boards. DHS       assesses that the types of systems Russian actors targeted or       compromised were not involved in vote tallying.        Russia's state-run propaganda machine contributed to the       influence campaign by serving as a platform for Kremlin       messaging to Russian and international audiences.        We assess Moscow will apply lessons learned from its Putin-      ordered campaign aimed at the US presidential election to       future influence efforts worldwide, including against US       allies and their election processes.     Second, I include a February 22, 2019, letter to the  Attorney General from six House committee chairs expressing the  expectation that the Mueller report will be made public and that the  Department will make the underlying investigative materials available  to committees upon request.                                      Congress of the United States,                                        House of Representatives,                                  Washington, DC, February 22, 2019.      Hon. William P. Barr,      Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Attorney General: Recent reports suggest that       Special Counsel Robert Mueller may be nearing the end of his       investigation into ``any links and/or coordination between       the Russian government and individuals associated with the       campaign of President Donald Trump'' and other matters that       may have arisen directly from the investigation. As you know,       Department of Justice regulations require that, ``[a]t the       conclusion of the Special Counsel's work, he or she shall       provide the Attorney General with a confidential report       explaining the prosecution or declination decisions reached       by the Special Counsel.''        After nearly two years of investigation--accompanied by two       years of direct attacks on the integrity of the investigation       by the President--the public is entitled to know what the       Special Counsel has found. We write to you to express, in the       strongest possible terms, our expectation that the Department       of Justice will release to the public the report Special       Counsel Mueller submits to you--without delay and to the       maximum extent permitted by law.        There also remains a significant public interest in the       full disclosure of information learned by the Special Counsel       about the nature and scope of the Russian government's       efforts to undermine our democracy. To the extent that the       Department believes that certain aspects of the report are       not suitable for immediate public release, we ask that you       provide that information to Congress, along with your       reasoning for withholding the information from the public, in       order for us to judge the appropriateness of any redactions       for ourselves.        We also expect that the Department will provide to our       Committees, upon request and consistent with applicable law,       other information and material obtained or produced by the       Special Counsel regarding certain foreign actors and other       individuals who may have been the subject of a criminal or       counterintelligence investigation. This expectation is well-      grounded in the precedent set by the Department in recent       years. In other closed and pending high-profile cases       alleging wrongdoing by public officials, both the Department       and the FBI have produced substantial amounts of       investigative material, including classified and law       enforcement sensitive information, to the House of       Representatives.        Finally, although we recognize the policy of the Department       to remain sensitive to the privacy and reputation interests       of individuals who will not face criminal charges, we feel       that it is necessary to address the particular danger of       withholding evidence of misconduct by President Trump from       the relevant committees.        If the Special Counsel has reason to believe that the       President has engaged in criminal or other serious       misconduct, then the President must be subject to       accountability either in a court or to the Congress. But       because the Department has taken the position that a sitting       President is immune from indictment and prosecution, Congress       could be the only institution currently situated to act on       evidence of the President's misconduct. To maintain that a       sitting president cannot be indicted, and then to withhold       evidence of wrongdoing from Congress because the President       will not be charged, is to convert Department policy into the       means for a cover-up. The President is not above the law.        Thank you for your consideration.            Sincerely,      Rep. Jerrold Nadler,        Chairman, House Committee on the Judiciary.      Rep. Elijah Cummings,        Chairman, House Committee on Oversight and Reform.      Rep. Adam Schiff,        Chairman, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.      Rep. Eliot Engel,        Chairman, House Foreign Affairs Committee.      Rep. Maxine Waters,        Chairwoman, House Committee on Financial Services.      Rep. Richard Neal,        Chair, House Ways and Means Committee.   [[Page H2730]]          Third, the introduction to the final report to the Deputy  Attorney General concerning the 1993 confrontation at the Mount Carmel  complex.                                Introduction         This Report contains the findings of the Special Counsel in       response to the questions directed to him by Attorney General       Janet Reno in Order No. 2256-99, dated September 9, 1999. The       questions pertain to the 1993 confrontation between federal       law enforcement officials and the Branch Davidians at the Mt.       Carmel complex near Waco, Texas. The Report is issued       pursuant to Section (e) of Order No. 2256-99 which provides,       in relevant part, that the Special Counsel shall submit ``to       the maximum extent possible . . . a final report . . . in a       form that will permit public dissemination.''        The Office of Special Counsel has organized the Report in       the following format:        (I) a description of the Issues investigated by the Special       Counsel;        (II) the Conclusions of the Special Counsel;        (III) a description of the Investigative Methods used by       the Special Counsel;        (IV) a Statement of Facts relevant to the Special Counsel's       investigation;        (V) Exhibits to the text of the Report; and        (VI) Appendices that include a narrative summary of the       relevant beliefs and practices of the Branch Davidians, a       summary of expert findings, a chronological table of events,       and the reports of experts retained by the Office of Special       Counsel.     And fourth, the Department of Justice commentary  interpreting the special counsel regulations.       DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE      Office of the Attorney General      28 CFR Parts 0 and 600      [A.G. Order No. 2232-99]      Office of Special Counsel        AGENCY: Department of Justice.        ACTION: Final rule.        SUMMARY: This order amends the Code of Federal Regulations       to provide regulations concerning Attorney General       appointment of Special Counsel to investigate and, when       appropriate, to prosecute matters when the Attorney General       concludes that extraordinary circumstances exist such that       the public interest would be served by removing a large       degree of responsibility for a matter from the Department of       Justice. These regulations replace the procedures for       appointment of independent counsel pursuant to the       Independent Counsel Reauthorization Act of 1994.        EFFECTIVE DATES: July 1, 1999.        FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John C. Keeney, Deputy       Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, U.S.       Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20530, (202) 514-2621.      SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:      Background        The Attorney General is promulgating these regulations to       replace the procedures set out in the Independent Counsel       Reauthorization Act of 1994. These regulations seek to strike       a balance between independence and accountability in certain       sensitive investigations, recognizing that there is no       perfect solution to the problem. The balance struck is one of       day-to-day independence, with a Special Counsel appointed to       investigate and, if appropriate, prosecute matters when the       Attorney General concludes that extraordinary circumstances       exist such that the public interest would be served by       removing a large degree of responsibility for the matter from       the Department of Justice. The Special Counsel would be free       to structure the investigation as he or she wishes and to       exercise independent prosecutorial discretion to decide       whether charges should be brought, within the context of the       established procedures of the Department. Nevertheless, it is       intended that ultimate responsibility for the matter and how       it is handled will continue to rest with the Attorney General       (or the Acting Attorney General if the Attorney General is       personally recused in the matter); thus, the regulations       explicitly acknowledge the possibility of review of specific       decisions reached by the Special Counsel.        The regulations also remove Sec. 0.14, setting forth       procedures for Special Independent Counsels for members of       Congress. The regulations in that section have been suspended       since April 19, 1989. 54 FR 15752.      Section-by-Section Discussion        Section 600.1. Grounds for Appointing a Special Counsel        ``The Attorney General, or in cases in which the Attorney       General is recused, the Acting Attorney General, will appoint       a Special Counsel when he or she determines that criminal       investigation of a person or matter is warranted and--        (a) That investigation or prosecution of that person or       matter by a United States Attorney's Office or litigating       Division of the Department of Justice would present a       conflict of interest for the Department or other       extraordinary circumstances; and        (b) That under the circumstances, it would be in the public       interest to appoint an outside Special Counsel to assume       responsibility for the matter.''        Section 600.2. Alternatives Available to the Attorney       General        ``When matters are brought to the attention of the Attorney       General that might warrant consideration of appointment of a       Special Counsel, the Attorney General may:        (a) Appoint a Special Counsel;        (b) Direct that an initial investigation, consisting of       such factual inquiry or legal research as the Attorney       General deems appropriate, be conducted in order to better       inform the decision; or        (c) Conclude that under the circumstances of the matter,       the public interest would not be served by removing the       investigation from the normal processes of the Department,       and that the appropriate component of the Department should       handle the matter. If the Attorney General reaches this       conclusion, he or she may direct that appropriate steps be       taken to mitigate any conflicts of interest, such as recusal       of particular officials.''         Discussion:        There are occasions when the facts create a conflict so       substantial, or the exigencies of the situation are such that       any initial investigation might taint the subsequent       investigation, so that it is appropriate for the Attorney       General to immediately appoint a Special Counsel. In other       situations, some initial investigation, whether factual or       legal, may be appropriate to better inform the Attorney       General's decision. This provision is intended to make it       clear that a variety of approaches, even in cases that might       create an apparent conflict of interest, may be appropriate,       depending on the facts of the matter.        Section 600.3. Qualifications of the Special Counsel        ``(a) An individual named as Special Counsel shall be a       lawyer with a reputation for integrity and impartial       decisionmaking, and with appropriate experience to ensure       both that the investigation will be conducted ably,       expeditiously and thoroughly, and that investigative and       prosecutorial decisions will be supported by an informed       understanding of the criminal law and Department of Justice       policies. The Special Counsel shall be selected from outside       the United States Government. Special Counsels shall agree       that their responsibilities as Special Counsel shall take       first precedence in their professional lives, and that it may       be necessary to devote their full time to the investigation,       depending on its complexity and the stage of the       investigation.        ``(b) The Attorney General shall consult with the Assistant       Attorney General for Administration to ensure an appropriate       method of appointment, and to ensure that a Special Counsel       undergoes an appropriate background investigation and a       detailed review of ethics and conflicts of interest issues. A       Special Counsel shall be appointed as a `confidential       employee' as defined in 5 U.S.C. 7511(b)(2)(C).''        Section 600.4. Jurisdiction        ``(a) Original Jurisdiction. The jurisdiction of a Special       Counsel shall be established by the Attorney General. The       Special Counsel will be provided with a specific factual       statement of the matter to be investigated. The jurisdiction       of a Special Counsel shall also include the authority to       investigate and prosecute federal crimes committed in the       course of, and with intent to interfere with, the Special       Counsel's investigation, such as perjury, obstruction of       justice, destruction of evidence, and intimidation of       witnesses; and to conduct appeals arising out of the matter       being investigated and/or prosecuted.        ``(b) Additional Jurisdiction. If in the course of his or       her investigation the Special Counsel concludes that       additional jurisdiction beyond that specified in his or her       original jurisdiction is necessary in order to fully       investigate and resolve the matters assigned, or to       investigate new matters that come to light in the course of       his or her investigation, he or she shall consult with the       Attorney General, who will determine whether to include the       additional matters within the Special Counsel's jurisdiction       or assign them elsewhere.''         Discussion:        Under these regulations, it is intended that a Special       Counsel's jurisdiction will be stated as an investigation of       specific facts. The regulations also recognize, however, that       accommodations can be made as necessary throughout the course       of the investigation, with the Attorney General's approval.       This provision establishes a protocol whereby Special       Counsels are provided with an appropriate description of the       boundaries of their investigation, with the full recognition       that adjustments to that jurisdiction may be required.        Paragraph (b) establishes a single procedure through which       a variety of different jurisdictional issues can be resolved.       For example, a Special Counsel assigned responsibility for an       alleged false statement about a government program may       request additional jurisdiction to investigate allegations of       misconduct with respect to the administration of that       program; a Special Counsel may conclude that investigating       otherwise unrelated allegations against a central witness in       the matter is necessary to obtain cooperation; or a Special       Counsel may come across evidence of additional, unrelated       crimes by targets of his or her investigation. Rather than       leaving the issue to argument and misunderstanding as to       whether the new matters are included within a vague category       of ``related matters,'' the regulations clarify that the       decision as to which component would handle such new matters       would be made by the Attorney General. The Special Counsel       would report such matters to the Attorney General, and the       Attorney General would decide whether to grant the Special  [[Page H2731]]       Counsel jurisdiction over the additional matters.        ``(c) Civil and Administrative Jurisdiction. If in the       course of his or her investigation the Special Counsel       determines that administrative remedies, civil sanctions or       other governmental action outside the criminal justice system       might be appropriate, he or she shall consult with the       Attorney General with respect to the appropriate component to       take any necessary action. A Special Counsel shall not have       civil or administrative authority unless specifically granted       such jurisdiction by the Attorney General.''         Discussion:        Paragraph (c) is intended to clarify that the Special       Counsel's jurisdiction will cover only the criminal aspects       of the matters within his or her jurisdiction, unless other       jurisdiction is specifically granted by the Attorney General.        Section 600.5. Staff        ``A Special Counsel may request the assignment of       appropriate Department employees to assist the Special       Counsel. The Department shall gather and provide the Special       Counsel with the names and resumes of appropriate personnel       available for detail. The Special Counsel may also request       the detail of specific employees, and the office for which       the designated employee works shall make reasonable efforts       to accommodate the request. The Special Counsel shall assign       the duties and supervise the work of such employees while       they are assigned to the Special Counsel. If necessary, the       Special Counsel may request that additional personnel be       hired or assigned from outside the Department. All personnel       in the Department shall cooperate to the fullest extent       possible with the Special Counsel.''         Discussion:        This provision, providing for the assignment of appropriate       personnel to assist the Special Counsel, also includes       assignment of needed investigative resources from the Federal       Bureau of Investigation. It is anticipated that most       personnel will be Department of Justice employees provided by       detail to the Special Counsel, although the regulation       provides for additional employment from outside the       Department when necessary.        Section 600.6. Powers and Authority        ``Subject to the limitations in the following paragraphs,       the Special Counsel shall exercise, within the scope of his       or her jurisdiction, the full power and independent authority       to exercise all investigative and prosecutorial functions of       any United States Attorney. Except as provided in this part,       the Special Counsel shall determine whether and to what       extent to inform or consult with the Attorney General or       others within the Department about the conduct of his or her       duties and responsibilities.''        Section 600.7. Conduct and Accountability        ``(a) A Special Counsel shall comply with the rules,       regulations, procedures, practices and policies of the       Department of Justice. He or she shall consult with       appropriate offices within the Department for guidance with       respect to established practices, policies and procedures of       the Department, including ethics and security regulations and       procedures. Should the Special Counsel conclude that the       extraordinary circumstances of any particular decision would       render compliance with required review and approval       procedures by the designated Departmental component       inappropriate, he or she may consult directly with the       Attorney General.''     I would also like to say, Mr. Speaker, that one reason  for this resolution, given the fact that Mr. Barr, the Attorney  General, has, in fact, said that he would want to release as much as  possible--and we appreciate that statement--but he and Mr. Rosenstein,  the Deputy Attorney General, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, have  both cited the Department policy not to comment on the conduct of  someone not indicted.   That leads us to expect that a misapplication of the normal  Department policy to a sitting President of not commenting on someone  who is not indicted, the application of that normally good policy to a  sitting President who the Department believes cannot be indicted  because he is a sitting President, would, in fact, greatly limit the  ability of the Department or the willingness of the Department to  release information in the report to the Congress and to the public.   One of the reasons for this resolution is that we want to say, no,  you cannot use that normally salutary policy to convert the  Department's policy of never indicting a sitting President into a  coverup that you can't comment or give to the Congress information  about that.   If you can't indict a sitting President and you can't give the  information to Congress, then you are holding the President above the  law, and you are frustrating Congress' ability to do its job of holding  an administration accountable.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hurd).                                time  1000     Mr. Speaker, I yield 15 seconds to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Collins).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, for all the reasons stated by all the people who spoke  in favor of this resolution, myself and everyone else, I urge adoption  of the resolution. I urge everyone to vote for it. It is a very  important resolution to maintain the rule of law in this country   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
