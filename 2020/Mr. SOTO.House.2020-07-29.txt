 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of legislation we just  passed, the Commission on the Social Status of Black Men and Boys that  was sponsored by my fellow Floridian, Congresswoman Wilson.   Slavery lasted for over 246 years in America, from 1619 to 1865. It  is one of America's original sins. People think of the Civil War as  ancient history, but there are actually still even children of slaves  alive today. They may be in their late eighties, early nineties, but it  makes you realize it wasn't that long ago.   In the 13th through 15th Amendments, we saw a great change  prohibiting slavery, creating citizenship, due process, and the right  to vote for African Americans.   Then, you had the Reconstruction Era. It started out with promising  potential. Federal troops helped ensure votes throughout the Nation. We  elected African Americans to the House and Senate, and according to  Sherman's promise, everyone would get 40 acres and a mule.   It all came tumbling down, though, starting with the assassination of  President Abraham Lincoln, and President Johnson began to dismantle  Reconstruction. Then, President Hayes ended Reconstruction in 1877 as  part of a corrupt deal to ensure his Presidency.   Those in the South, African Americans, were arrested and put on chain  gangs, among other ways, to force them into indentured servitude. Those  in the North and West faced discrimination, discrimination in jobs,  housing, justice, education, healthcare, marriage. Even facilities  became segregated.   It reached a fevered pitch with ``The Birth of a Nation'' in 1915,  restarting the KKK and lynchings and renewed interest in the  Confederacy, its leaders, and its symbols. It played upon every  terrible stereotype of African-American men on the silver screen for an  impressionable public to see.   But it didn't stop there. Financial segregation was generationally  punishing. African-American troops fought in World War I and World War  II in segregated units for a country that discriminated against them.  Then, they came home and were shut out of the New Deal programs during  the Great Depression, shut out of VA student loans and home loans.   They missed out on the greatest expansion of the middle class during  the 1950s, and it was then that their renewed civil rights fight was  just beginning.   With the success of the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act of the  1960s, we saw some improvement, victories fought hard by  John Lewis,  who we just lost.   Even with these advances, discrimination persisted in the systems of  justice, finance, business, and other foundations of our society.   Add in the 1980 war on drugs and the 1994 crime bill, and the list of  laws and rules to systematically break up Black families, especially  the arrest of Black men, reverberates today as our Nation looks inward  after the murder of George Floyd about our country's racist past and  institutional bias against Black men and boys, as well as Black women  and girls.   This is why the Commission on the Social Status of Black Men and  Boys, as well as the Justice in Policing Act, are so important.   There must be an investigation, a realization, and reckoning in  America about the racist past of this country and generational theft.  We must develop lasting solutions if we are to progress as one Nation  where every American is created equal.                            ____________________
