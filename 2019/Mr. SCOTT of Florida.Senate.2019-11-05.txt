 Madam President, as a member of the  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  a small business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit  at the heart of our economy. This week, it is my privilege to honor a  business that provides quality women's clothing while also fostering  economic development within its immediate community. It is my pleasure  to recognize Pink Stable of Camden, SC, as the Senate Small Business of  the Week.   Pink Stable is a boutique located in historic downtown Camden.  Established in 2014, Kathryn Couch's business provides both classic and  trendy clothing at an affordable price for women of all ages. Kathryn  filled an empty space in Camden's downtown after noticing there were  few places where women could buy contemporary clothing with an element  of southern flair. After securing private financing, she began  implementing her unique business plan and quickly developed a loyal  customer base. Currently, the business is expanding their brand and  brainstorming ideas to create a greater following outside of Camden.  Their Instagram page has amassed over 4,000 followers. This social  media outlet is used to scale their business and provide merchandise to  a wider range of potential customers.   Since its founding, Pink Stable has also made a significant positive  impact in the community by maintaining its commitment to customer  service and quality products. Through the Main Street South Carolina  Program, the city of Camden has allocated $32.5 million to revitalize  the historic downtown area and expand the local economy. Kathryn's  business has helped inspire others to consider opening shops and  restaurants in downtown Camden. Pink Stable has become an integral part  of the community, proving that a Camden-based business can flourish  through determination and a well-executed business plan.   Kathryn was recently awarded with the honor of South Carolina Young  Entrepreneur of the Year by the South Carolina Small Business  Administration in 2019 for her outstanding contributions. Pink Stable's  success has led Kathryn to open another small business in the Camden  area, Evelyn's Bridal Store, which was recognized as South Carolina's  Best Bridal Store in 2017. I am honored to recognize Kathryn and the  entire team at Pink Stable as the Senate Small Business of the Week.  Their boutique is a great example of how strategic vision and  determination can create commercial success, and I look forward to  watching their continued growth.                            ____________________
