 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 3229) to protect the safety of judges by extending the authority  of the Judicial Conference to redact sensitive information contained in  their financial disclosure reports, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3229         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF REDACTION AUTHORITY CONCERNING                     SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION.         Section 105(b)(3)(E) of the Ethics in Government Act of       1978 (5 U.S.C. App.) is amended by striking ``2017'' both       places it appears and inserting ``2027''.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  California (Mr. Issa) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 3229, currently under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 3229, currently under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   As chairman of the Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Internet  Subcommittee, I recognize the importance of judicial security needs.   Federal judges hear cases involving hardened criminals on a regular  basis. Although not everyone threatens a Federal judge and not everyone  is a gang member, many are. Federal judges and their families should  not be at risk for simply doing their jobs.   Congress provides funding for a variety of judicial security needs by  building secure court houses, staffing metal detectors at entrances,  and so on, but there is a simple way to address security needs without  extending taxpayer dollars. One method is to redact specific  information from judicial financial disclosure reports done by the  judges and other key employees. If they are to be targeted, we cannot  have a judge's home address or other information that allows tracking  by a criminal to, in fact, be a source of their demise.   The redaction authority has been in place since Congress began, in  1998, to allow for this, and it has been extended and expanded, in a  number of cases, to include family members. The redaction process  requires input and agreement from the U.S. Marshals Service.   The legislation that my colleague from New York (Mr. Jeffries) and I  introduced would extend the redaction authority for an additional 10  years, until December 31, 2027. There is no financial impact from this,  and it serves to put judges and their families in a position they have  historically been in since 1998: less at risk by this information being  disclosed.   I not only urge the House to support this legislation, but after  careful consideration and research, we find that this authority has not  been abused, it has been properly used, and the Federal judges have  earned the absolute right to this limited redaction.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I, too, would close by urging my colleagues to  support this well-thought-out, well authored, and in regular hearings  by the committee, universally accepted as necessary and reasonable for  a 10-year extension.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
