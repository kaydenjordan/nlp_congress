 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of title IV, insert the following:       SEC. 406. NEW MELONES RESERVOIR.         The authority under section 4006 of the WIIN Act shall       expire 7 years after the date of the enactment of this Act.       SEC. 407. ACTIONS TO BENEFIT THREATENED AND ENDANGERED                     SPECIES AND OTHER WILDLIFE.         None of the funds made available under section 4010(b) of       the WIIN Act may be used for the acquisition or leasing of       land, water for in-stream purposes if the water is already  [[Page H5528]]       committed to in-stream purposes, or interests in land or       water from willing sellers if the land, water, or interests       are already designated for environmental purposes by a court       adopted decree or order or cooperative agreement.       SEC. 408. NON-FEDERAL PROGRAM TO PROTECT NATIVE ANADROMOUS                     FISH IN STANISLAUS RIVER.         The program established under section 4010(d) of the WIIN       Act shall not sunset before January 1, 2023.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 431, the gentleman  from California (Mr. Denham) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment to H.R.  23.   This amendment updates a small portion of the Water Infrastructure  Improvements for the Nation Act, or the WIIN Act, to protect endangered  species and assess water storage opportunities.   First, it sets a reasonable timeframe for the completion of expanded  water storage opportunities at the New Melones Reservoir. These  opportunities can increase available storage for conservation,  transfers, and rescheduled water projects to allow for maximum storage  within the reservoir. Conservative estimates of increased water storage  have been at 100,000 acre-feet, which will provide water for over  400,000 people for a year.   With such a precious resource, we must ensure our water storage  capacity is being used responsibly. This timeline of 7 years is  consistent with other provisions of the WIIN Act, and will ensure the  study will be completed so we can make best use of our water storage  capacity.   Additionally, this amendment helps protect our threatened and  endangered species.   In Western States, water users can buy and sell water rights. This  provision prevents individuals from using funding set aside for species  conservation to buy water rights and sell them back to the government.   Funding in section 4010(b) of the WIIN Act was allocated to benefit  endangered species populations through habitat restoration, improved  monitoring, and conservation fish hatcheries. This policy has been in  effect for the Central Valley Project Improvement Act for over a decade  and needs to be applied to this section as well. This ensures funding  will be used for its intended purposes to help endangered species, not  to buy and resell water rights.   Finally, this amendment extends a program to protect native fish in  the Stanislaus River for 2 years. This program allows for the taking of  invasive species that prey on native salmon and steelhead in the  Stanislaus River. It was originally authorized for 5 years. However,  since the spawn cycle for these salmon is 3 years, it needs to be  extended to ensure two full salmon cohort cycles can be observed.   In conclusion, this amendment protects native and endangered species,  and ensures we are making the most of water storage capacity at the New  Melones Reservoir.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Denham).   The amendment was agreed to.                  Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. DeSaulnier    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5  printed in part C of House Report 115-212.   Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of title IV, insert the following:       SEC. 406. REVIEW OF AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGIES AND PROGRAMS.         Section 3405(e) of the Central Valley Project Improvement       Act is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(4) The Secretary, through the office established under       this subsection, shall review available and new, innovative       technologies and programs for capturing municipal wastewater       and recycling it for providing drinking water and energy, and       report on the feasibility of expanding the implementation of       these technologies and programs among Central Valley Project       contractors.''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 431, the gentleman  from California (Mr. DeSaulnier) and a Member opposed each will control  5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.   Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Chairman, my amendment asks for a review of  existing best practices worldwide for the capture and reuse of  wastewater and a feasibility study on the expansion of these efforts.   Existing policy requires a review of conservation plans of Central  Valley Project contractors. I believe we should look further than just  what we are currently doing and learn from new, emerging technologies  and practices from around the world for recycling wastewater.   Capturing wastewater for reuse is not new. Orange County, California,  implemented its Groundwater Replenishment System in 2008, which  augments the water supply for 850,000 residents with treated wastewater  and helps reduce the area's dependence on water from the Sacramento-San  Joaquin delta.   In Singapore, an initiative to recycle wastewater supplies  approximately one-third of the country's water demand. In Israel,  treated sewage water meets approximately one-quarter of the country's  needed water.   Across California, more than 200 billion gallons of municipal  wastewater are already reused each year. According to one report,  California has an unrealized opportunity to grow that number to between  390 billion and 590 billion acre-feet per year.   The need for innovation to increase the amount of available water is  very clear. Between 2011 and 2013, even before the onset of one of the  State's most severe droughts on record, water stored in the Sacramento- San Joaquin watershed and the Central Valley dropped by nearly 20  billion cubic meters, or two-thirds of the volume of Lake Mead.   We need to prepare for more severe droughts in the coming decades.  With innovation and technologies available in the United States and  around the world, we could and should continue to look for new ways to  augment our water supply and enhance our water security.   Around the world and across the United States, innovation and  technologies for capturing and recycling wastewater are improving, and  their costs are falling. The purpose of this amendment is to understand  the current state of these technologies and to identify opportunities  for expanding them.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleague to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5  minutes.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, this amendment adds a superfluous  provision that requires a study on a subject that we have already  studied to death.   We find the left constantly proposing these technologies to manage  our existing water shortage often as an excuse not to expand our  ability to store new water supplies.   The problem is not complicated. These recycling projects are  typically four times as expensive as traditional water storage,  according to a 2016 study by the California Public Utilities  Commission.   If we had exhausted our existing resources, then these technologies  might make sense if the alternative is no water at all. But that is not  the alternative. The alternative is to develop our resources at about  one-fourth the cost of these technologies the gentleman is trying to  sell us--four times the cost.   No consumer in his right mind would pay four times more for the same  product. Only politicians would do that, and the problem is when  politicians make this choice, consumers end up paying.   Which brings me to my second objection to the gentleman's amendment.  Our traditional water projects are paid for by the users of the water  in proportion to their use, as is the beneficiary pays principle that  has guided our water projects for generations.  [[Page H5529]]                                     time  1815    These policies protect taxpayers from footing the bill for somebody  else's water.   The title 16 recycling projects the gentleman is promoting are not  paid for by the water users but rather by general taxpayers, meaning  these projects literally rob St. Petersburg to pay St. Paul.   If the gentleman would like to confine the provisions of the bill to  require his constituents to pay four times more for their water or that  his constituents pay to subsidize the water for my constituents, I  would be happy to support him. But I sincerely doubt that is what he  has in mind.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Matsui).
