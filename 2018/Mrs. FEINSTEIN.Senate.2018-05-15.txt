 Mr. President, I rise with my colleagues, Senators  Grassley, Capito, and Durbin to introduce the Using Data to Prevent  Opioid Diversion Act.   This legislation provides additional tools to drug manufacturers and  distributors to better enable them to determine when orders of opioids  are suspicious.   It also provides additional tools for law enforcement to hold  manufacturers and distributors who fail to identify, report, and stop  suspicious orders of opioids accountable.   Between 2006 and 2016, nearly 21 million opioids were distributed to  two pharmacies in Williamson, West Virginia, which has a population of  nearly 3,000. Even worse, between 2007 and 2008, nearly 9 million pills  were distributed to a single pharmacy in Kermit, West Virginia, which  has a population of only 392.   In total, between 2007 and 2012, 780 million oxycodone and  hydrocodone pills--two powerful opioids--were distributed to pharmacies  throughout West Virginia. These two drugs contributed to 1,700 drug  overdose deaths in the state.   All of this happened despite the fact that opioid manufacturers and  distributors are required to detect and disclose suspicious orders of  opioids to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). They are also  required to keep complete and accurate records relating to the sale,  delivery, or disposal of opioids through the Automated Reports and  Consolidated Ordering System, often referred to as ARCOS.   While required by law to provide this information, once obtained, the  DEA is not required to disclose to opioid manufacturers and  distributors the total number of distributors serving a single pharmacy  or practitioner, or the total quantity and type of opioids being  distributed.   This creates a blind spot because there is no awareness of how many  drugs are entering a community. This lack of information may be part of  the reason that millions of opioids were able to be delivered to small  mom and pop pharmacies in West Virginia.   Our bill corrects this problem by requiring the DEA to provide to  opioid manufacturers and distributors anonymized information related to  the number of distributors serving a single pharmacy or practitioner,  and the quantity and type of opioids being delivered to each.   This information, coupled with the algorithms that these companies  already use in their efforts to determine the legitimacy of opioid  orders, will help manufacturers and distributors better prevent these  substances from being diverted to someone other than the intended  recipient who has a lawful prescription.   Our bill also strengthens accountability by establishing civil and  criminal fines for drug manufacturers and distributors who fail to  consider ARCOS data when determining whether an order for opioids is  suspicious. Additionally, it increases existing civil fines for drug  manufacturers and distributors who fail to report suspicious orders and  keep accurate records ten-fold, from $10,000 to $100,000. It also  doubles existing criminal fines from $250,000 to $500,000.   In addition to opioid manufacturers and distributors, accurate and  timely data related to the manufacture and distribution of opioids can  also assist state officials in stopping suspicious orders.   That is why our bill requires the United States Attorney General to  share standardized reports with state officials, including regulatory,  licensing, attorneys general, and law enforcement agencies, related to  the distribution patterns collected by the ARCOS database on a semi- annual basis.   Finally, our bill requires the Department of Justice to provide an  annual report to Congress on how it is using ARCOS data to identify and  stop suspicious activity related to opioids.   Opioid manufacturers and distributors are on the front lines and have  an important role to play in combatting the opioid crisis.   In 2016, we lost 64,000 individuals to drug overdose deaths in our  country. More than 42,000 of these were opioid related.   Prevention is critical to reducing these deaths.   The Using Data to Prevent Opioid Diversion Act will help ensure that  we never have another situation in which 9 million pills are delivered  to a single pharmacy in a town that has a population of less than 400  people. It will provide drug manufacturers and distributors with the  tools they need to better prevent the distribution of opioids to bad  actors, and will provide law enforcement with the authority to hold  them accountable for failure to do so.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and look forward to  its passage.  [[Page S2681]]    Thank you, Mr. President.

A bill to amend the White Mountain Apache Tribe Water Rights  Quantification Act of 2010 to clarify the use of amounts in the WMAT  Settlement Fund; read the first time.                                  S. 2850         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. USE OF FUNDS IN WMAT SETTLEMENT FUND FOR WMAT                     RURAL WATER SYSTEM.         (a) Authorization of WMAT Rural Water System.--Section       307(a) of the White Mountain Apache Tribe Water Rights       Quantification Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-291; 124 Stat.       3080) is amended in the matter preceding paragraph (1) by       inserting ``, (b)(2),'' after ``subsections (a)''.        (b) Funding.--Section 312(b)(2)(C)(i)(III) of the White       Mountain Apache Tribe Water Rights Quantification Act of 2010       (Public Law 111-291; 124 Stat. 3093) is amended by striking       the period at the end and inserting the following: ``,       including the planning, design, and construction of the WMAT       rural water system, in accordance with section 307(a).''.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise with my colleagues, Senators  Grassley, Capito, and Durbin to introduce the Using Data to Prevent  Opioid Diversion Act.
