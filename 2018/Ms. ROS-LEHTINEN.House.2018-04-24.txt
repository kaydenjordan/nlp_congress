 Madam Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I  demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Madam Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground  that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum  is not present.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to condemn the actions  of Daniel Ortega against the people of Nicaragua who peacefully  protested the regime.   Ortega has taken a page out of the Castro and Maduro playbook and has  unleashed his national police to kill more than 30 young Nicaraguans  and injure many others over the weekend. He is presenting a false  narrative that the political protests are political maneuverings by the  opposition, giving him the excuse to censure all independent media,  while his people beat, jail, and kill students who are fighting  [[Page H3460]]  for their basic rights. He has changed presidential term limits,  dismantled democratic institutions, and committed electoral fraud.   Madam Speaker, this is a country that has endured two dictatorships  and a civil war. We must demonstrate our solidarity with the people of  Nicaragua. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to pass my NICA Act to  cut funding to Ortega, and I urge the administration to sanction more  Ortega officials who are committing human rights abuses. We must not  allow Ortega's actions to go unpunished.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to this  measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to do something that I never would have  thought that I would do in my time in Congress. I am here to stand in  opposition to a bill that purports to seek justice for Holocaust  survivors.   Anyone who knows just the slightest bit about my tenure in Congress  knows how hard I have worked over the years in support of Holocaust  survivors. I have held hearings on the plight of survivors. I have  introduced bills to seek justice for survivors. I have pressed Germany  to honor its obligation and its commitment to survivors to ensure that  Germany takes care of the health and home care needs of all survivors  so that they may live out their remaining days in the dignity and  comfort that they deserve.   I have fought against those who denied the Holocaust, and I have  spent countless hours speaking with and visiting with the many  survivors that I have now come to know as dear friends; listening to  their stories; hearing them recall the atrocities that they somehow  managed to live through; and then hearing how, even today, more than 70  years later, they still face the injustices of humanity's darkest  period.   In fact, it was Speaker Ryan who named me as one of the congressional  members on the Holocaust Museum Board just last year, and I am truly  honored and humbled to have been named to this position.   So I think my history of support for Holocaust survivors and their  families is well established and well known, which is why I cannot, in  good conscience, stand here before you, Mr. Speaker, before my  colleagues, before the American people, and before the Holocaust  survivors who are listening to offer my support for this bill.   And with all due respect for my colleagues, and they are good  friends, because I know that their hearts are in the right place, this  bill is not what it purports to be. That is the problem.   Let's start with the name, Mr. Speaker. Justice for Uncompensated  Survivors Today Act.   Where is the justice, Mr. Speaker?   This bill is nothing more than a mere reporting requirement. It has  got a fancy name. It is going to give us the feel-good that you are  doing something for survivors, but it is just a reporting requirement.   What do survivors gain from that?   There is no actionable item in this bill. There is nothing to compel  any government to do anything in this bill. There is simply no real  action here.   This is a Claims Conference justice, and by that I mean the Claims  Conference wants to appear to be doing all that it can for survivors,  but it is nothing more than that. It is a smoke screen.   We should not be fooled, Mr. Speaker. This bill has the full support  of the Claims Conference precisely because it does the bare minimum. It  keeps the tension away from the sad truth.   What is the truth?   That the Claims Conference has utterly failed our Holocaust  survivors. There is no denying that the Claims Conference has a  particularly checkered history: its flawed process, its failure to  support fully the Holocaust survivors' needs, its opposition to  allowing survivors real justice, and, of course, the embezzlement and  fraud issues.                                time  1545    There is no denying that this bill moves the needle not 1 inch closer  to justice. It has a fancy name, but there is no justice.   Just look at the timeframe here, Mr. Speaker. The report is due in 18  months, and then what? And how many of the survivors will pass away  before this report even gets issued?   So I am sorry to say, but the JUST Act just falls so far short of  what survivors need today that I cannot stand before my friends and  colleagues and I cannot stand before my Holocaust survivors and offer a  voice of support for this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I previously discussed how passing just a reporting  requirement is not justice for survivors, never mind the title. It may  be vigilance, but there will be no justice served for a single survivor  when this body passes this bill and sends it to the President for his  signature. Mr. Speaker, there is something even worse than not  providing justice for survivors, and that is depriving them of justice.   I want to talk about one of the principles in this bill that, while  on the face of it, might read like it is a simple principle--perhaps it  sounds like good, common sense--and this is what it does:   This bill directs the Secretary of State to submit a report to  Congress that assesses and describes the nature and extent that certain  countries have gone to in order to meet the goals and objectives of the  2009 Holocaust Era Assets Conference.   Again, it sounds reasonable. It is always good to hold countries  accountable, especially when we are talking about seeking justice for  Holocaust survivors. But one of the big flaws of the 2009 Conference,  and what this bill does by asking the Secretary to report on how  governments are complying with these goals, is that it enshrines a  principle of running out the clock on survivors. The principle, which  is specifically highlighted in this bill, the JUST Act, is the notion  of allowing governments to use the assets of heirless property claims  to provide for other survivors' needs.   Essentially, what this is saying to the governments that have claims  against them or that have obligations to survivors whom they must meet  is: Go ahead. Stall as long as you can. Wait them out. Then use those  assets to pay off your obligations.   How long have survivors had to wait now, Mr. Speaker? Over 70 years.  And the longer they wait, the longer those states which have  obligations to survivors are allowed to stall, the less that these  states will be on the hook for.   Even worse, this rewards states for stalling. It compounds the  injustice to survivors. Using property and assets that were denied to  survivors for over seven decades to then pay off other survivors is  sickening.   Every survivor deserves justice, and that includes all who have lived  [[Page H3462]]  through the unthinkable but are no longer with us today. This practice  is nothing more than a smokescreen for Germany's and other Claims  Conference failures to forthrightly provide for all survivors' needs.   Let's think about it this way, Mr. Speaker: The Claims Conference  will support the idea of using heirless claims to provide for other  survivors, sure, but will the Claims Conference support the idea that  survivors still being denied their justice by the insurance companies  should be allowed to sue those insurance companies in Federal court?  Nope.   Mr. Speaker, I wonder why that is. If my colleagues want to support  this bill and if they think that using heirless property to pay for the  needs of other survivors is the best we can get, then fine. But I  challenge each and every one of you to believe that we can do more, we  must do more, and that we have a moral responsibility to do more for  survivors.   Surely, if we can tell governments in Europe that it is okay to  benefit from their unwillingness to resolve the outstanding property  claims against them for 70 years, then we can tell our survivors that  it is okay for them to go to Federal court and fight for their justice.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, earlier I spoke about survivors being unable to sue the  insurance companies in Federal court, how unjust that is. What a  travesty.   First, they were forced to suffer the inhumanity of the Nazis during  the Holocaust, treated as outsiders. Worse than that, there really are  just no words to adequately describe how Jews were treated during the  Nazi time. And now, for so many, they continue to face injustices on a  daily basis.   One would think, Mr. Speaker, that those who endured and managed to  make it here to America--home of freedom, democracy, respect for human  rights, where everyone is meant to have equal rights--would not have to  face the harsh truth that they are still being treated no better than  second-class citizens.   Imagine how survivors feel when they are told that, in America,  almost anyone can have their rightful day in court--unless you are a  Holocaust survivor with a claim against one of the big, rich, powerful  insurance companies. In that case, you have no right to your justice.  You have no day in court. You are prohibited from bringing justice to  the courts.   Countless survivors had valid insurance policies with insurance  companies in Europe before the Holocaust, but when so many tried to  make a claim on the policies of their loved ones, can you imagine what  these companies told them?   The insurance companies have asked Holocaust survivors to show their  policies, because, as we all know, Mr. Speaker, the Nazis just let the  Jews of Europe take all of their important documentation and their most  cherished possessions with them before they were hauled off for  extermination--of course that did not happen.   Even worse, these big, rich, powerful insurance companies didn't just  reject these claims due to the absence of policy documents. Many claims  were rejected due to the absence of a death certificate--another paper  that the insurance companies knew were not readily available. They did  not pass them out in extermination camps. The relatives did not get a  death certificate. But yet that is what insurance companies are asking  of survivors.   Of course, we all know that policyholders aren't the only ones with  the proper documentation. Allianz or any of those big, rich, powerful  insurance companies aren't just going to take my word for it that I  have a policy with them. Insurance companies are going to have their  own documentation to validate the claim. They have that documentation.   But do insurance companies do this for survivors? Do they show them  the claims? Of course not. And, unfortunately, there is nothing to  compel these huge, rich, and powerful insurance companies to provide it  and to pay off those claims.   These claims, by the way, Mr. Speaker, now run into the billions of  dollars, so you can imagine why the insurance companies would fight so  hard against allowing survivors to receive their claims.   This is not justice. This is just as immoral and as reprehensible as  you can get. These rich and powerful insurance companies should be held  liable, and they should be held accountable for these sins against  morality and humanity.   That is the bill that we should be debating today, and that is why,  for years, I have authored the Holocaust Insurance Accountability Act,  H.R. 762, in this Congress and I have worked side by side with so many  survivors over the years who feel as if they are continuing to be  victimized.   They ask me: Why can everyone else get their day in court like we are  all entitled to, but not Holocaust survivors?   My bill is simple, Mr. Speaker. It will finally allow survivors the  ability to bring their cases before the U.S. court system, and it  allows them to have their day in court.  [[Page H3463]]                                     time  1600    It does not prejudge the outcome of any case. It simply says  survivors can face the insurance companies in court and seek redress.  It will make the insurance companies open up their books and let the  world know the truth.   If it is decided by the U.S. court system that these insurance  companies have in fact been shirking their moral and legal  responsibilities, then the appropriate course of action should be  taken. But this cannot happen and these survivors cannot have their day  in court unless we take steps to ensure that it can.   If we are here today to talk about justice for survivors, as this  bill is called, let's talk about real action. Let's talk about doing  something more than a simple reporting requirement with a fancy name.  Let's talk about ending seven decades of injustice. Let's talk about  ending impunity for these big, powerful, rich insurance companies.  Let's talk about accountability.   Let's take up the JUST Act with the Holocaust Insurance  Accountability Act. Let's not allow ourselves to pass a reporting  requirement and then pat ourselves on the back thinking the job is  over. Let's get real justice for survivors.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, in order to close my part of this debate on the bill, I  want to reiterate that, though I strongly oppose the JUST Act--it is  smoke and mirrors and it gives you the feel-good moment and provides no  justice for survivors, in spite of its fancy name--I do believe that my  colleagues do have good intentions and they want to see Holocaust  survivors finally get the justice that has for so long evaded them.   Their words and their remarks are heartfelt. They just don't apply to  this bill. They would more rightly apply to the bill that I have and  that I hope this body will soon take up. In fact, this body took action  last Congress when the Holocaust Expropriated Art Recovery Act of 2016,  or the HEAR Act, was passed and signed into law.    This was an important bill. It actually helped. That bill allowed for  civil claims or causes of action for the recovery of artwork stolen  from Jews by the Nazis during the Holocaust.   In other words, we have acted to ensure that Holocaust victims can  bring claims in U.S. courts to recover their looted artwork and other  possessions. They can have their day in court, and I am glad for it. If  you lost a famous painting and there have been movies and books written  about it, you can have your day in court. That is wonderful.   But since HEAR was passed, or the Holocaust Expropriated Art Recovery  Act, it has already been cited in several cases and has been applied by  the Ninth Circuit Court to revive a previously dismissed Nazi-era art  case. That is great. So why not take action to allow the same process  to take place for survivors to hold insurance companies accountable?   If you had your artwork looted by the Nazis, you can have your day in  court. But if the Nazis have destroyed your life, and you had an  insurance company policy, you do not have the right to take that case  to court. It doesn't make sense.   So, Mr. Speaker, we are here today to debate justice for  uncompensated survivors of the Holocaust. A simple reporting  requirement isn't going to do that. We shouldn't have to be taking such  action. Unfortunately, because certain governments haven't lived up to  their obligations and because these insurance companies and others  complicit in Nazi-era crimes still manage to evade accountability, we  have a moral obligation to step into action. That is the message that I  am giving to my colleagues.   If we want to pass the JUST Act, so be it. But let's also vow here  and now to take more concrete action to really get justice for  Holocaust survivors. Let's take that next big step. Time is running  out. Time is running out for all of these survivors and we need action  yesterday--not today, but today will do.   I am asking my colleagues to do the right thing, and I am asking for  this body, Mr. Speaker, to bring the Holocaust Insurance Accountability  Act to the floor as soon as possible so that we  [[Page H3464]]  can take a meaningful step, a concrete step, an action item toward  justice for survivors. And then, all of those lofty words that are laid  upon the table on this bill that don't really apply, would really apply  to this bill, the Holocaust Insurance Accountability Act. We owe it to  the survivors. We owe it to their families.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Royce for his  kindness and his leadership, and Ranking Member Eliot Engel, my  favorite mensch, for bringing this bill to the floor today. I also want  to thank and congratulate  Michael McCaul and my south Florida  colleague and dear friend Ted Deutch for their work in offering this  important bill.   The regime in Iran, as we have heard from my colleagues, is  responsible for some of the most despicable human rights abuses  imaginable. The regime is also notorious for its hostage-taking  tactics, hoping to get financial or political concessions from the  United States and other Western countries for their hostage taking.   Mr. Deutch and I have been highlighting these abuses in our  subcommittee through multiple hearings and many pieces of legislation,  including a resolution that the House passed last year, H. Res. 317,  that urged the President to make the release of Americans held hostage  in Iran the highest of priorities.   We also held a hearing on some of the hostages named in the  resolution where we heard from family members of Mr. Deutch's  constituent Bob Levinson, who is America's longest held hostage ever;  Baquer and Siamak Namazi, father and son, who have been unjustly  detained in Iran for far too long; Nizar Zakka. All of these families  have had to endure so much, Mr. Speaker.   Almost 1 year later after our resolution, all of these men as well as  at least four other Americans, additional Americans, continue to be  unjustly detained in Iran, suffering under horrific conditions with  little to no contact with their families.    Iran must be held accountable, Mr. Speaker. We need to be applying  maximum pressure against the regime. This bill gives the administration  more tools to sanction the regime for this practice of taking hostages,  and I offer my full support.   I thank the esteemed chairman of our committee, as well as my friend,  the ranking member. I thank the chairman for the time.
