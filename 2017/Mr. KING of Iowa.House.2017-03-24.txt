 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman for  yielding to me.   Seven years ago today, I brought the first repeal of ObamaCare here  to this Congress. Forty words, to rip it out by the roots as if such  act had never been enacted. I would like to be here today passing the  full repeal of ObamaCare. We are not, but this is the first bite at the  repeal apple in a process to hopefully get all of this thing done in  one day.    If I thought we could do it all in one bite, I would stand for that,  but instead, here is what we have got. We have got a $1 trillion tax  cut. We have got a $1.15 trillion spending cut. We have got a $150  billion deficit reduction. We have got a bill that eliminates the  employer mandate, eliminates the individual mandate, and it eliminates  Federal mandates in the essential health benefits package of those 10  mandates--that I despise, by the way.   It expands health savings accounts--doubles them--it allows for us to  pass selling insurance across State lines, and it enables catastrophic  health insurance. That is a pretty good list, and that is the list of  things that I am going to support here when this goes up for a vote.   Mr. Speaker, I urge its adoption.
