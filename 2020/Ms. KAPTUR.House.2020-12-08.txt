 Madam Speaker, I thank Chair DeFazio.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Water Resources  Development Act.   There is no question that Chairman DeFazio and Chairwoman Napolitano  have worked tirelessly over the last year--and probably longer--to get  this bill to the finish line. This bill delivers for our Nation's  crumbling water infrastructure.   Madam Speaker, S. 1811 enjoys broad bipartisan support because it  pays attention to the unique and particular needs of the different  regions of our diverse Nation. The package includes provisions to  protect 90 percent of North America's surface fresh water on our Great  Lakes. This includes a specific authorization of the invasive species  control system at Brandon Road Lock and Dam. The project serves a  unique national role, and once completed, will serve as a bulwark for  preventing Asian carp and other invasive species from threatening the  fragile ecosystem of our Great Lakes and its $7 billion fishery.   Madam Speaker, today's authorization marks an important milestone for  protecting the Great Lakes recreational fishing industry. Our region  has advocated to include this authorization for nearly a decade. And  since 2010, when Congress authorized the Great Lakes Interbasin Study,  our delegation searched for a long-term and basin-wide solution to the  predatory Asian carp.   I commend the committee for embedding resiliency into the Corps  planning processes and for investing to rebuild and advance the  Nation's water infrastructure for the 21st century.   Finally, the bill adds the words ``Great Lakes'' to the name of the  Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation, and I look forward to  working with my colleagues to shine a light on the Seaway's unique role  in unleashing the economic potential of the region and the Nation.   President Dwight David Eisenhower understood that this seaway is the  shortest distance to Europe, and we must remember that today.   Madam Speaker, I urge support for this bipartisan bill.                                time  1415
