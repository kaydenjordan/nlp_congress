 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, now, for the second time this week,  sadly, the Senate has lost a greatly admired former colleague. Last  night, Carl Levin--Michigan's longest-serving Senator, a Harvard- educated civil rights attorney, and former taxidriver--passed away  after a battle with cancer.   Over the years, many have been called model Senators, but few have  earned the title like Carl. He was no frills, hyperfocused on policy  and results, and fearless in taking on entrenched powers.   When the Pentagon was profligate, you could be sure that Carl Levin  was there. When large financial institutions fleeced consumers, you  could be sure Carl Levin was there. And whenever and wherever the  interests of assembly line employees, the shift workers, or the  servicemembers were at stake, you could be sure Carl Levin was there.   He was Mr. Integrity. Like a true son of the ``Motor City,'' he  punched the clock at an auto assembly plant as a young man. Decades  later, he proudly carried his 1953 union membership card in his wallet,  a silent reminder of where he came from and who he fought for.   He was certainly not a Senator out of central casting. As the  tributes came pouring in from all corners of the country, the word most  often you would see associated with Carl is ``disheveled''--the rumpled  suit, the stark-white hair, the glasses perched precariously at the end  of his nose.   Well, he may have been disheveled in his appearance, but there was  nothing--nothing--disheveled about his mind and principles.   It reminds me of one story. In 2006--I try to teach some of my caucus  members some certain Yiddish words, and one of them is ``schlumpy.'' It  means disheveled, not dressed to the best.   So when Harry Reid heard that Bernie Sanders was coming to the  Senate, he got up at our caucus lunch one day, and he said: Well, we  will finally find somebody here in the caucus more schlumpy than  Schumer: Bernie Sanders.   Carl Levin said: I object to that; I am the most schlumpy.   He had a great sense of humor. He was a fine man. His intellect was  fierce, a sharpened blade designed to cut to the core of an issue, or  sometimes cut through the unimpressive answers of a witness in front of  his committee. To modify a well-known expression, one of the most  dangerous places in Washington was the witness chair across from  Chairman Levin.   And while he was not a veteran himself, the Armed Forces of the  United States could not count on a better friend than Carl Levin. For  more than three decades, the not-so-invisible hand of Senator Levin  shaped America's defense policy. There were large and weighty issues:  matters of war and peace, terrorism and national security, billion- dollar budget decisions.   But there was also the Michigan Korean war veteran, denied a  veterans' loan because his military records were destroyed in a fire.  It would have been enough for Carl to set his office to the task, find  the lost records, and ship them off in a manila envelope. Instead, Carl  went to visit with him in person and deliver four service medals.   He was an example that inspired and one to aspire to. Because of who  he was and what he accomplished, the Senate, the State of Michigan,  these entire United States, and our globe, our world, are much better  off thanks to Mr. Carl Levin.                                Infrastructure    Mr. President, on another matter entirely, later today, we will vote  on the nomination of Ur Mendoza Jaddou, of California, to be Director  of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. This is a Department  in desperate need of capable leadership after four chaotic years under  the Trump administration.   The daughter of Mexican and Iraqi immigrants, Ms. Jaddou would be the  first woman to ever lead the USCIS, and I am confident she has the  skills, expertise, and experience to do the job well.   In a short time, the Senate will also take a procedural vote to move  forward with a bipartisan infrastructure bill. I expect the vote will  receive the same significant margin of support today as it did on  Wednesday.   Once Senators agree to proceed to debate on the bill, it is my  intention to offer the text of the bipartisan agreement as a substitute  amendment, making it the base of the bill on the floor.   The Senate remains on track to reach our goal of passing both a  bipartisan infrastructure bill and a budget resolution, with  reconciliation instructions, before the start of the August recess. It  is an ambitious deadline, absolutely, but the hard work put in by  Senators and staff means that we are on the right track to get it done.   Given the bipartisan nature of the bill, the Senate should be able to  process this legislation rather quickly. We may need the weekend. We  may vote on several amendments. But with the cooperation of our  Republican colleagues, I believe we can finish the bipartisan  infrastructure bill in a matter of days.   While our job is not nearly complete, I do want to take a moment this  morning to recognize the sweat that our Members and staff have already  put in. Senators from the bipartisan group have worked long hours for  many weeks to first reach, and then finalize, this agreement.   I want to thank Senators Sinema and Portman for taking the lead, to  the entire G-22 group--as it is called--as well as the White House for  helping pull all of this together.   There has been significant work behind the scenes. In order to  prepare the legislative text, staff members from our committees, the  group of bipartisan Senators, and the legislative counsel have worked  not just long hours but endured sleepless nights to finish writing the  bill.   And the work I am talking about--a massive down payment toward  rebuilding our Nation's infrastructure--will  [[Page S5199]]  benefit our economy for years and decades to come.                Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Session     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that upon the  disposition of the Jaddou nomination, the Senate remain in executive  session.    Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, before I close the Senate, I want to  inform the Senators where we are today.   First, I want to thank all of the Senators who voted to proceed  today. The bipartisan group is still finalizing the text of their  agreement, which will be the substitute amendment, with a nonpartisan  legislative counsel.   Once they are finished--this is a big job--the text will be reviewed,  and then I will immediately offer the text of the bipartisan  infrastructure agreement as the substitute amendment, making it the  base bill, as I have promised. As soon as the bipartisan group  finalizes the text of the substitute amendment and it becomes the base  bill, we can start voting on amendments and make further progress on  the bill over this weekend.   The Senate will resume session tomorrow at 11 a.m.   This is a really important bill, and I know all the parties want to  make sure it is done right.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a morning of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.
