 Madam President, I thank my friend from Oklahoma. The two  of us arrived in the House of Representatives on the same day. We have  been friends for all this period of time. I thank him for his  generosity.                            Budget Reconciliation    Madam President, I take this time to talk about legislation we will  be considering tomorrow, which will be the budget resolution. It gives  us a once-in-a-generation opportunity.   I would just like to pause for a moment because it is part of  President Biden's Build Back Better, that we can have a more  competitive nation, and we can create the jobs that we need for the  future.   I was with Secretary Blinken earlier today in College Park, and he  talked specifically about the challenges our Nation faces. We go back a  generation ago, and America was clearly in the forefront of creating  jobs, of taking advantage of all innovation and new, emerging fields.  We were the envy of the world. Today, the rest of the world has caught  up and in some cases, exceeds us.   This once-in-a-generation opportunity to build back better gives us  an opportunity to do what we need to do for America's future and to  show the world that our free market, democratic society is the best way  to take care of its people.   This is an incredibly important part to deliver on President Biden's  Build Back Better. We already did with the American Rescue Plan. That  gave us the opportunity to get the COVID-19 vaccines distributed so we  can get that behind us. It helped our State and local governments. It  took half of our children out of poverty. In Maryland, 52,000 Maryland  children were taken out of poverty. Forty million families nationwide  benefited from the child credit and the earned income tax credit. We  took a major step forward in building back better with the passage of  the American Rescue Plan.   Tomorrow, with the passage of this bipartisan infrastructure package,  we will take the second step in building back better, and there is a  lot to be celebrated in the legislation that we will pass tomorrow   I was proud to work on the transportation and water infrastructure  issues, along with my colleague who is presiding, to make sure that we  provided the building blocks necessary for modern infrastructure--for  transportation, for roads, bridges, transit systems, and our water  infrastructure, which is critically important.   We will take a second step to build back better with the passage of  the bipartisan bill, but there is a third step that is critically  important, and that is the budget resolution we will be taking up  starting tomorrow.   The budget resolution takes us beyond COVID-19. Yes, we have to  rebuild from COVID-19, but we also need to rebuild our Nation, make it  modern and provide the needs that Americans need. The budget resolution  will provide America more competitiveness, better prepared for the  future, create jobs, millions of jobs, and lower the cost for Americans  in dealing with their everyday needs. We are asking the wealthier  people to pay their fair share--first of all, to pay their taxes, and  then pay their fair share of taxes. We tackle the climate crisis, and  we develop the workforce to meet the jobs of the future.   So I am very excited about the opportunity of taking up the budget  resolution. Let me just comment on a few specifics as chair of the  Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee. I expect we will  be given budget instructions to deal with those issues.   Madam President, you are part of that group. We need to look at  access to credit, investment, and markets, particularly in underserved  communities, those that have not had the opportunities in the past. I  am talking about women-owned small businesses, minority-owned small  businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, and entrepreneurs from  other underserved communities.   We are going take a look at government contracting. The United States  is the largest purveyor of goods and services of the world. How can we  improve that in building back better to make sure all are included in  that opportunity?   We are going to look at innovation and growth. Small businesses are  the innovator of our economy. They create a better way to do things. We  saw that during COVID-19. We get more innovation from small businesses  than from the larger companies. But as we look at emerging markets,  there has been a real separation between the underserved communities  not being able to participate in new, emerging markets.   When you take a look at the amount of venture capital that goes to  minority small businesses or women-owned small businesses, it is a  small fraction of their demographic numbers. The last time I checked,  White men controlled 93 percent of all venture capital funding. Now, I  am all for everyone participating, but that is not a fair division and  opportunity for emerging markets.   So we need to take a look at emerging markets, incubator and  accelerator programs, and then access to capital. We need direct help  through the Small Business Administration to help small businesses  because we know we have a better chance for the underserved community  to get a fair shake with the SBA controlling the loans. We also need to  have partnerships with the private sector, as we have seen in programs  like the SBIC Program and other programs.   So we are going to work as a committee to try to deal with the needs  particularly of those small businesses that have been left behind in  the past.   I also serve on the Environment of Public Works Committee and chair  the Subcommittee on Infrastructure, working with the Presiding Officer.  I mention this because both of us have been directly involved in  creating new programs to help underserved communities.   There is a program that I was involved with that deals with water  affordability, a pilot program that will allow those who cannot afford  their clean water bills help from government, as we do for utility  costs. That was included in the bipartisan package but not the funding.  I am hoping that we will have the opportunity to fund that program and  to fund other programs that we deal with in underserved communities,  the water projects; that we will be able to deal with that in the  Environment and Public Works Committee in the budget resolution.    We are going to deal with climate, and we need to deal with climate.  Investments in jobs and growth and dealing with the environment go  together, and we are finding that America is not as far ahead  internationally as other countries, such as China, investing a lot more  in electric convention than America is investing in electric vehicles.   We are going to work with the Environment and Public Works Committee,  the Agriculture Committee, and the Commerce Committee to deal with  coastal resiliency, which is critically  [[Page S6093]]  important to my State. The Chesapeake Bay--the iconic symbol of  Maryland in our region, the largest estuary in our hemisphere--it has  challenges. This once-in-a-generation opportunity gives us the  opportunity to do things that are going to be beneficial for our  environment and help us deal with climate change; for example, the  beneficial use of dredge material. We want to keep our channels dredged  for commerce. It is very important. Where do we put that material?  Well, in the Chesapeake Bay, we want to put it into restoring wetlands,  creating new wetlands, which will help our environmental issues as  well. In agriculture, we are going to look at land conservation  programs, all that are important.   I was pleased to see that in the explanation of the budget  resolution, there is a specific reference to the Appalachian Regional  Commission. It is very important to two western counties in Maryland,  and we need to do more to help them and their economy and to grow back  better, and we are going to have an opportunity in the budget  resolution to do exactly that.   As I mentioned earlier, lower costs for Americans--childcare. We need  to bring down the cost so Americans can afford childcare.   There is extension of the child tax credit, the earned income tax  credit, because we want to make sure that the progress we have made in  lifting families out of poverty--that we do that on a permanent basis.  Let's get that longer period of time providing that relief.   Help for high education--the cost of higher education is way out of  line here in America. This bill will give us a chance to deal with the  cost of higher education, community colleges, HBCUs, Pell Grant  increases.   I was listening to Senator Brown talk about affordable housing and  home ownership. I was with Secretary Fudge this week in Prince George's  County, MD, and we talked about tools that are available to help with  affordable housing and home ownership so families can afford a home  today.   I am proud to cosponsor a bill with Senator Portman, the Neighborhood  Reinvestment Act, so that communities can do the investment in their  community, and where there is a difference between market rate and the  cost to do the renovation or building, we have a credit so that  communities can have the type of housing commensurate with their needs.   We can do a lot more. Paid family medical leave--we are one of the  only countries that don't have that. There is an opportunity in the  budget resolution for us to be able to accomplish that.    Expansion of Medicare: I have been trying to get Medicare to cover  dental care for a long time. Seniors need that type of protection. We  have a chance to do that in this budget resolution, along with  eyeglasses and hearing aids, which should be--they are essential. They  should be included in Medicare. We have a chance to do that.   Then on the climate issue, we are going to have an opportunity to  really deal with one of the greatest threats we have, and that is our  planet is burning up. We know that. We need to take dramatic action in  order to deal with the realities of climate change. We see it all  around us. We see it in flooding in Maryland, wildfires out West, in  flooding--lands disappearing in our community and around the world.   We will have a chance with electric vehicles and transportation and  research. We will have a chance with the Tax Code to reduce carbon  emissions. We will have a chance in public buildings to build green  buildings and energy efficiency. We will have an opportunity for  weatherization programs. All that is contemplated in the budget  resolution.   I can't give specifics because that is what committees will be doing  in the next several weeks, coming up with specifics to fill in. But to  make this once-in-a-generation opportunity to bring down the cost to  Americans, to deal with climate change, to deal with job creation and  preparedness and job training--this is a responsible package that will  help working families and have the wealthy who are not paying their  taxes today to pay their taxes and pay their fair share of taxes.   Winston Churchill remarked:         The pessimist sees difficulty in every opportunity. The       optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.    I agree with Sir Winston Churchill. Together, we can meet the most  formidable challenges our Nation faces, and the Build Back Better  budget is the next step in that process, and I look forward to our  taking this resolution up, moving it forward, and then letting our  committees get back to work and fill in the blanks and get this done in  order that Americans can meet the challenges of the future, create the  jobs we need in the future, and get the cost reliefs that they need to  deal with life essential needs.   I thank my friend from Oklahoma for allowing me to give my remarks.   I yield the floor.
