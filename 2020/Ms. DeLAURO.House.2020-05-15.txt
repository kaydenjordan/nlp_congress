 Mr. Speaker, the HEROES Act is a critical $3 trillion  rescue for our frontline workers, cities and States, and our small  businesses. It creates the kind of modern-day safety net I have been  fighting for with so many brave allies in and outside the U.S.  Congress.   Paid sick days and paid family and medical leave are now available to  all workers, including those workers in warehouses, healthcare, grocery  stores, pharmacies, and retail.   The child tax credit is now available for all families, raised to  $3,000 per child over 6 years old and a higher benefit for younger  children, cutting child poverty nearly in half.   We raised the maximum food stamp benefit by 15 percent, bigger than  in 2009, and we purged President Trump's $135 billion gift to real  estate developers and hedge fund managers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues: Let us act boldly and let us act  swiftly for this Nation.
