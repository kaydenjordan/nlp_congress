 Madam Speaker, as our Nation approaches Memorial Day  2021, I am deeply privileged to enter into the Congressional Record the  true story of a great soldier and an agonizing battle during the War in  Vietnam.   The story recounts the superhuman valor of a great army soldier named  John Eade, heroic son of my hometown of Toledo, Ohio. John is held in  the highest esteem by all who know him. He is a faithful friend and a  true patriot, a superlatively strong soldier, yet a humble decorated  warrior for liberty. Yes, he is a Purple Heart and more. He has been  tested beyond human limits his entire life. He has triumphed against  overwhelming odds, including lifelong war wounds, time and time again.   In November 1965, Sergeant John Eade, then 21, was deployed in  Vietnam, a fire team leader in the 1st Calvary division and its ill- fated 2nd Platoon, Alpha Company. On November 14, 1965, Sergeant Eade  and his team were sent to reinforce their sister battalion that was  engaged in very heavy fighting at Landing Zone X-Ray in La Drang  Valley. Two days later, believing the enemy was destroyed and the worst  fighting seemingly over, the 1st and 2nd Platoons Bravo were all  choppered out. But John Eade and his team left Landing Zone X-ray the  morning of November 17, marching 10 kilometers to nearby Landing Zone  Albany. They were the first to arrive.   They established the command post and defense perimeter, and other  companies were still coming up the trail. Sergeant Eade, with Alpha's  2nd Platoon, was sent into the trees to the left while the 1st Platoon  went right. That is when the two much larger North Vietnamese regiments  encamped nearby attacked.   Sergeant Eade's platoon was immediately pinned down in ferocious  hand-to-hand combat as the North Vietnamese swarmed down on them  through the trees. Sergeant Eade reflected, ``it was like a gang fight.  It was small groups of us versus small groups of them. It got down to  knives. It got down to choking people.''   Sergeant Eade and his team, Wilbert Johnson, Barry Burnite, and Oscar  Barker, Jr., tried to outflank the attacking Vietnamese but were badly  outnumbered. Eade recounts: ``Burnite, a machine gunner, was hit in the  chest by shrapnel and his gun was disabled. Johnson, his crewman,  dragged Burnite 30 meters back to a position of cover in an effort to  save him.'' Eade recounted, ``It was the greatest feat of human  strength I have ever witnessed. I don't know if Burnite was still  alive.''   Johnson and Barker holed up amongst some trees and continued to  fight. Johnson was killed and Eade was shot in the gut and the right  shoulder, forcing him to fire his M-16 left-handed. Under RPC fire,  Eade said his legs and boots were sprayed with shrapnel that left a  large piece stuck in his foot, leaving him unable to walk.   Barker tended to Eade's wounds. Everyone else was dead. Eade urged  Barker to flee 50 meters beyond the woods where the command element was  situated. Barker refused. Shortly thereafter, Barker was shot and Eade  attended him as he slowly died. Eade later reflected: ``I don't think  anyone who studies war doesn't get stuck on the Battle of Thermopylae.  It is that thing of standing our ground to the last man. If you had  your chance to cut out or stay, you would have stayed.''   Despite some misgivings, according to official records, the U.S.  Command Post called in a napalm strike on Sergeant Eade's position. As  a result, Sergeant Eade was set on fire and severely burned because of  the air strike. He was further weakened but still alive. He managed to  roll in the dirt to put out the flames.   Sergeant Eade recalled that, among his problems, the napalm proved  inconsequential. In fact, he said, ``the napalm served a purpose by  flushing the enemy out and gave me an opportunity to reduce the  Vietcong numbers.''    Later in the afternoon, still conscious but bleeding, he said he was  surprised by the sudden appearance of three enemy soldiers behind him.  ``There were three North Vietnamese looking at me, one with a pistol.''  Eade said he shot and killed two, but was shot in the face by the one  with the pistol.   The small caliber bullet destroyed his right eye socket and shattered  parts of the sinus, making it difficult to breathe. He was knocked  unconscious. When he came to, the third Vietnamese was gone.   Small groups of North Vietnamese continued moving through the area  until about midnight, Eade said. And he stopped using his rifle after  dark so he wouldn't give away his position. He said he managed to crawl  around and throw grenades at some parties he assumed were removing  their dead after midnight. The enemy activity ended. He recalls it was  a struggle to stay awake. He was on his third night without sleep and  believed if he fell asleep, he would be found and killed.   Dawn came. He was still alive, though horribly wounded. Around 9 or  10 in the morning, Infantryman Eade  [[Page H2553]]  said he heard someone moving toward him. He prepared to shoot but held  his fire and then saw the shape of an American helmet.   ``I yelled at them, `Give me some water.' I was really thirsty. He  looked at me and said, `You're shot in the stomach. I can't give you  water.' I told him I had been drinking water all night. But the soldier  said `no.' So I asked him for some morphine. I told him I used mine up  on the other wounded. It really hurts. The soldier said: `You are shot  in the head. I can't give you morphine.' So I said, `Well, give me a  cigarette.' They gave me that. And he said he never stopped smoking  after that.''   John Eade was awarded the Purple Heart.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the entire story of John Eade,  a great American soldier.                   John Eade: ``I Am Going To Die Well''                  [From the Boston Herald, Nov. 15, 2010]                           (By Jules Crittenden)         There are people who have the ability to surprise you with       the evidence, against long odds, that it is possible to       retain a sense of wonder, some ideals and even wistful       dreams, when cynicism, demons and nightmares should have won       out a long time ago.        John Eade is like that, the kind of person you're always       glad to see. You know you'll walk away with a little of that       energy he barely manages to conceal behind a quiet facade,       still retaining in his 60s--despite severe war wounds--an       infantryman's ability to walk 25 miles on short notice.        And you know Eade will always leave you with something to       think about--like what he had say about the Spartans at       Thermopylae, when the movie ``300'' came out a few years       back.        It came up in one of our late-night phone conversations.       Eade said he had been captivated by the story when he was in       high school in Toledo, Ohio. Forty-odd years later, he was       still.        ``I don't think anyone who studies war doesn't get stuck on       Thermopylae. It's that thing of standing your ground to the       last man,'' Eade said. ``Three days of fighting set up the       Persians for their ultimate defeat. It changed history. It       has taken on mythic proportions. You want to be one of the       300. If you had your chance to cut out or stay, you'd have       stayed.''        Eade said it almost casually, like any of us would do that.       Most people can only wonder if they would. But Eade knows       what he is talking about. He's an authority on the subject.        In November 1965, Sgt. John Eade, then 21, was in Vietnam,       among the first American regulars there, a fire-team leader       in 2nd Platoon, Alpha Company, 2nd Battalion of the       historically ill-fated 7th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry       Division. They had already seen some combat, and as former       paratroopers turned Air Cav, were a confident, well-trained       and cohesive unit.        Over Nov. 14, 15, and 16, elements of 2/7 Cav were sent in       to reinforce its sister battalion, 1/7 Cav, in the heavy       fight at Landing Zone X-ray in the la Orang valley, where a       reconnaissance in force had encountered a large force of       North Vietnamese regulars. On the 16th, with the enemy at X-      ray destroyed and the worst seemingly over, 1/7 was choppered       out, along with 2/7's Bravo. The rest of 2/7, with a company       of 1/5 Cav, left X-ray the morning of Nov. 17, marching 10       kilometers to Landing Zone Albany. Just short of Albany, the       lead elements captured a couple of North Vietnamese soldiers.       There was debate about whether they were deserters or an       outpost.        Still mulling the implications, they moved on, the       battalion CO calling his company commanders ahead for a       conference. In Albany's clearing of grassland and anthills,       surrounded by forest, 2/7's Alpha Company began establishing       a command post and a defensive perimeter within which the       helicopters could land and take them home. The battalion's       Delta, Charlie and Headquarters companies were still coming       up the trail behind them, with 1/5's Alpha company bringing       up the rear. Eade, with Alpha's 2nd Platoon, was sent into       the trees to the left, while 1st Platoon went right. That's       when the two North Vietnamese regiments encamped nearby       attacked, along the length of the column.        Eade discussed his experience with me five years ago for a       Boston Herald article. It was the first time he had done so       in a public venue. He recalled that his platoon was       immediately pinned down in ferocious fighting as the North       Vietnamese swarmed on them through the trees.        ``For the first hour and a half, it was intense hand-to-      hand,'' Eade said. ``It was like a gang fight. It was small       groups of us versus small groups of them. It got down to       knives. It got down to choking people.''        First and 2nd platoons were taking the brunt of the attack       on the landing zone's perimeter. Delta, Charlie, HQ and 1/5       Alpha companies, strung out along the trail, were also under       heavy attack, with similar scenes of desperate combat playing       out as hundreds of men, American and Vietnamese, engaged       among the trees. Meanwhile, the Vietnamese who had cut off       the column were directly assaulting the Alpha's command post       among some anthills in the middle of the clearing.        Eade said he and his fire team, Wilbert Johnson, Barry       Burnite and Oscar Barker Jr., had some freedom of movement       along a line of brush and tried to flank the attacking       Vietnamese.        ``We wanted to hunt them down and give the platoon a       chance,'' Eade said. ``We bit off more than we could chew.''        Burnite, a machine gunner, was hit in the chest by shrapnel       and his gun was disabled. Johnson, his crewman, dragged       Burnite 30 meters back to a position of cover in an effort to       save him.        ``It was the greatest feat of human strength I have ever       witnessed,'' Eade said. ``I don't know if Burnite was still       alive.''        Eade said he, Johnson and Barker holed up among some trees       and continued to fight. Johnson was killed, and Eade was shot       in the gut and the right shoulder, forcing him to fire his M-      16 left-handed. Under RPG and mortar fire, Eade said his legs       and boots were sprayed with shrapnel that left a large piece       stuck into his foot, so he couldn't walk.        By about 3 p.m., much of the fighting had subsided around       the fire team's two survivors, Barker and Eade. Barker tended       to Eade's wounds in the lull, stuffing one of Eade's dirty       socks into his shoulder wound to stop the bleeding because       they were out of bandages.        ``I knew and he knew that everyone else was dead,'' Eade       said. He said he urged Barker to try to save himself and run       for the command post, which Eade estimates was located about       50 meters of open ground beyond the woods, where the command       element and mortars still held a perimeter.        ``He refused to go,'' Eade said. Shortly after that, Barker       was shot, and Eade had to watch him die. It was a sucking       chest wound, and it took a long time, Eade said.        After Barker died, Eade was alone.        ``My whole life, I've missed the people I was with,'' Eade       said at that point in the conversation. ``I just miss them a       lot.''        I asked him what his thoughts and emotions were at this       time, as the last surviving man in his position with every       expectation that he would be killed as the Vietnamese moved       through the trees finishing off the wounded. I was under the       impression that Eade had played dead to survive, but he said       that wasn't the case.        ``Playing dead was a way to die. It made no sense to me.       Our job was to hold that position and kill the enemy,'' Eade       said. ``I had this thing in my mind, part of the U.S. Army's       General Orders and the soldier's code you learn in boot camp:       `I will never forget I am an American fighting man. I will       never surrender of my own free will. I will continue to       resist to the utmost of my ability. I will not leave my post       until properly relieved.' ''        Eade said he kept repeating it himself.        ``I don't think it was unique to me,'' Eade said, citing       the actions of men like Barker and Johnson. He said his       seemingly hopeless position was made easier by his belief,       established weeks earlier after several men in the unit were       killed in other actions, that he would not leave Vietnam       alive. What Eade says about that may sound familiar to other       veterans of heavy combat:        ``It wasn't a matter of living or dying. It was taking care       of each other and doing your duty. The anticipation of a       future is what you give up. The question was not, `Am I going       to die?' We all know the answer to that. The question was,       'How am I going to die? I am going to die well.' ''        In the command post, Alpha Company's executive officer, Lt.       Larry Gwin, reports they saw large groups of the enemy moving       through 2nd Platoon's area. The command post remained under       assault by waves of Vietnamese, still cut off from what was       left of the rest of the battalion.        A couple of 2nd Platoon soldiers who had made it out of the       woods and across the open grassland to the command post said       they didn't think any Americans were alive in there. Despite       some misgivings on the part of some officers, the decision       was made to thwart a Vietnamese attack on the command post by       calling in a napalm strike on 2nd Platoon's position.        ``I think they made the right decision,'' Eade said. He was       on the edge of the A-1 Skyraiders' napalm strike.        ``It set me on fire, but I managed to roll in the dirt and       put it out,'' Eade said, adding that among his problems, the       napalm proved inconsequential. In fact, he said, the napalm       served a purpose. ``It flushed them out and gave me an       opportunity to reduce the numbers.''        Later in the afternoon, Eade said he was surprised by the       sudden appearance of three enemy soldiers behind him.        ``There were three North Vietnamese looking at me, one with       a pistol.'' Eade said he shot and killed two, but was shot in       the face by the one with the pistol. The small-caliber bullet       destroyed his right eye socket and shattered parts of his       sinuses, making it difficult to breathe. He was knocked       unconscious, and when he came to, the third Vietnamese was       gone.        ``I was angry at myself for being shot in the head. I was       angry at myself for being careless. I was really pissed off       at the North Vietnamese. It was probably the most maniacal       moment of my life,'' Eade said. He declined to elaborate.        Small groups of North Vietnamese continued moving through       the area until about midnight, Eade said. He said he stopped       using his rifle after dark so he wouldn't give away his       position. He said he managed to crawl around and throw       grenades at some  [[Page H2554]]       parties he assumes were removing their dead.        ``There was no shortage of grenades lying around,'' Eade       said.        After midnight, the enemy activity ended. He recalls that       it was a struggle to stay awake. He was on his third night       without sleep, and believed that if he fell asleep, he would       be found and killed.        Dawn came. He was alive, though severely wounded. Around 9       or 10 in the morning, Eade said he heard someone moving       toward him. He prepared to shoot, but held his fire. Then he       saw the shape of an American helmet.        ``I yelled at them, `Give me some water!' '' Eade said. ``I       was really thirsty. He looked at me and said, `You're shot in       the stomach. I can't give you water.' I told him I had been       drinking water all night, but he said no. So I asked him for       some morphine. I told him I had used mine up on the other       wounded. `It really hurts,' I said. He said, `You're shot in       the head. I can't give you morphine.' So I said, `Well, then       give me a cigarette.' They gave me that.''        He said he had never smoked before, but hasn't stopped       since.        Eade's experience was similar to what hundreds of men up       and down the column experienced over the prior afternoon and       night, though many did not survive the first few hours after       the Vietnamese broke through and enveloped them shortly after       1 p.m. on the 17th.        Gwin, who remembers firing at the oncoming Vietnamese, and       firing again to keep them down, has said he is haunted by the       memory of the American dead that he saw strewn across the       grassland and throughout the trees on the morning of the       18th. He reports that the discovery of Eade alive where 2nd       Platoon had been destroyed was a tremendous morale booster       for the survivors. When the battle was over, Gwin said, the       battalion that had marched to LZ Albany could fit into four       deuce and a half trucks. Nearly three-quarters of them had       been killed or wounded in a matter of hours. But he said that       despite the trauma, morale was high and remained so in       following weeks as replacements rotated into nearly empty       platoon tents and the battalion prepared to return to the       field.        ``The survivors rallied and cheered the fact that we had       held the ground. We knew that we had killed a lot of them. We       had given as good as we had gotten,'' said Gwin. ``The morale       was very high in a perverse sort of way, because we had       survived it.''        Eade objects to the notion that his platoon, while largely       destroyed, was overrun. He argues that he stayed alive, kept       fighting, and remained in position. His platoon held.        Gwin, noting that 2/7 Cav held its ground in one of the       bloodiest days any battalion has experienced in U.S. military       history, said, ``John's platoon held. If they hadn't done       what they did, we would have been overrun.''        Eade was medevac'd, and none of his comrades saw him again       for decades. Gwin said that years later after they were       reunited, he and other la Orang vets tried to get a combat       award for Eade. Gwin, who earned a Silver Star for his       actions at LZ Albany and completed 45 combat assaults in his       year in Vietnam, said he believes Eade's actions merit a       Distinguished Service Cross. But because there were no living       American witnesses to Eade's actions, Gwin said, the effort       was unsuccessful. Eade himself has said, regarding       decorations, he is satisfied with the Combat Infantryman's       Badge.        Eade spent 1966, the year after the la Drang, in the U.S.       Army hospital at Valley Forge. That's where the mother of his       fire team's machine gunner, Barry Burnite, came to see him.        ``I don't know how she found me,'' Eade said. ``She asked       me, how did her son die? I kind of told her the truth and I       kind of didn't. I cleaned it up a bit. The uncontrollable       grief of that woman has stayed with me my whole life. Her       pain and her grief was more than I could bear to look at. I       can never think about it without wanting to cry.''        Eade, though battered and disfigured, recovered and went to       university in the late 1960s. He became an architect. He       pursued a career through what he called ``serial jobs,''       staying only until he became restless or angry, and moving       on. He was largely solitary, and to this day closely guards       his privacy. Eade became chief of inspectional services for       the City of Boston in the 1990s, which is where I first met       him. A lightly built, soft-spoken man with an eyepatch, an       unexpected character in City Hall, a little odd and engaging.       Serious about his work, he had a reputation for toughness and       honesty. I only learned about his history several years       later, and then it was by odd coincidence, through Gwin, our       mutual friend, by then the informal head of a small informal       group of combat veterans, some Boston lawyers and investment       bankers who form a sort of movable VFW down in the businesss       district.        Gwin had seen Eade's name in a local newspaper article and       sought him out. Eade had been out of touch with his fellow la       Drang vets for nearly 40 years, having made no effort to get       in touch.        ``You have to understand. All my friends were dead,'' Eade       explained.        It was one of those typical silver-bullet Eade statements.       He has a gift, or maybe the curse for it. Unsentimentally,       matter-of-factly plumbing a terrible depth of human       experience in a few words.        These days, Eade seems to have friends everywhere he goes.       There is always someone who walks up, glad to see him, when       we walk through the city. They say little things about him in       brief asides, something he did one time or another. I don't       know how many of them know that this quiet, gentle man is       still a soldier, prouder of nothing more than to have been an       American combat infantryman who held his ground.                                   ____________________
