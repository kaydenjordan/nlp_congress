 Mr. President, I am proud to support and cosponsor S.  4255, the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act of 2022, which the Senate  is considering as H.R. 350. This bill is critically important in  supporting law enforcement's response to domestic terrorism.   Domestic terrorism has become increasingly common. According to a  recent study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies,  more than two-thirds of domestic terrorist plots and attacks in 2020  were fueled by White supremacists and ideologically aligned violent  extremists.   Unfortunately, just last week in Buffalo, NY, we saw the savage  destruction that hate can cause. A gunman killed 10 people and injured  3 others in a local grocery store. Eleven of the 13 people who were  shot were Black. Make no mistake, this act of violence was a domestic  terrorism incident.   We must do more to stop these heinous acts of violence. To do this,  we must provide our law enforcement with the resources they need. This  bill will would help establish offices within the Department of  Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Bureau of  Investigation that would monitor, investigate, and prosecute domestic  terrorism crimes. This bill would also help ensure that all law  enforcement agencies have access to anti-terrorism resources.  [[Page S2721]]    I believe this bill is an important step to help address the rising  threat of domestic terrorism throughout the country.   I am proud to cosponsor this bipartisan bill, and I am happy to see  my Democratic colleagues support it on the floor today.
