 Mr. President, it has been the honor of my lifetime to  serve Georgia in the U.S. Senate. There has never been a day that I  don't walk through the hallways of the Capitol when I am not awestruck  by the magnitude of this job and of this place and of my duty.   I want to thank my colleagues, especially those who welcomed me from  the start, who worked with me, and who even across the aisle worked  with me to get things done for our country in such a consequential  year.   I want to thank the people of Georgia who showed me the very best of  our great State. My goal as Senator was clear: to work every single day  to make Georgians' lives better and to make ours the very best State to  work, to live, to worship, and to raise a family.   I never stopped working to meet that goal and was energized and  humbled every single day by the opportunity to serve. In between weeks  spent in Washington, I crisscrossed our great State nonstop, going from  southeast coastal Georgia in Camden County to northwest mountain  Georgia in Catoosa County. Time with Georgians are my fondest memories.   One of my earliest visits was in Homerville, GA, population 2,400. I  carried the people of Homerville with me every day as I approached my  work. Having grown up on our family farm, where the nearest small town  had a population of 600, my calling to public service was, in large  part, to be a voice--an outsized voice--for those who feel they didn't  have a voice in Washington.   Many Georgians inspired me each day to bring results to every corner  of  [[Page S52]]  our State. In that spirit, I want to thank Governor Kemp for appointing  me and entrusting me with the important work of being a voice for our  State and a servant to our citizens.   I was proud to serve alongside my friend and colleague Senator David  Perdue.   I want to recognize Senator Johnny Isakson and Senator Saxby  Chambliss for their shining example of what it meant to be a Senator,  and, most importantly, a public servant. I also want to recognize and  thank my incredible husband, Jeff, whose love and support encouraged me  every single day. And I want to thank my family for instilling the  values of faith, family, and hard work. You all have my deepest love  and gratitude.   As importantly, I want to recognize my very talented and hard-working  staff, many of whom are with me today. Together, our work here and in  Georgia has made a tremendous difference in our State.   Let me tell you about just some of that work, because in one  significant year in the Senate, I am so proud of all we have  accomplished together. We delivered more than $47 billion in relief to  Georgia during the pandemic--to farmers, to family, to small  businesses, hospitals, and schools. And, as a freshman Senator, I  introduced and passed six pieces of legislation. We secured funding for  rural hospitals. We increased telehealth access, and we sped the  delivery of PPE to the frontlines.   I championed and we passed legislation that increased funding to help  homeless veterans get back on their feet, and I was proud to champion  agriculture, our State's leading industry, as well as our military, law  enforcement, small businesses, and school choice.   I stood up for innocent life, the Second Amendment, and all of our  constitutional rights.   I was able to use my business experience to develop four wide-ranging  plans to drive economic security, keep our Nation safe, modernize our  healthcare system, and increase opportunities in minority communities.   In 2020 alone, our office helped over 5,200 Georgians with casework,  including nearly 1,000 Georgia veterans and Active-Duty service men and  women navigate their VA benefits in VA medical centers.   I am incredibly proud of all the work we accomplished together for  our State and for our country. There is much more work to do. I had  hoped to pass a piece of my legislation to bring back to the United  States from China the manufacturing of our critical medical supplies,  including prescription drugs, over-the-counter medicine, and medical  equipment.   I want to wish my successor well in his work serving Georgia.   Now, most farewell speeches urge colleagues to put country before  party or to fix what is broken here in the Senate. My message is  slightly different. In all of the events of recent weeks, I want to  urge my colleagues to remember why we are here, whom you serve, and to  recall the greatness of the American experiment, as well as the fragile  nature of our freedoms.   I spent 30 years in the private sector chasing the American dream. I  worked on our family's farm. I waitressed. I lived paycheck to  paycheck. I moved around the country and worked hard to overcome  setbacks and to build a respected career in business. I came to Georgia  two decades ago as a job seeker, and I became a job creator, helping to  grow a small startup company into a Fortune 500 company.   And, like many Georgians, part of that work is giving back in our  communities and supporting others in achieving their dreams. I have  done that now in business, in philanthropy, in sports, and now in  public service. That is the American dream. It gives everyone,  regardless of their background, the freedom to make the most of their  life, chase their passions, build their family and their career, and  thrive in the greatest country in the world. Protecting that dream for  all Americans should be our common cause, regardless of political  party.   As I served over the last year, it has become clear that we need more  outsiders, more business people, and fewer--with all due respect--fewer  politicians.   Americans have high expectations for us. They are looking for  leadership. They want results, and, right now, they want their lives  back. They are looking for us to restore America and protect their  dreams, not to take advantage of a crisis and expand the government.   They certainly don't want their way of life overwhelmed by radical  change and costly policies that will push them out of their job, limit  their children's educational opportunities, and threaten their right to  worship and speak freely.   At the same time, while those on the left feign a desire for unity,  they say they cannot tolerate it without accountability. In essence,  there can be no unity without conforming to their views. Disagree, and  you will be canceled, and not just your social media account but your  job, your family, your educational opportunities, and even your God- given rights. Only those who meet the ideological purity test can claim  moral superiority and maintain their voice.   Over the last year, I experienced this firsthand many times. Yes, I  have been a proud champion of conservative values, but I always put  Georgia first ahead of politics. As the pandemic began to unfold, I  worked around the clock to deliver relief across Georgia, yet the  mainstream media, including my own hometown newspaper, flooded its  pages not with serious coverage of my relief efforts but with  completely false stories about stock trades fabricated by a leftwing  blog.   When this political attack was thoroughly debunked, that fact was  largely omitted from subsequent coverage to fit their narrative. The  truth is, the mainstream media and Big Tech increasingly care only  about advancing their political ideology and protecting only the speech  that fits into their specific narrative. The double standards, disdain,  and contempt that elites and institutions of influence have for  conservatives is increasingly being revealed. For the sake of our  discourse, this cannot continue.   As a starting point, we must hold accountable those who limit our  free speech and the loss of our civil discourse in this country. The  American people are alarmed by the effort to censor conservative  voices. We are witnessing a constitutional crisis that threatens to  erode the First Amendment and silence people across our country. As a  Republican and a conservative American who still believes in the  Constitution and the core principles on which our country was founded,  I refuse to be intimidated by the cancel culture and its dangerous  narratives.   However, not every American feels free to speak up. Their voices are  being lost.   This is why this Senate is so important. For 230 years, the U.S.  Senate has been the central venue for voicing dissenting views, and it  has celebrated the deliberation of issues confronting our Nation.   You must be the voice for those who can't use theirs. Now is the  time. The urgency weighs on our country. If we are serious about  uniting, it must be out of respect for diversity, not despite it.  Diversity of belief is not monolithic.   In 1964, a future President Ronald Reagan spoke to his fellow  Americans saying:         You and I have a rendezvous with destiny. We will preserve       for our children this, the last best hope of man on earth, or       we will sentence them to take the first step into a thousand       years of darkness.    These sage words echo today. These words are timeless.   To my colleagues in the Senate, I urge you to address the dire  threats to our First Amendment rights in order to restore every  American's faith in our democracy and to help restore our trust in each  other. It is the only way to ensure that America, the world's shining  city on the hill, a republic admired for centuries, can endure for  future generations.   I encourage each of you to uphold our uniquely American values and  preserve the American dream, and I will continue to champion our  party's values from whatever position I occupy. America depends on it.  Americans are counting on us to be their voice.   For a shy farm girl who was the first in her family to graduate from  college, who could never have imagined that one day I would serve as  the U.S. Senator from the great State of Georgia, thank you all. It has  been my deepest honor.   May God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America.  [[Page S53]]    I yield the floor.   (Applause.)
