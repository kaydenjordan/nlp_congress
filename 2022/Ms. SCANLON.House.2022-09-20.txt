 Mr. Speaker, every September, we observe Recovery Month  to celebrate the millions of Americans in recovery from substance use  disorders, and we reaffirm our commitment to passing policies to combat  the impact of addiction in our communities.   The impact of addiction is tragically far reaching, extending far  beyond the individual suffering, impacting entire families, especially  children.   The opioid epidemic has forced increasing numbers of kinship  caregivers, most of whom are grandparents, to take over the role of  primary caregivers for children impacted by the crisis. Grandparents  like Susan, a grandmother I spoke with recently at an opioid awareness  vigil, who had stepped up to be her grandchildren's primary caregiver  but is struggling to make ends meet, unable to access services that  would be available if her grandchildren were instead placed in foster  care.   I introduced the Help Grandfamilies Prevent Child Abuse Act to help  ensure that grandfamilies like Susan's have access to the critical  services and support needed to keep kids safe and keep them with their  own families.   Combating addiction will take all of us working together to support  our loved ones and community members. We can't let our families fight  this fight alone.                  Supporting and Defending the Constitution     Mr. Speaker, as I walked up the Capitol steps this  morning, I was stopped by a reporter who wanted to know if it was a  priority of the Democratic Party to pass the Presidential Election  Reform Act, which we will consider in the House this week. I was  stunned by the assumption in that question that protecting the peaceful  transfer of power in the United States of America could ever be a  partisan issue. In fact, the legislation under consideration is a  bipartisan bill.   I don't care if you are a Democrat, a Republican, a conservative, a  liberal, an Independent, if you love this country and believe in a  government by the people, for the people, of the people, we all have an  obligation to confront the dangers posed by radical extremists who  would undermine our elections, abandon the peaceful transfer of power  and the rule of law for their own personal or political gain.   I look forward to working with my colleagues of all political stripes  to strengthen the guardrails of our democracy and to support and defend  our Constitution.                            ____________________
