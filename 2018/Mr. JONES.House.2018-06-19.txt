 Mr. Speaker, with the multitude of serious issues and  problems facing our Nation, one important issue has been forgotten:  Afghanistan.   That brings me to a moving Washington Post feature written by Greg  Jaffe on May 27 titled ``Imperfect Answers--A Son Was Killed in Action  and His Parents Ask Why.''  [[Page H5228]]    I would like to share an excerpt from the article: ``Ten days since  Gabe was killed. Bob and Donna Conde were sitting on a couch in their  basement surrounded by relatives, close friends, and 16 of the soldiers  who fought alongside their son in Afghanistan.   ``The soldiers had been back in the United States for just a few  days--exhausted from their 9-month deployment and relieved to be home.  They had come to this small farming town an hour's drive from Denver to  help bury Spec. Gabriel Conde. . . .   ``By the time Gabe deployed in September, the war had fallen so far  out of the headlines that Bob found it hard to figure out why the U.S.  military was still in Afghanistan. He tried to read up on the war, but  the news accounts of suicide bombings, civilian deaths, and political  infighting never really made sense. They didn't explain what Gabe was  fighting for.''    Mr. Speaker, that is why so many of us in the United States House of  Representatives are disappointed, frustrated. We have written numerous  letters from Members of both parties asking for a debate, and to this  day, Mr. Ryan, the Speaker, has not allowed the House to meet its  constitutional responsibility to debate and vote on a 17-year-old war.   And as the Washington Post article notes, that is why the Conde  family is so hurt. U.S. military members and their families deserve a  debate on the future involvement in Afghanistan and committing our  troops to other countries around the world.   Mr. Speaker, allow me to share with this body that the Commandant of  the Marine Corps, the 31st Commandant, is a friend of mine, Chuck  Krulak. He and I have communicated for 5 years on Afghanistan. He  agrees with me there is nothing we are going to do to change it.   And he said to me one time in an email:         Let me say, no one has ever conquered Afghanistan, and many       have tried. We will join the list of nations that have tried       and failed.    Again, this is the 31st Commandant of the Marine Corps, Chuck Krulak,  who is now retired.   Mr. Speaker, it makes no sense that our men and women in uniform have  been there for 17 years. The Afghan Government will never change.  History has proven that Afghanistan is a graveyard of empires, and yet  we in Congress who take an oath of office, and that oath says that we  are responsible for voting to go to war, we can't even get a debate.   Speaker Ryan, I know you have a lot to do, but for goodness' sake,  before you leave in January, let us have a debate on the future of  Afghanistan. Let Members vote ``yea'' or ``nay,'' but at least give us  a debate.   It is very disappointing, Mr. Speaker, that you will not allow us to  meet our constitutional responsibility.                            ____________________
