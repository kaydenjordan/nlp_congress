 Mr. Speaker, I thank Madam Chairwoman for  recognizing me.   Mr. Speaker, I represent rural eastern and southeastern Ohio, which  is no stranger to the benefits of natural gas. It sits on top of the  Utica and Marcellus shale plays, which have led to a growing interest  in new and exciting manufacturing opportunities, like ethane cracker  plants and ethane storage hubs.   Those opportunities have become viable thanks to new technologies  that have led to an increase in natural gas production. But that  increased production has also been the result of the growing demand for  excess U.S. natural gas.   H.R. 4606, the Ensuring Small Scale LNG Certainty and Access Act,  will help ensure the United States takes full advantage of our  opportunities for excess small scale LNG exports, along with  encouraging production opportunities here at home.   Specifically, this bipartisan bill provides that applications under  the Natural Gas Act for the importation or exportation of small volumes  of natural gas, that being defined as 0.14 billion cubic feet per day,  shall be granted without delay, but only if they do not require an  environmental assessment under the National Environmental Policy Act.   Despite the U.S. being the world's leading producer of oil and  natural gas, American companies are unable to efficiently export small  quantities of gas to neighboring countries. By reducing regulatory  constraints and codifying a similar rule issued by the Department of  Energy, H.R. 4606 will better allow our domestic providers the  opportunity to provide a stable source of U.S. energy to countries  currently reliant on Venezuelan fuel oil, which has been used to gain  influence in countries in the Caribbean and Central and South America.    This effort to increase U.S. energy opportunities within the region  is not new, as the previous administration also sought to increase  energy engagement through the creation of the Caribbean Energy Security  Initiative.   As many independent and DOE-commissioned studies have confirmed, the  benefits of natural gas exports are clear. They are a net positive to  our domestic economy, but that is not the only benefit.   As Puerto Rico continues to rebuild after the devastating hurricane  in 2017, increased shipments and availability of reliable U.S. natural  gas can help the island meet its energy needs.   Additionally, LNG exports can only serve to strengthen U.S. ties with  countries throughout the region.   With U.S. natural gas reserves as large as they are and with new  technological advancements allowing our producers to access an  increasing amount of natural gas each and every day, it is imperative  that the U.S. take full advantage of this abundant resource and the  economic benefits it provides here at home. H.R. 4606 is a step in that  direction. It will strengthen U.S. geopolitical ties, increase job  creation, and promote economic growth as a result.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage everyone to vote for this rule and this  commonsense underlying bill.                                time  1245
