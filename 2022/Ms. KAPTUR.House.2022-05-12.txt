 Madam Speaker, I rise today during the solemn occasion of  National Police Week to recognize the law enforcement officers across  our Nation who have lost their lives in the line of duty.   Every day, police officers across our Nation put on their badges and  go into their communities to carry out their mission to protect and  serve. Tragically, some do not return to their families at the end of  the day.   This year, the names of 619 officers have been added to the National  Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington, D.C., including four  from Ohio.   They are: Toledo Police Officer Brandon Stalker, Cleveland Police  Officer Shane Bartek, Hamilton County Sheriff's Deputy Donald Gilreath,  and Ohio Department of Natural Resources Officer Jason Lagore.   Their legacies will live on in the hearts of all Americans and at the  National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial here in Washington, D.C. We  are perpetually indebted to them for their service, courage, and  patriotism. Today and always, let us honor their service, their  memories, and hold their loved ones close in our heart and prayers.                            ____________________
