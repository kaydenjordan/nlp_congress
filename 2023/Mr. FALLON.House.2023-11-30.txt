 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life and  service of Mrs. Sue Nell Boenker of Fort Worth, Texas, who passed away  October 16, 2021.   Mrs. Boenker was a dedicated mother, grandmother, and a stalwart  Christian. She was married to a dear friend of mine, Al Boenker, who is  really one of the most magnificent human beings I have ever had the  good fortune to encounter.   Mrs. Boenker was born on April 27, 1949, in Hot Springs, Arkansas. On  December 5, 1970, she married Al Boenker, and they lived together and  had a very happy marriage for over a half century.   Sue Boenker personified the American Dream. In 1998, she started her  own Allstate Insurance Agency firm and quickly became one of the  largest firms in the State of Texas. She continued to operate it  successfully for many years. Without a doubt, she was an inspirational  role for many people and many entrepreneurs, in particular, in the  north Texas area and beyond.   Mrs. Boenker was also an exemplary member of her community and a  leader in the business world. She was a devoted woman of faith, who  never hesitated to pray for the health and well-being of others. She  was very selfless. Those that knew her knew that she was incredibly  gracious and very generous with her wealth, but also--and far more  importantly--her time.    Beyond that of a familial nature, she was dedicated to human service.  She will forever be remembered in the hearts and minds of those  individuals that she cared for and served.   Mr. Speaker, I requested that a U.S. flag be flown over our Nation's  Capitol to recognize the wonderful American life that Sue Boenker led.  She always put God first. She put her country first. She put her family  first. She put her friends first.   Mr. Speaker, I know that she has been sorely missed. Al Boenker lost  his soulmate 2 years ago.   Al is a great salesman and is a self-made guy. He has done incredibly  well and is very generous. The reason for his success was Sue and the  virtues that they shared, which were honesty, integrity, and loyalty.   Do you know what we are all striving for in our lives?   It doesn't matter if it is personal, political, professional, we are  searching and striving for authenticity and for people to be genuine.  That is one of the reasons why so many people do succeed in business,  you have to have these virtues in place. Al Boenker has those. He  touches the lives of the folks that he encounters in such a tremendous  and magnificent way.   For me, he is not only a dear friend, a mentor, and really an  inspiration to recognize and make sure you put family first and to make  sure you represent, as a Member of this august Chamber, 767,000 people.  You have to serve them. That is what Al Boenker did. That is why he was  so successful. Not only did he make great commercials, but he gave  great rates and helped people a little bit more when they needed home,  auto, or life insurance. He was there and people trusted him.                                time  1130    I just wanted to take this moment, Mr. Speaker, to recognize the loss  that Al Boenker suffered when his wife, Sue, left the surly bonds of  this Earth.   I think the greatest compliment any one of us can pay to another  person is to look them in the eye and say, the world is a better place  because you are in it.   The world was certainly a better place when Sue Boenker was in it,  and the world is a better place because Al is still with us.   Mr. Speaker, God bless the Boenker family, and God bless Texas.                            ____________________
