 Mr. Speaker, the Constitution gives the  responsibility for the Nation's finances to the House of  Representatives. It is the House's responsibility to pay the Nation's  debts, to manage the Nation's finances, to protect our ability to  borrow, when necessary. The Founders warned us about the dangers of  excessive debt, the dangers of perpetual debt, and yet we find  ourselves with the highest level of debt to our GDP that we have had  since World War II.   The World War II generation came out of a literal battle, a war to  save the world from imperialist Japan and Nazi Germany, which caused  significant borrowing to fund that war, to fund that conflict, but that  generation paid that debt down to a manageable level shortly  thereafter.   Here we are today with $32 trillion in debt, nearly $100,000 per  American citizen. I have said that many times on this floor, in  committee hearings, in speeches and interviews, $100,000 per American  citizen.   One time when I said that on this very floor, it was opposite the  then Budget Committee chairman from the other side, Mr. Speaker. When  his time came to speak, he said, stop saying that. We are not asking  anybody to pay it back. As if it was not real, as if it was monopoly  money, and if it didn't matter.   However, the days of spending without consequence are now over. I  believe the American people are beginning to connect the numbers, the  stats, the dollars, what they hear about with Federal spending, the  deficit and the national debt, to their own very lives, because the  American people are suffering from 40-year high inflation.   As a matter of fact, the consumer price index showed today that  prices have risen 17 percent in the 2\1/2\ years since President Biden  took office. That means $1,000 in 2020 is now worth just $832 today.  Americans are experiencing record-high inflation, 40-year high  inflation, but it is even higher than the 17 percent for the  essentials, for groceries, for gasoline in the tank, for utilities,  and, yes, for housing costs.                                time  2000    The average mortgage today payment is $1,218, which is more than  double what it was when President Biden assumed office. That is a  direct result of Federal spending causing massive inflation, which was  then reacted to by the Biden Fed that has raised interest rates to 20- year highs, further exacerbating it. Of course, we have had our credit  rating lowered for just the second time in our history.   Americans are suffering under this debt. Americans' futures are more  bleak financially because of this debt. It is a terrible threat to our  children and our grandchildren, and we, as the Republican majority,  must do something about it.   We, as the Republican majority, elected by the American people after  running on a platform of fiscal responsibility, are leading a House of  Representatives that will have a $2 trillion deficit this year.   We are here tonight with this Special Order time to talk about our  spending, to talk about our deficit, to talk about our national debt,  and to talk about the budget battle that we are in at this very moment,  the appropriations process to fund our government, and what we will do  with the faith and the trust the American people placed in us last  November when they gave us the House majority.   I am pleased to be joined by a couple of my distinguished colleagues  tonight. I have with me Congressman Ralph Norman from South Carolina  and Congressman Clay Higgins from Louisiana.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Norman) to  share his thoughts on this topic tonight.    Maimed    Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Norman) has said, debt is the opposite of freedom.   There is a biblical principle to that. It says the debtor, the  borrower, is a slave to the lender. Again, the Founders warned us about  the consequence of excessive debt.   I was reminded, as Mr. Norman was speaking, that I feel like I am  living through the movie of how to destroy a country produced by  President Biden.   If you were going to set out to destroy a country intentionally 2\1/ 2\ years ago, what would you do different than the things that Mr.  Norman has outlined today, whether it is our border invasion,  purposefully, willfully facilitated by this administration, or whether  it is our national debt with predominant responsibility to the  Democratic Party, but also contributed to by Republicans? We have the  opportunity to do something about that now in this Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I recognize my friend from Louisiana (Mr. Higgins) to  express his thoughts accordingly.    Mr. Higgins, we are going to spend some $20,000  per citizen this year. There are 330 million Americans. In a Republican  majority Congress, we are going to spend nearly $7 trillion, about  $20,000 per citizen. We will borrow $6,000 of that $20,000. This year  alone, we will borrow $6,000 per citizen; not per taxpayer, not per  household, but per citizen.   Of the $20,000 per citizen that we will spend this year, only $3,000  per citizen will be for the primary responsibility of the Federal  Government, the safety and security of the Nation, to defend the  Nation. We will spend $20,000 per citizen, we will borrow $6,000 of  that, and only $3,000 will be for protecting the Nation from foreign  invasion, keeping the Nation safe and secure.   To Congressman Higgins' point, with the explosion of debt from $1  trillion in 1980 to now nearly $33 trillion today, the interest on the  debt, what we are paying to service the debt is about $1 trillion a  year. With interest rates rising, that cost is only going to go higher  in addition to the spending disaster that we are experiencing.   What are we prepared to do? It doesn't matter what you believe in, it  doesn't matter what you say you stand for if you are not willing to  have the courage of your convictions to take risks to fight for that  for which you claim to believe. It is no coincidence that one thing the  gentlemen with me tonight, Mr. Norman of South Carolina and Mr. Higgins  of Louisiana, and I share in common is that we are members of the House  Freedom Caucus. I believe the American people are counting on us and  putting their hope in us that maybe we will be the ones who will make  this stand and not betray them and not let them down.   I go back to January. What January's Speaker battle was ultimately  about was that we, as a renewed Republican majority, would not do what  we have always done and therefore fail, as we have failed to deliver  for the American people, particularly when it comes to fighting to cut  our spending.   Yes, Democrats are better at spending than Republicans are, but  Republicans have contributed, as well with a failure to follow through  on the things that we run on.   We had commitments made in January that we were going to cut our  spending at least back to pre-COVID levels for nondefense discretionary  spending; pre-COVID levels, which was the highest level of spending in  the history of the country at that point, the most reckless, bloated,  and excessive spending in the history of the country at that point.   We voted together as a Republican Conference to that effect in April.  We voted together for pre-COVID-level spending in April with the Limit,  Save, Grow Act. However, that was discarded with the debt ceiling  agreement where the Republican House came together with the Democrat  majority of the House and the Senate and the White House for a debt  ceiling agreement that is unlimited until January of 2025, as much  money as Congress can gleefully come together and spend between now and  January of 2025, where most projections say we will be $35 to $36  trillion in debt by that time.   We were told when we were negotiating the debt ceiling bill and when  the debt ceiling bill came forward--which we did not vote for, my  colleagues and I--well, we will fight during the appropriations  process. That is when we will fight to cut our spending. As a matter of  fact, we were told when we were negotiating H.R. 1, the energy bill, we  will fight during the appropriations process to cut our spending.   We were told when we were fighting for the H.R. 2 Secure the Border  Act that we would begin to cut spending during appropriations. Even  during the NDAA negotiations, we were told that we would use the  appropriations process to cut our spending. We were told we would pass  12 appropriations bills out of this House, implementing Republican  priorities at pre-COVID levels for nondefense discretionary spending.   Now we are at a crisis point where will we deliver for the American  people. We are only talking about $115 billion in spending cuts to  reach that pre-COVID level, $115 billion when we are running a monthly  deficit, to Mr. Higgins' point, of $150 billion a month.   What we need to do is come together as a Republican majority, pass  our 12 bills that implement our policy priorities, our legislative  priorities, do our job here in the House, cut our spending to pre-COVID  levels that we committed to doing in January and in April, send it to  the Senate and demand that they pass those House bills that the  American people elected us to pass. Then if the Senate wants to shut  down the government, let them shut it down.   Mr. Higgins, when I am in my district--we both came from our  districts over these last few weeks--the American people didn't express  concerns to me that the government might shut down.   The American people expressed concern to me about our national debt.  They expressed concern to me about our spending. They expressed concern  about rising crime. They expressed concern about the border invasion.  They expressed concern about the weaponization of the Federal  Government against them, a two-tiered justice system. They expressed  concern about the faith and confidence in our election system.   The way for us to address those issues is by passing our bills,  implementing our policies, and cutting our spending.   I yield to Mr. Higgins for any final thoughts he might have.    Mr. Speaker, may we meet the moment, may we be  that transformational Congress that cuts spending and does not let the  American people down.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to Mr. Norman the final minute that we have for  his final thoughts.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 26 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, September 14, 2023, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
