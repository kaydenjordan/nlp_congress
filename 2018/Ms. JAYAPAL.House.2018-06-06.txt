 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment, which  simply adds an important aspect to a GAO study that is already in the  underlying bill.   Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio for  their leadership in crafting this bill, and also my friend on the other  side of the aisle, Representative Woodall, for his support as well.                                time  1600    The underlying bill directs GAO to report to Congress on the  preparedness of the Army Corps of Engineers to truly make it a 21st  century agency. The study will investigate how the Corps of Engineers  is supporting efforts to invest in recruitment and retention of a  diverse workforce. It will examine how the Corps of Engineers is coping  with the steady trickle of the baby boomer generation retiring, and it  will also look at the Corps of Engineers and how it can better utilize  available and existing technologies in fulfilling its mission.   At the same time, Mr. Chairman, it is important for us to understand  how the Corps of Engineers' primary partner in the delivery of its  services, the navigation industry workforce, is also managing the  impending retirements of the baby boomer generation. We need to get a  grasp on what the Corps of Engineers needs to do to prepare for the  graying not only of its workforce, but also the workforce of the  maritime and shipping sectors. What is more, it is critical to  understand how all of this has a bearing on safety and operations  within the navigation industry.   Mr. Chairman, in my home State of Washington, the average age of a  maritime worker is 54 years old. And while the maritime sector is  growing at a rate of 6.4 percent a year, there is a so-called silver  tsunami looming in the next 5 to 10 years. The industries that the  Corps of Engineers intimately works with are expected to be fighting to  fill open positions even more than they are now. That is why, Mr.  Chairman, my amendment directs GAO to make these additional  considerations as it conducts its study.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Shuster very much for  accepting the amendment, and I urge support.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment, which  simply asks the Corps of Engineers to explore what opportunities exist  to incorporate noise abatement and noise mitigation technologies and  practices in the Corps of Engineers.   Noise has a bearing both on the land and in water, and as maritime  transportation and travel increase and as vessels increase in size,  communities along our Nation's waterways stand to be affected the most.   Seattle's residential population and our maritime sector are both  growing. And importantly, the liveability of our communities and the  strength of our maritime sector will depend on how we address the  challenges that come with that growth. At the same time, as sound  travels more efficiently in the water, we need to be certain that we  understand how we minimize the disruption to maritime environments.  [[Page H4824]]    Underwater wildlife--like the endangered southern residents, orcas-- are especially vulnerable to noise destruction, because they are so  dependent on underwater sounds for basic life functions. The Port of  Vancouver, BC, recently investigated whether limiting the speed of  ships would reduce noise and help our overall community. Over the  period of the study, ambient noise dropped 44 percent. So research into  this area is emerging, but it is clear that more needs to be done.   In providing guidance to mitigate noise in 2014, the International  Maritime Organization identified more than just speed, but also ship  design, on-board machinery, and navigation as factors to take into  consideration.   In the Puget Sound region, the Corps of Engineers is uniquely placed  to lead this effort and unite stakeholders behind solutions that  protect the maritime environment, ensure the liveability of our  communities, and support our growing maritime sector.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman very much and I urge  support. I yield back the balance of my time.
