 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to congratulate the winner of  the Ohio Ninth Congressional District's second annual Congressional App  Challenge, James Bish, of Bay High School in Bay Village, Ohio.   James' app, called Anonymous FRQ Grading, is an impressive tool for  teachers and students to submit responses to essay questions free of  bias in evaluation. James' application received strong scores in each  phase, from concept to design to the skills shown to produce it.   The judges for this year's competition included computer science  professionals and scholars from across the district, such as Max Herzog  from the Cleveland Water Alliance and Kelly Zelesnik from Lorain County  Community College.   I am amazed by the strong showing of submissions and participation  from across the district that we received this year. Developing STEM  education must be a priority not only within our community but across  our Nation as well, and the Congressional App Challenge is an  opportunity to foster such critical skills.   I offer my sincerest congratulations to James Bish on his win and  thank him for the impressive and important work that went into creating  this app. And I thank James' teacher at Bay High, Rob Grossman, who  provided guidance and mentorship to James during this challenge.                            ____________________
