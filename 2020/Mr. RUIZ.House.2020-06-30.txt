 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this en bloc amendment  and encourage support for my amendment to require the National Highway  Traffic Safety Administration to study and issue a report on the safety  effects of ensuring school buses are equipped with air-conditioning.   I represent rural desert cities like Palm Springs and Coachella in  California's 36th Congressional District, where, for much of the year,  the temperatures are really hot and well into the triple digits,  sometimes reaching 125, 130 degrees Fahrenheit. Yet many school busses  do not have air-conditioning, causing children to arrive at school in  sweat-soaked T-shirts, dehydrated, and with heat exhaustion.   Last fall, I wrote the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  to take action. This amendment would provide them needed data to help  protect students' health and safety while riding on school buses  without AC in extreme heat.   The Moving Forward Act contains robust improvements for school bus  safety in rural and urban areas, and my amendment would strengthen  that. I urge support for this en bloc amendment and for H.R. 2, the  Moving Forward Act.   I thank the chair.
