 Mr. Speaker, once again, Americans are waking up to another  embarrassing headline from another self-inflicted wound from President  Biden.   President Biden delayed almost 100 days to begin good faith  negotiations with Speaker McCarthy. In the meantime, House Republicans  passed a bill that is a reasonable, sensible, and responsible solution  to the default Democrats' debt ceiling crisis.   Unfortunately, because of President Biden's unnecessary delay, the  President has to cancel part of his international trip to Japan, Papua  New Guinea, and Australia.   The cancelation is extremely disappointing for Papua New Guinea,  which spent 6 months preparing for its first-ever visit from a sitting  United States President. They even designated the day of the  President's visit as a national holiday.   Now, after this embarrassment for our country that is sure to result  in a waste of taxpayer dollars, Americans can only hope the President  has started to take this self-made crisis seriously. If not, he will be  to blame for a default on our Nation's debt.                            ____________________
