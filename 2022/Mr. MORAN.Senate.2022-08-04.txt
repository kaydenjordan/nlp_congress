 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the service and  career of Mr. Drew Trojanowski, an Army veteran of Phoenix, AZ. He,  with honor and courage, has dedicated his life to service to our great  Nation and continues to work to ensure veterans are connected with  their communities and needed resources.   Drew had many accomplishments while serving in the U.S. Army from  2006 to 2015. He was a sniper, achieved the rank of staff sergeant, and  deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan to support the Global War on  Terrorism. He also served as a combat adviser to foreign militaries  while coaching them on operations, tactics, intelligence, and civil  affairs. Drew concluded his military career serving in the Arizona Army  National Guard, where he aided in developing long-range plans for the  Joint Counter Narco-Terrorism Task Force.   In 2015, while searching for a way to continue service after  returning from Afghanistan, Drew became active in the veteran space and  the Mesa Chamber of Commerce. After identifying a void between the  business and veteran communities, he established the Mesa Veterans  Program and Mesa Industry and Defense Council. This consortium has  grown to more than 70 aerospace and defense companies.   In 2016, Mr. Trojanowski started working with U.S. Senator John  McCain as a military and veteran advocate. As an advocate, he traveled  throughout Arizona, learning about veterans and their service and the  challenges they face post-service. He was also the primary contact for  Department of Defense installations, personnel, and industry throughout  Arizona.   In December 2016, Senator McCain asked Mr. Trojanowski to be his  military legislative assistant and senior policy adviser. In that role,  he was at the forefront of advocating for reform, resources, funding,  and benefits that our military and veterans earned and deserve.   During his time with Senator McCain, Mr. Trojanowski helped author  and champion the passage of significant legislation impacting American  servicemembers, their families, and veterans. Drew worked on the VA  MISSION Act, numerous National Defense Authorization Acts, the VA  Appeals Modernization Act, the VA Accountability and Whistleblower  Protection Act, the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance  Act--also known as the Forever G.I. Bill--and the Veteran  Overmedication and Prevention Act. These bipartisan bills, all of which  were signed into law, serve as examples of Drew's dedication and  leadership in the military and veteran community.   In 2018, Mr. Trojanowski joined the White House as a Presidentially  Commissioned Officer and Special Assistant to the President on the  Domestic Policy Council. In this role, he oversaw the Departments of  Veteran Affairs, Defense, NASA, and Labor. During his tenure, Mr.  Trojanowski was the policy lead on three Executive orders and 56  regulations, including the implementation of the MISSION Act that  strengthened the nationwide VA healthcare system by empowering veterans  with more healthcare options and the PREVENTS initiative, a national  strategy for preventing veteran suicide.   I am honored to recognize Mr. Drew Trojanowski's outstanding military  service and continued service to our military, veterans, and their  families. As Mr. Trojanowski begins a new chapter, I do not doubt that  he will continue to be a voice for all those who serve.                            ____________________
