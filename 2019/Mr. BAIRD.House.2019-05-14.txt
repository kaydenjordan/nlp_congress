 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mike Piggott, who  has become virtually an institution for the Lafayette community and  Purdue University.   Mike has been an integral part of the greater Lafayette area for more  than 40 years. He serves numerous roles at Purdue, including public  address announcer for the men's basketball team and public orator for  more than 100 commencement ceremonies.   Before working at Purdue, Mike was general manager at WLFI, and he  was the television station's news director and news anchor for 14 years  and news director at WASK radio for 13 years.   Mike's remarkable career focused on communicating with neighbors,  friends, and alumni through sharing stories, delivering the news, and  representing Purdue University.   His wife, Nancy, is a retired fourth grade teacher at Glen Acres  Elementary. Together, they have two daughters, Jane and Julie, both  married and living in the Indianapolis area, along with five  grandchildren.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Mike on his retirement and thank him for  his dedication to our community.                            ____________________
