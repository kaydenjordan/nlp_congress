 Madam Speaker, I rise to oppose the previous question so  that we can immediately consider H.R. 8589 to prohibit the Securities  and Exchange Commission from finalizing, implementing, or enforcing its  proposed climate rule.   Now, Madam Speaker, it is the Securities and Exchange Commission. It  is not the securities and environment commission.   Last night, we had the pleasure of playing baseball. I am glad to see  my colleagues up early this morning to be on the House floor. It was a  great game. I was proud to see the right team won, but we are once  again back on the floor talking between Republicans and Democrats,  Republicans being the party for growth, opportunity, and liberty, and  the House majority, the Democrats, doubling down, Madam Speaker, on  dumb in the midst of inflation, runaway spending, failed energy policy,  and open borders.                                time  0930    Today, as the winds of recession and stagflation blow, House  Democrats are here to talk about higher taxes and higher crippling  regulations on job creators. There is no evidence that there  [[Page H7413]]  is any lack of knowledge in public companies that they have an  obligation under the existing securities laws to disclose material  impact from anything to do with climate change, and there is zero  evidence that they are unaware of climate change and are not talking  about it on a regular basis with their shareholders, their boards, and  their employees.   Now, the Securities and Exchange Commission has three mandates:  investor protection, maintaining orderly markets, and capital  formation. But rather than focus on those three missions, Gary Gensler,  the chairman of the SEC, is typical of this administration: a Big  Government, nanny state supervisor who is going beyond his statutory  authority and delving in and trying to become, as I argue, a climate  czar.   His proposal has been met with significant substantive rejection.  Ninety-one advocacy groups just last week, including the Farm Bureau,  community bankers in every State of the country, and the Job Creators  Network wrote the Small Business Committee chairman and ranking member  their opposition to this proposal, and that it should be withdrawn.   Alfredo Ortiz, the president of Job Creators Network, said:         The SEC's proposed rule would be an unnecessary and costly       burden on America's small businesses, at a time when we are       dealing with ``Bideninflation'', higher interest rates, and a       supply chain crisis.    Now, Madam Speaker, Gary Gensler, the chairman, argues that this  proposal is the right thing to do. We argue it is not, that it  shouldn't be implemented, and we shouldn't spend any money there to do  it.   Let me tell you what Nasdaq, the National Association of Securities  Dealers--the market system for the growth of our country--wrote Gary  Gensler. Now, these people are not anti-climate. They are not climate  deniers. They run the Nasdaq marketplace.   They wrote:         The proposal creates additional disclosure obligations       outside of existing frameworks. The proposed timeline for       reporting is unreasonable. Prescriptive disclosures are too       costly.    The Commission itself says this will triple the cost to be a public  company.   Huh? Triple the cost to be a public company?   We don't have enough public companies as there are.         The materiality standards deviate from the law. The       prescriptive disclosures do not facilitate meaningful       comparisons. The prescriptive disclosures create       disincentives for companies. And they say that scope 3       greenhouse gas emissions disclosure requirements could harm       small private suppliers. Finally, they say that the       proposal's timing and scope could harm the initial public       offering market.    This is an economy that has half the public companies we had in 1980,  and this administration and their SEC want to make that even worse and  more costly.   Let me remind you, the Commission itself tripled the cost to be a  public company.   Madam Speaker, we have people who are private companies now because  they cannot afford to be public. And if we don't have public companies,  then we don't have investments in labor union pension plans, we don't  have opportunities for investment in our 401(k) plans, we hurt this  economy, and we hurt job creators if this proposal is implemented.   So it is very easy for me to stand here and argue against it.   Finally, I would say that this is part of a longstanding practice of  this administration to use every tool they have in the regulatory space  to do something that is the prerogative, as my good friend from  Pennsylvania said, of Congress.    Madam Speaker, I want to reiterate this point. This is the  responsibility of Congress if we are going to set environment and  energy regulatory policy. It is not the purpose of our independent  regulatory commissions.   Aren't we clear now that the Supreme Court agrees with that position?   Just in the last few days they ruled in a case called West Virginia  v. EPA which basically says: hey, independent regulatory agencies, stay  in your lane. Stay in your lane. Listen to what Congress has written in  the statute. And Congress has not written this in a statute, which is  why the SEC is way out of line with this proposal, while the Nasdaq  market system rejects it, while small businesses reject it, while  public company CEOs reject it, and why the Farm Bureau rejects it.    As I say, this administration came to power with an idea that this  was their number one issue, and you can tell it because the people who  worked on the task force to propose this rule are the Chief of Staff at  the Treasury Department, the head of the National Economic Council, and  the White House staff. All came to Congress with an idea to propose  this rule.   So I urge my colleagues to support Republicans' efforts to not see  this rule implemented and to not fund it. I thank my friend from  Pennsylvania for yielding to me.    Madam Speaker, listening to the other side, and listening  to my friend from Pennsylvania, I hear a lot about uncertainty; that we  are not sure what we are here for; we are not sure what we are going to  bring up on the House floor.   Well, I will tell you what: We are certain that inflation is hurting  American families. We are certain that people don't know how to fill up  their car; what that is going to cost; what they are going to  sacrifice; moving from beef to chicken; working on prescriptions this  week, maybe gas next week. So we are certain the American people have  inflation, top concern.   This bill proposed today will help attack inflation by reducing the  costs that will be imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in  this act.   And I will read, Madam Speaker, from the Task Force on Climate- Related Financial Disclosures, the Bloomberg Commission, and it says:  All these efforts must be cost-effective, reliable. They must be  comparable across countries, across industries, within industries. And  the proposal of SEC does not do that.   So I hope that we will be successful in H.R. 8589, which will save  the government money. And if we are looking for bills to bring up, I  say to my friend from Pennsylvania, I recommend H.R. 7209, which is the  Price Stability Act, which will focus the Federal Reserve solely on  fighting inflation; not fighting climate change; not fighting  socioeconomic disparities, focused on inflation because inflation is a  thief. That is what we should be on this floor debating.     Madam Speaker, I really don't understand this debate,  talking about the PACT Act, my friend from Massachusetts. That has  passed the House. Let the Senate do its work.   We supported it here. Let's be serious here. I voted for the bill.  The Senate is working out some concern they had. They changed the bill.  They made the bill that is controversial over there. Let them figure it  out.   In the Senate, they don't even know that revenue bills originate in  the House. It was blue-slipped. They don't really know what they are  doing over in the upper Chamber.   We know we have the advantage over them on that, but what we are  talking about today are bills being considered today. The Speaker is  leaving on some foreign trip tonight, so we are rushing around. We  don't know why we are here today, and the people deserve to know in  advance what we are voting on so we can prepare our arguments.   So, it is not about some bill over in the Senate. It is about what  bills will be on the floor of the House today.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Marine Sergeant  Major Randal S. Jernigan, the United States Marine Corps JROTC from my  alma mater, Catholic High School for Boys, in Little Rock on a very  happy and healthy retirement.   Jernigan retired from the Marine Corps where he served in a variety  of roles. Upon his retirement, Jernigan returned to his Ohio hometown  where he began a teaching career.   Ten years later, Jernigan was hired to lead the Catholic High School  JROTC program. After a short time, Jernigan took over the school's  physical fitness team where during his first 3 years, Jernigan had  delivered three-peat national titles.   This year, Jernigan and his team of cadets took home another national  title, but this time it was different. Jernigan and his cadets received  the 2022 National Title on Catholic's home field for the first time.   In all, Jernigan led nine different teams at Catholic High School to  national titles, plus two more teams from Mount St. Mary Academy.   As school begins in a few weeks, we will miss seeing Sergeant Major  Jernigan on campus.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Sergeant Major Jernigan for his service and  dedication for our hardworking students. His impact is recognized and  lasting.                            ____________________
