 Madam President, I rise today to extend my sincere  appreciation to Victoria Cech, who is planning on retiring from her  position as the executive director of the Montana Health Research and  Education Foundation. The citizens of my State are truly grateful for  her tireless efforts to improve thehealth of all Montanans.   During her tenure at the foundation, Victoria was responsible for  managing our State's hospital flexibility and frontier community health  improvement programs, both of which provide vital support to our  State's critical access hospitals. Why is this important? Because  Montana has the distinction if not losing a single critical access  hospital since the program's inception. It is the work of the  foundation and Victoria's tireless leadership that has contributed to  this great success.  [[Page S2223]]    But her work did not stop there. She continued to lead efforts to  improve care in Montana by expanding two of the area health education  centers managed by the foundation. These efforts led the charge in  addressing behavioral health needs in our State, even bringing national  attention to Montana when the foundation partnered with the National  Council for Behavioral Health and Lady Gaga's Born This Way Foundation  to complete the Teen Mental Health First Aid pilot program at Jefferson  High School in Boulder.   Patient safety and quality improvement are also major focuses of the  foundation. Victoria pioneered these efforts, leading a quality  improvement team that moved Montana's hospitals into the highest ranked  position within the Hospital Improvement Innovation Network hosted by  the American Hospital Association's Health Research & Education Trust.   In 2014, Victoria was at the helm of the foundation when our country  saw its first Ebola patient. The foundation was managing the hospital  preparedness program--HPP--which it continues to do today. With five  Montana residents under Ebola surveillance, the preparedness program  quickly ramped up to raise awareness in hospitals across the State.  That preparedness work has expanded dramatically since then, bringing  in four full-time planners who played a large role in helping Montana  prepare for and manage the coronavirus pandemic.   All 50 States are also experiencing an epidemic of drug addiction and  opioid use that has hit Montana particularly hard, especially on the  high line. The Montana Hospital Association and its foundation took  this reality to heart and worked to expand its education and engagement  work to move the needle on reversing opioid addiction. Under Victoria's  leadership, the foundation was successful in securing a Rural  Communities Opioid Response Program grant that is currently helping to  address opioid addiction along the Canadian border and increasing  engagement in our Tribal communities.   With all the work that Victoria has done, she has not overlooked the  needs of her team members or those of the Montana Hospital Association.  When the pandemic halted in-person education in Helena area schools,  Victoria looked for a solution to support the parents at the  association and ultimately converted the educational center into a  classroom for virtual learning, dubbed the MHA Learning Center. Staffed  by a full-time teacher, parents could now go to work knowing their  children would not slip in their classwork and instead continue to make  educational gains.   A lifelong learner, her passion for education will continue after her  retirement as she supports her husband and president of Carroll  College, John Cech, in positioning the college to be a national leader  in higher education.   Victoria is a gifted leader who has had a meaningful impact on the  lives of all Montanans, and we are very grateful for her dedication to  keeping folks healthy across the Big Sky State.   Congratulations, Victoria Cech, on your much deserved  retirement.                            ____________________
