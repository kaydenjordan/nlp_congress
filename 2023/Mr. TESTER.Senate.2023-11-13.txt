 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the  longstanding tradition of weekly, rural newspapers in Montana. This  week, Montana's longest running weekly print newspaper is celebrating  its 150th anniversary. Originally located in Virginia City, MT, dating  all the way back to November 1873, the Madisonian newspaper now located  in Ennis, MT, has kept residents of Madison County up to date and  informed on what is happening in their community for a century and a  half. From local elections, to stories about new public schools and  libraries, the Madisonian has told the stories of Madison County  residents for generations--heck, they have told these stories since  before Montana was officially admitted to the Union.   The Madisonian is a paramount example of how folks in rural America  stay informed. Rural weekly newspapers like the Madisonian are the  lifeblood of engaged citizens in Montana. They tell stories, they keep  us informed, and they hold elected officials--like me--accountable. The  folks at these papers work long hours for little pay, and are often  forced to drive long distances to chase leads, but they do it to serve  their readers.   Much like hospitals and schools, rural newspapers are part of the  fabric of their communities and help to keep every corner of our State  strong. I appreciate the work of our weekly newspapers across Montana,  but today, I especially appreciate the work of the people at the  Madisonian that have kept this tradition alive for 150 years.   Thank you for keeping Montana informed, and I look forward to the  next 150.                            ____________________
