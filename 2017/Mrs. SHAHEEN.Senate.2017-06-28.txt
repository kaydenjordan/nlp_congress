 Mr. President, after weeks of secrecy, after not  engaging with the public, after an effort to prevent not only Democrats  in this body but women in this body from participating in putting  together a new healthcare bill, last week we saw Senate Republican  leaders put forward their bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act.   Like its companion bill in the House, this legislation imposes  draconian cuts to Medicaid, our Nation's principal program for insuring  children, people with disabilities, and seniors in nursing homes. It  drives up costs for middle- and low-income Americans while delivering  huge new tax cuts to the wealthiest in this country.   I start with the premise that you can't take health insurance away  from 22 million Americans and call it reform or better care. I think  President Trump was accurate when he described this approach simply as  mean. The fact is, this legislation is a direct threat to the health  and well-being of millions of Americans, including tens of thousands in  New Hampshire.   The opioid epidemic in the country and in New Hampshire is the worst  public health crisis in modern history. In New Hampshire, thanks to the  expansion of Medicaid, done by a Republican legislature and a  Democratic Governor, my colleague from New Hampshire who is now in the  Senate, who is here with me today--thanks to their bipartisan work,  nearly 11,000 Granite Staters have been able to access lifesaving  treatment under the Medicaid Program for substance use disorders. By  completely reversing the Medicaid expansion, the Senate bill released  last week would cost who knows how many lives and would be a crippling  setback in our fight against the opioid crisis.   Medicaid covers one out of three children in New Hampshire, as well  as people with disabilities and seniors in nursing homes.   In concert with the President's budget, this bill being proposed by  the Senate would cut Medicaid funding in half by the year 2027. Cuts of  that magnitude simply cannot be done without  [[Page S3814]]  having devastating effects on children and other vulnerable people  across New Hampshire.   Then, of course, this legislation blocks all Federal funding for  Planned Parenthood. We have more than 12,000 Granite State women and  men who depend on Planned Parenthood for essential health services,  including cancer screenings.   According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, nearly  45,500 Granite Staters would lose coverage under the Republican  leader's bill. These are people who rely on that coverage for basic  care, as well as for treatment of cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and  other chronic illnesses, and they are deeply afraid that they will be  among the 22 million Americans who will lose their health coverage if  the Senate bill becomes law.   Last Friday, Senator Hassan and I convened an emergency public field  hearing in Concord. We wanted to hear directly from Granite Staters who  would be affected by the Senate bill. I have to say--and I am sure my  colleague agrees with me--it was an extraordinary event, with over 200  attendees. They overflowed the overflow room. This is a picture of the  room where we held the hearing, and we can see people lined up on  either side of the room, waiting to take their turn to testify.   Senator Hassan and I heard firsthand from healthcare providers, from  people in recovery from substance use disorders, from parents of  children with chronic diseases and disabilities, and so many others who  are concerned about this legislation. We listened to emotional,  heartfelt statements about the uncertainty, anxiety, and anger this  Senate bill has caused. I was especially moved by testimony from  parents who are worried their children will lose access to the  lifesaving treatment they need that for so many of these kids is the  difference between life and death.   People like Paula Garvey, of Amherst, NH, who talked about her 19- year-old daughter Rosie, who was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis just 2  weeks after birth. Rosie also suffers from juvenile rheumatoid  arthritis. Rosie must follow a strict regimen of medications to keep  the cystic fibrosis under control. Paula fears that the repeal of the  Affordable Care Act and cuts to Medicaid will leave her daughter  without coverage for her preexisting condition and that insurance  companies will once again impose a lifetime dollar limit on benefits.   For Paula, and for any parent, the prospect of not being able to  access lifesaving care for a child is profoundly upsetting. Paula said:  I don't know what I am going to do if the Affordable Care Act goes  away. What will Rosie do when she is off of our insurance and she is  not able to find insurance again?   Sarah Sadowski of Concord, NH, testified about her 9-year-old  daughter who has cerebral palsy. She said:         The Affordable Care Act was a huge moment of hope. I cannot       face what life would look like with pre-existing conditions,       lifetime limits, and countless hours on the phone with       insurance companies.    At the field hearing, we also heard important testimony about others  who rely on Medicaid. For example, Medicaid provides coverage for more  than 10 million Americans with disabilities and nearly 6 million  seniors in nursing homes. In fact, these two groups alone account for  nearly two-thirds of all Medicaid expenditures. Yet the Republican  leader's plan to cut Medicaid funding in half over the next decade  would have dire consequences for these Americans.   Brendan Williams, CEO of the New Hampshire Health Care Association,  told our hearing that 63 percent of nursing home residents in New  Hampshire rely on Medicaid. As was reported on Sunday in the New York  Times, the deep cuts to Medicaid included in the Senate bill would  force many retirees out of nursing homes or lead States to require  residents' families to help pay for care. For many families, this is  just not an option. They don't have the finances to be able to do that.  So what happens? Their loved ones get kicked out of their residential  care.   We also heard compelling testimony from healthcare providers who  treat people with substance use disorders. Melissa Fernald is a private  clinician in Wolfeboro, NH. She told us:         For the majority of [Medicaid expansion] patients, it is       the first time they have had health insurance. It allowed me       to assist them in properly diagnosing their mental health       conditions . . . and securing primary care providers to treat       their medical needs. It has been a powerful experience to       watch them heal and grow as a result of receiving proper       care. . . . My clients are more motivated and capable of       getting a job and gaining financial independence.    Again, if your heart is not moved by the morality of these kinds of  stories and by the values I think we should have in this country to  help people who need help, we should be moved by the economics of this.  It is going to cost a whole lot more when we kick people with substance  use disorders off of their insurance, when they go to emergency rooms  to get their care, or when they die than to make sure they get the help  they need.   The Senate bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act and radically cut  Medicaid is a threat to healthcare coverage for people in New Hampshire  and in every other State in this country. I am so grateful to all of  those Granite Staters who attended our field hearing on Friday. I know  that in other States across this country, large numbers of people are  turning out to express overwhelming opposition to the Republican  leader's bill. I heard this morning that polling shows that just 17  percent of Americans support this legislation. We need to listen. We  need to stop this headlong rush to pass a cruel and heartless bill.   For ordinary people in New Hampshire--the people whom Senator Hassan  and I heard from on Friday--repealing the Affordable Care Act and  gutting the Medicaid Program isn't about politics. It is a matter of  life and death. We need to listen to the voices of ordinary people  whose lives and finances would be turned upside down by this bill.   There is a better way forward for both the Senate and our country. It  is time for Republicans and Democrats to put ideology and partisanship  aside and come together to do what is right for ordinary working people  in this country.   The majority leader's decision to delay a vote on the bill is an  opportunity for all of us in the Senate. When we come back after next  week's July 4th recess, let's come together in an open and inclusive  process. The right way forward is for Republicans and Democrats to work  together to strengthen the parts of the Affordable Care Act that are  working, including Medicaid expansion, and to fix what is not working.   According to poll after poll, this is what the majority of the  American people want us to do. It is time now to respect their wishes  and to strengthen the Affordable Care Act so it works for all  Americans.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.    Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my colleague  from North Dakota, Senator Heitkamp, and appreciate all of the efforts  she is making to try to address the challenges we are facing in the  healthcare markets across this country. Like her and like so many of my  colleagues who are going to be here, I have come to the floor this  afternoon because we want to take urgent steps and we can take steps  today to address the uncertainty in our health insurance markets. We  can take steps today that can hold down premiums.   I have heard Senators on both sides of the aisle who have expressed  concern about looming premium increases in the Affordable Care Act  marketplaces. We all need to understand, as Senator Heitkamp pointed  out, what some of the causes of these premium increases are.   Insurers regularly cite the Trump administration's refusal to commit  to making cost-sharing reduction payments, also known as CSRs. These  CSR payments were included in the Affordable Care Act in order to help  Americans afford insurance once they had it. The ACA requires insurers  to reduce deductibles and copayments for working families who are  buying insurance in the marketplace. Because of the cost-sharing  reduction payments, the CSRs, patients pay less for their care and the  government reimburses the insurers.   These reductions and payments are built into the rates insurers are  charging for 2017. Yet the Trump administration has refused to commit  to paying these reimbursements because of a partisan lawsuit that has  been brought by House Republican leaders.   Because of the radically uncertain landscape insurers are facing  right now, many of them are doing one of  [[Page S3822]]  two things: Some are pulling out of the ACA marketplaces altogether,  and others are dramatically increasing premiums. The end result is  fewer choices and higher costs for American families.   Last year in my State of New Hampshire--and Senator Hassan is here.  We represent New Hampshire, and we have been very concerned about what  is happening right now. Last year, the insurance markets were stable,  and health insurance premiums increased an average of just 2 percent-- the lowest annual increase in history. Today is a radically different  story, in large part because of the uncertainty this administration is  causing by refusing to guarantee insurers cost-sharing reduction  payments. What we are seeing is that those insurance companies are  protecting themselves by raising premiums on patients.   The same thing is happening in other States. In some cases, insurers  are filing two different sets of rates--a set that is premised on the  administration continuing to make cost-sharing reduction payments and  an alternative set with higher premiums to account for continuing  uncertainty and the possibility that this administration will stop  making those payments.   Unfortunately, the Trump administration continues to send mixed  signals to insurers, and of course it has threatened to stop paying  cost-sharing reduction payments altogether. If this were to happen,  insurers could immediately exit the markets for breach of contract.   So we are kind of in this perverse limbo situation. The  administration creates uncertainty by refusing to commit to continuing  the CSR payments, and the insurers protect themselves by exiting the  markets or raising rates. And it is the premium holders, the families  out there, who are hurt by this political football that the  administration seems to be intent on continuing.   That is why I have introduced the Marketplace Certainty Act, which is  a bill to appropriate funding for the cost-sharing reduction payments  in order to make good on our commitment to help working families with  their deductibles and cost sharing.   I believe that the House Republican leaders' lawsuit has no merit but  that the chaos it has caused by allowing the Trump administration to  waver on these promised payments requires that we act now.   I am pleased to be joined in this legislation by Senators Baldwin,  Blumenthal, Cardin, Carper, Coons, Kaine, Hassan, Heitkamp, Cortez  Masto, King, Leahy, Markey, Wyden, Stabenow, and I am sure that by  tomorrow, we will have even more Senators on this bill.   We could pass it right now. Right now, we could end this manufactured  crisis. We could immediately restore certainty and stability to the  health insurance markets for all of our constituents. That would be  good for the Republicans, and it would be good for the Democrats.  Mostly, it would be good for the families out there who are  experiencing this uncertainty.   We could do this. It would give us the breathing space we need to  come together on a bipartisan basis to improve the law, to strengthen  what is working and to fix what is not. In poll after poll, that is  what the American people want us to do. They want us to stop the  partisan bickering. They want us to work together. They want us to make  commonsense improvements so that this law works for every American.   Mr. President, at this point, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 1462, the Marketplace  Certainty Act; that the bill be considered read a third time and  passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table with no intervening action or debate.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   The Senator from Wyoming.    Mr. President, while I am disappointed, I am not  surprised that my colleague from Wyoming has objected to our effort to  move forward. He is objecting to ending the uncertainty we have  experienced, which is forcing insurers to raise rates because of the  uncertainty with which this administration is administering the  Affordable Care Act. They have been very clear that they want  marketplaces to implode so that the act does not work for people.  Senator Barrasso is objecting to a commonsense step to stabilize the  insurance marketplaces.   This is not going to be the last word because this is a commitment we  made to American families. The instability here in Washington is what  is causing the instability not only in insurance markets but in the  country at large.   We are approaching the Fourth of July, which is next week. When our  Founders declared independence on July 4, 1776, Benjamin Franklin  warned that we must all hang together or we will all hang separately.  It is no different today. We all need to come together. We need to work  across the aisle. We need to improve the healthcare system so that it  works for all Americans. That is our goal. That is why we are here on  the floor today, and we need to start by making sure the insurers have  some certainty so that they can keep rates low for American families.  We will be back, have no doubts about that.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.   Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I have to say that there are a lot of  things my friend from Wyoming could have said in his objection, but to  lecture us about bringing out a bill that people have not had a chance  to read or study is rather rich at this moment in our legislative  journey on healthcare. I do not know if he thought that through before  he said it, but I can assure you  [[Page S3823]]  that when it came out of his mouth, all of us on this side were saying:  You have got to be kidding me. Really? It was just a little much.   I know we are all talking around the obvious, and that is that we  need to fix the healthcare system in America so that people do not have  to go into their pockets as often, so that insurance is reliable, and  so that the markets are more stable. We are going to have a lot of  opportunity, I hope, to come together and do just that. I hope my  friend from Wyoming and my other friends on the other side of the aisle  will be part of that.                      Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1201    We have a very simple solution to the bare counties, and I hope  people will think this through before they just object. I am going to  have 25 bare counties, mostly as a result of the sabotaging of the  exchanges by this administration. People in those counties are looking  to me for an answer, and I do not blame them for being worried. How can  we solve that problem today? S. 1201, the Health Care Options for All  Act, which I have introduced, will solve that problem today.   All we have to do is say to anyone who is in a county in America--and  I know my colleague from Ohio, Senator Brown, has some counties, and I  know my colleague from Indiana has some counties--if you do not have an  insurer in your county, you can come with your subsidy and buy  insurance from the same places our staffs buy it and most Members of  Congress buy it. Those are national plans. They are in every State in  the Union because Members of Congress have staff members in every State  in the Union. There is no need to attract more plans. There is no need  to do anything complicated. You just take the subsidies that you are  entitled to and you buy insurance at the same place Congress buys it.   We can do that today. If we do not do it today, do you know what we  are saying to the people who live in Ohio and Indiana and Missouri? We  are saying that we are entitled to something better than they have and  that they should not be allowed to buy what we can buy. Now, that takes  some nerve. If we are not willing to take this simple, basic step,  people in these counties should be angry and take up pitchforks-- metaphorically, of course.   The national plans that are out there that my staff uses that are in  Springfield, Cape Girardeau, Columbia--and I am sure my colleagues  could talk about their staffs using these plans all over the country--I  would like to make those available to regular folks in my State who  want to be able to lay their heads on their pillows tonight and not  worry about whether they are going to have insurance next year.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Finance  be discharged from further consideration of S. 1201, the Health Care  Options for All Act; that the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration; that the bill be considered read a third time and  passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table with no intervening action or debate.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   The Senator from Wyoming.
