 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and remember the life of  New York State Trooper Nicholas Clark. A lifelong resident of Steuben  County and a star football player from my alma mater, Alfred  University, Nick Clark honorably served his community and the State of  New York as a New York State trooper. Since 2015, he has protected the  people that he called his friends and neighbors.   Trooper Clark put his life on the line every day to serve his  community. In the early morning of Monday, July 2, 2018, Trooper Clark  responded to a call in the town of Erwin and was shot and killed in the  line of duty.   Mr. Speaker, he is truly a hero for his actions and the sacrifices he  made for all of us. Trooper Clark will be missed by the communities  that he served and the lives that he touched. Together we stand with  his family and friends as they mourn.   I thank him for his service to our community and for his bravery. I  pray he rests in peace.   Mr. Speaker, I ask this legislative body to pause its deliberations  and join me in remembering and honoring the 29-year life of Trooper  Nicholas Clark.                            ____________________
