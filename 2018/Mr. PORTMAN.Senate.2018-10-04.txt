 Mr. President, I rise to talk about my vote on the  confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to serve on the Supreme Court.   Sadly, over the past couple of weeks, the confirmation process has  become a bitter partisan fight that has deeply divided this body and  has divided our country in the midst of all the passion, the anger, and  the emotion from both sides. Now I want to talk about something else. I  want to talk about the facts. I want to talk about the facts as I know  them.   First, I know Brett Kavanaugh. I have known Brett and his wife Ashley  for more than 15 years since we worked together in the George W. Bush  White House. I have seen them in tough situations. I have seen them  tested. I have seen their character. I have known Brett not so much as  a legal scholar or a judge or a professor but as a colleague and a  friend and a father and a husband. I have known him as someone who is  smart, thoughtful, and compassionate.   Among White House colleagues, I know that he is universally viewed  that way. He was at the time, and he still is today as we have seen  from the testimony of so many men and women who have worked with him. I  also know that Brett Kavanaugh has been a widely respected public  servant for nearly three decades, including the last 12 years as a  judge on the DC Circuit Court--what most view as the second highest  court in the land.   I know he has received praise from his fellow judges and his many law  clerks, the majority of whom have been women, and from the students in  his classes of Harvard, Yale, and Georgetown Law Schools--students from  across the political spectrum--also from litigants who have been before  him, including Lisa Blatt, who is a self-described liberal who has  argued more cases before the Supreme Court than any other woman. When  Lisa Blatt joined Condoleezza Rice and me in introducing Brett  Kavanaugh before the committee, she said, ``He is unquestionably  qualified by his extraordinary intellect, experience, and  temperament.'' All of this seems to have been lost in the past couple  of weeks.   I also know that Brett Kavanaugh is highly qualified to serve on the  Supreme Court. In fact, frankly, I have  [[Page S6556]]  heard that from a number of my Democratic colleagues who were quick to  say they don't support him for other reasons, but they don't question  his legal experience and his qualifications. You really can't.   The American Bar Association, not known for being very friendly to  Conservatives, has given Brett Kavanaugh its highest rating  unanimously. I know that in more than 20 hours of testimony before the  Judiciary Committee--in fact, I think it was 32 hours of testimony--he  showed an encyclopedic knowledge of the Constitution, of Supreme Court  cases, an appreciation for Supreme Court precedent, and, overall, has  an impressive grasp of the law.   Only a couple of weeks ago, he had successfully navigated the arduous  process of meetings, interviews, and tough questions during 32 hours in  front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. As a result, he had the votes  in the committee, and he seemed to be headed toward confirmation here  on the floor of the Senate. After 12 weeks of consideration and 5 days  of hearings--by the way, more days of consideration and more days of  hearings than we have had for any confirmation of any judge for the  Supreme Court in recent history--the committee was ready to vote. Just  before the vote in committee came the allegations of sexual assault and  calls for delay.   As wrong as it was for Members of the U.S. Senate to have kept the  allegations of Dr. Ford's secret until after the normal process had  been completed and then to have sprung it on the committee, the Senate,  and the country, I thought that because of the seriousness of the  allegations, it would also have been wrong not to have taken a pause  and to have heard from Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh, and we did.  Chairman Chuck Grassley, of the Judiciary Committee, was accused by  someone on my side of the aisle of bending over backward when he should  have pushed ahead, but he reopened the process and allowed the painful  ordeal to play out as, I think, we were compelled to do--painful for  Dr. Ford, painful for Brett Kavanaugh, the Senate, and the country.   I believe sexual assault is a serious problem in our Nation, and many  women and girls--survivors, victims--choose not to come forward, choose  not to report it for understandable reasons. Therefore, I think we  should take allegations seriously. We must take allegations of sexual  assault very seriously, and I do. Dr. Ford deserved the opportunity to  tell her story and be heard, and, of course, Judge Kavanaugh deserved  the opportunity to defend himself. That is why I supported not only  having the additional committee investigation and hearing but also of  taking another week to have a supplemental FBI investigation after the  normal Judiciary Committee process was completed. I watched that  additional Judiciary Committee hearing, and I listened carefully to  both Dr. Ford's and Judge Kavanaugh's testimony. I am sure many  Americans did.   I have now been briefed on it and have read the supplemental FBI  report, which arrived early this morning. I went to a secure room here  in the Capitol. To do so, I went three times today to be sure I could  be fully briefed on it and could read it. Again, my job, my obligation,  is to assess the facts, and the facts before us are that no  corroboration exists regarding the allegations. No evidence prepared  before or in the supplemental FBI investigation corroborates the  allegations--none.   Judge Kavanaugh, of course, has adamantly denied the allegations. His  testimony is supported by multiple other statements. Simply put, based  on the hearings, the Judiciary Committee's investigation, and the FBI's  supplemental investigation, there is no evidence to support the serious  allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. Of course, in his 25 years of  public service, there had also been six previous FBI investigations.    In America, there is a presumption of innocence. When there is no  evidence to corroborate a charge, there is a presumption of innocence  that we must be very careful to pay heed to.   Just 1 day after Dr. Ford's allegations were made public, 65 women  who knew Judge Kavanaugh in high school sent a letter to the Judiciary  Committee in defense of his character. These 65 women put this letter  together within a day's notice.   The letter stated:         Through the more than 35 years we have known him, Brett has       stood out for his friendship, character, and integrity. In       particular, he has always treated women with decency and       respect. That was when he was in high school, and it has       remained true to this day.    These are women who knew Brett Kavanaugh. They knew him in high  school. Importantly, that is the Brett Kavanaugh I have known these  past 15 to 20 years.   This confirmation debate could have and should have unfolded very  differently. The process has become poisonous, and it is up to us in  this Chamber to change it.   It is going to take a while for the Senate and the country to heal  from this ugly ordeal, but for now let me make a modest suggestion.  Let's step back from the brink. Let's listen to each other. Let's argue  passionately, but let's lower the volume. Let's treat disagreements  like disagreements, not as proof that our opponents are bad people.  Let's see if we can glorify quiet cooperation--at least every once in a  while--instead of loud confrontation.   Some may say this is trite or naive, but, my colleagues, we have  crossed all these lines in recent weeks. For the state of this  institution and for the country, we have to step back from the brink,  and we have to do better.   The way this process unfolded risks candidates with the kinds of  qualifications and character we all want deciding to think twice before  entering public service. If the new normal is eleventh-hour  accusations, toxic rhetoric like calling a candidate ``evil'' and those  who support him ``complicit in evil'' and guilt without any  corroborating evidence, who would choose to go through that? How many  good public servants have we already possibly turned away by this  display? How many more will we turn away if we let uncorroborated  allegations tarnish the career of a person who has dedicated 25 of the  past 28 years to public service and who has done so with honor, again  based on the testimony of so many people across the spectrum, men and  women?   These are questions the Senate is going to have to grapple with for  possibly years to come, but right now I want to focus on something that  hasn't gotten as much attention in the last couple of weeks, and that  is what is known.   I know Judge Kavanaugh as someone with a deserved reputation as a  fair, smart, and independent judge. I know him as someone who is  universally praised by his colleagues for his work ethic, his  intelligence, and his integrity. I know him as someone who respects  everyone and someone whose first introduction to law came from  listening to his mom practicing closing arguments at the dinner table.  Perhaps most importantly--most importantly--I know him as someone who  has the ability to listen. It is something we need more of in this  country and on the Court during turbulent times.   In following facts, as I am obligated to do, I will support this  nomination, and I will be proud to vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh as  the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I understand, there is a bill at the desk  that is due for a second reading.    Mr. President, in order to place the bill on the  calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to further  proceedings.  [[Page S6557]]     I yield the floor.                            ____________________
