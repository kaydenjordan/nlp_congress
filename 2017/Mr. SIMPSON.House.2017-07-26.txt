 Mr. Chairman, it is my distinct honor to bring the  fiscal year 2018 Energy and Water bill before you today.   Before I go into the details, I would like to recognize Chairman  Frelinghuysen. It is because of his leadership and unswerving  commitment to the appropriations process that our committee has managed  to bring 12 bills through the full committee process and have them  ready for consideration by the House.   I would also like to thank Ranking Members Lowey and Kaptur. As  always, their thoughtful approach to issues has made this a better  bill.   The bill totals $37.6 billion, which is $209 million less than last  year's level and $3.2 billion above the request.                                time  1545    Increases over last year are targeted to those areas where they are  needed most: to provide for our Nation's defense and support our  Nation's infrastructure.   The bill provides strong support for the Department of Energy's  national defense programs. Weapons activities is funded at $10.24  billion, up $921 million from last year's level, to keep our Nation's  nuclear deterrent reliable and effective.   This increase will fully fund the ongoing stockpile life extension  programs and will make substantial progress toward addressing the  continued deterioration of infrastructure across the enterprise. The  recommendations for Naval Reactors is $1.49 billion, and includes full  funding for the Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine, formerly  referred to as the Ohio-class replacement.   Additionally, the bill provides funding increases across the  Department of Energy to defend against cyber attacks and, within  Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability, to strengthen energy  sector cybersecurity preparedness, response, and recovery.   This bill addresses the critical infrastructure work of the Army  Corps of Engineers, providing a total of $6.2 billion, an increase of  $120 million more than last year.   This recommendation makes full use of all annual revenues from the  Inland Waterways Trust Fund.   The harbor maintenance trust fund activities are funded at $1.34  billion, which is $40 million more than fiscal year 2017, an increase  of $375 million above the budget request, and the same as the WRDA  target.   The bill provides $74 million more than last year for flood and storm  damage reduction activities.   This is a responsibile bill, one that makes some difficult choices in  order to prioritize the most critical Federal programs. As a result, as  has been mentioned already, this bill eliminates the Advanced Research  Projects Agency-Energy--or ARPA-E, as it is known--and the title 17  loan guarantee program of the Department of Energy, as proposed by the  President.   I realized some people are concerned about that. These are programs  that I happen to like also. But this is what happens when you are $20  trillion in debt: you have to make tough choices. And that is what the  Appropriations Committee is doing: making some of the difficult choices  that we have to make.   This bill includes a number of targeted investments above the budget  request to ensure a secure, independent, and prosperous energy future.   Mr. Chairman, this is a strong bill that will protect our national  security interests, address our most pressing infrastructure needs, and  advance our economy. I urge everyone to support it.   I would like to thank the staff of the Energy and Water Committee,  both ranking and minority members, and of the full committee, for the  work they have done in making sure we can get this bill to the floor.   Again, I urge Members to support this bill.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Alaska (Mr.  Young) for the purpose of a colloquy.    Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I appreciate my  colleague's statement on the Denali Commission. He is a strong advocate  for Alaska and the important work that the Denali Commission conducts  in the State.   The House mark this year supports the Denali Commission and its  efforts rather than the administration's request to terminate the  agency.   The elimination of the Denali Commission would have deprived many  communities of essential infrastructure and economic development  projects.   In a time of economic change, these communities can scarcely afford  to lose the millions of dollars in private investment leveraged by the  Commission annually.   In the event the subcommittee receives additional funding in  conference, I would be happy to work with my colleague to ensure the  Denali Commission is provided sufficient funds to support their efforts  in his State.    I yield to the gentleman.    I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Chairman, I look forward to working with the  gentleman from Alaska.  [[Page H6369]]                                     time  1645     Actually, the offset does not come out of EERE.    I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio.    It comes from Corps expenses and administration.    It comes from Corps expenses and administration.    I knew we could get through this.   Let me just say, Mr. Chairman, I understand that the Soo Locks  project is of great importance to my colleague from Michigan, as well  as other Members from the Great Lakes. I would be happy to work with  them to see if we can advance this project to ensure continued  navigation on the Great Lakes.   I have to remind my colleague that the amendment increases the  funding level of an account. It does not direct that funding level to a  particular activity, and, for that reason, the amendment does not  constitute a major shift in funding between accounts, and I will  support the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, as the designee of Chairman Frelinghuysen,  I move to strike the last word.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from New York  (Mr. Faso) for the purpose of entering into a colloquy.    Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Faso for the question. The  gentleman is correct on his reading of the bill. Projects authorized  under section 5003 of the 2007 water bill are eligible for this  additional funding by the Army Corps of Engineers. This is reflected in  report language from the Energy and Water Development, and Related  Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.           Amendments En Bloc No. 2 Offered by Mr. Simpson of Idaho     Mr. Chairman, pursuant to section 3 of House Resolution  473, as the designee of the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Frelinghuysen), I offer amendments en bloc.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473 the gentleman from  Idaho (Mr. Simpson) and the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) each  will control 10 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Idaho.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate that the en bloc amendments  have been agreed to by both sides, and I would urge my Members to  support the en bloc amendments.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered  by the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Simpson).   The en bloc amendments were agreed to.    Mr. Chairman, as the designee of Chairman Frelinghuysen,  I move to strike the last word.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. Lance) for the purpose of a colloquy.    I thank the gentleman for his question.   Yes. It has been the committee's intent that funds provided to date  were to be used to complete the feasibility study and issue a chief's  report. There is additional funding provided in this bill that could be  allocated to the Rahway River study, if necessary.    I thank the gentleman for his comments.   We would be pleased to work with the gentleman from New Jersey on  such a meeting and to ensure a successful conclusion to the feasibility  study.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The Chair understands that Amendment No. 31 will  not be offered.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman. It is wonderful  to have someone who can talk with some intelligence about what we are  doing here, and keep the attention of the body as we are waiting for  Members to come to the floor.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker Pro Tempore (Mr.  Mitchell) having assumed the chair, Mr. Gallagher, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3219)  making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year  ending September 30, 2018, and for other purposes, had come to no  resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that, during  further consideration of H.R. 3219, pursuant to House Resolution 473,  amendment No. 32 and amendment No. 35, printed in House Report 115-259,  may be offered out of sequence.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Idaho?   There was no objection.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. I  understand that reducing the size of the bureaucracy is an important  issue for many Members, and should be for all of us.   As chair of the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies  Subcommittee, I am always open to hearing if my colleagues have  particular concerns with agency budget requests. I could be supportive  of thoughtful strategies for reducing the size of government by making  agencies more efficient and carrying out their statutory goals. That is  not what this amendment does. This amendment simply slashes 10 percent  from each administrative account in the bill.   Most of these accounts have been held flat or even slightly decreased  over the past several years. Reducing them an additional 10 percent,  with no clear idea on how such cuts would be absorbed, is simply not  the right way to address the size of the Federal Government. It could  take longer to review and improve important water resource projects--I  hear about that all the time from my colleagues--or to issue grants and  approve research agreements--I hear about that all the time from my  colleagues--or to respond to congressional information requests--I hear  about that all the time from my colleagues.   These cuts would also put at risk the cybersecurity efforts of each  agency, reducing their efforts to secure their own IT infrastructure. I  don't think that is what the gentleman from Michigan intended, but that  is a very possible result of this amendment.   Mr. Chair, for those reasons, I must urge a ``no'' vote on this  amendment.    I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.  [[Page H6430]]    The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Idaho is  recognized for 5 minutes.   There was no objection.    Mr. Chairman, I understand what the gentleman's concern  is. In fact, it is a concern not only in Florida, but all over the  country. It is a concern in Ohio. It is actually a concern in Idaho.  You wouldn't think about that, but they are having some problems in  Idaho with algal blooms, also. So it is something that we need to get  on top of.   I would just like to clarify that the amendment does not direct funds  to any particular activities so that doesn't necessarily mean that this  will get done, but I understand what the gentleman is trying to do.   For that reason, and because it doesn't upset the balance of the  bill, I will not oppose the amendment, but I want to work with him, as  well as, I am sure, the ranking member, because this is an issue we  have got to address across the country. I appreciate him bringing this  matter and this issue to our attention so that we can talk about it.    I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentlewoman's comments, and  we not only need to work with the Corps, but we also need to work with  the EPA in trying to address this issue because it is a lot broader  than most people think.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the  amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.   The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Idaho is  recognized for 5 minutes.   There was no objection.    Mr. Chairman, I agree with what the gentleman is trying  to do. I would just point out again that this amendment does not direct  the funds to any particular activity, so it will actually take some  coordination with us and some conversation with the Army Corps of  Engineers to make sure that this goes in the area that we would like it  to go to to study just what the gentleman was talking about.   But because it doesn't direct it to a particular activity, for that  reason and because it does not upset the balance of  [[Page H6431]]  the bill, I will not oppose the amendment. In fact, I will support the  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Washington (Mr. Heck).   The amendment was agreed to.                    Amendment No. 37 Offered by Ms. Kaptur    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 37  printed in House Report 115-259.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, this is going to be something that the  ranking member and I happen to disagree on.   Poison pill riders--I have always liked that term, ``poison pill  riders.'' What they are are policy changes. If they are policy changes  you like, they are policy changes. If you don't like them, they are  poison pill riders. So when they had the majority, they put what we  considered poison pill riders in their bill, but they were policy  changes, and that is what we do in some appropriations bills.   But I rise in strong opposition to this amendment. I have been  debating this issue for, I don't know, probably 10 years. While the  change in the administration means that we are able to reduce the  number of the issues we needed to address in this bill, some issues  warrant continued congressional attention--WOTUS is one of them.   My reason for opposing the Obama administration's WOTUS rule remains  the same. The rule would greatly expand Federal jurisdiction over the  Clean Water Act. The Supreme Court has twice ruled that the definition  used under the Clean Water Act of navigable waters was hard to define  and told them that they need a new definition.   Well, the EPA's design on a new definition is, okay, we will just  control everything. So everybody thinks that those waters that are now  under control of the Clean Water--I mean, of the WOTUS rule written by  the Obama administration were unregulated before. They were not  unregulated. They were regulated by the States, and the States did a  good job of regulating those things.   But now the Federal Government has come in and taken control of all  of those States. We think, and the courts have ruled, that this is too  broad a definition of what they intended and what the Clean Water rule  states.   Nobody wants dirty water--nobody. But what we want is a rule that  separates what the Federal Government has the authority to control and  what the States have the authority to control.   President Trump moved quickly on this issue by issuing an executive  order in February, and a few weeks ago, the EPA and the Corps announced  the first step in a two-step process: a proposed rule to rescind the  WOTUS rule and recodify the previous regulatory text.   The second step will be a second rulemaking to reevaluate the  definition of waters of the United States in a manner consistent with  the Supreme Court decision.   The provision in this bill is supportive of these efforts. First, it  provides clear authorization to withdraw the Obama administration's  rule. Second, it clarifies what rule will be in effect if the WOTUS  rule is withdrawn, specifically, the same rules that were in effect  immediately prior to the promulgation of the final WOTUS rule. And  third, it does not affect the Trump administration's ability to develop  a new rule, one that will provide more clarity and certainty for the  regulated community while staying within the legal bounds provided by  the Supreme Court.   For these reasons, I have to oppose this amendment, and I strongly  oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Jenkins).   Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman so  much for his leadership on this issue.   WOTUS, waters of the U.S., it has really been talked about for a  number of years. This is a classic case of Barack Obama, the  administration previous to the Trump administration, overreaching its  authority. This is executive branch takeover, waters of the U.S.,  saying that we have got what is called navigable waters and using the  executive authority to redefine what navigable waters are.    This hurts farmers. This hurts small businesses. The suggestion that  just a puddle, a small creek is defined as a navigable water, we know  that is simply not the case.   Let me remind folks about the three branches of government:  legislative, executive, and judiciary. We have Supreme Court decisions  that were putting a stop to the overreach of the Obama administration's  WOTUS rule. Thank you to the courts.   We now have an opportunity as the legislative branch. We appreciate  the work of the executive branch. We appreciate the fact that Donald  Trump and Scott Pruitt and this administration are working to put a  stop to it, because the Court said, as we all know, the Obama  administration overreached.   Now what we are doing, what this appropriations bill provides is the  voice of the legislative branch to say, yes, the prior administration  overreached; the executive branch historically needs to be curtailed;  the courts were right. We need to speak as the legislative branch  giving the authority to stop this onerous rule.   I applaud the work of the Appropriations Committee. We need to put  the legislative stamp of approval on what the Trump administration is  doing to stop this overregulation.  [[Page H6432]]    I thank the chair, and I certainly oppose this proposed amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).   The amendment was rejected.                                time  2015              Amendment No. 38 Offered by Ms. Castor of Florida    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 38  printed in House Report 115-259.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment-- not just opposition to this amendment, but strong opposition to this  amendment.   This bill fully funds the request of $10.2 billion for weapons  activities, which is, as the gentleman stated, an increase of $921  million over fiscal year 2017.   I have got to tell you, from his comments, you would think we were  growing the nuclear stockpile. The reality is we are decreasing the  size of the nuclear stockpile currently under the new START program.  But even having done that, we have to fund the modernization of our  nuclear stockpile, and it is one of my highest priorities in this bill.   The activities the gentleman proposes to cut are the primary reasons  the Energy and Water bill is being included as a division in the  Defense minibus, because maintaining the nuclear weapons stockpile is  essential to our Nation's national security.   The increase provided in this bill to weapons activities is needed to  extend the life of four nuclear warheads and to address the continued  deterioration of the infrastructure at the Department of Energy's  nuclear sites. These investments are long overdue and must be funded if  our Nation is to have a credible nuclear deterrent, regardless of the  size of that nuclear deterrent.   I would say that the Department of Defense is carrying out a nuclear  posture review that will inform future funding needs. Until that  concludes, there is no change in our Nation's nuclear defense  requirements, and Congress, I believe, must fully fund those  requirements if our Nation is to have a credible nuclear deterrent.   Increases are also needed, as I said, to address the aging  infrastructure at the Department of Energy's nuclear energy sites.   Mr. Chair, I strongly oppose this amendment that the gentleman from  Illinois is offering and would encourage my colleagues to vote against  it.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I would say that the Secretary of Energy is  required to report to the President on  [[Page H6435]]  the safety and reliability of our nuclear stockpile. This is part of  that requirement by the Department of Energy so that they can assure  the President that our nuclear stockpile is safe and reliable.  Modernizing these nuclear weapons makes sense.   Now, we can sit and argue whether we need all these nuclear weapons  or not--I happen to think we can get by on quite a number fewer nuclear  weapons--but we still have to maintain the nuclear weapons stockpile  that we currently have and let the Department of Defense do their  Nuclear Posture Review and make a determination of what ought to be the  ultimate number of nuclear weapons we have, but, as long as we have  this, we have got to make sure they are safe and they are reliable.   Mr. Chair, I would encourage my colleagues to vote against this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Quigley).   The amendment was rejected.                    Amendment No. 41 Offered by Mr. Polis    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 41  printed in House Report 115-259.    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I am not opposed to the EERE. I actually  like the program. But we had to make some difficult decisions, and our  highest priority is maintaining our nuclear stockpile and making sure  that our defense activities were fully funded.   Secondly, it was making sure that the Army Corps of Engineers was  fully funded at the WRDA level that our colleagues here on the floor  always insist on. That means we had to make some difficult decisions  within the Department of Energy. EERE, we did the best we could.   But when the gentleman says, you know, we are not living in the Cold  War anymore, so we don't need the nuclear weapons and stuff and we  don't need these facilities and stuff, you are right, we are not living  in the Cold War anymore. It is scarier times right now than it was in  the Cold War.   You never need those facilities until you need those facilities, and  you better have had them by then. That is the problem. It is not  looking forward.   So I oppose this amendment because we have done our best within the  weapons activities to make sure that we do what our Nation requires,  and that is to make sure that we have a safe, reliable, and secure  nuclear stockpile.   And we ought to let the Defense Department come out with their  Nuclear Posture Review and tell us what they believe we need as a  weapons system, altogether, when that review comes out.   I oppose it also because it takes money for the arguments made by my  friends from West Virginia, because it takes money out of the fossil  energy research. As they said every time I have asked the Department of  Energy, ``What do you think the amount of energy we are going to  consume over the next 20 or 30 years that comes from hydrocarbons,  coal, and natural gas, is going to be in the future,'' it is actually a  larger part, not a smaller part.   And while I have been to NREL, I think NREL is a great lab. They do  some incredible work out there. We want to support them. We want to  make sure that they stay open and that they can do the job that we have  asked them to do and that our other labs can also.   But this amendment, I think, is directly the wrong direction to go.   Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Will the gentleman yield?    I yield to the gentleman from West Virginia.   Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I will be very brief.   By my calculation, this is about the third or fourth amendment from  the minority trying to take money out of a very important future- looking initiative, the fossil energy R&D, and redirect it elsewhere.  They keep trying to raid this important funding.   I am sitting here with my colleague from West Virginia, who NETL is  actually physically in his district. There is no stronger champion of  NETL than  [[Page H6436]]  the gentleman from West Virginia. This is hundreds of jobs in our  State, in his district, but the impact of their work reaches across the  country and literally around the world.   I spoke on a previous attack on this funding a moment ago. I defend  strongly the work of the fossil energy R&D. And to suggest this is just  looking to yesterday is missing the point that I made a moment ago  talking about rare earth elements and unlocking the potential that  these fossil resources have in so many ways, not just energy  production.   So I thank the chairman of the subcommittee for recognizing and  supporting fossil energy R&D and my colleague from West Virginia, who  is such a staunch supporter of NETL, and my ability to work with him.   Please, I encourage people to reject the gentleman's amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Weber of Texas) having assumed the chair, Mr. Donovan, Acting Chair of  the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported  that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R.  3219) making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the  fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and for other purposes, had come  to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     I claim the time in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5  minutes.    I claim the time in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chair, first, let me say, it was not a $300-some- odd-million plus-up in the fossil energy research. In fact, I think the  fossil energy research account was down from last year.   It was more than the President requested, but it is not a plus-up  from what it was in 2017.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. The amendment  would increase funding for the Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy by  $20 million but has to use $40 million from the Fossil Energy Research  & Development account as an offset.   This bill was the result of some tough choices. I have to admit, they  were some tough choices. It is not that I oppose the program that the  good lady advocates for, but there were some tough choices. We had to  prioritize research and development that will increase our energy  independence.   Our domestic energy resources are vast, and this bill strikes a  balance to lay the foundations for future energy generation  technologies, while maintaining full support for the resources we use  most today.   Increasing funding for EERE by diverting funding from fossil energy  strikes the wrong balance when considering the Nation's electricity  needs. Fossil fuels produce 65 percent of the electricity we use today  and will continue to provide the majority of the Nation's energy needs  in the future.   This amendment would reduce funding for a program that ensures that  we use our Nation's fossil fuel resources as well, and as cleanly as  possible. For all of the reasons that team fossil talked about earlier  tonight, I must oppose the amendment and urge my Members to do the  same.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. Esty).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I  am not opposed to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Idaho is  recognized for 5 minutes.   There was no objection.    Mr. Chairman, I understand the gentlewoman's concern and  thank her for her advocacy for this project.   The committee has been supportive of this project and has provided  $42 million in prior years. The bill includes an additional $18 million  to ensure that the project moves forward, and I am happy to work with  her as the project advances and understand this amendment will be  withdrawn, and I appreciate that.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate  the chairman's words and respect his work prior to this and in this  current effort to get this space and the facility infrastructure issues  addressed. I look forward to working with him on a variety of ideas to  make sure that we get this project completed in a timely and effective  manner.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time, and I withdraw my  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn.                    Amendment No. 51 Offered by Mr. Foster    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 51  printed in House Report 115-259.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, although I am not opposed to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Idaho is  recognized for 5 minutes.   There was no objection.    Mr. Chairman, I understand the gentleman's concern on  this issue and appreciate the fact that  [[Page H6442]]  he brought it up for discussion here tonight.   I would note that the weapons activities accounts provides funding to  ensure the reliability of our Nation's nuclear weapons stockpile. The  NNSA does not use funds within this account to counter proliferation of  biological weapons, although I understand it is an important issue, and  I agree with them we need to address this issue.   However, this amendment increases and decreases the same account and  has no effect on the bill overall, so I will accept the gentleman's  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, although I am opposed to the amendment, I  have to admit that I do enjoy our annual discussion on this.   I oppose this amendment because the bill already shows strong support  for the nonproliferation programs of the NNSA. Funding for nuclear  defense nonproliferation is $1.83 billion--$76.5 million below fiscal  year 2017 and $16.8 million below the budget request.   Within nonproliferation, the bill largely supports funding as  requested, but makes a limited number of realignments within the  account to emphasize the importance of nonproliferation research and  development activities and to meet international commitments for  plutonium disposition.   Our understanding--and this is the important point. Our understanding  is that budget request is down because NNSA still has significant  unexpended balances in this account due to slow progress on  international nonproliferation agreements.   Specifically, the NNSA reported in May that it had approximately $2.2  billion in funds available to carry out its nonproliferation mission,  of which over $680 million is left over from prior years. For years,  NNSA has struggled to execute funding in its nonproliferation budget  because it could not obtain agreement from other nations to do the work  as quickly as planned or as we would maybe like to.   This amendment also targets funding from the weapons activities  infrastructure recapitalization program. Created in fiscal year 2014 by  Congress, the recapitalization program has been highly successful in  addressing the aging and deteriorating infrastructure at NNSA sites.  Replacing things like telephone poles, leaking fireman valves, roofing,  and addressing other basic infrastructure needs are essential to the  safe and continued operation of these nuclear security sites.   The budget request proposed to cut the program, and the bill  increases funding $118 million above the request to restore that  program to the fiscal year 2017 level. We should not divert funding  needed to address these urgent infrastructure needs, and I urge my  colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would just say that this infrastructure  need is not for a new pit facility. They would need to come to us and  ask us what they were going to do with funding, and request funding for  that. They did not do that. This is for infrastructure needs and  upgrades.   But the other thing is that I am as much a nonproliferation activist  as anyone in this body. I think it is important work. But the reality  is that there are $681 million unexpended from previous years, not  because funding is not available--the money is there--but they haven't  been able to get agreements with other countries. Unfortunately, you  can't do work in other countries without having agreements with those  countries.   So, consequently, we are--I guess you could maybe say--overfunded in  nonproliferation if we can't spend the money on that activity. That is  the problem.   Why would we put the money into that when we need the money in  infrastructure and building and repairing the buildings and facilities  that NNSA has?   It just doesn't make any sense to me.   I am sure if this amendment is defeated, we will have this discussion  next year, and I hope my colleagues will vote against this.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   While there may be instances--and I am sure there are--in which  greater coordination would be helpful in ensuring our coastal resources  are available for future generations, any such coordination must be  done carefully to protect against Federal overreach.   As we saw with the Obama administration's WOTUS rule to redefine  waters of the United States, thorough and strong Congressional  oversight is needed to ensure that we protect private property rights.   Unfortunately, the way the Obama administration developed the  National Ocean Policy increased the opportunities for Federal  overreach. The implementation plan is so broad and so sweeping that it  may allow the Federal Government to affect agricultural practices,  mining, energy producers, fishermen, and anyone else whose actions may  have an impact on the oceans.   The facts is that the previous administration did not work with  Congress. This is their National Ocean Policy. They never brought it to  Congress.   If you are going to do something this sweeping, you need to have  congressional input. They never came to Congress to develop its plan,  and they had even refused to provide relevant information to Congress.  So we can't be sure how sweeping it actually could be if left  unchecked.                                time  2200    That is why I support the language of the underlying bill and,  therefore, oppose this amendment. But I understand their concern. But  why not bring it to Congress? Why not have Congress enact the National  Ocean Policy instead of just relying on the executive branch to do  whatever they want to do? That is the problem the Natural Resources  Committee has with this. It is a problem I have with this, and that is  why I oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I will just say it is kind of interesting  that I don't disagree with anything Ms. Pingree is saying. The problem  is, there is a process, and Congress needs to be involved.   The last administration did not involve Congress. If it is a good  policy, why don't we just let the administration do it? If you can't  get the votes on the floor, doesn't that tell you something?   Maybe you need to go and work this out and bring the policy to the  floor. But if we are just going to let the administration do that, I  don't know, maybe we will let this administration just enact a tax  policy because we have a tough time doing it here in Congress. I don't  know, maybe we will let them enact the healthcare policy because we  can't get together on the floor to see what to do about our healthcare  system, so let's just let the administration do it all.   It is exactly what you are doing with this. You bring an actual ocean  policy to the floor, if I think it is a good bill  [[Page H6445]]  and necessary, I will vote for it. I can't tell you what I will vote  for yet because I haven't seen it.   But just because Congress hasn't acted doesn't give the  administrative branch of government the right to interject itself and  take on the legislative branch of government's responsibility.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I will just say, the usurpation by the  administrative branch of government over Congress happens with both  Republican and Democratic administrations. I remember someone standing  up and saying: Well, if Congress won't do it, I have a pen and a phone.   This is Congress surrendering our responsibility, and even though you  might like the outcome of what they do, it is the wrong thing to do,  and Congress needs to stand up at times and take back our  responsibility than just saying: Well, I don't really like the way it  was done, but I like the policy, so I will just support it. And that is  what we are doing here. That is the problem with the National Ocean  Policy.   Again, I would encourage the supporters of this, and who knows, I  might be one of them, to bring it to Congress. Let's debate it. Let's  have a good healthy debate on this floor. Go through the committee  process, go through the regular order, and then it is something that we  might be able to support in the appropriations process.   Other than that, I would urge my colleagues to vote against this  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Walker). The gentleman from Idaho is recognized  for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I would tell the gentleman that they have  brought a lot of nuclear waste to the State of Idaho. We process it  there. It was Rocky Flats that was, they say, cleaned up. It wasn't  cleaned up; it was moved to Idaho because we got most of their stuff  there. That is kind of what happens.   Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose this amendment. I think we all  understand why my colleagues from Nevada oppose Yucca Mountain, their  position on Yucca Mountain; however, I cannot support this amendment.  It is time to move forward with the Yucca licensing process.   The previous administration ignored the law. I repeat that--ignored  the law. Ignoring our obligation to take responsibility for this spent  fuel, and breaking trust with 32 States stopped this process in its  tracks.   I don't think I have to state why that happened. It wasn't because of  science or anything else. We all know why they stopped the licensing  process at Yucca Mountain.   The decision has already cost taxpayers $6 billion in claims, and the  Department of Energy estimates at least another $24 billion in claims.   This administration has taken swift action to put us back on track,  and the budget request proposed in this bill includes $150 million for  Yucca licensing efforts. Licensing efforts will continue to involve  experts in geochemistry, hydrology, geology, seismology, volcanology,  and more to ensure that Yucca Mountain, already one of the most studied  pieces of land on Earth--I would say the most studied piece of land on  Earth. There were 52 or 53 National Academy of Sciences studies on  Yucca Mountain that have been done. But it will get a careful review  from all aspects of its license applications.   Once that application is finished, all Members of this body and of  the Senate will have the opportunity to decide whether we move forward  to construct and use the facility. But killing the process at this  point is shortsighted, and, therefore, I oppose the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would just say in response: Then change  the law. The law is that Yucca Mountain is the waste repository for  high-level nuclear waste. All we are asking is to continue the  licensing process.   As I said during my opening statement, Congress will have a chance to  vote on whether to proceed with the construction of this facility. That  is the reality. But we have got to get off the dime and start moving  and handling this nuclear waste or it is going to cost us billions and  billions and billions more.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Kihuen).   The amendment was rejected.                 Amendment No. 56 Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 56  printed in House Report 115-259.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.  [[Page H6447]]    The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division D, before the short title, insert       the following:        Sec. __.  The amounts otherwise provided by this Act are       revised by reducing the amount made available for ``Corps of       Engineers-Civil--Investigations'', and increasing the amount       made available for the same account, by $3,000,000.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I am going to take this opportunity  just to show this picture to my colleagues on the floor of the House  and the headline that says: ``Urban Flooding in Houston is on the  Rise.''   I clearly just used the city of Houston by coincidence, but I will  tell you that this is what we are facing, really, across America.   The opening sentence of the article says: ``Before you can fix a  problem, you need to know what's causing it.''   My amendment is just that. My amendment--as I thank Chairman Simpson  and Ranking Member Kaptur for their work on this legislation in doing  the best that we can under the circumstances of trying to preserve the  balance--speaks to the need for robust funding for the U.S. Army Corps  of Engineers' investigations account by redirecting $3 million for  increased funding for postdisaster watershed assessment studies, like  the one that has been contemplated in many areas around the country.   As the Federal agency that collects and studies basic information  pertaining to river and harbor, flood and storm damage reduction, shore  protection, aquatic ecosystem restoration, and conducts detailed  studies, plans, and specifications for river and harbor and flood and  storm damage reduction, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers plays a  critical role in building, maintaining, and expanding the most critical  of the Nation's infrastructure.   When questioning the Army Corps of Engineers about a certain area in  my community covering a number of bayous, which we are called The Bayou  City--Sims Bayou, Greens Bayou, Brays Bayou, White Oak Bayou, Hunting  Bayou, and Clear Creek Bayou--it is the same all over the Nation: the  Army Corps of Engineers said they need to study the issue to know how  to best resolve it.   My amendment is just that. It is resources to be directed to ensure  that we are allowed to study issues so that we can focus the dollars  correctly as we attempt to work collaboratively with our local  communities.   I ask my colleagues to support this amendment, and I make this point:  such a study is certainly needed, given the frequency and severity of  historic-level flood events in many parts around our Nation and in the  area in which I live.   On April 15, 2016, an estimated 240 billion gallons of water fell in  the Houston area over a 12-hour period.   Let me be very mindful, this is not an earmark. It simply says that  we should have the resources to study these issues so that we can  direct moneys in the right way.   Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Texas has 2\1/2\ minutes  remaining.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, let me conclude my remarks by  indicating that I believe this particular amendment will be helpful in  general to, in essence, provide funding for the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers' investigations account and ensuring that a postdisaster  watershed assessment can result.   Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Ms. Kaptur in particular. We have  spoken about this for probably over a 2-year period. I think the very  fact that my particular area can be cited as an example of what happens  when you have urban flooding is just an example.   Over this past summer, we know that we have had some serious loss of  life when rivers have overflowed or areas where water is and people  have been recreating have overflowed, and so the idea of saving lives  is part of my amendment as well.   Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairman Simpson and Ranking Member Kaptur  for shepherding this legislation to the floor and for their commitment  to preserving America's great natural environment and resources so that  they can serve and be enjoyed by generations to come.   My amendment speaks to the need for robust funding for the U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers ``Investigations'' account by redirecting $3 million  for increased funding for post-disaster watershed assessment studies,  like the one that is being contemplated for the Houston/Harris County  metropolitan area.   As the federal agency that collects and studies basic information  pertaining to river and harbor, flood and storm damage reduction, shore  protection, aquatic ecosystem restoration, and conducts detailed  studies, plans, and specifications for river and harbor, and flood and  storm damage reduction, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers plays a  critical role in the building, maintaining, and expanding of the most  critical of the nation's infrastructure.   We understand this very well in my home state of Texas and the  Eighteenth Congressional District that I represent.   The Army Corps of Engineers has been working with the Harris County  Flood Control District since 1937 to reduce the risk of flooding within  Harris County.   Current projects include 6 federal flood risk management projects:  Sims Bayou, Greens Bayou, Brays Bayou, White Oak Bayou, Hunting Bayou,  and Clear Creek.   In addition to these ongoing projects, the Army Corps of Engineers  operates and maintains the Addicks and Barker (A&B) Detention Dams in  northwest Harris County.   Mr. Chair, I am pleased that the bill provides that the Secretary of  the Army may initiate up to six new study starts during fiscal year  2018, and that five of those studies are to consist of studies where  the majority of the benefits are derived from flood and storm damage  reduction or from navigation transportation savings.   I am optimistic that one of those new study starts will be the  Houston Regional Watershed Assessment Flood Risk Management Feasibility  study.   Such a study is certainly needed given the frequency and severity of  historic-level flood events in recent years in and around the Houston  metropolitan area.   On April 15, 2016, an estimated 240 billion gallons of water fell in  the Houston area over a 12 hour period, which resulted in several areas  exceeding the 100 to 500 year flood event record.   The areas that experience these historic rainfalls were west of I-45,  north of I-10, and Greens Bayou.   Additionally, an estimated 140 billion gallons of water fell over the  Cypress Creek, Spring Creek, and Addicks watershed in just 14 hours.   The purpose of the Houston Regional Watershed Assessment is to  identify risk reduction measures and optimize performance from a multi- objective systems performance perspective of the regional network of  nested and intermingled watersheds, reservoir dams, flood flow  conveyance channels, storm water detention basins, and related Flood  Risk Management (FRM) infrastructure.   Special emphases of the study, which covers 22 primary watersheds  within Harris County's 1,756 square miles, will be placed on extreme  flood events that exceed the system capacity resulting in impacts to  asset conditions/functions and loss of life.   Mr. Chair, during the May 2015 Houston flood, 3,015 homes were  flooded and 8 persons died; during the April 2016 Houston flood, 5,400  homes were flooded and 8 deaths recorded.   The economic damage caused by the 2015 Houston flood is estimated at  $3 billion; the 2016 estimate is being compiled and is estimated to be  well above $2 billion.   Mr. Chair, minimizing the risk of flood damage to the Houston and  Harris County metropolitan area, the nation's 4th largest, is a matter  of national significance because the region is one of the nation's  major technology, energy, finance, export and medical centers:   1. Port of Houston is the largest bulk port in the world;   2. Texas Medical Center is a world renowned teaching, research and  treatment center;   3. Houston is home to the largest conglomeration of foreign bank  representation and second only to New York City as home to the most  Fortune 500 companies; and   4. The Houston Watershed Assessment study area sits within major  Hurricane Evacuation arteries for the larger Galveston Gulf Coast  region.   I ask my colleagues to join me and support Jackson Lee Amendment No.  56.   I thank Chairman Simpson and Ranking Member Kaptur for their work in  shepherding this bill to the floor.                      [From the Houston Public Media]                  Urban Flooding in Houston Is on the Rise                           (By Marissa Cummings)         Before you can fix a problem, you need to know what's       causing it.  [[Page H6448]]         Dr. Sam Brody, Professor at A&M Galveston, is doing exactly       that.        He focuses on urban flooding and says Houston is the poster       child.        ``The bigger driver of this urban flood problem is human       development, it's the spread of impervious surfaces and I       calculated the Houston region increased its pavement by 25       percent over a 15 year period from 1996 to 2010,'' says       Brody.        He is also contributing to national research that will help       alleviate urban flooding across the U.S.        Stephen Costello, Houston's Flood Czar, agrees with Brody's       assessment.        Part of the solution he says is investing in innovative       infrastructure.        ``But there has to be a commitment on the part of the       community to invest in infrastructure,'' Costello says. ``And       that's what the voters should be looking at saying `OK, so       let's make sure we continue to invest in the infrastructure,'       and that's where the public needs to get involved.''        Although, we cannot stop flooding from happening, Costello       says we need to mitigate and reduce the risk.    Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR.

The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.   Stated for:    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I recognize the underlying bill has  language on this issue, but I understand that the requirement may not  be as comprehensive as my colleague supports. I am concerned that the  amendment before us may have unintended consequences. If my colleague  would withdraw the amendment today, I will commit to working together  as this bill moves through the legislative process to see if we can  address her concerns in a manner acceptable to everyone. Otherwise, I  will have to oppose the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman  from Ohio.    Mr. Chairman, if the gentlewoman is willing to withdraw  the amendment, we will work together to see if we can solve this.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's willingness  to work with me on this important issue and also Representative Kaptur  for her support.   Our Nation can't afford to lose its critical production capability.  We should not allow American workers to be left behind, so I look  forward to working with the gentleman and the gentlewoman.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time, and I withdraw my  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn.                   amendment no. 61 offered by mr. burgess    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 61  printed in House Report 115-259.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, let me first say that I compliment the  gentlewoman for her consistency. She is a true budget hawk in trying to  make sure that we ultimately balance this budget. It is tough work to  do that.   We have actually, as she mentioned, reduced spending in this bill  over last year. Could we reduce it another 1 percent across the board?  The problem is we have to choose some priority in the bill.   The highest priority we had was our Nation's defense, the nuclear  weapons program. Even though the overall bill is down $206 million, the  defense activities are actually up nearly a billion dollars.   We then have to look at the infrastructure of this Nation and the  fact that we have deteriorating infrastructure, and Congress has told  us that each year we have to meet what is called the WRDA target. We  have to spend with the Army Corps of Engineers to meet the  infrastructure of our harbors, dams, and inland waterways and restore  those things, because it is very important to our commerce and  something the Congress supports greatly.   So when we have had to increase the Army Corps of Engineers funding  over what was spent last year and then we have had to increase weapons  activity, that means the Department of Energy has been significantly  reduced over what they were last year.   We have had to make some very hard choices. We have cut the EERE,  Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, program in half from $2 billion  to $1 billion, roughly.   We have had to eliminate the ARPA-E program, a program that I happen  to support, but we just don't have the money for it.   We have had to eliminate the loan guarantee program, a program that,  again, I support, but we just don't have the money for it.   So we have made some significant reductions while prioritizing basic  science research and those types of activities within the Department of  Energy. I think we have done a good job, given a pretty skinny budget.  We have made tough choices. That is okay. That is what we do all the  time in the Appropriations Committee.   The reality is, if we are ever going to balance this budget, if  anybody looks at the numbers, right now we are spending about 70  percent of our total Federal budget on mandatory programs. We have been  reducing discretionary spending over the years. As a portion of the  total budget, it has gone down every year.   If we don't get a hold of mandatory spending--Medicare, Medicaid,  Social Security, and interest on the debt--within 10 years we will have  enough money for our mandatory programs and defense, nothing else-- zero.   We are not going to balance this budget by reducing discretionary  spending. Keeping control of it, you bet, that is what we have been  doing. That is what the Appropriations Committee has been doing since  2010, or earlier. We have actually been reducing spending. It is very  important that we do that. But we have to get a hold of mandatory  spending if we are going to balance the budget.   So while I appreciate what the gentlewoman is trying to do, I agree  with her, we need to balance this budget. We need to balance this  budget. Unfortunately, this is not the way to do it.   So I have to oppose this amendment and hope my colleagues would  oppose it also.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H6460]]         Mr. Chairman, as the designee of Chairman Frelinghuysen,  I move to strike the last word.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, as the designee of Chairman Frelinghuysen,  I move to strike the last word.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, while I would like to support this  amendment, unfortunately, I can't. But, believe me, I understand and  have learned from Ms. Kaptur and the members of the Great Lakes States  when I was chairman of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies  Subcommittee. And now she sits on the Interior, Environment, and  Related Agencies Subcommittee with me, and they have all come and  talked to me about this problem.   This, unfortunately, pits kind of one State against another, and what  I am trying to do is find a solution to this, because I happen to agree  with these individuals that it seems rather silly that we go out and  ask for a report to be done and then can't seem to get it released--not  only the final report, we can't even get a draft report released that  will go out for comment. That doesn't make any sense to me.                                time  0020    But I know that there are Members who also have concerns about that,  but that is, frankly, why you release a draft report, so that you can  get the comments.   During full committee consideration on the Energy and Water bill, we  discussed a similar amendment that was offered by Ms. Kaptur, my  ranking member, Mr. Joyce, and Mr. Moolenaar; and I committed to them  at the time that I would work with all interested parties and Members  to try to move these efforts forward, and I am happy to reiterate that  commitment now.   What I am asking is if the gentleman will withdraw the amendment,  give me a chance, and I commit to try to get this report out, because I  think it needs to get done, and I think, together, we can convince the  Army Corps and maybe the administration that it needs to get done. So  that would be my request.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  [[Page H6463]]  Mitchell) having assumed the chair, Mr. Perry, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3219)  making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year  ending September 30, 2018, and for other purposes, had come to no  resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 12 o'clock and 22 minutes  a.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until today,  Thursday, July 27, 2017, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
