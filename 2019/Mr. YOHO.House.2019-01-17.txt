 Madam Speaker, I would like to discuss border security, not  as viewed by Washington elites, but how it is viewed by average  Americans.   Democratic leaders and the media will tell you that most Americans  don't support President Trump's proposed southern border wall. They  will tell you that a border wall is not needed; it is immoral; it won't  fix the country's illegal immigration problem.   I currently represent Florida's Third Congressional District, and  here I have a picture of my district's public creative space, the 34th  Street graffiti wall that is well known in Gainesville. This wall is  used by local organizations to express their thoughts on issues and  display information for community events.   Recently, local residents painted their support of President Trump's  proposed wall for all passersby to see. The wall reads: ``Keep the  government shutdown until the wall is funded. Call Congress. We the  people demand Congress fund and build the wall now.''   It is a great example of everyday Americans voicing their support for  what matters most to them.  [[Page H683]]    It is clear that Americans do support President Trump's security  stance, despite exaggerated reports by the media and my colleagues on  the other side.   I have heard from hundreds of my constituents who are in support of  the wall. Their voices have been heard, and I will remain strong for  border security and protecting this Nation.                            ____________________     Mr. Scalise, may I ask a question?    Does the court reporter have a record of Mr. Guthrie's  statement? Can we have that read back, please?    A parliamentary inquiry.    I would like to know if the court reporter has taken a  transcript and recorded Mr. Guthrie's ask for a recorded vote.    If that Record shows that he did ask that and it didn't ask  for a vote, is this vote null?
