 Mr. President, I want to talk a little bit about Social  Security and, specifically, about the windfall elimination provision  and the government pension offset. Now, I know that sounds real  technical, but, basically, here is the problem.   We have a lot of Americans who have paid into Social Security who are  now getting screwed by Social Security. They are not getting their  money back. All of us want to do everything we can to maintain the  stability and sanctity of the Social Security system, and I think all  of us believe that we all ought to get the Social Security payments  that we are entitled to. That is all this issue is about. Let me  explain.   For many middle-class Americans, receiving Social Security at  retirement is sort of like a welcoming light at the end of the tunnel.  They have worked hard, they have retired, and now they are entitled to  some of the money back that they paid into the Social Security system.  I am talking, of course, about the hard-working women and the hard- working men who have seen a chunk of their monthly earnings go into the  Social Security system throughout their entire careers--10, 15, 20, and  sometimes 30 and 40 years. These same Americans have not seen a pay  raise or an increase in their median household income for a long time.  The median household income in America today, as the Presiding Officer  knows, is pretty much the same as it was in 1999.   I guess whom I am talking about are ordinary people. You can call it  the middle class, if you would like, or working families. They were the  ones who were hit the hardest by the great recession of 2008. They have  been struggling throughout their lives to participate in the great  wealth of this Nation. They are entitled to participate in the great  wealth of this Nation, and they should not have to keep on struggling  to get money for retirement from the Social Security system when they  have already paid into the Social Security system.   The principle behind Social Security is pretty simple. Throughout  your working life, you pay some money and your employer pays some  money. When you are done working, or when you retire, according to a  formula, you get your money back through a Social Security check. It is  simple in theory. You put money in, and when you hit the retirement  age, you get some of it back, except that for 1.7 million Americans,  that is not the case. That is not how the system works for them. That  includes about 38,000 hard-working folks in my home State of Louisiana,  but there are a lot more in other States as well. I am talking about  millions of teachers, police officers, firefighters, and a lot of other  folks who earn modest pensions in service to their communities who face  little or no access to Social Security.   Here is what I am talking about. I am talking about a teacher who  paid into the Social Security system. I am talking about teachers or  firefighters or policemen who paid into their own retirement systems.  So they are rocking along. They are, basically, paying into two  retirement systems--Social Security and the private retirement system.  They are doing the right thing in getting up every day, going to work,  obeying the law, and trying to save money for retirement. It is  deferred gratification. They are ready to retire, but because they were  prudent enough to invest in a private retirement system, they do not  get their Social Security check even though they have already paid into  it. Additionally, a worker can pass away before reaching retirement age  not even knowing that his spouse and children will not have full access  to his Social Security survivors' benefits. That is just not right.   Until 2005, there was not even a legal requirement for human  resources to notify workers that switching careers would affect their  eligibility for Social Security or Social Security survivors' benefits.  Many of these 1.7 million Americans who are getting screwed tried to do  the right thing. They paid into a private retirement system, and they  paid into Social Security only to find out later that they can get  their money from the private retirement system but that they cannot get  their money from Social Security. They are being punished for being  prudent. Many of them retire with no idea that that is the law. By  then, of course, it is too late.   In June of this year, one in six Americans collected Social Security  benefits, and I am happy for every one of them because, to collect,  they had to pay in. That is about 61 million Americans. By 2031, when  the last of the baby boomers hits retirement age, that number is going  to increase to about 75 million Americans. These are going to be our  seniors. They are our seniors, and they are our seniors to be. They are  battling against the rising costs of housing, healthcare, automobiles,  taxes, and fees. Many of them have had their private retirement  accounts or home values wrecked by the great recession. Yet these  Americans press on.   When we talk about tax reform--and we are going to be talking a lot  about tax reform here over the next few weeks--we need to make clear  that we are talking about reforms that will help these middle-class  Americans. They are the people who get up every day, go to work, obey  the law, and try to do the right thing by their kids and teach their  kids morals and try to save a little money for retirement.   Let me be blunt. I would like to eliminate the windfall elimination  provision and the government pension offset in the Social Security  office. I think it would be a vital step in ensuring that our middle- class seniors can enjoy continued economic security after their  retirements. Not only would it help the economy, but it is the right  thing to do.   I sum up. We can provide economic relief immediately to some of those  middle-class retirees about whom I have been talking by eliminating the  windfall elimination provision and the government pension offset of the  Social Security system. It will not cost much money. It will have a  small effect on the cost of Social Security, at about 0.13 percent--not  13 percent but 0.13 percent. It is a little over one-tenth of 1  percent.   After taking care of this simple fix, which is more than about  money--it is about fairness--we can turn our eyes to out-of-control  Washington spending to ensure that Social Security remains a reliable  source of retirement income for Americans in the long term.
