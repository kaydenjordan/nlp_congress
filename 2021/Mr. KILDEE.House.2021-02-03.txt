 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this budget resolution,  which gives Congress the additional legislative tool it needs to pass  the urgently needed coronavirus relief for our constituents and for our  communities. I am very pleased that President Biden has made defeating  this virus his top priority.   This pandemic is not over. COVID-19 continues to pose both a health  and economic crisis, so we have to respond with solutions that are  scaled to the size and scope of this problem. By passing this  resolution, Congress will be able to get relief to people more quickly:  more resources for vaccine distribution; more aid to reopen schools  safely; additional support for families, for seniors, for small  businesses that are hurting.   I know that Republicans and Democrats share these common goals. In  fact, they are speaking up all across the country. Republicans and  Democrats support this big and bold approach.   We should work together in this body to manifest that and pass this  legislation, so we get the people the help they need.   Doing nothing is not an option, and neither is doing too little. In  fact, we have heard so much about the long-term economic impact. The  truth of the matter is, doing nothing or doing too little will cost us  more money, an estimated 4 million jobs that could be lost. The impact  on families, the impact on all of us, would be tremendous if we fail to  scale the response to the size of this problem.   Mr. Speaker, my Republican colleagues were very quick to use this  very same process to pass legislation that we received the day before  we voted on it, to give massive tax cuts to the very people at the very  top of the economy. Now, when we see a crisis that literally is  threatening the lives and the livelihoods of Americans, we have to use  every tool we can to get them the help they need.   I support this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to do so as well.
