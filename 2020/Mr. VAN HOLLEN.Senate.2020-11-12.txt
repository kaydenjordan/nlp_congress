 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday, we came together as a  country--not as Republicans, not as Democrats or Independents, but as  Americans--to recognize the service and sacrifice of our veterans, men  and women who served in uniform to protect our country and to defend  our democracy.   The ongoing attacks that President Trump has launched on our  democracy are an insult to those who have sacrificed so much to defend,  and so too is the complicity of so many Republican Senators right here  in this body, who through their silence or active incitement are  spreading Donald Trump's absurd false narrative that he won the  election.   Each of us--each of us in this body--has sworn an oath to protect and  defend the Constitution of the United States, to stand up for our  democracy, and to support the peaceful transfer of power established  there. My colleagues, it is time for every Senator to do your sworn  duty and stand up for the Constitution and for our democracy.   Make no mistake, on January 20, Joe Biden will be sworn in as the  next President of the United States and Kamala Harris will be sworn in  as the next Vice President of the United States. But that does not mean  that what Donald Trump is doing now is harmless. That does not mean  that the silence or active complicity of so many Republican Senators is  harmless. It is downright dangerous to the health of our democracy and  to our national security interests.   We have enough challenges protecting our democracy from foreign  enemies and foreign adversaries who seek every day to undermine faith  and confidence in democratic institutions here in the United States and  in other democracies around the world. The last thing we need is for  people to attack that confidence from within the United States. This is  doing harm in the short term and the long term to our national  security, putting us at risk.   In the short term, we are seeing a very dangerous purge of top  national security officials at the Defense Department and other places.  These are officials with whom I have many policy differences, but they  are competent managers and qualified individuals. And what you are  seeing this President do in the death throes of his administration is  purging those qualified individuals and replacing them with people  whose only credential is loyalty to President Trump, and replacing  competent, qualified individuals with political lackeys. That is  dangerous at any time. It is especially dangerous to mess around with  the top leadership of our national security agencies during a  transition to power.   That is what the 9/11 Commission told us. Yet what you are seeing  President Trump do is play with matches when it comes to our national  security  [[Page S6659]]  and to put personal political peeves above the national security  interests of the United States.   In addition to purging individuals from some of our top national  security agencies, the President is prohibiting the government of the  United States, which belongs to the people of the United States, from  providing daily intelligence briefings and other intelligence briefings  to the incoming President, President-Elect Joe Biden.   Now, we all know that President Trump has been notorious for not  being interested in those intelligence briefings, but I think that for  all of us who know Joe Biden from the time he served as Senator and  Vice President, we know he takes these things seriously and he takes  threats that might be learned through those intelligence briefings  seriously. To deny the next President of the United States access to  those briefings, which is part of the tradition and part of the rules  that we developed to ensure steady transfer and making sure the next  President has the information needed on day one, that is outright  grossly negligent when it comes to our national security. It is time  for our Senate Republican colleagues to be speaking out loudly about  that.   That, of course, is part of the consequence of the fact that the  General Services Administration has been unwilling to provide the  traditional funds to support the peaceful transfer of power. This is  another gross abuse of the government, which belongs to the people of  the United States, not to Donald Trump.   In addition, you have the Secretary of State, Secretary Pompeo,  instructing the Department of State not to pass along messages from  foreign leaders to the next President of the United States, President- Elect Joe Biden. This is, again, another gross abuse of power. And, of  course, Secretary Pompeo undermined this faith in our transition of  democracy himself when he talked about the fact that we are  transitioning to the second Trump term.   This is the person--this is the individual--who is supposed to  represent the United States of America overseas, the person who is  supposed to stand up for our democracy, and yet, here, at home he is  undermining faith in that democracy. And who does that give any comfort  to? Our adversaries and enemies abroad, people who want our democracy  to fail.   I don't know if our Republican colleagues have noticed who has  congratulated the President-Elect Joe Biden and who has not among  foreign leaders. Well, our democratic allies around the world have  congratulated the next President of the United States, Joe Biden. The  United Kingdom, France, Germany, Canada--the leaders of democratic  governments and countries have all acknowledged that our democracy is  working and that they are recognizing the next President of the United  States.   Who has refused, so far, to congratulate the next President of the  United States, Joe Biden? Vladimir Putin, President Xi, and the leader  of North Korea. What President Trump is doing and what our Republican  colleagues are doing by their silence is aiding and abetting these  authoritarian leaders. These guys are smiling. If you are an  authoritarian leader, you want nothing more than to see democracy  fail--to see that model fail. These are leaders who often have their  own sort of election facades, where they pretend to have a free and  fair election, and then it turns out to be 90 percent for them. They  are smiling at what is happening here.   So I hope our Republican Senate colleagues are looking at the company  they are keeping among foreign leaders who are watching us, because the  leaders of our democratic friends and allied countries have all  recognized the outcome of this election, and it is the leaders of  Russia, China, North Korea, and others who have not. That is the  company that is being kept by so many Republican Senators today. And  that is going to do ongoing damage to our ability around the world, as  the world's oldest democracy, to stand up for the interests of liberty,  freedom, and democracy.    I fear that that is not even the most damaging thing that has  happened as a result of this fraud that is being perpetrated on the  American people. The biggest danger is undermining the confidence of  the American people themselves, or large numbers of the American  people, in the outcome of this election, seeding this false narrative  that somehow Donald Trump was actually the winner and that Joe Biden  was somehow an illegitimate President-to-be.   If you look at the recent polling in the last 48 hours, what you find  is that 70 percent of Republicans believe this was not a clear and fair  election. That is two times as many as before the election, and that is  when Donald Trump was telling everybody that, if he lost, it meant the  election was rigged.   Are we really, through our silence or sometimes encouragement, going  to seed the idea that because Donald Trump lost the election it was  rigged? All you have to look at is the frivolous claims being made in  courts around the United States and the reaction to those claims by  judges, appointed by Democrats and Republicans alike, to realize what a  charade this is.   Joe Biden, as a candidate, has said he wants to bring the country  together. He and Kamala Harris want to find a way to bring us together  to find common ground. And he is looking for the opportunity to work on  both sides of the aisle here in the U.S. Senate and in the House of  Representatives to address urgent matters before our country.   So I ask my Republican Senate colleagues: How are you going to take  the extended hand of Joe Biden when you are telling so many of your  constituents back at home that this is an illegitimate election? How  are you going to do that?   What we have seen in the aftermath of this election is scary because  we saw so many times over the last 4 years that our Republican Senate  colleagues refused to stand up to the abuse of power of this  administration, things that if the Obama administration ever thought of  doing, they would be out there every day crying foul and abuse of  power. But everybody enabled that conduct. And now, after the election,  when Joe Biden was already 5 million votes ahead in the national vote  and winning the electoral college, you would think this is a moment for  everybody to come together to give the next President of the United  States a chance.   I think the scary thing of what this shows is that the Republican  Party has become the party of Donald Trump. I just urge my colleagues  to think about the consequences of feeding into this fraud that Donald  Trump was actually the one who was elected, because what you will be  saying there to the 72 million Americans who voted for Donald Trump is  that he is, in fact, the rightful President, and he will therefore also  continue to call the shots within the Republican Party. He is doing  that now, even after he has lost an election. So I just urge my  colleagues to think about what they are doing each day that goes by  that reinforces this false and fraudulent claim--how it is harming our  democracy, how it is harming our national security, how it is going to  impede Joe Biden's ability to reach out to our Republican colleagues.  It is not because he doesn't want to--he does--but because you will  have undermined your ability to do it by telling tens and millions of  Americans that somehow this was an illegitimate election.   I ask, I implore my colleagues to think more about this as every hour  goes by, because every hour that this lie continues and persists is  another hour that you are harming the health of our democracy and our  country.   Thank you.   I yield back.    Mr. President, November 15, 2020, will mark the 25th  World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims, commemorating the  millions of people killed and injured on the world's roads. It is also  a day to thank emergency responders for their role in saving lives; to  reflect on the impact of road traffic deaths and injuries on families  and communities; and to draw attention to the need for improved  legislation, awareness, infrastructure, and technology to save more  families from the tragedy of losing a loved one.   More than 1 million people die from road crashes every year, and tens  of millions are seriously injured. Road traffic crashes are the No. 1  killer of young people aged 15-29 and the eighth leading cause of death  among all people worldwide. Rochelle Sobel, President of the  Association for Safe International Road Travel, highlighted the gravity  of this issue and the imperative to fix it: ``Every 27 seconds,  somewhere in the world, a person dies in a road crash.''   On the 25th anniversary of World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic  Victims, it is important to remember the history and recommit to the  goals of this day. It was initiated in 1995 as the European Day of  Remembrance and quickly spread around the globe to countries in Africa,  South America, and Asia. In 2005, the United Nations General Assembly  adopted Resolution 60/2, recognizing November 15 as the World Day of  Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims. Since that time, the observance  of this day has continued to spread to a growing number of countries on  every continent.   This year, the stated goals of World Day of Remembrance 2020 include  remembering all people killed and seriously injured on the roads,  acknowledging the crucial work of the emergency services, advocating  for better support to road traffic victims and their families, and  promoting evidence-based actions to prevent and eventually stop further  road traffic deaths and injuries.   Indeed, the day has become an important moment to focus international  attention on this preventable epidemic and as an advocacy tool in  global efforts to reduce road casualties. As a result of the growing  awareness and global call to action that World Day of Remembrance for  Road Traffic Victims has generated, in September 2020, the United  Nations passed a resolution declaring the years 2021 to 2030 a new  Decade of Action for Road Safety. The declaration affirms the UN's  commitment to work vigorously to implement a new, ambitious agenda to  halve road crash deaths by 2030.   Additionally, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3.6  calls on governments and their stakeholders, including NGOs and private  citizens, to address the personal, medical, and financial burdens  associated with road traffic deaths and injuries.   The devastation of losing a child, parent, sibling, partner, friend,  caregiver, or caretaker; the struggle of having to care for a  permanently disabled loved one, these are incalculable. Road traffic  crashes are preventable, and so we owe it to our communities to work  together so that the hopes and dreams of our loved ones are not  shattered on the roads of the United States and the  [[Page S6673]]  world. We must all take action to prevent these avoidable tragedies and  save lives.                            ____________________
