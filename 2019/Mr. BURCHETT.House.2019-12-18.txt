 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to  impeachment against President Donald Trump.  [[Page H12181]]    This is based on hearsay that was made by partisan witnesses behind  closed doors. This impeachment is a sham, Madam Speaker, and it has  divided this country.   Congress' wasted time on this impeachment would have been better used  to address issues that are facing Americans, like securing our southern  border, the opioid epidemic, or establishing a constitutionally  mandated budget.   Now American workers have to wait until the Senate trial to pass  USMCA that the President and the House Republicans have been working on  for over a year.   I am disappointed in the path Congress chose to go down.
