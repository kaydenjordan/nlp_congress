Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on H.R. 4990, the bill now under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of H.R. 4990, the  Election Technology Research Act. This bipartisan legislation, which I  was proud to introduce alongside my friend Representative Gonzalez,  Chairwoman Johnson, and Ranking Member Lucas, is a practical,  commonsense bill that would yield important results for the security of  our elections.   Madam Speaker, 48 days from today, Americans will exercise one of  their most important duties in a democratic society and vote. Amidst a  global pandemic, targeted attacks on our democracy by our adversaries,  and political unrest, Americans deserve to know that our elections are  secure.   Last summer, the Science, Space, and Technology Committee held a  hearing with voting technology and election administration experts to  discuss U.S. election system technologies and research recommendations  made in the 2018 National Academies report, Securing the Vote:  Protecting American Democracy. This report and the input we received  during that hearing made it clear that targeted research designed to  protect our voting systems is not only wise but necessary.   The COVID-19 global pandemic has put stress on our healthcare system,  caused nearly 200,000 deaths in the United States, devastated our  economy, and underscored racial inequities in our society. But  Americans are resilient. They will mail in their ballots or go to their  polling stations to cast their vote. Why? Because they care deeply  about our country and our democracy. In return, one of our jobs in  government is to ensure the American people have confidence in the  integrity of our election process.   Nearly 20 years ago, Congress enacted the Help America Vote Act. HAVA  provided funding for States to purchase new voting equipment and  created the Election Assistance Commission. It also included provisions  to advance research, technology, and standards development for voting  systems.   There are more than 10,000 voting jurisdictions across the United  States. HAVA mandated that the National Institute of Standards and  Technology work with the EAC to develop voluntary voting systems  guidelines for voting machines.   Today, all U.S. States and territories look to those guidelines to  make decisions to about technology procurement and securing their  elections. My legislation modernizes the 20-year-old provisions in HAVA  to reflect the state of today's technology and the nature of today's  election security challenges.   The most important new areas of research and standards development  this bill supports are online voter registration systems and electronic  poll books. Forty States now offer online voter registration, and many  States also use e-poll books on election day for quick access to voter  information.   The Election Technology Research Act also creates centers of  excellence at NIST and the National Science Foundation to further study  a range of important election technology challenges, including  cybersecurity, privacy, reliability, and interoperability.   We must strive to ensure the highest standards are in place for all  technologies used in the election process. And while the overwhelming  majority of election experts agree that the technology is not yet ready  for secure voting over the internet, this bill does support continued  research on internet voting.   In addition to the security and integrity of voting equipment, voting  accessibility is also important. Keeping security at the forefront, we  should make it as easy as possible for all voters to cast their  ballots. H.R. 4990 supports research at NSF to study ways to improve  the voter interface with different voting technologies, including  accessibility, ballot design, and ballot-marking devices.   Beyond the ballot box, this bill supports education and training of  students and design of curricula focused on organizational management  and informational technology needs of the election community.   Finally, H.R. 4990 directs NIST to provide technical assistance to  States for their election needs, including risk assessments and risk- limiting audits.   This is a bipartisan piece of legislation. The Members of the House  Science, Space, and Technology Committee worked to put together a  bipartisan bill that represents our values and our commitment to  protecting our democracy. It recognizes the simple fact that technology  advances quickly. So, when it comes to something as fundamental as  ensuring the security and the sanctity of our elections, it is  incumbent upon Congress to pass legislation to make sure our election  technology is modern, secure, and state of the art.   Madam Speaker, I sincerely thank Representative Gonzalez, Chairwoman  Johnson, and Ranking Member Lucas for joining me as cosponsors on this  bill, as well as my other colleagues on the Science, Space, and  Technology Committee and in the House for adding their names to this  legislation.   I urge all Members to support the Election Technology Research Act,  and I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to see it  enacted in law.  [[Page H4470]]    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                               Committee on House Administration,                                  Washington, DC, February 10, 2020.      Hon. Eddie Bernice Johnson,      Chairwoman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Johnson: I am writing to you regarding H.R.       4990, the ``Election Technology Research Act of 2019.'' This       measure, introduced on November 8, 2019, was referred to your       committee as well as the Committee on House Administration.        The Committee on House Administration agrees to waive       further consideration of H.R. 4990. The Committee does so       with the understanding that by waiving further consideration       of this bill it does not waive any future jurisdictional       claims over similar measures. In addition, the Committee       reserves its right to seek conferees on any provisions within       its jurisdiction which are considered in a House-Senate       conference and requests your support if such a request is       made.        I would appreciate the inclusion of this letter and a copy       of your response in the Congressional Record during       consideration of H.R. 4990 on the House floor.            Sincerely,                                                       Zoe Lofgren,      Chairperson.                                   ____           House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space,             and Technology,                                 Washington, DC, February 10, 2020.      Chairperson Zoe Lofgren,      Committee on House Administration,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairperson Lofgren: I am writing to you concerning       H.R. 4990, the ``Election Technology Research Act of 2019,''       which was referred to the Committee on Science, Space, and       Technology, and in addition to the Committee on House       Administration on November 8, 2019.        I appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       bill. I recognize that the bill contains provisions that fall       within the jurisdiction of the Committee on House       Administration. I appreciate that your Committee will waive       further consideration of H.R. 4990 and that this action is       not a waiver of future jurisdictional claims by the Committee       on House Administration over this subject matter.        I will make sure to include our exchange of letters in the       legislative report for H.R. 4990 and in the Congressional       Record. Thank you for your cooperation on this legislation.            Sincerely,                                          Eddie Bernice Johnson,                                   Chairwoman, Committee on Science,                                             Space, and Technology.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Johnson).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Perlmutter).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Oklahoma (Ms. Kendra S. Horn).    Madam Speaker, this is a practical, bipartisan piece of  legislation that will work to secure our elections.   The administration committee discharged this bill in February, and I  hope I can count on robust support from my colleagues there.   When the House passed the Help America Vote Act nearly 20 years ago,  we recognized that our election systems need protection. That is why  that landmark legislation included the provisions I already mentioned  to advance research, technology, and standards development for voting  systems.   We are in a new technological landscape today, and our voting systems  need to be updated accordingly, and this is the first step in that  direction.   NIST already has a team of experts working with the Election  Assistance Commission on standards for voting technology, and they are  absolutely qualified to pursue this research.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues today. Thank you to  Representative Gonzalez for his work on this bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
