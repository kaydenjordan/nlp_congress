 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment to correct the  number of hostages that Hamas terrorists took when they attacked Israel  on October 7. It was the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the  Holocaust.   That day, Hamas terrorists brutally murdered, raped, burned alive,  and decapitated more than a thousand innocent babies, children, women,  men, and elderly, including dozens of Americans.   Let me be very clear: More than 230 people were abducted and taken  hostage by Hamas, a terrorist organization, including nearly a dozen  Americans. Again, Americans were killed. Americans remain hostage.   There are some people who equivocate about Hamas, a foreign terrorist  organization. There should be no equivocation. They are designated by  the United States of America as a foreign terrorist organization. They  are terrorists, and anybody who spent time looking at images of the  barbaric, heinous, and unthinkable acts that took place on October 7,  like I have, knows what Hamas is capable of. We will never unsee it. I  know the ranking member was there, as well, and has seen it.   We cannot forget that Hamas is an evil terrorist organization. Their  charter advocates jihad against the Jewish people and the destruction  of the Jewish state.   In the region, militarily, beyond their support for Hamas, Iran is  backing proxies that have attacked American troops in Iraq and Syria.  We have seen an uptick in skirmishes between Hezbollah and Israel near  the Lebanese border.   President Biden has been phenomenal with his resolve and unwavering  support for our key ally Israel, which is critical to America's  national security and the fight against terror and is the democracy in  the region.   The President has taken action in Syria in response to attacks by  Iranian-backed proxies on American personnel, regular attacks. We have  seen them in Syria. We have seen it in Iraq. We have seen it from the  Houthis.   The President understands that you have to actually hold terrorists  who commit atrocities against our country accountable, or they will  strike again and be stronger. Hamas terrorists, their leadership, have  even made it clear that they will not back down and are committed to  ``a second, third, and fourth'' October 7 against Israel.   The President has continued to demonstrate strength, resolve, and  leadership to get hostages home. Thankfully, in recent days, groups of  hostages have been rescued, including 4 year old Abigail, an American  citizen.   As of today, there are still nearly 160 hostages, including  Americans. Forty American citizens were slaughtered by Hamas, and other  terrorists have been living in horrifying fear and uncertainty at the  hands of terrorists for more than 50 days. It blows my mind that this  isn't talked about every single day in our country that Americans  remain hostage.   Americans were killed and are still suffering in Gaza. May all their  memories be a blessing.   This should be the beginning and end of the argument of why we must  crush Hamas and stop Iranian-backed terrorist proxies. These terrorists  continue to attack Israel and American personnel around the globe.   The names and ages of the Americans still held hostage by the  terrorists in Gaza are as follows: Gad Haggai, 73 years old; Judith  Weinstein, 70 years old; Keith Samuel Siegel, 64 years old; Sagui  Dekel-Chen, 35 years old; Hersh Goldberg-Polin, 23 years old; Omer  Neutra, 22 years old; Itay Chen, 19 years old.   The eighth American still held hostage is 19-year-old Edan Alexander  from Tenafly, New Jersey, in my district. Here is Edan. He is a  wonderful, wonderful person. I have met with his family. They are  phenomenal.   After Edan graduated from Tenafly High School in 2022, he began  serving with the Israel Defense Forces. He grew up in northern New  Jersey, became a swimmer, and went to the prom. I have seen all the  photos.   Since day one, I have been in constant contact with the Alexander  family. Their unimaginable strength in the face of unfathomable pain  gives all of us hope. I don't know how they do it.   It is time to get our Americans and all of the hostages home. It is  in America's interest and critical to our national security to ensure  that October 7 can never and must never happen again. Our objectives  are clear: to stand by Israel, our key ally, the democracy in the  region, our partner in the fight against terror; to get all of the  Americans and all the hostages home; to crush the terrorists and  provide much-needed humanitarian aid to innocent Palestinian civilians  being used by Hamas as human shields.   Mr. Chair, you will notice that Hamas does not allow any of the  innocent Palestinians to go underground to be protected. There is no  protection for them. They use them as human shields. Israel must  eliminate every single terrorist responsible from Hamas for the  atrocities committed on October 7.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Wasserman Schultz for this  Special Order.   I rise tonight, Mr. Speaker, because, on October 7, Hamas terrorists  attacked Israel and abducted more than 230 people, including many  Americans. Hamas brutally murdered, raped, burned alive, and  decapitated more than 1,000 innocent babies, children, women, men, and  the elderly. It was the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the  Holocaust.   Mr. Speaker, 40 American citizens were slaughtered by Hamas, and 9  have been living in horrifying fear at the hands of terrorists for more  than 50 days. It blows my mind that this isn't talked about every  single day in this country, that Americans were killed and Americans  remain hostages.   Hamas killed Americans, and terrorists still hold American hostages  inside Gaza. That should be the beginning and end of the argument of  why we must crush and kill Hamas.   Thankfully, because of President Biden's resolve and strong  leadership, groups of hostages have been rescued, including 4-year-old  Avigail, an American citizen. Nevertheless, as of today, there are  still 160 hostages.   One of the eight American hostages is Edan Alexander, a 19-year-old  from Tenafly in my district in northern New Jersey. You can see him in  this photo that was shared with me by his family, his mom.   I have spent time with his family. They are phenomenal people and  just such wonderful, warm people. His sister is at Tenafly High School.  After graduating from Tenafly High School in 2022, Edan began serving  in the Israel Defense Forces.   Edan is the type of person who would regularly call his mother to  check in, and his sister considers him to be her best friend. He is  devoted to his friends and is always there for his family. He swam in  high school. I have seen pictures of him at the prom. He is just like  any other American kid we know.   Since day one, I have been in constant contact with the Alexander  family and the State Department. Their unimaginable strength in the  face of unfathomable pain gives us all great hope.   It is time to get all of these hostages home.   There are some people who equivocate about Hamas. There should be no  equivocation. They are designated by the United States of America as a  foreign terrorist organization, and anybody who has spent time looking  at images that many of us saw in the videos of barbaric, heinous, and  unthinkable acts that took place on October 7 knows what Hamas is  capable of.   Look what they are doing to innocent Palestinian civilians every  single day. Are they welcoming them underground and giving them safe  haven? No. They take no responsibility. They use innocent people as  human shields. That is what Hamas does.   Hamas' charter advocates jihad against the Jewish people and the  elimination of the Jewish state. Israel  [[Page H6039]]  is surrounded by terror groups that want to kill their people,  including Arab Israelis.   Israel is and remains the only vibrant, progressive, and inclusive  democracy in the region. They are our key ally because they are  critical to our national security and stand up for values that we  share, strong democratic values. They are key to our fight against  terror in the region, against Hezbollah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and  Hamas.   In Israel, Arab parties serve in the Knesset; women serve at the  highest levels of military; and the country remains an oasis for LGBTQ  people in a region hostile toward the community.   It sickens me that some people are trying to romanticize Hamas. They  should be reminded that in Gaza, under Hamas rule, same-sex relations  are outlawed. Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, your life would be at risk  every day if you were openly gay in Gaza or the West Bank.   Additionally, Hamas' 1988 charter states that Muslim women are  important because they ``manufacture men.'' Hamas even enforces what  women wear in public. There is also no law in Gaza that criminalizes  violence against women within the family, including sexual violence.                                time  1845    Hamas allows honor killings, the murder of women and girls accused of  what they call ``immoral sexual conduct.''   Yet, it took U.N. women a month and a half to recognize that women  and girls were raped in Israel, and, even then, they still refused to  mention Hamas.   Do they not believe the fact that Hamas terrorists committed  horrifying and unspeakable acts against innocent girls and women,  including many that we have seen images of? As you see all of these  hostages being released, you can't imagine what they have been through;  and I think, of course, of the images we are seeing this evening, those  who are still hostages.   Thankfully, President Biden has been phenomenal, as I said, with his  unwavering support for the State of Israel and the Jewish people. The  President understands that you have to actually hold terrorists who  commit atrocities accountable or they will strike again and be  stronger.   Hamas terrorists have made it clear that they will not back down and  are committed to ``a second, third, and fourth'' October 7 against  Israel.   Mr. Speaker, let me conclude by saying: We must stand by our key ally  to get all hostages home, crush the terrorists, and provide  humanitarian aid to innocent Palestinian civilians being used by Hamas  as human shields.   Israel must eliminate every single terrorist responsible for the  atrocities committed on October 7, and we must get these hostages home.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Debbie for her leadership. I thank all of my  colleagues for being here this evening.
