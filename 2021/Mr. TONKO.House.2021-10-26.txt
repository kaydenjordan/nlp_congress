 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank  Congressman Levin for arranging this evening's special order.   Today we honor the remarkable life of Richard Trumka, a person who  poured his entire heart and voice and passion into what is right for  workers and what is right for union workers. Rich emboldened that  mission and fought with great fierceness in order to achieve. Rich  taught us that anything worth fighting for deserves our efforts beyond  belief, and he poured himself passionately into his mission.   A fierce champion of the labor movement and fearless proponent of the  rights of working people, Rich revolutionized collective bargaining and  civil disobedience as a mechanism for meaningful change in our modern  era.   I was deeply saddened and stunned to learn of Rich's sudden passing  back in August.   A great friend to so many of us, myself included and my district, we  worked together to build strong enforceable labor standards into the  heart of the new NAFTA agreement, which gives American workers a fair  shot and level playing field on the global stage.   That kind of fight was at the heart of Richard's lifelong work, using  unionism as a tool to build a fairer economy, a more just economy, a  more robust and competitive economy for our society.   We must honor his indelible legacy and deliver the kind of  generational change for which he fought day in and day out by creating  good-paying union jobs and tackling the climate crisis, racial  injustice, and economic injustice that disproportionately hurts working  people.   My sincerest condolences go out to the entire Trumka family and all  of his loved ones.  [[Page H5921]]    May Richard rest in peace.
