 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3607) to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to  establish fees for medical services provided in units of the National  Park System, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3607         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. FEES FOR MEDICAL SERVICES.         (a) Fees Authorized.--The Secretary may establish and       collect fees for medical services provided to persons in       units of the National Park System or for medical services       provided by National Park Service personnel outside units of       the National Park System.        (b) National Park Medical Services Fund.--There is hereby       established in the Treasury a fund to be known as the       ``National Park Medical Services Fund''. The Fund shall       consist of--        (1) donations to the Fund; and        (2) fees collected under subsection (a).        (c) Availability of Amounts.--All amounts deposited into       the Fund shall be available to the Secretary, to the extent       provided in advance by Acts of appropriation, for the       following in units of the National Park System:        (1) Services listed in subsection (a).        (2) Preparing needs assessments or other programmatic       analyses for medical facilities, equipment, vehicles, and       other needs and costs of providing services listed in       subsection (a).

(5) Obtaining or improving medical facilities, equipment,       vehicles, and other needs and costs of providing services       listed in subsection (a).        (d) Definitions.--For the purposes of this section:        (1) Fund.--The term ``Fund'' means the National Park       Medical Services Fund established by subsection (b).        (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of the Interior.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the National Park Service currently manages 11 units  that provide medical services to park visitors, employees, and nearby  residents, including Yosemite in my district, Yellowstone, Zion, the  Grand Canyon, and Death Valley. These include a wide range of services,  including emergency medical services, ambulance transport, and clinical  services. They treat colds; they set broken bones; they stabilize heart  attacks and strokes; they evacuate the severely injured and treat  thousands of patients annually.   These national park units are typically located in remote areas,  which means that they are often the only option patients have to  receive timely medical care, especially in emergency situations.   In the case of Yosemite, the medical clinic has operated in the  valley since 1929. Like other medical clinics in our national parks, it  serves the park and concessionaire employees, their families, and tens  of thousands of daily park visitors.   The Yosemite medical clinic is a million-dollar-a-year operation,  maintaining a full-time staff and sophisticated medical treatment to  treat and stabilize any number of serious injuries and sudden illnesses  that confront a population of a moderately sized town.   But here is the problem: Any other medical clinic would be able to  use the fees it collects to finance its operations, to plan for  amortizing equipment purchases and expansions, and to match its  expenses to the revenues it generates, but not so our national park  medical clinics.   Under current law, the fees collected by our national park clinics  must go directly to the national Treasury, and the parks must then rely  on annual appropriations to replace those funds, with no certainty they  will return and no ability to plan long-term improvements.   This bill changes all of that. It would establish a separate trust  fund in the Treasury, still under the control of Congress but dedicated  to be returned to the clinics that generate these funds in the first  place. H.R. 3607 will allow the National Park Service to retain  revenues to help offset the costs of providing medical services.   It establishes a national park medical services fund at the Treasury.  The fund will consist of fees collected for medical services provided  to persons in units of the National Park System and through other  donations.   My bill will help the National Park Service to provide higher quality  patient care with industry standard equipment and technology; assist  with training relating to providing the necessary medical services;  develop management plans for medical facilities; and obtain or improve  medical facilities, equipment, vehicles, and other needs and costs of  providing medical services to visitors and staff of our national parks.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Hawaii for  her kind words and support, and I urge adoption of the measure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4609) to provide for the conveyance of a Forest Service site  in Dolores County, Colorado, to be used for a fire station.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4609         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``West Fork Fire Station Act       of 2017''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) County.--The term ``County'' means Dolores County,       Colorado.        (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of Agriculture.        (3) West fork fire station conveyance parcel.--The term       ``West Fork Fire Station Conveyance Parcel'' means the parcel       of approximately 3.61 acres of National Forest System land in       the County, as depicted on the map entitled ``Map for West       Fork Fire Station Conveyance Parcel'' and dated November 21,       2017.       SEC. 3. CONVEYANCE OF WEST FORK FIRE STATION CONVEYANCE                     PARCEL, DOLORES COUNTY, COLORADO.         (a) In General.--On receipt of a request from the County       and subject to such terms and conditions as are mutually       satisfactory to the Secretary and the County, including such       additional terms as the Secretary determines to be necessary,       the Secretary shall convey to the County without       consideration all right, title, and interest of the United       States in and to the West Fork Fire Station Conveyance       Parcel.        (b) Costs.--Any costs relating to the conveyance under       subsection (a), including processing and transaction costs,       shall be paid by the County.        (c) Use of Land.--The land conveyed to the County under       subsection (a) shall be used by the County only for a fire       station, related infrastructure, and roads to facilitate       access to and through the West Fork Fire Station Conveyance       Parcel.        (d) Reversion.--If any portion of the land conveyed under       subsection (a) is used in a manner that is inconsistent with       the use described in subsection (c), the land shall, at the       discretion of the Secretary, revert to the United States.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4609 would authorize the U.S. Forest Service to  convey 3.61 acres of land to Dolores County, Colorado, for the purpose  of building a fire station for the community of West Fork. Currently,  area residents must rely on a fire protection district located 26 miles  away to provide critical firefighting and emergency services to the  community.   Frequent and devastating wildfires have ravaged the Western States,  making it more vital than ever that every community is prepared to  protect itself  [[Page H3322]]  against fire and other catastrophic events. H.R. 4609 will improve  local fire and emergency services to the community of West Fork and  will ensure that residents of the West Fork area will be prepared for  catastrophic events without expending any new Federal dollars.   Mr. Speaker, I want to note the hard work that Representative Tipton  has put into this bill, and I salute his efforts and leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tipton), the author of this measure  and one of the leaders in the House on important issues facing the  Western States.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3961) to amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate  segments of the Kissimmee River and its tributaries in the State of  Florida for study for potential addition to the National Wild and  Scenic Rivers System, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3961         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Kissimmee River Wild and       Scenic River Study Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The Kissimmee River has undergone, over the course of       two decades, the largest river restoration effort in the       world.        (2) Extending approximately 105 miles from Orlando to Lake       Okeechobee, the Kissimmee River forms the headwaters of Lake       Okeechobee and the Everglades and serves as a vital component       of ecosystem restoration in South Florida as a whole.        (3) The Kissimmee River Restoration Project has       significantly improved approximately 63,000 acres of wetlands       within the Kissimmee River watershed and reestablished an       environment suitable for fish, wildlife, and the wetland       plants that existed prior to the Kissimmee River's       channelization in the 1960s.        (4) The Kissimmee River Restoration Project is expected to       be completed in 2020, at which point it is expected to       reestablish historic hydrologic conditions, recreate historic       river and floodplain connectivity, recreate the historic       mosaic of wetland plant communities, and restore historic       biological diversity and functionality.        (5) After decades of restoration efforts and the       expenditure of nearly a billion dollars, upon completion of       the Kissimmee River Restoration Project, a study should be       conducted to determine the eligibility of including the fully       restored Kissimmee River into the National Wild and Scenic       River program to preserve the fully restored free-flowing       condition and immediate environment of the river for the       benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations.        (6) Inclusion of the Kissimmee River into the National Wild       and Scenic River program would be a fitting tribute to the       hard work of the Army Corps of Engineers and the South       Florida Water Management District's restoration work.       SEC. 3. DESIGNATION FOR STUDY.         (a) Designation for Potential Addition.--Section 5(a) of       the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 U.S.C. 1276(a)) is amended       by adding at the end the following:        ``(__) Kissimmee river, florida.--The segment from the       southern shore of Lake Kissimmee to its confluence with Lake       Okeechobee.''.        (b) Study.--Section 5(b) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act       (16 U.S.C. 1276(b)) is amended by adding at the end the       following:        ``(__) Kissimmee river, florida.--        ``(A) In general.--Not later than 3 years after the date on       which funds are made available to carry out this paragraph,       the Secretary of the Interior shall complete a study of the       Kissimmee River, as described in subsection (a)(__), and       submit a report describing the results of such study to the       Committee on Natural Resources of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural       Resources of the Senate.        ``(B) Report requirements.--The report required under       subparagraph (A) shall--        ``(i) include a discussion of the effect of the designation       of the segment to be studied under subsection (a)(__) on--         ``(I) existing commercial and recreational activities, such       as cattle ranching, dairy production, hunting, fishing,       trapping, recreational shooting, motor boat use, or bridge       construction;        ``(II) the authorization, construction, operation,       maintenance, or improvement of energy production and       transmission infrastructure;        ``(III) military operations; and        ``(IV) the authority of State and local governments to       manage the activities described in subclauses (I) and (II);       and         ``(ii) identify--         ``(I) all authorities that will authorize or require the       Secretary of the Interior to influence local land use       decisions (such as zoning) or place restrictions on non-      Federal land if the area studied under subsection (a)(__) is       designated under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act;  [[Page H3323]]         ``(II) all authorities that the Secretary of the Interior       may use to condemn property if the area studied under       subsection (a)(__) is designated under the Wild and Scenic       Rivers Act; and        ``(III) all private property located in the area to be       studied under subsection (a)(__).         ``(C) Noninterference.--This study shall not interfere with       the Kissimmee River Restoration Project authorized under       section 101(8) of the Water Resources Development Act of 1992       (Public Law 102-580).''.        (c) No Negative Impact.--Nothing authorized by this Act may       negatively impact agricultural production in the Kissimmee       River basin.        (d) No Effect on Management.--This Act and the amendments       made by this Act shall not interfere with the current       management of the area of the Kissimmee River described in       section 5(a)(__) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, nor shall       the fact that such area is listed for study under the Wild       and Scenic Rivers Act (16 U.S.C. 1271 et seq.) be used as       justification for more restrictive management, such as       wilderness or as a category of wild and scenic river, until       Congress acts on the study recommendations.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3961 would designate the Kissimmee River for study  for potential addition to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.   I must admit, I have become highly skeptical of wild and scenic  designations on our rivers after I watched the Merced River's  designation used as an excuse to severely restrict traditional  recreational amenities at Yosemite National Park in my district,  including bicycling, horseback riding, river rafting, lodging, and many  other amenities that long predated the wild and scenic designation. The  iconic Curry Village Skating Rink was lost to these restrictions.   Not only are the designations used to severely restrict public access  and to restrict the enjoyment of the public's lands, even the existence  of a study has often been used as an excuse to forbid longstanding and  traditional enjoyment of these rivers.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the bill's author, Mr. Soto, for agreeing to  amendments that will assure that the conduct of the study authorized by  this measure cannot be used as justification for any restrictions on  the public's use of the Kissimmee.                                time  1715    It should be very clearly understood that, with this bill, Congress  is authorizing a study and nothing else. In no way is it authorizing  any restriction on the public's use of this land while it is being  studied or because it is being studied.   Any further actions forthcoming from the result of this study is for  the Congress and the Congress alone to decide.   With that very clear understanding, I support adoption of the  measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 146) to take certain Federal lands in Tennessee into trust  for the benefit of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 146         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(f) Right of Entry.--The lands subject to this Act shall be       subject to a reasonable right of entry by the personnel of       the Tennessee Valley Authority and agents of the Tennessee       Valley Authority operating in their official capacities as       necessary for purposes of carrying out the Tennessee Valley       Authority's statutory program for river control and       development.        (g) Entry Onto Land.--To the extent that the Tennessee       Valley Authority's operations on the lands subject to this       Act do not unreasonably interfere with the Eastern Band of       Cherokee Indians' maintenance of an appropriate setting for       the memorialization of Cherokee history or culture on the       lands and its operations on the lands, the Eastern Band of       Cherokee Indians shall allow the Tennessee Valley Authority       to enter the lands to clear, ditch, dredge, and drain said       lands and apply larvicides and chemicals thereon or to       conduct bank protection work and erect structures necessary       in the promotion and furtherance of public health, flood       control, and navigation.        (h) Loss of Hydropower Capacity.--All future development of       the lands subject to this Act shall be subject to       compensation to the Tennessee Valley Authority for loss of       hydropower capacity as provided in the Tennessee Valley       Authority Flood Control Storage Loss Guideline, unless agreed       to otherwise by the Tennessee Valley Authority.        (i) Protection From Liability.--The United States shall not       be liable for any loss or damage resulting from--        (1) the temporary and intermittent flooding of lands       subject to this Act;        (2) the permanent flooding of adjacent lands as provided in       this section;        (3) wave action in Tellico Reservoir; or        (4) fluctuation of water levels for purposes of managing       Tellico Reservoir.        (j) Continuing Responsibilities.--The Tennessee Valley       Authority shall--        (1) retain sole and exclusive Federal responsibility and       liability to fund and implement any environmental remediation       requirements that are required under applicable Federal or       State law for any land or interest in land to be taken into       trust under this Act, as well as the assessments under       paragraph (2) to identify the type and quantity of any       potential hazardous substances on the lands;        (2) prior to the acquisition in trust, carry out an       assessment and notify the Secretary of the Interior and the       Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians whether any hazardous       substances were stored on the lands and, if so, whether those       substances--        (A) were stored for 1 year or more on the lands;        (B) were known to have been released on the lands; or        (C) were known to have been disposed of on the lands; and        (3) if the assessment under paragraph (2) shows that       hazardous substances were stored, released, or disposed of on       the lands, include in its notice under paragraph (2) to the       Secretary of the Interior and the Eastern Band of Cherokee       Indians--        (A) the type and quantity of such hazardous substances;        (B) the time at which such storage, release, or disposal       took place on the lands; and        (C) a description of any remedial actions, if any, taken on       the lands.       SEC. 6. LANDS SUBJECT TO THE ACT.         For the purposes of this Act, the term ``lands subject to       this Act'' means lands and interests in lands (including       easements) taken into trust for the benefit of the Eastern       Band of Cherokee Indians pursuant to or under this Act.       SEC. 7. GAMING PROHIBITION.         No class II or class III gaming, as defined in the Indian       Gaming Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.), shall be       conducted on lands subject to this Act.   [[Page H3325]]      Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Band Eastern of Cherokee Indians is a relatively  small Tribe located in the Great Smoky Mountains of western North  Carolina and is headquartered in Cherokee, North Carolina. The Tribe's  reservation covers over 51,000 acres in a region known as the Qualla  Boundary.   After the completion of the Tellico Dam in Loudon County, Tennessee,  in 1979, the Tribe continued in active communication with the Tennessee  Valley Authority on any areas impacted that the Tribe believed was of  historical significance to them.   H.R. 146 would place approximately 96 acres of Tennessee Valley  Authority land in Monroe County, Tennessee, along the shores of the  Little Tennessee River and Tellico Reservoir into trust for the benefit  of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians.   Gaming pursuant to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act would be  prohibited. Most of the parcels to be placed in trust under this bill  will be used for memorializing and interpreting the history of the  Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, and the remaining parcels will be  used for recreational trails.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Fleischmann), the author of this  measure, a tireless advocate for the State of Tennessee.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I ask for adoption of the measure, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 443) to direct the Secretary of the Interior to study the  suitability and feasibility of designating the James K. Polk Home in  Columbia, Tennessee, as a unit of the National Park System, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 443         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``James K. Polk Presidential       Home Study Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds that--        (1) in 1961, the James K. Polk Home was designated as a       National Historic Landmark; and        (2) in April 2015, the National Park Service completed a       reconnaissance survey of the James K. Polk Home, in which the       National Park Service--        (A) determined that--        (i) the James K. Polk Home is conclusively nationally       significant; and        (ii) a special resource study is needed to fully analyze       the suitability, feasibility, and need for management of the       James K. Polk Home by the National Park Service; and        (B) recommended that Congress consider authorizing a       special resource study for the James K. Polk Home and       associated properties.       SEC. 3. STUDY.         (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Interior (referred to       in this Act as the ``Secretary'') shall conduct a special       resource study of the site of the James K. Polk Home in       Columbia, Tennessee, and adjacent property (referred to in       this Act as the ``site'').        (b) Criteria.--The Secretary shall conduct the study under       subsection (a) in accordance with section 100507 of title 54,       United States Code.        (c) Contents.--In conducting the study under subsection       (a), the Secretary shall--        (1) evaluate the national significance of the site;        (2) determine the suitability and feasibility of       designating the site as a unit of the National Park System;        (3) include cost estimates for any necessary acquisition,       development, operation, and maintenance of the site;        (4) consult with interested Federal, State, or local       governmental entities, private and nonprofit organizations,       or other interested individuals; and         (5) identify alternatives for the management,       administration, and protection of the site.        (d) Report.--Not later than 3 years after the date on which       funds are made available to carry out the study under       subsection (a), the Secretary shall submit to the Committee       on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives and the       Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate a       report that describes--        (1) the findings and conclusions of the study; and        (2) any recommendations of the Secretary.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, President James K. Polk lived in Columbia, Tennessee,  from 1819 until 1824. Other than the White House itself, the Columbia,  Tennessee, site is the only surviving residence of our 11th President.  It is the repository of many original artifacts from his life.   Although he served a single term, Polk left our Nation with a  remarkable legacy of public accomplishments, including expansion of our  Western territories and the establishment of the U.S. Naval Academy. My  home State of California owes him a particular debt of gratitude.   Indeed, he made four campaign promises and, in 4 years, he fulfilled  all four.   President Polk left office in 1849, and returned to Nashville,  Tennessee, where he lived for 3 months before his death.   The James K. Polk home in Columbia, Tennessee, was designated as a  national historic landmark in 1961. In April of 2015, the National Park  Service completed a reconnaissance survey of the home and determined  that the site warrants a special resource study.   H.R. 443 would authorize the special resource study of the James K.  Polk home to evaluate its national significance and the suitability and  feasibility for a potential designation of the area as a unit of the  National Park Service.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. DesJarlais), the author of this  measure and another tireless advocate for Tennessee.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Again, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. Hanabusa)  [[Page H3327]]  for her support, and I ask for adoption of the measure.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 167) to designate a National Memorial to Fallen Educators at  the National Teachers Hall of Fame in Emporia, Kansas.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 167         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``National Memorial to Fallen       Educators Act''.       SEC. 2. DESIGNATION.         (a) In General.--The memorial to fallen educators located       at the National Teachers Hall of Fame in Emporia, Kansas, is       designated as the ``National Memorial to Fallen Educators''.        (b) Effect of Designation.--The national memorial       designated by this section is not a unit of the National Park       System and the designation of the National Memorial to Fallen       Educators shall not require or permit Federal funds to be       expended for any purpose related to that national memorial.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 167 designates the existing memorial to fallen  educators at the National Teachers Hall of Fame in Emporia, Kansas, as  the National Memorial to Fallen Educators.   We all know the life-inspiring and life-changing role that teachers  play in each of our lives. I dare say that we, all of us, have had  teachers whose influence looms large through our lives because of  something they once did to inspire, motivate, or equip us for the lives  we lead through the decades that follow.   Often, their influence on us only becomes obvious as we look back on  their role in our lives through the perspective of the years, by which  time we have often lost them or lost touch with them. It is through  official acts like this before us today that we can express our  gratitude, if not individually, then collectively as a Nation.   I would also like to say, on a personal note, that our daughter,  Shannah, began her career as a first grade teacher, and her mother and  I couldn't be more proud of her.   The bill before us today is a small token of recognition to a small  group of teachers, who not only dedicated their lives to teaching, but  who gave their lives during the performance of their duties.   On June 12, 2014, the National Teachers Hall of Fame in Emporia,  Kansas, dedicated the memorial to the 119 educators who have lost their  lives while teaching since 1764.   This bill gives Federal recognition to this memorial, while retaining  it under the jurisdiction of the National Teachers Hall of Fame. No  taxpayer money will be used for it, and management will not be  transferred to the National Park Service. But the bill will give  official Federal recognition to it as a small token of respect and  appreciation from the American people.   I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   This concludes six bills, all bipartisan, that have been reported out  by the Natural Resources Committee today, and I think that is worthy of  note. I want to again thank my Democratic colleague, Ms. Hanabusa, for  her support and bipartisan cooperation on these measures. I urge  adoption of the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
