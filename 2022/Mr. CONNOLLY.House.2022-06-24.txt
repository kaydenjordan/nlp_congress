 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairman who has  done so much on this issue for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2938, the Bipartisan Safer  Communities Act.   More than 15 years ago, I was chairman of Fairfax County when the  Virginia Tech tragedy occurred. We buried six young people in my  community that week--six. I am still in touch with those families, and  the emptiness in their souls will never go away.   Today, we have an opportunity to choose: will we protect our  children, or will we continue to persist in an abstract ideological  commitment to an absolute reading of the Second Amendment which is  false, and a false reading of the Constitution.   We can do something finally. America demands we do something. We need  to disenthrall ourselves from the gun mythology and do the right thing:  protecting our communities and our children.
