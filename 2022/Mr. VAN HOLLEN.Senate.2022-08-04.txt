 Mr. President, I was just listening to the majority  leader outline some of the disastrous policies that Republicans have  proposed to make, including putting Medicare on the chopping block by  making it discretionary.   I want to talk a little bit about the good things that Democrats have  done, some on a bipartisan basis and some which it looks like we are  going to have to do alone for the American people. In just the last few  weeks, this U.S. Senate has made historic progress tackling a number of  very real and very urgent challenges that our country faces.   We passed the first major gun reform bill in 30 years. We passed  historic legislation to boost American manufacturing of essential  semiconductor chips--important to our economy and our national  security. We passed the PACT Act so that veterans exposed to toxins  will get the care they deserve. Just yesterday, we voted to admit  Finland and Sweden as new members of NATO, therefore expanding and  strengthening the Atlantic alliance in the face of Putin's brutal war  against Ukraine.   These are major accomplishments, but now is not the time to rest on  our laurels, now is not the time to coast, because we have to do  everything we can to fight back against rising prices, against  inflation, which has been driven in recent months by what I call the  three p's: Putin's war and its impact on energy and food prices; the  pandemic and the supply chain disruptions it has caused; and price  gouging by big oil companies that are reaping record profits. Those  have been big drivers of inflation.   I have listened to my Republican Senate colleagues here on the floor  week after week trying to exploit inflation as a campaign issue, as if  it were all caused by the policies of President Biden. The American  people know much better. They also know that while Republicans are  talking up inflation and talking down the economy, we in the Democratic  majority had a plan to do something about rising costs, and it is  called the Inflation Reduction Act.   In coming days, we are going to be voting on that, and I hope--I  hope--our Republican colleagues will have a change of heart, at least  some of them, because here is the bottom line: The Inflation Reduction  Act will drive down prices over time, it will reduce the deficit, and  it will do that without raising taxes on anyone making under $400,000 a  year, not by one dime. It does all that while addressing four major  issues facing our country: the need to lower healthcare costs, the need  to address the climate crisis, the need to fix parts of our broken tax  system--this is a start on that--and reducing the deficit.   First, on healthcare, all of us in this Chamber have known that the  costs of prescription drugs in the United States are way too high, out  of control. Our constituents--Americans--pay twice as much on  prescription drugs as people in other advanced economies around the  world. And it is not just squeezing people's pocketbooks--that, of  course, hurts--it is also jeopardizing their health.   If you look at the 2022 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, they  found that nearly one in three adults reported that they had not taken  their medications as prescribed due to cost. They were too expensive.  They couldn't afford them. That financial pressure is hard on  everybody. It is especially so on many of our seniors. Nearly 9 in 10  older adults take prescription medication, but millions of Americans 65  and older say they struggle to afford their medicine.   Here is what adds insult to injury: American taxpayers spend over $40  billion every year to support cutting-edge medical research happening  at the National Institutes of Health in my State of Maryland. That is a  great investment for our country. It helps discover and it helps  develop and produce many of the life-changing medications that are  available to American families today and to people around the world.  But it is just not right for American taxpayers to invest $40 billion a  year in developing drugs that are then sold by American pharmaceutical  companies here in the United States for two, three, four times as much  as they are sold overseas.   People throughout the world benefit from the great research done at  places like NIH, and they pay lower costs on the medicines developed  from that research than Americans who helped fund the research in the  first place. That is just not right. That is why the Inflation  Reduction Act finally empowers the Medicare Program to negotiate prices  with the pharmaceutical industry. Private insurance companies negotiate  volume discounts every day, all the time, to try to get a better deal  for their members. Why should we tie the hands of the Medicare Program?   I say ``finally'' because the Presiding Officer and I and many others  in this Chamber have worked for not just 1 or 2 years but for decades  to try to achieve this, and every time, the pharmaceutical industry has  succeeded in blocking it because if you take away the power of Medicare  to negotiate drug prices, it means they get to write the bill  themselves. So this is important.   It is also accompanied by a cap on Medicare Part D out-of-pocket  spending to $2,000 a year.   Last but not least, this legislation extends the important work we  achieved through the American Rescue Plan to lower the healthcare costs  for people who get their insurance through the affordable care  exchanges. In my State, Marylanders are saving an average of $80 every  month on their healthcare premiums because of that provision from the  American Rescue Plan, which this bill will extend for 3 more years.   We are joined in this effort by a vast coalition of Americans who  have been pushing for years to address prescription drug prices,  including AARP and its 38 million members who support this bill.   Meanwhile, we have seen some billion-dollar pharmaceutical companies  pouring their profits into negative ads to try to defeat this bill. In  fact, just last night, I saw two or three of them within the space of  about an hour as I was flipping channels at home. But I think the  country is pretty clear on what is at stake here. On the one hand, you  have tens and tens of millions of Americans who will benefit from  lowering the costs of prescription drugs. Yet you have Big Pharma  trying to maintain this privileged position where we don't have to  negotiate with them in order to boost their profits.   So let's be clear on what we are going to do. We are going to allow  Medicare to negotiate prices, and that will lower the costs for  seniors. We are capping out-of-pocket spending for seniors. We are  making it more affordable to get health insurance through the  Affordable Care Act marketplaces. Yet, right now, as of today, we have  every one of our Republicans voting no.   When I go around Maryland, this is not a party or a partisan issue.  All of my constituents want us to take this action. The same is true of  climate change. Most Americans, regardless of party, recognize the very  real harm caused by climate change. They just have to look around them  or turn on the news. But apparently, when you enter the Senate  Republican Cloakroom, you go into a science-free and fact-free zone.  Many of our colleagues still doubt the fact of human-caused climate  change. But that is out of touch with the American people, who see the  harm every day and also see the promise of developing a clean energy  industry.  [[Page S4007]]    That is why our legislation makes this big investment in more rapidly  deploying clean energy technology, and in doing so, we are projected to  cut U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by 40  percent by 2030. We should move even faster, but at least this gets us  in the game to hitting the targets that we have to. We will do that  while supercharging the development, manufacturing, and deployment of  wind, solar, and battery power.    I want to talk about a couple of provisions in this bill--there are  many--a couple that I have worked on over the years.   First, this bill includes what is called the Greenhouse Gas Reduction  Fund, $27 billion, some of which could support a national climate bank,  which is an initiative I have been working on since my time in the  House of Representatives and now in the Senate with my colleague Ed  Markey and in the House today with Congresswoman Debbie Dingell.   A national climate bank would be a magnet for private investment in  new sustainable technology, channeling more capital into the clean  energy space and lowering the risk to investors. For every $1 of public  financing through a national climate bank, we project it will draw in  $7 to $10 of private investment, to turbocharge investments and jobs in  clean energy. In addition, it targets a large share of investments to  low-income and disadvantaged communities that often lack access to  financing for clean energy and energy efficiency projects.   This bill also includes another provision I have worked on for a long  time, the bill I introduced called HOPE for HOMES. I have worked on it  with a bipartisan group of colleagues in both the House and Senate. In  the House, that includes Congressman Peter Welch and Congressman  Dave  McKinley and, here in the Senate, Senator Coons and Senator Shaheen.   The HOPE for HOMES legislation that has been incorporated into this  bill will provide Americans with sizable rebates and with tax credits  to retrofit their homes with clean energy and energy efficiency  technology. So it will not only help us meet our climate goals and our  pollution reduction goals, it is also going to save consumers up to  $750 every year on their heating and cooling bills. So we are going to  give people a rebate to make their homes more energy efficient, and  they will save money as a result.   It also invests in clean energy jobs training so that we have the  people power to help folks in every neighborhood around the country  access the help and the workers they need. It is estimated to help  generate 80,000 jobs over the next couple years in this important area.   The Inflation Reduction Act also includes major investments to  develop a clean energy manufacturing base to reduce our reliance on  foreign imports of clean energy products, including $30 billion in tax  credits designed to accelerate the manufacturing of solar panels, wind  turbines, batteries, and critical minerals right here in the United  States.   China has made it one of its goals--and they have been very open  about it--to dominate the clean energy technology space for years to  come. We need to make sure that we manufacture critical technologies  and products right here in the United States.   I want to give you a great example from my State of Maryland, which  is at the vanguard of a budding offshore wind industry. Right now, we  have two companies in Maryland--Orsted and U.S. Wind--that are building  new wind turbine fabrication centers in our State to support their  offshore wind farms coming to the mid-Atlantic--two major projects off  Maryland's Atlantic coast.   The Deputy Secretary of Commerce was just in Baltimore yesterday  talking about apprenticeship programs that will help support 10,000  jobs, 10,000 Maryland jobs, as part of this offshore wind  manufacturing. That is just in the State of Maryland, and we can do  that across the country in terms of offshore wind in coastal States  and, of course, interior wind for others.   These are really important provisions that I have talked about-- fighting the climate crisis, lowering the cost of prescription drugs-- so let's talk about how they are paid for.   Unlike the Republican tax bill in 2017, which provided huge tax  giveaways to big corporations and very wealthy individuals, this  legislation actually will both pay for itself through the cuts made and  recycled and through fixing parts of our broken tax system. We have a  lot of work to do to fix our tax system, but this is a downpayment in  terms of the policy changes in this bill.   First, we are going to beef up IRS enforcement to go after wealthy  tax cheats, and this is an important issue. I chair the subcommittee  that oversees the IRS, and we have been pushing for years to make sure  that the IRS has the resources and the expertise to track down taxes  that are already due and owing from very wealthy people who come up  with elaborate tax dodges.   Right now, we estimate there is anywhere from $500 billion to $1  trillion in taxes each year that are owed but not paid. Think about  that--up to $1 trillion every year in taxes that are owed but not paid,  and the people who are suckered are all the people who pay when you  have these very wealthy tax cheats skirting their responsibilities. So  this bill will address that issue.    Second, we make sure that big corporations invest in the success of  everyday Americans. In 2020, 55 huge American corporations paid zero-- zero--in taxes, despite a combined $40.5 billion in profits--$40.5  billion in profits from these 55 companies; zero taxes paid.   Small businesses across the country are paying their taxes while some  of these big corporations are not. That is not fair. It needs to  change.   That is why the Inflation Reduction Act includes the 15 percent  minimum tax on profits of corporations that have over $1 billion in  annual profits.   And I want to thank the Presiding Officer for his leadership on this  issue.   Third, our legislation would tighten the rules on what is known as  carried interest, which allows hedge fund managers to pay a lower rate  on their income than the rate their employees pay on theirs--the  classic example of how a big hedge fund CEO can pay a lower tax rate  than their receptionist. This is a fact under our current Tax Code, and  I hope we will keep this provision in this bill because this loophole,  the carried interest loophole, is Exhibit A of some of the biggest  unfairnesses in our Tax Code.   So taken together, the measures to lower the cost of prescription  drugs, lower the cost of energy to American households and consumers,  reduce the deficit--these measures will reduce inflationary pressures  that are bearing down on working families. You don't have to take my  word for it. In just the last few days, economists from all over the  country have spoken out in favor of this approach and supporting this  legislation.   One hundred twenty-six leading economists recently wrote to the  congressional leadership:         This proposal addresses some of the country's biggest       challenges at a significant scale. And because it is deficit-      reducing, it does so while putting downward pressure on       inflation.    And that is key. Unlike that Republican tax giveaway in 2017 that  added $2 trillion to our national debt, we are actually reducing our  deficit, and by reducing the deficit, you also put downward pressure on  inflation.   In recent months, I have heard the Republican leader, Senator  McConnell, often citing former Secretary of Treasury Larry Summers  about Larry Summers' views on the economy and inflation.   Well, here is what Larry Summers had to say recently about the bill  we will be voting on:         The prescription drug provisions, energy incentives, and       the increased Medicare benefits will all contribute over time       to much needed inflation reduction.    And just yesterday, former Secretary Summers was joined by former  Secretary of the Treasury Hank Paulson, who, of course, served under  former President George W. Bush, who with other Secretaries wrote:       . . . we support the Inflation Reduction Act which is       financed by prudent tax policy that will collect more from       top-earners and large corporations.    And, again, by using those revenues to reduce the deficit, we put  downward pressure on inflation.   I just, as we close here, want to contrast that to the approach that  Republicans took in 2017 with their tax giveaway.  [[Page S4008]]    As I said, that ballooned the deficit by $2 trillion. It also handed  the top 1 percent income earners an average tax cut of $69,000 each in  2018 alone. So just in 1 year, about a $70,000 tax cut to the top 1  percent. And the Congressional Budget Office estimated that 43 percent  of the growth in economic output from the 2017 tax law flowed to  foreign investors in that space. So foreign investors have holdings in  U.S. corporations. That tax cut to American corporations--yes, it  flowed to some very wealthy Americans, but a lot of it flowed offshore  to foreign investors.   So what we have seen from our colleagues across the aisle is big tax  cuts to corporations and the very wealthy, not just here at home but  benefiting others around the world, in contrast to this, which does ask  big corporations to pay their fair share--minimum of 15 percent--and  reduces the deficit as we invest in job creation and reduce prices here  at home.   So this is a win for families; it is a win for seniors; it is a win  for our planet, our economy. It is a win for the country.   So I hope as this debate goes forward, that we will focus on the  facts, listen to what it does, because this is a comprehensive piece of  legislation that does help us tackle some of the key priorities in  front of our country, and we are hearing that from our constituents  every day.   So I am proud to support this legislation. Let's get it done.   I yield the floor.
