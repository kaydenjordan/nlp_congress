 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss H.R. 2811, the Limit,  Save, Grow Act of 2023.   This bill is more proof of the Republicans' anti-American agenda. It  would create more water and air pollution nationwide. It would cost the  country trillions of dollars in taxes from corporations and the richest  1 percent. It would deny food assistance to hardworking American  families who need it. And it would deny American college students and  schoolchildren a quality education.   Republicans only care about budget cuts during Democratic  administrations. They said nothing when Donald Trump added $8 trillion  to the national debt. Thankfully, Democrats put people over politics.   President Biden's budget saves trillions of dollars and helps  American families. It benefits all Americans, and it is the plan we  need right now.                            ____________________
