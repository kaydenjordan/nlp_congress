 Madam Speaker, I rise with my Republican  colleagues in support of H.J. Res. 43.   Under the Obama administration's last-minute rule change to title X  funding, States like Texas are prevented from establishing criteria  that would eliminate abortion providers from receiving title X grant  money.   States have the right and responsibility to choose the health  providers that best provide and serve the needs of their moms and their  babies. During my time in the Texas Legislature, we used the  Alternatives to Abortion program.   This program provides low-income pregnant women and their babies care  items during pregnancy, and it also provides preventing information. It  also funds the counseling referral and pregnancy information hotline  and the Texas Pregnancy Care Network. Additionally, this program  supports groups in maternity homes, provides referrals to community and  social service programs like child care, and offers classes on life  skills, budgeting, parenting--yes, parenting--stress management, and  GED preparation.                                time  1415    Nationally, 13,000 federally qualified health centers and rural  health centers provide comprehensive healthcare services to low-income  moms and their babies.   In my district, the 14th Congressional District, over 30 clinics are  committed to our community, including moms and their babies. These  organizations do a terrific job of supporting women, and yes, their  babies, too.   We are not cutting funding. We are not cutting care. We are ensuring  that Federal health centers have the funds and the support they need to  give the women and the babies the care that they deserve.   I want to thank the gentlewoman from Tennessee for her efforts to  stand up for women and their babies.   Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).
