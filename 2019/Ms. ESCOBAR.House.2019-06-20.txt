 Mr. Chair, I thank Congressman Crow for yielding and for  his great work on this amendment.   Mr. Chair, the Census aims to count each person living in the United  States every 10 years. It is important that we get this count right  because the information helps determine a vast array of decisions, from  the number of congressional seats to the allocation of Federal dollars.   For example, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, my home  State of Texas stands to gain three congressional seats. These gains  will go a long way for Texans and help bring much-needed funds to every  community in the State, but we must ensure an accurate count.   With the administration's push to include a citizenship question on  the upcoming Census and scare Latino communities like mine into not  participating, this amendment underscores the fact that no personally  identifiable information can be shared.   This amendment will give all residents, regardless of their  immigration status, the confidence they need to answer the survey  questions freely and to know that their data will be kept safe and  secure.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.                                time  1030     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   On April 6, 2018, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions unveiled the  zero-tolerance prosecution policy, a memo directing U.S. Attorneys  along the southwest border to prosecute all improper entry cases  impacting thousands of migrants since its implementation.   My amendment would end this policy and restore prosecutorial  discretion at the Department of Justice. This amendment is necessary  because zero-tolerance is the center of the administration's cruel  family separation policy.   Under zero-tolerance, when an asylum-seeking family crosses the  border between a port of entry, parents are placed in DOJ custody while  they await their prosecution date. The child is then deemed  unaccompanied and placed in the custody of the Office of Refugee  Resettlement. At least 3,000 families that we know of have been  separated. Some children were literally ripped from their parents'  arms.   At the height of the family separation crisis last summer, the  President signed an executive order entitled: ``Affording Congress an  Opportunity to Address Family Separation.'' That was on June 20, 2018,  exactly 1 year ago today. However, this executive order does not end  zero-tolerance. Instead, the executive order favored family detention-- possibly indefinitely--over release.   I have seen the consequences of family separation firsthand in my  community. Before zero-tolerance was implemented, the administration  used El Paso as a testing ground for these horrific family separations  in the fall of 2017. During this pilot program, 281 families were  separated. The American Association of Pediatrics tells us that  separating children from their parents  [[Page H4932]]  is highly damaging and can cause long-term health consequences from  toxic stress.   These children are suffering emotionally and physically as a result  of this government. We must put an end to this cruelty and work on  reuniting all of those who remain separated.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Serrano).    Mr. Chair, I have no further speakers. I would just urge  all of my colleagues to come to my community to see for themselves the  impact of this horrific policy.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time
