 Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Librarian  Refugee Immigration Fairness Act. I am pleased to be joined in this  effort by Senators Whitehouse, Durbin, Klobuchar, Smith, Cardin, and  Van Hollen.   In 1989, a seven-year civil war broke out in Liberia that claimed the  lives of over 200,000 people, displaced over half of the Liberian  population, halted food production, and destroyed the country's  infrastructure and economy. A second civil war then followed from 1999  to 2003, further destabilizing the country and creating more turmoil  and hardship for its people. Then from 2014 to 2016, Liberia faced an  Ebola virus outbreak that devastated the country's fragile health  system and killed nearly 5,000 people. As a result of these tragedies,  thousands of Liberians sought refuge in the United States, living and  working here under the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred  Enforced Departure (DED) systems, extended under both Republican and  Democratic administrations beginning in 1991.   The reality is that for more than a quarter of a century, the United  States has been home to law-abiding and taxpaying Liberians. They fled  violence, turmoil, and disease to come here. Many now have children who  are American citizens, some of whom serve in the Armed Forces. They  have worked hard, played by the rules, paid their dues, and submitted  to rigorous vetting.   But now, as a result of President Trump's decision to terminate DED  for Liberians, this population could face the risk of deportation on  March 31st. Uprooting them now would be cruel and harmful to them,  their families, employers, and communities.   And while things are improving on the ground in Liberia, following  the first democratic transition of power in decades, there are still  serious concerns about the country's stability and ability to maintain  peace and deliver essential services to its population. So though few  in number, the influx of Liberians from the United States could  overburden the country's limited infrastructure and reverse the  progress that the Liberian people and government have made.   Given these challenges, we believe that it is in the national  security, foreign policy, and humanitarian interest of the United  States for this population to remain here. I have introduced the  Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act in every Congress since 1999  because this community deserves a long-term solution after decades of  uncertainty. This bill provides legal status and a pathway to  citizenship for qualifying Liberians. I have worked with several of my  colleagues over the years to include this pathway in comprehensive  immigration reform bills that passed this body only to die in the House  of Representatives.   The Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act would end the perpetual  limbo for Liberians here in the United States and ensure our security  interests in fostering Liberia's continuing postwar and post-Ebola  recovery. This legislation offers much-needed certainty for the  Liberian community, and it should be part of any bipartisan and  comprehensive solution for our broken immigration system. I thank  Senators Whitehouse, Durbin, Klobuchar, Smith, Cardin, and Van Hollen  for cosponsoring this bill and urge our colleagues to join us to  finally provide a pathway to citizenship for eligible Liberians who  contribute so much to our American community.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Ms. Duckworth):   S. 458. A bill to require the Administrator of the Environmental  Protection Agency to revise certain ethylene oxide emissions standards  under the Clean Air Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on  Environment and Public Works.
