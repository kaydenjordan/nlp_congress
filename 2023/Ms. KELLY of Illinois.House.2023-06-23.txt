 Mr. Speaker, I rise today for Tori Bowie. Tori  was once called the fastest woman in the world. She dazzled before  international crowds with her remarkable speed on the track. She  brought home Olympic medals. She was a role model for young Black girls  who were just learning how to lace up their sneakers.   Tori was just 32 years old when she was taken from us. She was 8  months pregnant. She passed away due to complications that included  respiratory distress and eclampsia.   Eclampsia is a rare and severe complication of preeclampsia. Multiple  studies have shown that Black women are disproportionately at risk for  preeclampsia.   Tori's story is unfortunately not unique. A Black woman can be well- off, well-educated, and well-connected, and she is still more likely to  die from pregnancy or childbirth complications. This is a crisis.   Black mothers and babies are dying at intolerable rates. Every woman  deserves the best quality of maternal care, no matter what they look  like or where they come from.   I urge my colleagues to honor Tori's memory by committing ourselves  to ending the Black maternal mortality crisis. Action is our only  option.                            ____________________
