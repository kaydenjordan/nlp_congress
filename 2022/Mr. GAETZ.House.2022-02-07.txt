 Mr. Speaker, while the Biden administration, the media,  and many in Congress beat the drums of war for Ukraine, there is a far  more significant threat to our Nation accelerating rapidly close to  home.   Argentina, a critical nation and economy in the Americas, has just  lashed itself to the Chinese Communist Party by signing on to the One  Belt, One Road Initiative.   The cost to China was $23.7 billion, a mere fraction of a rounding  error when compared to the trillions of dollars our country has spent  trying to build democracies out of sand and blood in the Middle East.   China buying influence and infrastructure in Argentina to collaborate  on space and nuclear energy is a direct challenge to the Monroe  Doctrine, and far more significant to American security than our latest  NATO flirtation in the plains of Eastern Europe.   China is a rising power. Russia is a declining power. Let us sharpen  our focus so that we do not join them in that eventual fate.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   For the fourth consecutive year I rise as one of the few but faithful  Republicans in strong support of this good legislation.   Here is the question presented: Should sexual harassers who work for  big businesses get to pick their juries in advance? I think that the  populist, nationalist, right approach is to believe that the Article  III courts that we have set up for any and all function as the proper  venue.   But for tens of millions of American workers, that courthouse door is  locked. It is closed. It is inaccessible. The result is that a system  exists for concierge justice, private-sector justice.   The evidence before the Judiciary Committee undeniably is that big  business wins more cases, shuts down more awards, and is able to reduce  awards in the arbitration setting as opposed to the setting that  anybody else would be able to enter in a taxpayer-funded court. That is  wrong.   We have all heard about the fine print in this country. No one reads  the fine print. But the fine print shouldn't be a reason that someone  is more likely to have to endure sexual harassment in the workplace or  more likely to evade consequence as the result of predatory behavior.   I especially thank the majority for incorporating a number of the  minority's views to make this bill stronger and more likely to become  law, and I sincerely hope that I am not here for a fifth year  advocating for its passage again.
