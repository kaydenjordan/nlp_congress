 Madam Speaker, 1 year ago, this body and our Nation lost  one of its brightest lights with the passing of an extraordinary  congresswoman and my dear friend, Louise Slaughter.   I first came to know Louise in the early 1980s when we served  together in the New York State Assembly. We remained close until her  passing on March 16, 2018. While I will always miss her presence, her  legacy lives on in many, many ways.   It lives on in the renaming of the STOCK Act, an effort that I was  proud to sponsor last Congress.   Louise's legacy lives on in the Fairport post office, renamed after  Louise and her husband, Bob, a fitting tribute to a loving couple. I  thank my colleague, Joe Morelle, for making that happen.   Her legacy lives in the Rochester train station, named after Louise  after years of her advocacy and determination to make it an improved  destination and a special place of connection.   Most importantly, her legacy lives in the freshman class of this  United States House of Representatives. Louise used to represent Seneca  Falls and was proud of the women's rights movement that had its  strongest, deepest roots in upstate New York.   This year, more than 100 women serve in this body for the first time  in American history. Of course, if Louise were here, she would surely  remind us that 100 is much less than half of 435 and that our work was  far from over.   Madam Speaker, to my friend, Louise, our thoughts and prayers are  with her as we mark 1 year since her passing. Today, we celebrate an  incredible legacy, a legacy that is alive and burning bright with hope.                            ____________________
