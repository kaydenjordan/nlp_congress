 Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a  beloved pastor, an inspirational leader, and a lion for justice: Bishop  Douglas Miles. He passed away on August 3 of this year at the age of  72, and I would like to take this time to honor his life and his  legacy.   Bishop Miles was a lifelong Marylander, born in Baltimore City and  raised in Lafayette Courts in East Baltimore. By the time he entered  Johns Hopkins University as an undergraduate, he had determined that he  would become a doctor and set out to earn his medical degree. He wanted  to serve the weak and heal the sick. It was an auspicious career choice  because, while he eventually switched majors and earned his degree in  humanistic studies, Bishop Miles would commit five decades of his life  to serving and to healing communities across Baltimore.   He first embarked on that mission by helping to found the  organization Baltimoreans United in Leadership Development, or BUILD,  where he served as cochair. In this role, Bishop Miles fought to build  a better and stronger Baltimore for all by expanding job opportunities,  supporting schools, strengthening neighborhoods, and improving housing.  His efforts to force real action on housing at BUILD resulted in the  construction of at least 767 affordable homes throughout the city over  a 14-year span, and his leadership was pivotal in revitalizing the  Oliver neighborhood in East Baltimore after a tragic fire that claimed  seven lives.   When he wasn't pushing for progress with BUILD and the many other  organizations he helped lead, including the Industrial Areas  Foundation, the College Bound Foundation, and the Johns Hopkins BLocal  initiative, he was running his beloved Koinonia Baptist Church, which  he founded in 1992. As pastor, he used his gift for oratory and his  deep religious faith to guide his congregation with spirit and grace.  He was a titanic force, who could command an audience with equal vigor  at the pulpit, the podium, and the policy table.   But regardless of whether he was delivering a sermon on the  scriptures or leading a rally for social change, Bishop Miles always  spoke his mind and lived his values fully. Just a few weeks ago, I met  with him and a group of advocates about how to close the racial  homeownership gap in this country and help every American achieve their  full potential. He dedicated his life to holding the powerful to  account and raising the voices of those who had too often been left out  and left behind. I was honored to work with him over the years to  strengthen our healthcare system, expand access to affordable housing,  and prevent teen tobacco use, and I am forever grateful for his  leadership on a host of other issues from gun violence to education to  public safety to immigration. His dedication to the causes he held dear  left an indelible mark on our communities, and you can find proof of  his lifelong service in the countless lives he changed for the better  throughout Baltimore City.   He is gone too soon, but his legacy and his spirit live on in all the  Marylanders he helped shape and inspire, both as a faith leader and as  an advocate for justice. Bishop Miles taught all of us what it means to  live a life dedicated to serving your community, and it is a lesson we  must never forget. In living, he inspired a generation to fight harder  for those in need. In passing, his memory will continue to push future  generations to serve and to heal, as he did.                            ____________________
