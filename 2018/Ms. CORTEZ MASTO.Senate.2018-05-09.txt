 Mr. President, I am proud to stand with my good  colleague from New Hampshire and all of my colleagues today in defense  of net neutrality.   Net neutrality has leveled the playing field for every American  consumer, allowing everyone to access and enjoy an open internet.  Thanks to the internet provided by schools and public libraries,  students have been able to utilize information available online to  enhance their education or help them do their homework.   I have heard from librarians and library administrators from all  across Nevada expressing their concerns about the direct negative  impact net neutrality's repeal would have on Nevadans. They told me  that repealing net neutrality would hamper their ability to provide  Nevadans with essential services. According to the Pew Research Center,  ``Library users who take advantage of libraries' computers and internet  connections are more likely to be young, black, female, and lower  income.''   In Nevada, I know students who don't have access to internet at home  now go to the library to do their homework. Nevadans applying for jobs  currently use the internet in public libraries to connect with  employers to submit resumes and job applications. Many Nevadans use the  internet and internet access to learn new skills through training  resources that are available online.   In November of last year, I received a letter from the Las Vegas- Clark County Library District strongly opposing the repeal of net  neutrality. The Las Vegas-Clark County Library District is the largest  in the State and serves over 1.6 million people. The letter reads:         Many of our customers, even in the urban areas of the       county, are not able to afford access to the internet at       their homes at all, and rely on public libraries to complete       their school work, research information about starting small       businesses, and whatever else they need to do on the       internet.    Limiting the ability of public libraries to provide fast, reliable  internet service means limiting opportunities for Nevadans to thrive.   Through simple online marketing or by using online sales platforms,  small businesses have the opportunity to improve their visibility and  expand their customer base.   It has become possible for startup companies to get a fair chance at  competing in highly saturated markets because of internet  accessibility.   It is true in Nevada and all across the country that the internet has  opened doors for jobs, businesses, education, innovation, and  technology, and net neutrality protections have allowed the country to  continue opening those doors.   As access to the internet has exploded, more and more Americans have  been empowered to start their own business ventures. More specifically,  there has been a sharp growth in women business owners due in large  part to a freely accessible, fair and open internet.   As you have heard, between 2007 and 2016, women-owned firms grew at a  rate of five times the national average, mirroring the emergence of the  internet as a platform for economic growth. For example, Etsy, an  online shopping platform, caters to small businesses, 87 percent of  which are owned by women.   Just last week, I held a roundtable in Reno with women entrepreneurs.  One of their biggest concerns was the repeal of net neutrality and how  that would adversely affect their business's profitability and success.   With net neutrality's repeal, business owners, like Katie, who  cofounded a tech company in Reno, would have to go up against large  corporations that can afford to buy faster internet speeds. This would  stifle competition, and it would cripple the growth of small businesses  like hers. Katie told me:         It would really be a stifling situation for us, not only       financially, but from an innovation standpoint. Your dollars       have to go to furthering your business, not paying to deliver       it.    Nevada's economic growth depends on the small business owners, like  Katie, who invest in our communities, and that is why we can't afford  to repeal net neutrality.   Chairman Pai's misguided decision to repeal net neutrality  protections threatens to change the internet as we know it. It  threatens our small businesses, access to online education, job growth,  and innovation by giving those who can afford to pay more the ability  to set their own rules.   Nevada's small businesses, local hospitals, public libraries, and  disadvantaged communities, among many others, will bear the burden as  they become subject to the whims of broadband providers that now have  the ability to elevate their own content and pick and choose which  websites Nevadans can have access to.   The FCC has a longstanding responsibility of protecting American  consumers and the public interest. While Chairman Pai refuses to  properly do his job, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of the CRA  and stand with all Americans, regardless of their income.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
