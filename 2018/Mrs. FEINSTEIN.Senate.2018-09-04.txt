 Mr. President, today I wish to oppose the nomination  of Elad Roisman to be a Member of the Securities and Exchange  Commission, SEC.   Members of the SEC are charged with the critical tasks of protecting  investors and their hard-earned savings and ensuring that capital  markets are fair and transparent.   In the aftermath of the worst financial crisis since the Great  Depression, these responsibilities are more important now than ever  before.   That is why the Senate must confirm SEC Commissioners who have  learned the lessons of the financial crisis and will prioritize  investor protections and maintaining a fair marketplace for all.   Unfortunately, I am not confident that Mr. Roisman fits the bill.   As the majority chief counsel for the Senate Banking Committee, Mr.  Roisman was instrumental in developing legislation that rolled back  essential rules put in place after the financial crisis to protect  consumers and help prevent another crisis from occurring.   According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, passing  that legislation into law has increased the probability that a large  bank will fail or that another financial crisis will occur.   During the last financial crisis, more than 2 million Californians  were unemployed, and nearly 200,000 Californians filed for bankruptcy.   We simply cannot return to that time, and Mr. Roisman's work on the  Dodd-Frank rollback bill should raise concerns about his commitment to  protecting consumers and promoting fair markets.   In addition, the manner in which Mr. Roisman's nomination has  proceeded breaks with a longstanding Senate tradition to confirm SEC  nominees in bipartisan pairs.   The President has yet to nominate a replacement for a Democratic  Commissioner whose term expired in June 2017 and is slated to step down  later this year.   I believe the Senate should follow its tradition of waiting until the  President nominates a Democratic Commissioner before advancing Mr.  Roisman, a conservative pick, in the Senate.   Proceeding in a bipartisan fashion is critical for ensuring that no  President can stack independent agencies like the SEC with a large  partisan majority.   For these reasons, I must regretfully vote no on Mr. Roisman's  confirmation.                            ____________________
