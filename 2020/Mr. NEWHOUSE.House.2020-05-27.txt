 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the career of  Rick Beck, a teacher who has shaped the future of foreign language  learning in the Yakima Valley.   Drawing from German culture and his own high school experience, Rick  developed a nationally-recognized German language program in the West  Valley School District.   Through years of hard work and curriculum development, Mr. Beck  created bonds with his students, teaching them about language, leading  exchange trips to help them better understand German culture, and  inspiring several to pursue higher education in German linguistics and  international relations.   In November 2019, West Valley High School and German teacher Rick  Beck were recognized by the American Association of Teachers of German  as a German Center of Excellence, a crowning achievement of Rick's  career.   Now, as Rick enters into retirement, his legacy and the language  program he developed will continue to inspire students at West Valley  High School and beyond.   I thank Rick for his service and commitment to students across the  globe. I wish him the best in his retirement.                            ____________________
