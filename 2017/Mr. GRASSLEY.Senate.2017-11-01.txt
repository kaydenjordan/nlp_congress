 Mr. President, it is my understanding that I have 25  minutes.    Mr. President, I would like to address the issue we are  voting on in a few minutes. The Senate will vote on the nomination of  Michigan Supreme Court Justice Joan Larsen to serve on the Sixth  Circuit Court of Appeals.   Though she currently lives in Michigan, Justice Larsen was born in  and hails from my State of Iowa. In fact, she and I share the same alma  mater, the University of Northern Iowa, for our bachelor's degrees. I  have also learned, since meeting Justice Larsen, that her father was  the longtime CEO of the Lutheran Services in Iowa. He is now retired,  but during the time he was the CEO, he was the very same person with  whom I often met for breakfast when he would come to Washington to tell  us about the concerns of the Lutheran Services in Iowa. At that time, I  never knew I might be speaking in favor of his daughter. I didn't even  know of his daughter at that time. So I am proud to see a fellow Iowan  and such an eminently qualified nominee be nominated to the Sixth  Circuit Court of Appeals.   For those who may not be familiar with her career and  accomplishments, a few minutes will give me an opportunity to share  them with you. I think you will find, as I have, that Justice Larsen is  particularly well suited to serve as a Federal appellate judge.   Justice Larsen has an outstanding academic record, having received  numerous awards during her undergraduate and law school careers.  Justice Larsen was a Presidential Scholar at the University of Northern  Iowa and graduated with the highest honors. She graduated first in her  class at the Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law, where she  won the Justice John Paul Stevens Award for Academic Excellence and  served as editor of the Northwestern University Law Review.   She began her legal career as a clerk for Judge Sentelle on the DC  Circuit Court of Appeals and then clerked for Justice Scalia on the  U.S. Supreme Court. Following her clerkships, Justice Larsen joined the  DC firm of Sidley Austin, one of the largest law firms in the United  States. Justice Larsen spent 2 years as Deputy Assistant Attorney  General for the Office of Legal Counsel, where she provided legal  advice to the President and executive agencies on difficult issues of  constitutional and statutory interpretation.   Justice Larsen has taught constitutional law and criminal law at the  University of Michigan Law School since 1998, where she has earned the  respect of faculty members and students alike. She won the L. Hart  Wright Award for Excellence in Teaching early in her teaching career.  In addition to her teaching responsibilities, Justice Larsen ran  Michigan's clerkship program, helping hundreds of students and alumni  pursue clerkships at the Federal and State levels. As an adjunct  professor, she continues to run the law school's Moot Court Program.   Her colleagues at the University of Michigan praised Justice Larsen  and wrote:         Even among the talented and ambitious lawyers at an elite       law school, Joan stands out for her ability to make the       penetrating insight that untangles some knotty problem of       statutory interpretation or judiciary doctrine. Especially       distinctive, moreover, is the rigor and even-handedness she       brings to her analysis.    I will share one more example from that letter because I think it  addresses some of my colleagues' concerns, who are on the other side of  the aisle, as to her approach to the law.   Her colleagues wrote:         For those of us who have found ourselves on the opposite       side of a debate with Joan about a case, a statute, or some       broader issue of constitutional history, she has demonstrated       time and again that she is both a gracious and intellectually       honest partner in the collaborative project of figuring       things out. What matters for Joan is not winning but working       out the right answer.    Now I bring emphasis to this last sentence.         Even when you disagree with her, it is impossible not to       respect her and to take pleasure in the process of refining       the issues actually in dispute.    In other words, as I see it, Justice Larsen is and will be a jurist  who seeks to find the right answer, never simply one she prefers as a  matter of policy.   We can already see from her time on the Michigan Supreme Court that  Justice Larsen is a principled jurist with an impressive legal acumen.  She has served with distinction on that court since she was appointed  in 2015. It happens that she was elected to the position in 2016, in  her own right, by a resounding majority, winning every county in  Michigan. Colleagues on the court have praised her sharp legal  analysis, her clear and crisp writing, and, most importantly, her work  ethic.   Outside the courtroom, Justice Larsen is actively involved in  volunteer efforts to serve disadvantaged children, and she works with  Michigan's veterans, drugs, sobriety, and mental health court programs.   Some of my colleagues have said they will not support the nomination  [[Page S6944]]  because Justice Larsen was included on President Trump's short list for  the Supreme Court. Is there anything wrong with the President  suggesting whom he is going to put on the Supreme Court if he is  elected President? If you look at her background, it should be no  surprise that she was included on that list. She is an accomplished  legal academic, a mainstream jurist, and is well respected on a  bipartisan basis throughout the legal community.   Because my colleagues have been concerned about everyone on that  list, at her hearing, I asked Justice Larsen when she learned that her  name was on that list. She replied: ``The date it was announced . . .  it was a complete surprise to me.''   I also asked her about judicial independence and whether she could  rule against the President who nominated her.   She replied:         I would have no trouble ruling against the President who       appointed me or any successor President as well. Judicial       independence means one thing, one very simple thing--    At this point I want to emphasize--       and that is putting the law above everything else, the       statutes passed by this body, and the Constitution of the       United States. So I would have absolutely no trouble, and,       indeed, that would be my duty.    Here is the most outrageous reason I have heard for voting against  Justice Larsen. This should surprise a lot of people. Some in the  minority have suggested that she is somehow responsible for outside  groups running ads that support her nomination in Michigan. The claim  that she is responsible for the action of an outside group is  ridiculous, and the allegation that these ads are in some way a  guarantee of how she will rule in the future is the most absurd thing I  have heard based upon her answers to my questions.   I find it interesting that my colleagues who are complaining about  conservative groups do not seem to have the same concern for groups on  the left that are spending money in opposition to these nominees. One  such group, Alliance for Justice, routinely issues reports and press  releases on judicial nominees. Oftentimes, these so-called reports put  forward incendiary and false criticisms of these nominees. My  colleagues even make the same incendiary attacks against the nominees  as these outside groups do. In other words, they use the same talking  points. I do not hear that my colleagues on the other side are up in  arms about their spending millions of dollars to oppose nominees.   Of course, some may remember that last year groups on the left  coordinated attacks on this Senator. I was followed all over Iowa by  these groups and their members. They ran ads against me and put up  billboards that opposed my election, and that had something to do with  the Supreme Court, as one might recall. I don't remember hearing any of  my colleagues on the other side of the aisle complain about all of the  money those groups were spending at that time.   As I have said before, I expect that outside groups on the left and  on the right want to have their voices heard in the nomination process.  Isn't that something to do with what we call democracy, representative  government, freedom of speech, freedom of association? There is nothing  wrong with that, whether it is done by the right or the left, but I  take issue with complaints from the other side that do not acknowledge  that all sides have interest groups that are spending and engaging in  the judicial nomination process. It was completely appropriate for  Justice Larsen not to wade in on the political debate regarding those  political ads. Her answers to those questions were exactly what I would  expect an independent nominee to say, particularly if she wants to be  independent of any President who appoints her when she is appointed to  the bench.   Justice Larsen's nomination is supported by a broad and diverse  coalition of lawyers, judges, and academic colleagues. It is easy to  see why, for she is an accomplished and well-respected academic. She is  a brilliant and independent jurist. Her careful and well-reasoned legal  analysis puts her squarely within the mainstream of legal thought. I  urge my colleagues, in a few minutes, to vote for her nomination.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I yield back all time.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, tomorrow morning the Senate will vote on  the nomination of Colorado Supreme Court Justice Allison Eid. She is  going to be voted on to serve on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.  She is an eminently qualified and exceptional nominee who has received  widespread, bipartisan praise and support.   Justice Eid has spent over a decade on the Colorado Supreme Court.  Before her appointment, she served as the Colorado State solicitor  general. In that role, she represented the State before both Federal  and State courts. She also served as a tenured faculty member at the  University of Colorado School of Law, where she taught courses in  constitutional law, legislation, and torts. Justice Eid practiced  commercial and appellate litigation at Arnold and Porter. At the  beginning of her legal career, Justice Eid served as a clerk for Judge  Jerry Smith on the Fifth Circuit and as a law clerk for Supreme Court  Justice Clarence Thomas.   Justice Eid was raised by a single mother, whom Eid credits for her  significant personal and professional achievements. She earned a  scholarship to Stanford and graduated with distinction and is a member  of Phi Beta Kappa. Justice Eid received her law degree from the  University of Chicago, where she graduated with high honors and Order  of the Coif. She has had an impressive legal career, and she has an  impressive life story.   In her long and celebrated tenure on the Colorado Supreme Court,  Justice Eid has heard roughly 900 cases and written approximately 100  opinions. In 2008, 75 percent of Colorado voters retained Justice Eid  to the Colorado Supreme Court.   Her nomination has also received wide, bipartisan support. As an  example, Justice Eid's former clerks, who noted that they ``come from a  diverse set of geographic, economic, cultural and political  backgrounds,'' wrote a letter to the Judiciary Committee supporting her  nomination. Judges work closely with their law clerks every day. Law  clerks understand a judge's deliberative process and approach to the  law better than anyone. How did these clerks describe Justice Eid? They  said: ``She never fails to provide her full attention and dedication to  each individual case, mastering the relevant facts and carefully  analyzing the law, whether the text of a statute or the word of a  contract.'' Her law clerks also wrote that she goes ``where the law  takes her'' and that in their decade of collective experience in over  900 cases, Justice Eid ``treats each case individually without any  preconceived notion of desired outcome.''   The National Native American Bar Association also endorsed Justice  Eid. In their letter to the committee, they noted that she ``has  demonstrated deep understanding of Federal Indian law and policy  matters, as well as significant respect for the tribes as governments.  Such qualities and experiences are rare among nominees to the federal  bench.'' They went on to note that ``while we do not expect that  Justice Eid will agree with tribal interests on every issue, we also  believe that she is immensely well qualified and we are confident that  Justice Eid is a mainstream, commonsense Westerner who will rule fairly  on Indian Country matters.'' That is from the National Native American  Bar Association. I think ``mainstream, commonsense Westerner'' is the  perfect way to describe Justice Eid.   Despite this bipartisan support and her professional achievements,  all the Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee voted against her  nomination in committee, and I suspect most of the minority will vote  against her  [[Page S6952]]  confirmation when it comes up. That surprised me. Justice Eid received  a majority ``well qualified'' rating from the American Bar Association,  an outside group who evaluates judicial nominees. My colleagues on the  other side claim that this group's ratings weigh very heavily in their  decision to support or oppose a judicial nominee. In fact, my  Democratic colleagues claim that these ratings should carry a great  deal of weight with Senators, and they argue that the Judiciary  Committee shouldn't hold hearings on nominees who have not yet received  ABA ratings.   This week, we are voting on four circuit court nominees--including  three women--who received ``well qualified'' ratings from the ABA. The  American Bar Association rated two of these individuals unanimously  ``well qualified.'' Yet the vast majority of my Democratic colleagues  voted against the two nominees on whom we have already voted, and I am  willing to bet that the other two nominees will see similar opposition  from my Democratic colleagues.   Why do my Democratic friends profess such admiration for the American  Bar Association's evaluation process and then vote against nominees who  received the American Bar Association's ``well qualified'' rating? I  would like to see them put their money where their mouth is or maybe,  better yet, their vote where their mouth is. If my colleagues believe  so strongly in the ABA evaluations, they should start voting for  nominees who receive ``well qualified'' ratings, but I suspect they  will not.   When the Judiciary Committee voted on Justice Eid's nomination, my  Democratic colleagues really stretched to find reasons to oppose that  nomination. One of the chief reasons given for opposition to her  nomination centered on a quote in a Denver Post article that said  Justice Eid has ``earned a reputation of one of [the Colorado Supreme  Court's] most conservative members.'' I find that statement to be  misleading. Of the seven justices on the Colorado Supreme Court,  Justice Eid is one of only two justices appointed by a Republican  Governor. To argue that she is somehow extreme just because she was not  appointed by a Democratic Governor is very unfair.   Furthermore, the Denver Post published a subsequent article that  disagreed with this characterization. By contrast, the more recent  article stated that ``appointment by a Republican or Democrat does not  always dictate the ideology of the justice. . . . Even categorizing  justices as either conservative or liberal is generally an error.'' I  would agree with the Denver Post on this point.   Justice Eid should not be evaluated by her ideological reputation  but, rather, by how she approaches issues before her judiciary. That is  how I have evaluated Justice Eid and other judicial nominees, and that  is why I strongly support her confirmation today.   I am very proud to support the nomination of Justice Allison Eid. She  is the third in a series of distinguished female circuit court nominees  we have had the opportunity to vote on this week. Her impressive  experience and numerous accomplishments speak to her qualifications for  this role. I commend the President for nominating these outstanding and  accomplished women to our circuit courts. Justice Eid is an exceptional  nominee, and her record overwhelmingly supports her nomination. As a  result, I will support her confirmation tomorrow, and I urge all of my  colleagues to do the same.   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, last month the Environmental Protection  Agency--EPA--Administrator, Scott Pruitt, issued a directive to all  Agency employees that prohibits the so-called sue-and-settle process.  This is good news for good government.   Most of us here are familiar with the term ``sue and settle.''   These are tactics whereby the EPA has, in the past, resolved certain  lawsuits against it through agreements negotiated behind closed doors  with politically favored interest groups. As we saw under the Obama  administration, some of these agreements committed the EPA to take far- reaching regulatory action, all without an adequate opportunity for  those people most impacted to have a seat at the table, as would  normally be done through the regulatory process.   Today, I come to the floor to applaud Administrator Pruitt's  leadership in working to end these tactics, which make a mockery of  laws that Congress has put in place to ensure a transparent and  accountable regulatory process. The commonsense reforms outlined in  Administrator Pruitt's directive will, no doubt, help restore  transparency and accountability, and these reforms should stand as a  prime example for all Federal agencies to follow.   Accordingly, I call upon President Trump to use his full authority  through Executive order to ensure that similar reforms are adopted  across the entire bureaucracy. Regulatory decisions that affect key  parts of our economy should be made in an open, transparent, and,  consequently, accountable manner. But as we have seen with sue and  settle, Washington bureaucrats and their interest group pals would  prefer to do things their own way.   It works like this. First, an interest group sues a Federal agency,  claiming the agency has failed to take regulatory action required by  law. Through the lawsuit, the interest group seeks to compel the agency  to take action by a new, often rushed, deadline. These plaintiff  interest groups often share a common regulatory agenda with the agency  they sue, such as when an environmental group sues the EPA or the Fish  and Wildlife Service.   Instead of challenging the lawsuit, the agency and the interest group  enter into negotiations behind closed doors to produce either a  ``settlement agreement'' or a ``consent decree'' committing the agency  to take regulatory action. There is no transparency, no accountability,  which you would get through normal regulation writing.   Noticeably absent from these negotiations are the very parties who  will be most impacted, such as farmers, manufacturers, and even the 50  States themselves, which will be charged with enforcing some of these  regulations. In 2010, for example, an environmental interest group sued  the Obama administration EPA to force the agency to revise certain  wastewater regulations.   Wouldn't it be nice to have the people who are affected by those  regulations involved in the process in an open way--the way the  Administrative Procedure Act is designed?   Oddly enough, the same day the lawsuit was filed, the plaintiff  interest group submitted a consent decree already signed by the EPA,  which committed the agency to take prompt regulatory action. Such a  scenario should raise serious questions about how truly adversarial  these lawsuits and negotiations are.   To add insult to injury, regulations that have resulted from sue-and- settle tactics impose tremendous costs on the American economy.  According to the American Action Forum, from 2005 to 2016, 23 sue-and- settle regulations resulted in a cost burden of $67.9 billion, with  $26.5 billion in actual costs. Sixteen of the rules imposed paperwork  burdens on American job creators of more than 8 million hours. Think  about that. Nearly $70 billion in regulatory costs were imposed on  American business owners, manufacturers, farmers, and probably  taxpayers, all without due regard for transparency and the normal  rulemaking process required by the Administrative Procedure Act.   Decades ago, Congress enacted the Administrative Procedure Act for  the sole purpose of ensuring transparency, accountability, and, more  importantly, public participation in Federal rulemaking. The EPA has  been described as the citizens' ``regulatory bill of rights.'' A pillar  of the Administrative Procedure Act is the notice-and-comment process,  which requires agencies to notify the public of proposed regulations  and respond to comments submitted--in other words, transparency.   Rulemaking driven by sue-and-settle tactics frequently results in  reprioritized agency agendas and rushed deadlines for regulatory  action. This renders the EPA's notice-and-comment process a mere  formality. It deprives regulated entities, it deprives the States, and  most importantly, it deprives the American public of sufficient time to  have any meaningful input on final rules. The resulting regulatory  action is driven not by the public interest but by the special interest  priorities.   Sue-and-settle tactics also help agencies avoid accountability for  their actions. Instead of having to answer to the public for  controversial regulatory decisions, agency officials will simply point  to a court order and say that their hands are tied, when really they  welcomed that process.   The American people deserve better, but don't just take my word for  it. The Environmental Council of the States, a national nonprofit,  nonpartisan association of State and territorial environmental agency  leaders, adopted a resolution in 2013 entitled ``The Need for Reform  and State Participation in EPA's Consent Decrees which Settle Citizen  Suits.'' The rationale behind it  [[Page S6964]]  provides that ``state environmental agencies are not always notified of  citizen suits that allege U.S. EPA's failure to perform its  nondiscretionary duties, are often not parties to these citizen suits,  and are usually not provided with an opportunity to participate in the  negotiation of agreements to settle citizen suits.''   The Environmental Council of the States further resolved that  ``greater transparency of citizen suit settlement agreements is needed  for the public to understand the impact of these agreements on the  administration of environmental programs.''   Obviously, I agree. We need more transparency, more accountability,  and more voices at the table. In other words, the public's business  ought to be public, not some new regulation agreed to behind closed  doors. I am happy to say that this administration is working to  accomplish that, thanks to Administrator Pruitt. In his own words:  ``The days of this regulation through litigation . . . are  terminated.''   His directive puts a swift end to sue-and-settle tactics by this one  agency, the EPA. It does so by adopting commonsense reforms to promote  transparency and public participation in the regulatory process. It  requires the publication online of notices of lawsuits filed against  the EPA. It requires the EPA to reach out and notify any States or  regulated entities that will be affected by the lawsuit. It requires  the EPA to seek the agreement of any affected State or regulatory  entities before the agency can enter into a consent decree or  settlement agreement. Further, it prohibits the EPA from entering into  any consent decree or settlement that converts a discretionary duty of  the agency into a mandatory duty to issue, revise, or amend a  regulation. Most importantly, it requires the EPA to post online for  public comment any proposed consent decrees or settlement agreements  before they are entered into by the court.   These and other reforms in Administrator Pruitt's directive mark a  very strong step toward ensuring that States, American job creators,  and the public at large have a seat at the table when regulatory  decisions are made, which is exactly why Congress passed the  Administrative Procedure Act.   Before I close, I will add one more thing. Earlier this year, I  introduced the Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act.  This bill would make permanent the very types of reforms outlined in  Administrator Pruitt's directive. If it becomes law, it can't be  changed at some later date. In other words, it would ensure that future  administrations can't simply roll back the great work Administrator  Pruitt is doing through this directive.   I am pleased to hear that the House of Representatives just passed  the companion bill introduced by Congressman Doug Collins. We will  continue our work to build bipartisan support here in the Senate for  this commonsense decree.   But, today, I urge President Trump to move forward with the example  set by Administrator Pruitt because Administrator Pruitt is draining  the swamp through this process. The President loves to sign Executive  orders. He would probably do more good in draining the swamp by  producing an Executive order like this than almost any other Executive  order he could do.   There is simply no reason these reforms should be limited to just the  EPA. Transparency and public participation are core elements of a more  accountable government. Simply stated, they are part of the process of  representative government, where people make the laws and where  administrators carry out the laws, not where something is done behind  closed doors because some special interest wants something or because  the agency is begging to do something--which maybe someone doesn't want  them to do--to get it done and to do it behind closed doors, just to  work it out the way they want it and not necessarily the way it would  be done if people were participating.   I applaud Administrator Pruitt's directive. I urge the President to  promptly see to it that similar reforms are implemented across the  administration.   So for a third time today, President Trump, issue an Executive order  to all departments to do what Administrator Pruitt has done at the EPA.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to remind my colleagues that we  annually commemorate National Domestic Violence Awareness Month in  November. This is a time when we're called to increase public awareness  and understanding of domestic violence.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S6972, November 1, 2017, in the second column, the  following appears: . . . annually commemorate is National Domestic  Violence Awareness Month in October . . .      The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . annually  commemorate National Domestic Violence Awareness Month in  November.    ========================= END NOTE =========================     As noted by the National Network to End Domestic Violence, domestic  violence is a crime that thrives when we remain silent. That's why the  Senate today passed the resolution that I recently introduced with  Senator Feinstein to commemorate National Domestic Violence Awareness  Month.   As stated in our resolution, Congress should continue to raise  awareness of domestic violence in the United States. We also should  pledge our continued support for programs designed to assist survivors,  hold perpetrators accountable, and bring an end to domestic violence.   Congress has made support to survivors a national priority for over  three decades, through the enactment of the Violence Against Women Act,  the Victims of Crime Act, and other Federal laws. Through the enactment  of laws criminalizing domestic violence at the State and local level,  we've also sent a strong signal to abusers that domestic violence is  not a ``private'' matter.   We've come a long way, but we still have much work to do on this  front. Even now, domestic violence affects millions in the United  States, including women, men, and children of every age and socio- economic status. About one in five women will at some point in their  lifetime become a victim of this crime, according to the Centers for  Disease Control.   I applaud the many individuals and organizations in Iowa and  elsewhere around the Nation that work around the clock to respond to  victims in crisis. They include the hotline personnel who provide  support 365 days a year. They include the staff and volunteers at  shelters, who provide safe havens for those escaping abuse. They  include the advocates who champion survivors' interests at the State  and Federal levels. Last, but certainly not least, they include the  first responders who compassionately respond to victims in crisis.   We applaud their continued service and we continue to support the  goals and ideals of National Domestic Violence Awareness Month.                            ____________________
