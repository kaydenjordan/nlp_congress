 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support  of a true leader and friend, Betsy DeVos, for the nomination of  Secretary of Education.   By far and away, Betsy DeVos is the ideal candidate to guide our  Nation's education policies. For three decades, she has been focused on  making sure all of our Nation's children have access to quality  education, particularly for the disenfranchised and those in real need.   The Associated Press recently ran a piece highlighting West Michigan  Aviation Academy and the tremendous difference the school is making in  the lives of the children in Michigan. Betsy DeVos had her hand in that  process, as she has in so many of the other schools across western  Michigan.   Mr. Speaker, being from Michigan myself, I have seen firsthand what  Betsy DeVos has done for education in Michigan. She understands the  important role of public schools in the K-12 system, but also believes  that competition, school choice, and parental control will help drive  success in all schools to ensure that all children are receiving the  best possible education, no matter their circumstances.   I hope to work with my friends on the other side of the Capitol. And  I hope, during this time before the Senate committee considers Ms.  DeVos' nomination, that the rest of the Nation will hear of the great  things that Betsy DeVos has done and see how qualified she is for this  job.                            ____________________
