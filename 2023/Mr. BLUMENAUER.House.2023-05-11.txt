 Mr. Speaker, I am having flashbacks in terms of what  we were facing in 2020. Every member of my office was working to try  and deal with panicked people who couldn't get through to get their  unemployment in a system that was bogged down, 600 percent increase.   Now, we are taking up legislation that would cut fraud-fighting  dollars and hold hardworking Americans liable for overpayments that  were not necessarily their fault. Families would be forced to repay  these funds up to 10 years later. Even the Congressional Budget Office  has said there is uncertainty about how much would be recovered.   I was in the middle of that. I saw the panic, the challenge, and  despair. I think it would be far better to take advantage of extending  the statute of limitations so we make sure we can claw it back. But  don't punish people who may be caught up in this net that was not of  their making.   I strongly urge that we reject this, that we deal with ways to  increase the statute of limitations and recover the money that needs to  be recovered.
