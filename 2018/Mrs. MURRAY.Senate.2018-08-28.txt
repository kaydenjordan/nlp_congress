 Mr. President, as ranking member on the Senate Committee  on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions and along with my colleague,  Senator Alexander, the chairman, I would like to recognize a public  servant deeply committed to protecting the health of the American  people, Dr. Marcia Crosse. Dr. Crosse will retire on August 31, 2018,  after a distinguished 35-year career at the Government Accountability  Office, where she is currently a director with the Health Care Team.   Over the course of her career, Dr. Crosse led the work behind more  than 200 reports and congressional testimonies on a wide range of  important public health issues, including the safety of drugs and  medical devices; bioterrorism; infectious disease outbreaks such as  SARS and the West Nile Virus; pandemic and emergency preparedness;  biomedical research; and HIV/AIDS. She has helped shed light on  problems that otherwise may have long gone unnoticed. Her work has not  only led agencies to take action, but has also informed important  legislative changes, including more effective medical device recalls, a  risk-based approach to foreign drug inspections, clarification of FDA's  authority to oversee drug compounding, and enhanced authority for FDA  to better manage drug shortages. Her work has helped to improve the  health and safety of families across the country for generations to  come, and we are incredibly grateful for her service.
