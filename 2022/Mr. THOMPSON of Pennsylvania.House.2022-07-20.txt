 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize  today, July 20, as National Pennsylvania Day.   Since the inception of our Nation, Pennsylvania has played a  transformative role in United States history. Pennsylvania's nickname,  the Keystone State, represents the central role we played in shaping  our Nation.   Pennsylvania was the site of many important battles and military  milestones, like the Battle of Valley Forge in the Revolutionary War  and the Battle of Gettysburg during the Civil War.   Pennsylvania is the home to a lot of firsts, including our Nation's  first capital, Philadelphia; the first American flag sewn by Betsy  Ross; and the first commercial oil well in my district, giving birth to  the modern petroleum industry.   Pennsylvania has a proud history of American craftsmanship and work  ethic, from our steel mills and coal mines to our farmland and forests.   Madam Speaker, as a lifelong resident of Pennsylvania, I am  encouraged each and every day by the industrious spirit of our  residents as we continue to build a bright path forward for our  Commonwealth and our country.   Happy Pennsylvania Day. I am proud to be from the great Keystone  State.                     Late-Term Abortion Should Be Illegal     Madam Speaker, Democrats are advancing  an agenda of abortion on demand. Last week, House Democrats passed  their radical abortion on demand until birth act, falsely named as the  Women's Health Protection Act, and the Ensuring Access to Abortion Act.   Both bills go much further than codifying Roe v. Wade and would  legalize abortion for all 9 months of pregnancy across the country,  while undermining the health and safety of women. In advancing this  legislation that would continue the murder of innocent unborn, Speaker  Pelosi has confirmed Democrats' radical agenda by saying abortion is ``  . . . core to who we are. It is about freedom.''   Madam Speaker, 80 percent of Americans believe that late-term  abortion should be illegal.      Impact of the National Defense Authorization Act on our Military                               Servicemembers     Madam Speaker, last week, in a  bipartisan way, this body stood up and served those who serve in  uniform, those who sacrificed for this great Nation in the United  States Armed Forces.   I was proud, on Thursday, to join the majority of folks in this  Chamber in passing H.R. 7900, the National Defense Authorization Act. I  was proud to support this legislation, and I contributed significant  legislative language, too.   The bill extends a prohibition preventing dishonorable discharge for  servicemembers refusing COVID vaccines, while also extending a  prohibition on COVID vaccine mandates for Department of Defense  contractors.   The NDAA authorizes annual funding for the Department of Defense and  defense-related programs at other Federal agencies. The NDAA authorized  earned pay raises for our American troops. Included in the NDAA was my  legislation from H.R. 7144, the Military Housing Transparency and  Accountability Act, that directs the Secretary of Defense to develop a  centralized military housing feedback tool for members of the United  States Armed Forces and their families. This will allow these families  to identify, rate, and compare housing options. Our military families  have earned the right to safe housing conditions.   Additionally, it included provisions requiring the Department of  Defense to report the dollar amount spent on foreign fuel that is used;  report on the impact on low recruitment and retention, and the impact  on servicemembers' mental health as a result of that; and finally, to  report the impact of inflation, which is impacting every American  family today.   This report specifically is asking the question: What is the impact  of inflation--which is out of control, a record high--on our military  families?                            ____________________
