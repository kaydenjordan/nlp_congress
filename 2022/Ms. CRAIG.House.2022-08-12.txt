 Madam Speaker, today is the day that we deliver on many of  our promises to the American people. We are going to lower the cost of  healthcare for millions of Americans. We are going to invest in  American energy independence and reduce carbon emissions. We are going  to do this in a responsible way, as we reduce the deficit in the  process.   The Inflation Reduction Act takes historic strides to make healthcare  more affordable by capping the cost of insulin at $35 a month for those  on Medicare. Capping out-of-pocket drug costs for our Nation's seniors  at $2,000 a year, and empowering Medicare to negotiate drug prices for  our seniors.   We also extend the ACA tax credit, ensuring that we continue along  the path of these historic rates of uninsured in our Nation. We are  going to make the largest investment in clean energy in our Nation's  history, reduce carbon emissions by 40 percent this decade, and invest  in biofuels infrastructure for Minnesota's family farmers.   Madam Speaker, I say to my colleagues, today, the will of our  constituents will prevail over special interests--at least on this side  of the aisle.   Madam Speaker, this legislation will make a real difference in  reducing costs for working families. I am proud to support it, and I  encourage my colleagues to do the same.
