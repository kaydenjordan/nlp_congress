 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the retirement of a  distinguished member of the Myrtle Beach Police Department, K9 Bek. I  am proud to congratulate this canine and the rest of the Myrtle Beach  police force for their crucial role in the department's drug detection  and weapons recovery programs.   With well over 300 deployments, Bek was able to track and seize an  array of illicit drugs, including 44 kilograms of marijuana, several  ounces of heroin, cocaine, and meth. He was responsible for multiple  firearm retrievals and numerous building searches. These efforts led to  over 50 criminal apprehensions.   Thank you, K9 Bek, the Myrtle Beach Police Department, and all law  enforcement agents across our country for the work that you do to keep  us and our countrymen safe.   South Carolina is indeed safer because of the men, women, and dogs in  uniform.                            ____________________
