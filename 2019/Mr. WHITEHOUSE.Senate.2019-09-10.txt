 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business for up to 25 minutes.    Mr. President, as the Presiding Officer knows, I have  often spoken about how climate change is affecting Rhode Island. Rising  sea levels will remake my State's map. Warming seas are shifting our  traditional fisheries away from Rhode Island. A hotter climate creates  public health risks for Rhode Islanders. And the list goes on.   In the Senate, I have also tried to learn how climate change is  affecting other States. The Presiding Officer was courteous about  joining me in Louisiana when I made a trip to his State. I have been  doing a fair amount of traveling, and last month I visited Wyoming to  hear about climate change in the Cowboy State. That was the 17th State  I visited on these climate trips.   Here is a little background on Wyoming. It is big. It is a lot bigger  than Rhode Island. It is almost 400 miles wide by almost 300 miles  north to south. Although it has some lovely lakes, Wyoming ain't  coastal. Its lowest point is more than 3,000 feet above sea level-- three times higher than Rhode Island's highest point, Jerimoth Hill-- and its highest point, Gannett Peak, is almost 14,000 feet.   Wyomingites have a reputation for being conservative skeptics about  climate change, but polling data shows that even in Wyoming, 60 percent  of people think climate change is happening, 43 percent think humans  are driving it, 69 percent say they support regulating carbon dioxide  as a pollutant, and 68 percent think their schools should teach about  global warming.   My trip began in Teton County, which I was repeatedly told is the  liberal part of the State. Teton County is home to Jackson Hole and  Grand Teton National Park, as well as a large chunk of America's  legendary Yellowstone National Park. From Jackson, I went up to visit  Yellowstone and then came back down over Togwotee Pass and down here to  Dubois and then around on to Lake of the Woods, to the Wind River  Indian Reservation, to Lander, to Pinedale, and back to Jackson.   In Teton County, I met with local elected officials from Jackson,  from the Teton County council, and from the Wyoming Legislature. I  learned that roughly two-thirds of Wyoming's revenues come from mineral  extraction--mostly coal, oil, and natural gas. With all this fossil  fuel money pouring into its coffers, Wyoming has no State income tax,  sales tax of 4 percent, and one of the lowest effective property tax  rates in the Nation. Indeed, I was told that Wyomingites get around $9  in services for every $1 they pay in taxes. It is a sweet deal. And  fossil fuel picks up the rest of the tab.   There are problems with this political-economic model, however-- problems that folks in Wyoming repeatedly pointed out to me. First, it  exposes Wyoming heavily to boom/bust cycles. Three coal companies have  gone bankrupt just this year. It will also expose Wyoming to the  devastating bust coming if, as predicted, fossil fuel assets crash.  Almost all of Wyoming's eggs are in one fossil fuel basket.   Moreover, a political-economic model based on fossil fuel harms  Wyoming's other economic driver: outdoor recreation--skiing and  snowboarding, river rafting, backpacking, hiking, rock climbing, and  fly fishing. Wyoming has abundant outdoor recreation.   During my trip, I heard how lucky I was to enjoy clear and smokeless  skies in August and that this August was like August of times gone by.  The new normal across the West is hotter, dryer summers driven by  climate change, and that makes massive forest fires, filling the skies  with smoke for weeks and months on end. We enjoyed clear skies.   In addition to the threat to life and property, wildfires harm  Wyoming's tourism and outdoor recreation economies. Obviously, fewer  people visit when iconic landscapes are obscured or when places they  want to explore are at risk of fire. A representative from  [[Page S5383]]  the Fremont County lodging tax board told me that fires can shut down  roads to the national parks and forests, cutting hotels and motels off  from the attractions to draw people there.   At the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, I sat down with over a dozen  business leaders from the outdoor recreation industry who told me that  outdoor recreation generates $5.6 billion in Wyoming and supports  50,000 jobs--actually more jobs than the fossil fuel industry. For the  winter sports business, climate change is an existential threat,  shortening ski seasons, worsening snow cover, and affecting these  beautiful landscapes. For this industry, this problem is deadly  serious, and the industry is struggling to learn how to get the  political attention that the fossil fuel industry enjoys.   In Lander, I met with leaders from the renowned National Outdoor  Leadership School, NOLS. NOLS draws people from around the world to  learn about the outdoors, develop leadership skills, and study  mountaineering and outdoor survival. It is the largest nongovernment  employer in Fremont County. The president of NOLS told me: ``Without  question, the number one risk the school faces is climate change.'' For  instance, the risk of wildfire is up dramatically and along with it,  property insurance rates. Climate change has disrupted NOLS's schedule  at its outdoor campuses around the world, as wildfires, melting  glaciers and permafrost, and upended stream flows make it difficult,  impossible, or dangerous to access these course sites. For people who  love these places, this hurts the heart as much as it hurts the  pocketbook.   In Jackson, I met winter sports athletes from the group Protect Our  Winters. These are amazing athletes who spoke about their passion for  snow sports and magnificent mountain landscapes. They also spoke of  climate change threatening the future of the sports they love. I  listened to Lynsey Dyer deliver a wonderful presentation to a packed  house in Jackson about how climate change is altering alpine  environments. She is summoning the same inner strength that allows her  to ski death-defying drops. I will tell you, look at the film of some  of what she skis off of, and it will stun you. She is using that inner  strength to build national support for climate action.    In Pinedale I heard how climate change threatens Wyoming's cold water  fisheries. The Upper Green River and its tributaries are some of the  most storied trout streams in the world, drawing in a big fishing  business. I spent an afternoon with a fly fishing guy and a  representative from Wyoming Trout Unlimited. They told me how higher  temperatures and lower water flows, both caused by climate change, harm  Wyoming's iconic trout, which need cold water with plenty of oxygen.   I also visited local scientists who study climate change. Dr. Michael  Tercek and Dr. Andy Ray gave me a tour of Yellowstone National Park to  show me how climate change is already changing the park's ecosystem,  with vaster changes expected ahead. Dr. Tercek is an ecologist who has  worked in Yellowstone for over two decades. Dr. Ray's specialty is  amphibians, which may not be as iconic as Yellowstone's bison but are  on the frontlines of climate change.   The scientists told me that just over the last 70 years, the average  annual temperature in the greater Yellowstone area has risen by 2  degrees Fahrenheit. In parts of the region, there are now 60 fewer days  a year with below-freezing temperatures than there were just 30 years  ago. Summers are drier, and in winter there is less snowpack, meaning  less snowmelt and less water in the spring and early summer.   You can already see changes in the park. Take cheatgrass. Cheatgrass  is an invasive species whose roots don't hold the soil as well as the  native sage brush. As temperatures warm, cheatgrass spreads to higher  and higher elevations, supplanting the sage brush. The result is this:  large gullies carved in hillsides as rain and snowmelt wash away the  soil.   Consider Dr. Ray's amphibians. We visited several small ponds and  tarns that dot the Yellowstone landscape. As temperatures warm and  precipitation declines, water levels in many ponds fall, reducing  habitat for these amphibians and making them more vulnerable to  predators.   In this photo, you can see a line here along the edge of this pond.  Most of the rocks here are gray. They are gray because they are covered  by lichen that turns them that color. But if you look just above these  grasses here, you will see rocks that are nearly pink in color. These  are rocks that were submerged until recently, and the lichen hasn't yet  had time to colonize--clear evidence that the water level at this pond  has fallen rapidly.   We climbed up into some dead forests to look at what bark beetles are  doing to the Rocky Mountains' conifers. Here is a photo I took of a  branch from a tree killed by bark beetles. The beetles bore through the  bark, and then their larvae eat the thin cambium layer between the bark  and the wood of the tree trunk. This ultimately girdles and kills the  tree. You can see in this photo the marks left by the bark beetles.  This J-shaped mark you see here is particularly characteristic of bark  beetles.   This chart shows how beetle kill spreads through forests once winter  temperatures began warming. You see these temperature climbs here from  1980 forward, and you see a matching climb in beetle-killed trees in  Colorado and Wyoming. Hotter, drier summers also stress the trees,  making them more vulnerable to infestation. Once they are dead, they  become wildfire tinder.   Bark beetles might seem like esoteric little creatures until you see  the damage they have done throughout the Mountain West. Everywhere  there is red on this map there is kill by bark beetles. Bark beetles  have killed enough acres of western forest to cover the entire State of  Wyoming and then some. You can see a lot of this kill is in Wyoming.   On the road from Yellowstone to Dubois, you cross Togwatee Pass,  between the Absaroka and Wind River mountain ranges. You traverse miles  and miles that look like this--dead trees as far as the eye can see,  killed by beetle infestation.   In the Wind River Indian Reservation, I met a man named Jim Pogue. He  said they call these gray, dead forests ``doghair forests.''   Here is a landscape dramatically altered by climate change. This  forest died in less than a decade.   Before I met Dr. Tercek, I read an article in which he was quoted as  saying: ``By the time my daughter is an old woman, the climate will be  as different for her as the last ice age seems to us.'' I didn't fully  grasp what he meant until I met another scientist studying climate  change in Wyoming, the University of Wyoming's Bryan Shuman.   Dr. Shuman took me up to one of his research sites--the Lake of the  Woods--high in the foothills of the Wind River Range. At this lake and  others, Dr. Shuman extracts sediment cores and conducts radar scans of  the lake bottom and then reconstructs the climate of the region 10,000  years back to the last ice age. During the last ice age, global average  temperatures were 3.5 degrees colder than our preindustrial average.   The 3.5 degrees colder temperatures resulted in a radically different  landscape in Wyoming. Massive glaciers spread across the Wind River  Range. On this map, you can see just how much territory these vast  glaciers covered. That legend shows 10 kilometers. So that is  essentially the whole Wind River Range.   The 3.5 degrees change in temperature created a huge effect. I say  that because the Earth is predicted to warm at least 3.5 degrees by the  end of the century if we don't cut carbon emissions. So think about it  for a minute. In a little bit more than 100 years, the temperature on  Earth will have changed as much as it did in the 10,000 years from the  end of the last ice age. From 10,000 years ago to the beginning of the  Industrial Age, there was a change of 3.5 degrees, and in the following  100 years, we are expecting another 3.5 degrees. Instead of climate  change driving forward at 1 mile an hour, it started driving forward,  thanks to fossil fuel emissions, at 100 miles an hour.   This shows how dishonest the smug statement is that the climate is  always changing. Not like this, it is not. When you know that 3.5  degrees Celsius is the difference between being covered in ice and  having the forest and sage brush steppe ecosystems there now,  [[Page S5384]]  you can see that another 3.5 degrees of warming will cause massive  changes.   Dr. Tercek was not exaggerating. When his daughter is an old woman at  the end of the century, the climate will have changed as much as it  changed since the last ice age, and our climate then will seem as  foreign to her as the ice age seems to us.   There are still glaciers--some--in the Wind River Range. They were  tiny compared to the ice age glaciers that once dominated northwestern  Wyoming, but they are the largest glaciers in the Rocky Mountains. For  the last several summers, a team of professors and students from  Central Wyoming College have studied these glaciers. Their work is  featured in an Emmy-winning documentary produced by PBS Wyoming called  ``Glaciers of the Winds.'' It is actually available on YouTube, and I  highly recommend it. Again, it is called ``Glaciers of the Winds.''    I visited around their campfire the night before the Central Wyoming  College team set off on a 20-plus mile expedition up to the base of  Dinwoody Glacier. The students are measuring the size of the glaciers  to determine how quickly they are melting. They will analyze water  quality, and they will search for archeological artifacts to better  understand how Native peoples lived up in this alpine environment.   The archeology team told me that based on artifacts they have  unearthed, they believe that early Native peoples worshipped the  glaciers. A spiritual reverence for glaciers began to make a little  more sense to me when I visited the Wind River Indian Reservation. The  land to the east of the reservation is deathly arid. Agriculture  depends on irrigation, and irrigation depends on glaciers. Leaders of  the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho Tribal councils said that  after the winter snow melts away, their irrigation depends entirely on  the glaciers, which hold water back as ice and release it through the  long summer as meltwater--key after annual snows have melted away. They  told me that ``once the glaciers are gone, our main resource for life  will be gone.''   I won't pretend I met no climate skeptics in Wyoming. An innkeeper at  a motel told me that climate change was a ``goddamned hoax'' and for  sure wasn't happening in Wyoming. Many of the student scientists at  Central Wyoming College recounted difficulty explaining their interest  in climate change to family and friends. They called it having ``the  conversation.''   I also met with an employee at the Jim Bridger coal-fired powerplant.  She made a strong case that climate solutions must protect workers. I  couldn't agree more. Wyoming has lost three coal companies to  bankruptcy just this year.   One of the great lies of the rotten, crooked climate denial operation  is that reducing carbon emissions is bad for the economy and bad for  jobs, when, in fact, the opposite is true. Another great lie is that  the industry cares much about its workers. Carbon pricing would give an  economic reason for carbon removal, which in turn could help keep some  plants operating a little longer and ease the workers' transition. But,  no, like we saw when coal companies looted miners' pensions, took care  of the CEOs, and ducked into bankruptcy, the climate denial path is a  dead-end for workers.   In spite of some Wyomingites' skepticism, my trip underscored how  attitudes are changing even in the reddest parts of the country. Over  and over again, Wyomingites told me that they cherish the stunning  landscapes around them. They live in Wyoming to be able to hunt and  fish and explore these amazing places. As climate change bears down on  Wyoming's wild places, even current skeptics will come to accept that  we must fight climate change to protect things they love.   The younger generation already gets it. I won't forget the fire-lit,  passionate faces of the Central Wyoming College students, nor the  determination and drive of Lynsey Dyer and the winter sports athletes,  nor a young instructor at NOLS who gave an impassioned argument for  climate action. With powerful and knowledgeable voices like these  speaking, with an economy so vulnerable and no plan B, and with such  risk to Wyoming's natural wonders, I am hopeful that voters in Wyoming  and across the country will start to send a clear message that we must  take action to reduce carbon emissions and soon--it is the smart,  prudent, and economically best course--and to ask the people whom they  elect: Listen, let's do this. If you won't lead, at least get out of  the way. Help us protect what we love while there is still time.   I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, today I wish to honor the  career of one of Rhode Island's ocean and coastal experts, Dr. Bruce  Corliss. Dr. Corliss has served as dean of the University of Rhode  Island's Graduate School of Oceanography since 2012. In March, Dean  Corliss announced he would be leaving URI GSO early next year.   Dean Corliss started at URI GSO as a graduate student. He completed  both his M.A. and Ph.D. in oceanography at URI. He then completed  postdoctoral work at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and served as  a scientist at WHOI until joining Duke University as a professor in  1984, ultimately becoming director of the Duke University/University of  North Carolina Oceanographic Consortium. Dr. Corliss served as chief  scientist on more than a dozen oceanographic research cruises and has  published over 60 research papers.   In 2012, Dr. Corliss heard the call of the Ocean State and returned  to his alma mater as dean. Under his leadership, URI GSO expanded its  oceanographic and coastal research programs and is currently  revitalizing its Narragansett campus; NOAA selected the university to  lead a multi-university Ocean Exploration Cooperative Institute; and  last summer, URI GSO was awarded a new NSF research vessel, to be named  the R/V Resolution. The vessel will replace the R/V Endeavor, which URI  GSO has operated for 40 years.   Dean Corliss will leave URI GSO having reaffirmed its place as one of  the world's preeminent ocean research institutions. His work will be  reflected in the new research vessel on GSO's docks, in new buildings  and labs that will house the next generation of marine researchers, and  in new depths of understanding we will reach through the Ocean  Exploration Cooperative Institute.   Dean Corliss has been a friend and an ally in the fight to protect  and preserve our oceans and coasts. URI GSO has greatly benefited from  his scientific expertise, leadership, and support for ocean research.  On behalf of the Ocean State, I recognize and salute him on an  impressive career and a lasting legacy at the University of Rhode  Island.                            ____________________
