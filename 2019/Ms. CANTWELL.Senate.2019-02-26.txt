 Mr. President, I rise in opposition to a nomination we  are going to be vote on very soon--the confirmation of Eric Miller to  serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.   As a U.S. Senator, I take my obligation to advise and consent on  judicial nominations very seriously, and I believe Mr. Miller's  confirmation process has gone against longstanding Senate tradition and  norms and limited our role to advise and consent on his nomination.   This nomination has proceeded over the objection of both myself and  my colleague from Washington, Senator Murray. For more than 100 years,  conferring with Senators and allowing them to advise and consent on  judicial nominees in their home State has been our process.   Since 1936, only eight judges have been confirmed when one home State  Senator objected. In every case, confirmed nominees have been supported  by at least one Senator from the nominee's State, and to this day no  circuit court judge has ever been confirmed despite opposition from  their home State Senators. All that would change if Mr. Miller is  confirmed.   His confirmation hearing was held during a recess last Congress, when  the vast majority of Senators were back in their States. In fact, only  two Members of the U.S. Senate were present at the hearing, and neither  one of them were Democrats. Mr. Miller was questioned for less than 5  minutes--5 minutes--and when the Judiciary Committee Democrats  requested another hearing, that request was rejected.   Confirming Mr. Miller without a full vetting by both Democrats and  Republicans is the wrong way to proceed on a lifetime appointment.  Moreover, confirming Mr. Miller without approval from Senator Murray  and I would set a damaging precedent.   I do have concerns about Eric Miller's record. He has spent much of  his career fighting against the interests of Tribal governments and  Tribal sovereignty. He has argued cases opposing Tribal fishing rights,  challenging Tribal sovereignty, and fighting against the protection of  Native American religious and traditional practices, so it is no  surprise that organizations representing all 573 Tribal nations around  the United States, including the National Congress of American Indians,  oppose Mr. Miller's confirmation.   I urge my colleagues to stop this process and oppose Mr. Miller's  confirmation to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.                                    S. 47    Mr. President, I also want to comment on upcoming action in the  House, where they are scheduled to take up S. 47, the Murkowski- Cantwell lands package later this afternoon, which received 92 votes in  the Senate earlier this month.   It is my hope that the House will approve this bill with the same  overwhelming that it received in the Senate, and send this legislation  quickly to President Trump's desk.   I want to take a moment to emphasize four important provisions of  this legislation as we prepare for this year's upcoming fire season.   This legislation includes four provisions that will help firefighters  improve their safety and effectiveness and bring state-of-the-art  technology to combating wildfires. These provisions will help  firefighters and communities, and we need to do everything we can as we  face longer fire seasons having more catastrophic events. We need to  give communities and firefighters every tool possible.   First, this legislation allows for the use of drones to create real- time fire mapping, as well as GPS to track firefighter crews. These  advances will help enable real-time tracking and location of both the  fire and the firefighters.   Why is this so important? It is because our firefighters need real- time data to do their job more safely and effectively. The combination  of real-time mapping and GPS locaters has been referred to by the  industry as the ``Holy Grail of Wildland Firefighter Safety.''   Last month's report on the devastating Mendocino Complex fire shows  why this is the case. According to this report, one of the challenges  frontline firefighters had to face was the fact that they weren't sure  exactly where the fire was. The safety officers didn't always know  where the firefighters are. In one case, no one knew where six  entrapped firefighters were. The result was that all six suffered  injuries because it took quite a while to locate and rescue them.   Under this legislation that will be voted on by the House today, we  will have more drones orbiting high over the fires, constantly updating  fire maps and doing it more than just once a day, which has been the  standard until now. These drones employ infrared cameras that can  penetrate through thick smoke and better identify hotspots. Air tankers  will be able to more accurately drop their fuel retardants, and we can  tell firefighters on the frontlines how to steer away from areas that  are just too dangerous to tackle.   When I heard the stories of brave firefighters who battled fire that  raged in many parts of my State, I knew we needed to do more to protect  these unbelievable heroes. Whether it is in Eastern Washington or  Central Washington--in the Okanagon and Wenatchee forests or around  Spokane--we have to do more to help those communities and firefighters  who are putting themselves on the line for us.   This legislation also allows the Forest Service to access NASA's  mapping technology to help prevent mudslides that are all too common  after these horrific fires. We all know erosion can happen shortly  after the devastation of vegetation, and that creates more damage in  the community. The fact that we will be getting NASA access, we will  then be able to come up with strategies to prevent erosion, cutting the  time significantly from where it is today.   The fourth provision is improving smoke forecasting by assigning  meteorologists to every large fire. I know some people are thinking  this probably has already been done. Believe me, we haven't given the  Forest Service every tool it needs.   Over the last few years, summers in the Puget Sound region have  suffered as fires have blanketed our normally pristine air with smoke  and unhealthy air. We know this is becoming a new normal. As the  Western United States continues to become hotter and drier, fires  become more and more likely, and as the fuels get drier, the number of  fires increase and get even bigger.   This isn't just an Eastern Washington problem. Our Washington State  Department of Natural Resources responded to 1,800 fires last year, and  40  [[Page S1458]]  percent of those were in Western Washington. According to researchers  at the University of Washington, just 20 years from now, we will see  the median annual burned area in the Northwest double from what we have  seen in the last 50 years.   We know we need more tools to combat these challenges, and the  legislation we have already passed in the Senate and that is before the  House today will provide these new technology and training tools to  empower the Forest Service to help our communities and our  firefighters: real-time fire mapping, more drone technology to give us  real-time information about the fires, using NASA data to help us plan  post-fires, and giving us more smoke forecasting information to better  help our communities and to deal with those who are impacted by heavy  smoke.   I hope our colleagues will act expeditiously on this legislation. We  know that wildland fire funding, as we increased it in an agreement  last year, was so important, but we need to keep working on this  problem.   I thank my colleague from Colorado for helping to sponsor the  inclusion of this legislation and hope that the President will sign  this legislation very quickly so that tools can be put in place for  this upcoming fire season.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
