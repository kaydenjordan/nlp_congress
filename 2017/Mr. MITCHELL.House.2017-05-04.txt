 Mr. Speaker, my question today is: How long will the  opposition try to hold on to the failing Affordable Care Act? How long  will they desperately try to hold on with their fingernails, screaming  and thrashing at something that is failing so miserably?   Just this week, it was announced that 94 of 99 counties of Iowa will  not have a carrier at all. In Michigan this year, individual policy  premiums went up 20 percent, never mind deductibles and copays.   While currently 26 million Americans do not have coverage, 19.2  million either claim a waiver or pay a penalty that last year was $3  billion. Yet somehow the other side claims the Affordable Care Act is  some form of nirvana.   The American Health Care Act guarantees issuance of coverage and  targets assistance to those who have health challenges, in contrast to  the Affordable Care Act that just thinks we should throw money at it.  What amazes me, in my first few months here in Congress, if there is a  problem, we will just throw money. The opposition wants a blank check,  which will not work in this country. It is going to kill this country.   Let me suggest to my colleague from Michigan, my neighbor, that if he  wants to schedule to go around the State and talk about the benefits of  this program, the Affordable Care Act, I will go with him. We will go  anywhere he would like to go.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a statement from  the Children's Hospital Association in opposition to this bill.                   [From Children's Hospital Association,                               Apr. 27, 2017]        Children's Hospitals Urge House to Vote Against Amended AHCA                  Lawmakers should know bill is bad for kids         Washington, DC.--On behalf of our nation's children's       hospitals and the patients and families they serve,       Children's Hospital Association (CHA) continues to oppose the       newly modified American Health Care Act (AHCA) and strongly       urges the House of Representatives to reject the bill.       Recently adopted changes only worsen the AHCA by putting       children with preexisting conditions at increased risk of       losing health care coverage and failing to correct the       Medicaid cuts that would impact over 30 million kids.        The legislation the House might consider for a vote as       early as the weekend would impose over $800 billion in cuts       on states by fundamentally changing Medicaid--a program over       40 percent of the children across the country depend on for       their health care coverage and access to medical care. Under  [[Page H4133]]       the bill, Medicaid would no longer be able to flex with the       needs of enrollees, instead becoming a severely restricted       system of per capita caps or block grants.        The block grant option in particular would be devastating       to children as it eliminates Medicaid's EPSDT (Early and       Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment) benefit which       ensures children receive immunizations, mental health       assessments and vision, eye and hearing exams as well as       other medical services they might need. A block grant would       also remove cost-sharing protections for children,       essentially creating new barriers to care for low-income,       working families.        CHA urgently asks members of Congress to vote against the       AHCA. Medicaid must be maintained to ensure children receive       the coverage and medical care that return lifelong benefits       into adulthood. Investing in children's health advances a       better future for our nation.    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include a statement from Families USA in  opposition to this bill.                             [From FAMILIESUSA]    Latest House GOP Proposal--``Upton Amendment''--Still Leaves People                with Pre-Existing Conditions Out in the Cold         Washington, DC.--Republicans in the House today are       discussing a so-called compromise that ostensibly adds $8       billion to their Affordable Care Act (ACA) repeal bill in an       attempt to appease members worried that the bill strips       coverage guarantees for people with pre-existing conditions.       Below is a statement from Families USA Executive Director       Frederick Isasi.        ``Despite today's wheeling and dealing, the GOP repeal bill       still drops the coverage guarantee for people with pre-      existing conditions, strips coverage from millions, and       drives up costs for millions more. A measly $8 billion       handout isn't going to change that. The bill also decimates       Medicaid--more than $800 billion in cuts. That hurts seniors,       people with disabilities, and children like Jimmy Kimmel's       son who he so eloquently spoke of Monday night. Remember,       half of the births in America are reimbursed through       Medicaid.        ``The Upton $8 billion is a non-solution--money thrown at       `high-risk pools' that experts on both sides of the aisle       have warned lead to higher costs, fewer benefits, and waiting       lists rationing care for those with pre-existing conditions.        ``Republicans in the House can do all the backroom vote-      trading they want; their bill will still harm millions and       millions of people in America and breaks President Trump's       promise to cover everybody and protect people with pre-      existing conditions. This isn't what people in America want.       It is time for the GOP to drop this deeply flawed legislation       and move on to efforts that will help, and not hurt,       America's families.''    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include a statement from the Association  of American Medical Colleges in opposition to this bill.                          [From AAMC, May 2, 2017]   AAMC Statement on the MacArthur Amendment to the American Health Care                                    Act         AAMC (Association of American Medical Colleges) President       and CEO Darrell G. Kirch, MD, issued the following statement       regarding the amendment to the American Health Care Act       (AHCA) introduced by Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.):        ``This week, the House could vote on a new version of the       American Health Care Act that includes the MacArthur       amendment. Unfortunately, the amendment does not address the       limitations in the original measure, such as making high-      quality, affordable health insurance available to all, and       maintaining programs to support the health care safety net--      at least at current levels--until other comparable coverage       expansions are available.        The amendment's treatment of essential health benefits and       health status underwriting dilutes protections for many       Americans and would leave individuals with preexisting       conditions facing higher premiums and reduced access to vital       care.        The shortcomings in the underlying bill remain the same.       The original analysis from the Congressional Budget Office       indicated that 14 million Americans would lose their health       insurance coverage as early as next year, and as many as 24       million by 2024. Nothing in the bill has changed that alters       the fact that this legislation would lead to fewer Americans       with quality insurance, less affordable coverage for those       who have it, and the destabilization of the current Medicaid       program.        We continue to urge members of Congress to engage with the       nation's medical schools and teaching hospitals and other       stakeholders to find ways to achieve high quality health care       for all Americans.''    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Sanchez), the vice chair of the Democratic Caucus.
