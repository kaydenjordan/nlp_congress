 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Raise  the Wage Act.   For the last 10 years, the minimum wage has remained stagnant as the  cost of living has skyrocketed across the country. Low-income families  and minimum wage workers have carried the brunt of this burden.   Working Americans deserve sustainable living wages, and we should not  accept an economy where parents working full-time jobs cannot support  their families. A vital part of the American promise is the right to a  decent livable wage.   This legislation will empower our workforce, strengthen the economy,  and support families across the United States of America. I look  forward to voting in favor of this important legislation, and I  encourage my colleagues to do the same.                            ____________________
