 Madam President, I would like to speak for 1 minute.   Senate Democrats yesterday blocked a bill that provides much needed  funds for Puerto Rico's nutrition program, also, aid for the 2018  hurricanes and wildfires and, thirdly, assistance to Midwest States in  the midst of a flood crisis. That includes, at least, Iowa, Nebraska,  Missouri, and maybe other States.   Now, the people who voted against it say it was because they care  about Puerto Rico. The bill they blocked takes care of the urgent  funding shortfalls there in that Commonwealth. Playing politics with  disaster aid does a disservice to the people of Puerto Rico and the  people of States like Iowa who are suffering right now from these  floods.   Why would these Senators want to come to campaign in Iowa when they  don't show sympathy for Iowans suffering from the floods with the vote  they cast last night?   I yield the floor.                      Recognition of the Majority Leader     Mr. President, over the past 2 years, some in this body  have decided that they will oppose any nominee suggested by President  Trump. There isn't a Senator who serves their State's interest when  qualified, noncontroversial nominees are prevented from being  confirmed; however, some Members continue to do just that by slow- walking the President's nominees for partisan purposes.   This concern about the speed of confirming nominees is not anything  new. For the benefit of those who were not here at the time, I would  like to take this opportunity to review some of the history on this  subject and how we got where we are today with all this stalling.   Since the rejection of the Robert Bork nomination for the Supreme  Court in 1987, Republicans have felt like we are living under two sets  of rules. Republican Supreme Court nominees could be rejected by  Democrats on ideological grounds if they didn't pass their litmus test,  but Republicans continued to vote to confirm otherwise qualified  Democrat nominees who had what we might consider very radical views  about interpreting the Constitution to mean things that the  Constitution plainly does not say.   Then all of a sudden in 2003, to contrast with what the practice had  been from 1789, Democrats entered the Senate as a minority party under  a Republican President. Prior to 2003, there was simply no history of  systematically opposing cloture to prevent judicial nominees from ever  getting a final vote.   However, coaxed on by leftwing activists, Senate Democrats embarked  in 2003 on an unprecedented campaign of obstruction by filibustering  several of President Bush's judicial nominees to keep them from being  confirmed.   When Senate Democrats began to use the cloture rule to block George  W. Bush's circuit court nominees, we made it very clear that we  Republicans were done living by two sets of rules. We warned Democrats  that, if they continued down that path, we would  [[Page S2170]]  follow their precedent when the tables were turned, but the Democrat  obstruction continued anyway.   Not long after--and as they often so do in this Chamber--the tables  were turned. President Obama entered office with a Democrat majority in  the Senate. True to Republican promises to not live by two sets of  rules, we began to follow the precedent established by the Democrats  and blocked a proportional number of President Obama's judicial  nominees.   Despite the fact that Republicans were holding Democrats to the same  standard that the Democrats established, Senate Democrats made a big  show of being outraged at that time and being indignant about this  equal treatment. Senate Democrats began threatening to invoke the  nuclear option to ram through President Obama's nominees on a simple  majority vote.   However, the minority and majority parties reached an agreement--yes,  we actually reached an agreement--and this was at the beginning of the  113th Congress where Senate Republicans agreed to institute a temporary  standing order to limit postcloture debate for sub-Cabinet and U.S.  district court nominees. This agreement was made explicitly as a  bipartisan compromise, and that bipartisan compromise was there to  avert the use of what we call a nuclear option. Then-Majority Leader  Harry Reid stated on January 24, 2013:         I know that there is a strong interest in rules changes       among many of my caucus. In fact, I would support many of       these changes through regular order. But I agree that the       proper way to change Senate rules is through the procedures       established in those rules, and I will oppose any effort in       this Congress or the next to change the Senate rules other       than through regular order.    That is the end of Senator Reid's, who was then majority leader,  quote.   Despite this statement by Senator Reid and despite the bipartisan  agreement, the Democrat leader decided to pursue the nuclear option  just a few months later. At the same time, Senate Democrats thought  that Secretary Clinton would be President and that forcing this rules  change would benefit their agenda for the foreseeable future.   Our side saw this for what it really was, a power grab that sought to  steamroll the minority party. At that time, the minority party was my  party.   Before Senator Reid invoked the nuclear option, we actually urged the  Democrats to take a longer view. We were trying to get them to think in  terms of what can happen in the future if you do something now. So we  again warned that we were not about to play by two sets of rules and  that they, the Democrats, would regret their decision when the tables  were turned.   I was on the Senate floor on the day that Majority Leader Reid broke  the rules to change the rules--let me emphasize it--broke the Senate  rules to change the rules and made the following comment. This is this  Senator speaking in 2013:         If there is one thing that will always be true, it is this:       Majorities are fickle. Majorities are fleeting. Here today;       gone tomorrow. So the majority has chosen to take us down       this path. The silver lining is that there will come a day       when the roles are reversed.        When that happens, our side will likely nominate and       confirm lower court judges and Supreme Court nominees with 51       votes, regardless of whether the Democrats actually buy into       this fanciful notion that they can demolish the filibuster on       lower court nominees and still preserve it for Supreme Court       nominees.    That is the end of my quote from about 6 years ago when Senator Reid  was doing the nuclear option.   It so happens that very day did come, and the American people elected  President Trump with a Republican majority in the Senate and the House  in November 2016. Senate Democrats have since engaged in a  unprecedented campaign to prevent a whole range of government positions  from being filled by President Trump. It used to be understood that it  was in the American people's interest to have a functioning government,  even if your candidate didn't win the Presidency.   The norm around here for hundreds of years used to be that a new  President's Cabinet positions were filled as soon as possible. I know  that the 2016 election aroused strong feelings and that many people  were deeply disappointed when the candidate they expected to win did  not win to the point of not being able to accept the outcome under our  Constitution of who was elected and elected constitutionally.   A similar attitude arose when President Obama was elected with some  people latching on to the birther conspiracy theory that President  Obama was secretly born in Kenya and that this somehow made his  Presidency illegitimate. However, this was always a fringe movement  that Republicans in Congress did not take seriously and many refuted  it.   The arms race of partisan grievance has now escalated where U.S.  Senators pander to the ``resistance'' by preventing President Trump  from filling out his administration more than halfway through the first  term.   Senate Democrats insist on going through the lengthy motion to end  debate even for nominees which there is little or no opposition. This  means that, after being vetted by the White House, vetted by the Office  of Government Ethics, answering a detailed questionnaire probing every  aspect of the nominee's life, meeting with Senators in person, going  through a nomination hearing, and being voted out of committee,  nominees must wait and wait--sometimes for months and years--before  there is time in the Senate schedule to file a cloture motion as the  first step to getting to finish approving or disapproving that nominee.   The Senate must then allow for a intervening day to pass before it  can vote to end the debate, which often passes overwhelmingly. Yes. You  filibuster something. You have to file a motion, and yet a lot of  times, there is no disagreement that that nominee should be approved.  After all that, the cloture rule allows for an additional 30 hours of  postcloture debate.   I strongly support the Senate exercising its constitutional power,  and that power is about advice and consent. If there are any concerns  about any nominee's ability or willingness to do his job and whether  that nominee is willing to follow the law, Members should come to the  floor to hash through the merits of the nominee.   However, Members on the other side of the aisle have obstructed the  confirmation of a large number of actually noncontroversial sub-Cabinet  nominees and even lower court judges who were not controversial. In a  great many cases, the demand for a cloture vote appears to be solely  about delaying and about obstructing, not anything about the specific  nominee or his qualifications.   As chairman of the Committee on Finance this session, I want to  highlight the experience of some of the nominees considered by the  Finance Committee. So far this Congress, the Finance Committee has  reported seven nominees that were originally reported last Congress but  were not confirmed last Congress because of the obstruction.   I want to make clear that the Finance Committee has a very thorough  as well as bipartisan vetting process. Any nominee that has been  reported by the Finance Committee can verify that we do not rubberstamp  nominees.   However, with the exception of one of the seven nominees that were  rereported, all of them have been reported unanimously or with a  maximum of two no votes. Only one of those seven, however, has been  confirmed.   The U.S. Tax Court is a place where taxpayers are able to challenge  an assessment of tax before actually paying the amount that they are  challenging. It is important that we keep the full roster of 19 Tax  Court judges as full as possible. I don't think any member of my  committee or this Senate would disagree with what I just said. I also  am not aware of any criticism of the nominee currently on the Executive  Calendar for the Tax Court.   That nominee has been reported unanimously from the Finance Committee  twice now, last Congress and this Congress; yet there is no certainty  about when that nominee will be able to consider--or when the Senate  will be able to consider that nomination.   This is very unfair to nominees who submit to an extensive vetting  process and put their professional lives on hold so that they can  serve. And it is also unfair to the American taxpayer who needs these  people to be working.   It is also unfair to the American taxpayers who need these people to  be working. After all, government is a service.   In 2013, the liberal Brennan Center for Justice issued dire warnings  about  [[Page S2171]]  a judicial vacancy crisis. At that time, there were 65 unfilled seats  on the U.S. district courts, and this was crippling the ability of  those courts to dispense justice and to protect the rights of the  American people. Senate Democrats picked up on these talking points and  forcefully made their case.   There are now 129 vacancies on the district courts--129. The concern  from Democrats has somehow disappeared. Last Congress, I was chairman  of the Senate Judiciary Committee. By the end of last year, I had moved  more than 30 highly qualified district court judges to the floor. Most  of them had languished there for months. A few had been in the  confirmation process since 2017. This is all because Democrats insist  on 30 hours of debate for every nominee even though they often end up  voting for them. Some of these who had been filibustered were passed  almost unanimously by the Senate.   In the Judiciary Committee, when I was chairman, we had several more  judges ready to be reported out of committee, but they were likely to  face similar obstruction. I haven't been Judiciary chairman for 3  months. We are in a new Congress, and I assumed a different  chairmanship. Do you know how many of those district court nominees  have been confirmed in the new Congress, meaning the same ones we had  voted out last Congress? Zero. The vacancy crisis, by the Brennan  Center's definition, has nearly doubled because of this obstruction.   Clearly, it is a waste of this body's time to use all 30 hours of  debate after the cloture vote for almost every nominee who comes before  the Senate. The Senate was intended to be a deliberative body. If  Senators want to engage in debate on a nominee, then by all means have  that debate; however, don't make the Senate go through the motions if  you have no intention of actually engaging in debate.   There is now before the Senate a proposal to limit postcloture debate  on sub-Cabinet-level nominees. This proposal was very similar to one  that passed the 113th Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support. A  number of Senators from the other side of the aisle supported that  measure at that time. If they can't support it this time around, what  is their justification? Again, we cannot have a different set of rules  depending on which party is in the majority. We need to agree on a  common set of rules and a common set of norms that apply regardless of  which party has the White House and/or the majority in the Senate.   I note that there are quite a number of Senators who see themselves  in the White House in 2020. They are coming to Iowa every week. Do they  really want to live under the precedent they are setting now? If a  Senator who votes against virtually every Trump nominee gets into the  White House, how should this Senator proceed? If one of the current  Senate Democrats running for President gets elected in 2020, I, of  course, will be disappointed, and I surely won't agree with most of  their policies. So then should I vote against all of their nominees?   I would ask each of these Presidential candidates: Do you expect this  Senate to behave differently than you are right now if in the future  the shoe is on the other foot?   I don't want to be part of a resistance against a future Democratic  President. I don't want to live by two sets of rules. The solution is  to end now this partisan total war where the other side must be stopped  at all costs. We need to come to a bipartisan agreement to end this  tit-for-tat, cut-off-our-nose-to-spite-the-face environment. That is  the environment we find ourselves in today.   Senator Lankford's resolution builds on the bipartisan agreement from  2013, but it is not perfect. If Democrats have legitimate concerns,  let's work together on something better.   I have heard that the only change the Democratic leadership has  proposed is to delay the effective date of the standing order until the  start of the next Presidential term. Presumably, that is due to the  same hubris that led them to invoke the nuclear option without  imagining that they would soon regret it, as now they do regret it. We  had two Supreme Court nominees to prove that they regret it. We  actually approved those two Supreme Court nominees. It is impossible to  defend their position on principle.   Surely there are some Members on the other side of the aisle willing  to work in good faith with Republicans to resolve this impasse in a way  that takes into account the legitimate concerns of Senators on both  sides of the aisle. I don't believe it is too late to bring the Senate  back to the deliberative body the Framers of the Constitution intended  the Senate to be. It is in all of our interests to have a more  functional Senate. I hope my colleagues will join me in working toward  that goal.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
