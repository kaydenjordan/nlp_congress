 Mr. Speaker, we have another weekend gone by and  another speech of our President on the issue of illegal immigration and  what to do with the wall on the southern border.   I take this opportunity, after spending the weekend talking to  several constituents of the Sixth Congressional District, to deal with  some misconceptions in this debate.   The first misconception I would like to talk about is whether Donald  Trump can compromise, because there are some people out there who feel  that the delay in opening the government was because this, admittedly,  type A individual could not compromise.   The shutdown was caused because we had not passed an appropriation  bill that both, I can say, sides, both the pro-wall and anti-wall  people could agree with. President Trump previously--this is his third  year--signed two appropriation bills funding the Department of Homeland  Security and the rest of the government without getting a wall. It was  not until the third time that President Trump and Congress could not  reach an agreement on the Homeland Security bill. And I will point out  that was largely because Congress couldn't get along, not President  Trump.   After a delay of over 30 days, President Trump has, one more time,  compromised. He compromised to allow 3 more weeks of the government to  be open on the promise, or the implied promise, of the Speaker that she  will, in good faith, negotiate about a wall.   President Trump, during this time, also agreed to an extension, a  DACA extension, which the border patrol, quite frankly, would disagree  with, because they feel it will encourage more people to be optimistic  and come here illegally across the border. He also extended temporary  protected status, another thing which may or may not be right, but was  a further olive branch towards people, who, so far, would refuse to  vote for a budget with the funding of a wall.   In any event, I think, if you look at the past, President Trump has  been more than willing to compromise, signing bill after bill in his  first 2 years, despite not making due on his number one campaign  promise, extending temporary protected status, a DACA extension, and  now a 3-week extension.   You can say a lot of things about Donald Trump, but you cannot say he  is not willing to compromise. I think very, very many people feel he  has compromised more than enough.   The next question is: Do we need a wall? Is a wall necessary? And the  fact is it is. We need a wall because we need secure borders.   First of all, as has been pointed out, 70 percent of the heroin in  this country, which has caused tens of thousands of deaths, comes  across our southern border. Some of that heroin comes across points of  entry, and at the points of entry, it is not unusual to catch people  sneaking in heroin. Some people have made something of the fact that  not a lot of heroin is caught in the 60 percent of the southern border  that has no barrier at all up.   That is because there is no barrier. We have no idea how much heroin  is coming across there, but common sense will tell you, if you wanted  to sneak illegal drugs in this country and have a choice between going  across a regular point of entry with perhaps dogs and border control  agents or somebody out in the middle of nowhere, you would go somewhere  out in the middle of nowhere. It is hard to tell me that anyone cares  about the heroin crisis in this country if they do not want a wall.   The next thing to look for is all the people sneaking into the  country. The border patrol itself will tell you they have no idea how  many people are coming across the border. We can say, at a minimum, we  have 11 or 12 million people in this country illegally, but for all I  know, talking with somebody from the border patrol today, it could be  20 million.   And the question is, if we are going to let more people in this  country, are we going to let people in this country who are sneaking  across the border or people who are coming here legally?   Another problem with people coming here legally, I would argue, is  they may be more likely to use welfare or that sort of thing when they  come to the country. Talking to the customs agents, I have found  evidence, when they looked at people's purses, when they looked at  people's wallets, of evidence of people using EBT cards or Medicaid  cards, taking free goods from the American taxpayer.   People are committing crime. One can see when more walls are built on  the southern border; crime goes down on the other side of the wall. A  large percentage of people who are in Federal prisons are illegal  immigrants, which is not surprising, given that they broke the law to  come here.    It is a dangerous way to get in. Thousands of people have been found  dead trying to sneak across areas not at a point of entry. And having  been down in the desert in Arizona, I can easily see why that would  happen. People are giving children to other people to come across the  border, knowing it is easier to stay here if you come with children.   Obviously, that is a dangerous thing. As President Trump says, it is  a humanitarian crisis not to shut off the flow of people who are coming  across the desert hoping to get to America.   Finally, it is a huge cost to the American taxpayer. Something is  said about the almost $6 billion President Trump is asking for a wall.  A variety of different organizations make different guesses as to the  cost of illegal immigration every year. It is probably more than $50  billion. It is not surprising when you take into effect the free  healthcare, the free education, the welfare given out, and the cost to  our criminal justice system.   In any event, do we need a wall? If we care about heroin, we need a  wall. If we care about the cost to government, we need a wall. If we  care about people who are hurt by criminals who come across the border,  we need a wall. And I should point out that, right now, that border is  controlled by the drug cartels in Mexico. We need a wall.   The third issue I would like to address is there are some people who  feel that Donald Trump is anti-immigrant or America is becoming  nativist by requiring a wall. That is not true. Every  [[Page H1240]]  year, in this country, over 700,000 people are sworn in legally to  become citizens in this country. Almost 4 million people are given work  visas to come into this country. Another close to 2 million people come  into this country hoping to be students or to become students in this  country.   All we are asking, if people want to sneak across the border, is do  it legally. Get in line to be one of the 700,000 people who are going  to be sworn in legally. Get in line to be one of the almost 4 million  people who get work-type visas to come here.   I think compared to other countries, quite frankly, there is no  comparison. You look at other countries--Mexico, Germany, countries  like that--you will find the number of people that they are allowing to  naturalize into their country is percentage-wise much less than the  United States of America.                                time  2015    It is incredibly open-minded, and with open arms, that the United  States continues to let these large numbers of people come into this  country to naturalize, to become students, or to work in this country,  and nobody is talking about reducing those very large numbers. All we  are saying is: Don't skip in line.   The next issue I hear people talk about is: Do walls work? If you  build a wall, will it prevent people from coming across the border?   We can look at the southern border already, and we can look at walls  around the world.   Look at the southern border. In the 1990s, we built a border wall  between San Diego and Tijuana. People crossing at that point dropped 92  percent, an incredible success.   We have built other walls, walls near El Paso, walls near Tucson,  walls near Yuma. All of these walls currently built have reduced  illegal immigration by over 90 percent.   Look around the world in other countries building walls. Israel built  a well-known wall around 2010 between themselves and Egypt. Before they  built the wall, they were having about 1,500 people come across their  border illegally. After they built the wall, bit by bit, that number  has dropped all the way down to nothing. That is a pretty good success  rate, going from 1,500 a week to nothing.   You don't hear those people saying: Oh, people are sneaking across.  They're going over the wall or going under the wall.   No, a well-done wall reduces immigration almost entirely.   Right now, 10 EU nations in Europe, countries similar to ours, have  walls. Hungary built a wall on its border with Syria and had a 90  percent drop in the number of people crossing the border, another  example of a very successful wall.   The other thing I will point out, having spent last week down on our  southern border, the Border Patrol, every one of them who I talked to,  says they want a wall. They live with it every day. The Border Patrol  would not want a wall if it was not effective.   The next thing I would like to point out is the cost of a wall.  President Trump is asking for $5.7 billion. $5.7 billion is a lot of  money. But now we have to put it in context with what we are spending  in other parts of our budget.   What President Trump is asking for is one-seventh the cost of foreign  aid that we spend year after year after year, and all the people who  are keeping the government closed because they refuse to vote for a  wall, they have no qualms--or almost all of them have no qualms--about  voting for seven times as much every year on foreign aid.   It is about one-twelfth the increase in defense spending under  President Trump, one-twelfth just the increase. For the protection of  our country in the future, I can think of few things that are more  important than stopping the invasion from south of our Nation.   It is about 0.1 percent--one-tenth of 1 percent--of our overall  Federal budget, and about four-tenths of 1 percent of what we refer to  as the discretionary part of our budget.   So while $5.7 billion is a lot of money, when you look compared to  the other money that Congress appropriates again and again, year after  year after year, they usually don't object to the money being spent on  other things.   Now, you hear it said that walls are immoral. I will point out that I  think this is a new and rather silly argument. I think keeping heroin  out of this country; I think keeping a potential criminal class out of  this country; I think making sure that our future immigrants are people  who stand in line coming here are not considered immoral. But I will  detect a little bit of hypocrisy of people who make that argument.   I mentioned a second ago the wall between Tijuana and San Diego,  which was built during the term of Bill Clinton. I am sure, if you go  back and check the papers of the time, when Bill Clinton felt it was  necessary to build a wall between San Diego and Tijuana, nobody said it  was immoral.   Later on, more of the wall right now was built on an appropriation  passed when President Bush was President. Some of that wall, or  improvements in the wall, were built when President Obama was  President.   I have a feeling, if we go back, we won't find anybody saying the  wall was immoral when it was built by President Clinton or President  Bush or President Obama.   So one of two things is going on here. Either we have partisanship  rearing its ugly head, and people are perfectly happy to vote for a  wall under other Presidents, or some people, both Republicans and  primarily Democrats, are becoming a lot more radical since parts of the  wall were built in the 1990s or the zeros or the teens.   The next thing I would like to deal with is that you sometimes hear  it said by people who have kept the government closed by their refusal  to build a wall that everybody wants border security. Sadly, that is  not true.   You would feel any citizen with common sense would want to enforce  our borders, but if you look, the Governor of California has said that  he wants illegal immigrants to be given free medical care in his State.  The mayor of New York has said much the same thing.   There are over 500 sanctuary cities in the United States of America.  A sanctuary city is a city where the local mayor or city council has  said that we are not going to ask citizens in our jurisdiction whether  or not they are here illegally.   Look, if you have a city, or a county, or a whole State like  California that has become a sanctuary city, those governors or mayors  or legislators or city councils of course do not want immigration laws  taken seriously.   In the last 2 years, a bill was brought forth to try to end sanctuary  cities. A few Republicans voted against the bill, and all but three  Democrats voted against the bill.   I try to put in my mind, what would cause someone, if they really  cared about enforcing the border, to say we have no problem with  counties or cities, in essence, putting up a sign to say: We are not  going to ask people whether they are here illegally.   The point is that, obviously, there are a lot of people out there who  don't care about border security. We have several Congressmen getting  elected on the platform of saying that they don't want to fund ICE, the  Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.   Why would somebody not want to enforce the immigration and customs  authority and, at the same time, want to have our borders taken  seriously?   The answer is, they don't want our borders taken seriously. There are  a lot of people who believe, as the Minnesota Attorney General and  former Congressman Keith Ellison say, that national borders themselves  are an injustice. They want the idea of a separate United States of  America, I guess, to permanently change.   You may think it is ridiculous to say that the idea that we shouldn't  have national borders is a disgrace, but this has become, sadly,  mainstream among the left wing segment of the political class.   The Oakland mayor recently sent an alarm, telling people, including  particularly people with a criminal background in Oakland, that ICE was  going to make a sweep and try to pick up criminals. Why would she do  that if she wanted our immigration laws enforced?   The answer is, more and more people are getting elected in this  country who do not want immigration laws enforced.   Now, I have a few more suggestions for President Trump. I think it is  unfortunate that we have not built the  [[Page H1241]]  wall yet, but having talked to some members of the Border Patrol,  perhaps, in some ways, it is a blessing in disguise.   The $5.7 billion that President Trump wants will be nowhere near  enough to secure the entire border. It will secure more of the border  than now, and it will be a big step in the right direction. That is  true. But I think perhaps President Trump, now that they have kind of  bit his hand after he has compromised and compromised and compromised,  rather than build for just $5.7 billion, should try to increase the  size of the wall, so that we are covering all of the easy entry points  on the southern border, which would take about $8 billion. I do feel it  is important enough to secure our borders that that would be an  appropriate thing to do.   There are other things that, having been at the border, are  suggested. We are right now not making anywhere near a good enough  effort to see if cash is going from the cartels back from north of the  border to south of the border. I would ask President Trump to include  cash-sniffing dogs that can detect this cash. If people try to sneak  across the border without declaring that cash, that cash can be taken,  and it can be very devastating for the cartels.   We could use more density meters for cars, in which you can detect  whether there are drugs within cars. That is another thing that would  help our Border Patrol become more effective.   Finally, he can try to engage people, if there are any people out  there who care about our borders, about the ridiculous asylum laws. I  don't know if everybody is aware out there--not enough Americans are  aware--that anybody who comes to the southern border can say they are  fleeing from violence or religious persecution and, after being  detained briefly, they eventually will be let go for a court date,  which might be years in the future. As long as that law continues in  effect, we will continue to have millions of people stream across the  border.   I want to look here at some of the walls that we already have, walls  that were built by other Presidents and proved to be very effective.   Here we have a wall in San Diego built by President Clinton. It is  not an immoral wall. It is a very effective wall that has decreased  illegal border crossings in the San Diego-Tijuana area by over 90  percent.   We have another wall here that ends in Nogales, in the Arizona area.  I think this wall was built under President Bush. It might have been  somewhat improved under President Obama, another very moral wall that  is protecting people on the north side of the border.   I want to point out another reason why we need the wall. I talked to  some ranchers in the area. They came across the Salvadoran gangs that  we know are so brutal, and they fed them. They weren't harmed. But can  you imagine living near the border where we have people crossing the  border, either south to north or north to south, who are members of the  violent El Salvador gangs?   Here is another picture and a wall near Sasabe and another point  where the wall ends. This is an area in which, even if President Trump  gets the wall he wants, they will not be funding an extension of this  wall. It is one of the reasons why we should ask for a little bit more  than $5.7 million for this wall.    I will point out that the new walls they build will be better than  walls in the past. We can make walls higher than this, and we can make  walls in which we have sensors designed to track people coming up, and  walls in which we have flat areas on top of the wall that would be very  difficult to climb over. It will be very difficult to get over these  new high-tech walls.   In any event, here is another picture of a wonderful wall in Sasabe.  We just wish the wall was a little bit bigger.   Here we are going to look at another couple walls that countries feel  are effective.   Here we have a picture of where a wall is in Jordan. The feeling is  that the United States may have built part of that wall to protect the  poor Jordanians from terrorists coming across. I don't remember anybody  objecting to that wall.   Here we have the wall in Israel that was built and has cut illegal  immigration coming across the border from Egypt down to literally zero.   Now, looking at these walls, these effective walls in the past that  have been built by other Presidents, and thinking that I do not want to  have another shutdown in 3 weeks, the tremendous inconvenience for the  government workers, the inconvenience for people who are relying on the  government for inspections and that sort of thing, I will ask my  colleagues who refused to vote for a border wall during the last  shutdown to just imagine, stop and think for a minute, and pretend  that, instead of President Trump, we have a President Clinton, or a  President Bush, or a President Obama, and maybe, to help you pretend,  you can pretend that the border wall is not there to protect the  residents of Texas, or New Mexico, or Arizona, but it is there to  protect the residents of Jordan.   Just like in the past, when you voted for bills to protect the  residents of Jordan, or voted for Presidents to build walls other than  President Trump, just sit back, close your eyes, and pretend we are  building a wall to protect another country, or building a wall at  another time, and just vote ``yes,'' so that we don't have to go  through another shutdown, and so that we can protect American citizens  from drug lords and protect them from people coming across the border  out of line, to be fair to those people who are coming to this country  legally.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
