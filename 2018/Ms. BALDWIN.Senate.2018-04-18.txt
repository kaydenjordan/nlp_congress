 Thank you, Madam President and colleagues.   The next vote will be on cloture on a motion to concur with an  amendment that is the Coast Guard reauthorization, but with a special  provision that I want to draw all my colleagues' attention to, dealing  with incidental discharges from vessels.   I am strongly supportive of the Coast Guard reauthorization, but this  VIDA provision, as it is known, is extremely troublesome. It impacts  both freshwater coasts of the Great Lakes as well as our other coastal  regions, and it strips the Environmental Protection Agency of its  scientific role in setting standards for discharges and puts the Coast  Guard entirely in charge of these decisions and enforcement.   In addition, it strips all of our coastal States of the authority to  pass laws concerning the waters off their coasts. Wisconsin is a State  that has passed its own water discharge rules. It has done so because  we need to protect the greatest fresh drinking water source in the  world and in our Nation.   We also have had threats of invasive species that would decimate our  Great Lakes. Ballast water and incidental discharges can often be the  cause of those invasive species. In addition, there are chemicals that  can enter the water if this is not regulated. This is not the time for  a one-size-fits-all approach.   We should remove the VIDA provision from the Coast Guard  reauthorization, pass the Coast Guard reauthorization on a voice vote  because it is absolutely not controversial, and then get to the hard  work of doing VIDA the right way.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the first  annual I am for the Child Day on April 18, 2018, sponsored by the  Wisconsin Court Appointed Special Advocates, CASA, Association and the  National CASA Association. April is Child Abuse Prevention Month, and  Wisconsin CASA champions the needs of abused and neglected children.  Over 6,000 Wisconsin children are in foster care; yet only 690 are  assigned trained volunteers who can advocate for their safety and well- being while under the protection of the courts and child welfare  agencies. The goal of the first annual I am for the Child Day is to  raise awareness about the need for volunteers and the crippling impacts  of child abuse and neglect on vulnerable children. I am proud to honor  the WI CASA organization and the dedicated volunteers whose voice can  speak for these children.   The Wisconsin CASA Association is a charitable, nonprofit member of  the National CASA Association network. The association supports local  programs throughout the State of Wisconsin in La Crosse, Vernon,  Monroe, Brown, Marinette, Outagamie, Rock, Columbia, Dane, Manitowoc,  Sauk, and Milwaukee Counties. Court appointed special advocates are  community volunteers who champion the needs of abused and neglected  children. They are sworn ``friends of the court'' acting under the  jurisdiction of an appointing judge. Their work strengthens outcomes  for children involved in an overstrained social welfare system. They  provide advocacy for children's health, safety, emotional and physical  development, family interaction, education, faith, recreation, and the  cultural continuity that children need to thrive.   These volunteers interact with parents, caregivers, siblings,  extended family members, foster parents, teachers, counselors, and  healthcare providers to monitor the children's educational progress and  social development. Their observations ultimately cultivate important  recommendations for the court. Research shows that CASA volunteers  strengthen outcomes for children, enhance child safety, reduce time  spent in foster care, and improve the services the children receive.   CASA organizations are accelerating their advocacy by designating  April 18 as the first annual I am for the Child Day with the goal of  bringing awareness to child abuse everywhere and to help these children  navigate a tumultuous life experience. Once again, I commend the  Wisconsin Court Appointed Special Advocates Association on their  admirable work and look forward to celebrating their accomplishments in  the future.                            ____________________
