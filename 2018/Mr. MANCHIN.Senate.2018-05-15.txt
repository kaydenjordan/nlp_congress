 Mr. President, first of all, to my colleague from  Indiana, there is nobody who has been a greater ally or greater friend  than Senator Donnelly in some of the fights we have had, basically  making sure that there is fairness between business and workers and  that workers are treated fairly. We fought for that. Mr. Donnelly has  fought for miners in Indiana, and he brought me into his State to spend  time with them, and I appreciate that very much. We will continue to  make sure that we get the job done.   This should not be a conversation we are having right now--fighting  for miners' pensions. This was all rolled into one bill. The healthcare  and pensions were all done at one time. We had a pay-for. We had it  worked out. We thought we had an agreement, and it was bipartisan. It  came out of the Senate Finance Committee in a bipartisan way. I thank  Senator Hatch for taking an interest in leading that.   We will have to go back and fix this now. We have half of the job  done and half more to do.   Two weeks ago marked the 1-year anniversary of having a permanent fix  for the miners' healthcare, preventing 22,600 coal miners, just in my  State alone, from losing their healthcare. Now the Joint Select  Committee on the Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans, of which I am  very proud to be a member, is determined to find a permanent solution  for the miners' pensions.   Over 70 years ago, President Harry Truman recognized the importance  of the coal that our miners produced for this country, and he promised  that the Government would guarantee that our great coal miners would  have those benefits in return for their service. Let me tell you that  up until that point in time, my grandparents, on both sides of my  family, were coal miners. They both then started little grocery stores.  Up until that time, there were no guarantees or benefits. When they  said you owed your soul to the company store, that was literally and  figuratively correct.   My grandfather lived up until 1927. He worked and loaded coal since  he was 9 years old and never got a paycheck. He got scrip. At the end  of the pay period, he always owed more than they paid him. So they were  fighting for this for many years. It was Harry Truman who finally  realized what the coal industry and coal mining had done for America.  There has not been a group of people who have ever given more in blood,  sweat, and tears in hard labor.   I tell people that they mined the coal that made the steel that built  the guns and ships that defended our country and helped to build the  Industrial Revolution and really helped to lift the middle class to  what it is and what it has been.   It was over 70 years ago that President Truman recognized that  importance, and he made sure that would not go unnoticed. He passed a  bill with John L. Lewis and, at that time, Senator Krug. He passed a  piece of legislation. This was not from taxpayers' money. They  basically said that from every ton of coal mined from this day forward  by the Mine Workers of America, a percentage of the price of that  commodity, of that coal, would go toward their benefits so they would  have something.   Let me tell you exactly what we have gotten today. The average  miner's pension is $595. We are not talking about thousands of dollars.  Most of this goes to widows whose husbands have passed away. Without  this, they don't have a lifeline. In 2022 it goes away.   The agreement was a sacred promise between workers and the country,  and it captured the best of America and who we are.   But the multiemployer pension system in the United States is in  crisis. As many as 114 multiemployer pension plans, including the  United Mine Workers of America 1974 Pension Plan, are expected to  become insolvent. The miners' pension fund is up first. We are the  first ones on the block. This critical plan, which covers 87,000  retired miners--27,000 in my State alone--and 20,000 fully vested  current workers is projected to be totally insolvent by 2022 or sooner.  If Congress allows these pension funds to go under, the results will be  devastating for retirees and for current employees and the communities  these companies and beneficiaries are members of, including those in  West Virginia. These financial losses will be felt throughout the  communities UMWA retirees live in and spend money in.   We must work together to prevent this catastrophe and shore up  miners' pension plans--pensions they have earned and paid into.   Let me state how most of them became insolvent. It didn't happen  until the 1980s, as far as the bankruptcy laws in America. Bankruptcy  laws in our great country put the financial institution before the  human being who worked for the benefits they earned and paid for. There  has to be a correction. There has to be some right done there because  these miners and workers all over this country basically leave that  money in and pay for their benefits, and, at the end of their work  life, it is gone because of some conglomerate or some type of corporate  takeover or through a bankruptcy. This can't be tolerated any longer.   We could not have passed a permanent fix for miners' healthcare  without the support of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and  President Trump. I have spoken to President Trump about this, and he is  all for it. He is trying to help the miners. He knows what they have  done for the country, and I appreciate his speaking up for coal miners  and hard-working people across the country.   We have no better advocates for securing a healthcare fix than the  retired miners themselves. They come up here day by day, putting a real  face to the families and the challenges they have. They have done this  for years. For years they have walked the halls of Congress. They met  with all of the Members and their staffs. They worked the phones and  wrote letters urging us to keep the promise that was made to them. I  stand by them, leading the fight to make sure retired coal miners'  pensions will not be taken away too. We are not going to let this  happen. I have talked with thousands of West Virginians who will be  devastated if they lost their pensions. We received letters from miners  and their families about the fear and anxiety that comes with not  knowing whether they will be able to pay the mortgage or put food on  the table.   If my good friend the Senator from Indiana will indulge me a little  longer, I want to read about Ricky, from Hewett, WV. He is worried that  if his pension is taken away or reduced, he will not be able to support  his family. He said:         As a retired coal miner my family and I rely greatly on       these very modest benefits. Losing or even having my pension       reduced would cause great hardship on my family. A coal       miner's pension is not very much to start with. I am not       asking for a handout--only what I earned through years of       hard work.    Benny, from Oceana, WV, would have to choose between buying food and  paying utility bills. He said:         I only draw a small pension of $215.96 each month, but if I       lose that I will have to decide between food or utility       bills. I am an older disabled coal miner with a small social       security check. The loss of my pension check would be       devastating.   [[Page S2671]]     Judy, from Sharples, is worried that if she lost her late husband's  pension, she and her grandson wouldn't be able to make it. These are  basically people who have become second parents because the parents  have become dysfunctional. She wrote:         I'm not a rich person, but if I lose my late husband's       pension I will lose everything I have. My husband worked 30       plus years at the mines with the promise that we would be       taken care of. Yes, I get Social Security but that won't       cover my regular bills by itself, not to mention home and car       insurance plus taxes. . . .    After securing healthcare benefits for retired miners, we proved that  Congress can work together and put partisan politics aside. This was  truly done in a bipartisan way. It is a philosophy that I followed  throughout my life in public service and in the West Virginia State  Legislature, as the Governor of the great State of West Virginia, and  now as a U.S. Senator representing the great State of West Virginia.   The coal miners are among the hardest working people in America, and  they spent their lives empowering the Nation and keeping it the  strongest in the world.   I will leave you with this. When people ask: Where are you from? Let  me tell you where I am from. I am from a little State that has the most  patriotic people in the Nation. They have fought in every war and  conflict and shed more blood and lost more lives for the cause of  freedom than most any State. They have done the heavy lifting, mining  the coal, making steel, and building the guns and ships that defend us  every day.   The Good Lord has been so kind to us. He gave us a great venue, my  State of West Virginia. We hope you come, and when you do, we hope you  stay.   Thank you, Mr. President.
