 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, well, Congress has 3 days left to pass  straightforward, short-term funding legislation to prevent the Federal  Government from shutting down. That is 3 more days to provide essential  resources at the current rate of operations before critical government  functions come to a screeching halt.   Let's be absolutely clear about what is at stake. Shutting down the  government is not like pressing ``pause.'' It is not an interlude that  lets us pick up where we left off. It is an actively harmful  proposition. Instead of producing any meaningful policy outcomes, it  would actually take the important progress being made on a number of  key issues and drag it backward.   Back in 2019, our colleagues on the Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs Committee found that over the previous 5 years,  government shutdowns had cost the taxpayer nearly $4 billion--$4  billion. The American people covered at least $3.7 billion in backpay  for Federal workers. Some went to servicemembers, law enforcement  officers, and other frontline personnel who actually stayed on duty.  But some went to cover the equivalent of nearly 57,000 years of work  that Federal employees hadn't even been allowed to complete. And that  is not to mention hundreds of millions of dollars in extra  administrative costs.   America cannot afford for Congress to take government shutdowns  lightly. That is especially true of the crisis at our Nation's southern  border.   The Biden administration's utter failure to secure the border has  been recordbreaking in the worst possible ways. Functionally open  borders have led to alltime high migration and stretched border  security resources literally to a breaking point.   Meanwhile, flows of deadly drugs have made every State actually a  border State. In fact, the Border Patrol reported recently that in the  past year, agents have seized enough fentanyl alone to kill the entire  population of the United States.   Time and again, government shutdowns have made the essential work of  the Border Patrol and ICE even harder.   Many of our colleagues have pointed out how border security  personnel, like the Armed Forces, would work through a shutdown without  pay, but the full consequences go beyond financial hardship. As our  colleagues' 2019 report found, past shutdowns have delayed important  maintenance and repair  [[Page S4731]]  work that ``endangered the lives of law enforcement officers and  created significant border security vulnerabilities.'' They have forced  officials to cancel tens of thousands of immigration hearings, and they  have taken the Department of Homeland Security's employee E-Verify  system completely offline.   Shutting down the government is a choice, and it is a choice that  would make the crisis at the southern border even worse.   I am encouraged that many of our colleagues who share my concerns are  working to ensure that the short-term funding measure we pass this week  gives the men and women of Border Patrol and ICE critical resources  while we continue our work to clean up Washington Democrats' mess.                             Biden Administration    Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, this week, the Senate  will have the opportunity to push back one more time on a pair of  shortsighted Biden administrative policies with major consequences for  small businesses and landowners across America.   Earlier this year, thanks to the leadership of our colleagues, the  junior Senator for Kansas and the junior Senator for Oklahoma, the  Senate passed two resolutions disapproving of President Biden's  decision to up-list two creatures--the lesser prairie-chicken and the  northern long-eared bat--as endangered species.   As is so often the case under the Endangered Species Act, this move  by Washington bureaucrats would encroach on private property rights and  block infrastructure and economic development in the name of preserving  habitat. As many as 37 States would be affected by the designation of  the northern long-eared bat as ``endangered,'' and nearly $14 billion  in agricultural production would be affected by the designation of the  lesser prairie-chicken.   Now, in reality, aerial estimates show that numbers of lesser  prairie-chickens have grown from less than 17,000 in 2013 to over  26,000 in 2022, and the President's own experts admit that the  declining population of northern long-eared bats is mostly explained by  disease, not humans. Of course, that hasn't stopped the Biden  administration from pushing ahead with a plan to infringe on property  rights, impede urgent infrastructure, and put even more of America's  energy abundance literally out of reach.   So I would like to thank Senator Marshall and Senator Mullin for  their leadership on this resolution, and I would like to urge each of  our colleagues to join me in voting to override the President's veto.
