 Mr. Speaker, in June 2016, a gunman opened fire in the  Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, killing 49 people, including Jerry  Wright, a Miami Heat fan who loved to dance.   Jerry Wright's parents, Fred and Maria, know that their son's death  was preventable but, more than that, that it was not unusual.   Nearly 40,000 people die because of guns every year, and that is why  Fred and Maria lead the local Moms Demand Action group in my district.  I am so proud to learn from them and work with them on commonsense gun  safety in Miami-Dade and around the country.   By mandating universal background checks for every gun sale, we can  be a step closer to ensuring that, when our children go to school, to  concerts, to movie theaters, to clubs, they do so safely, they do so  without worrying that this dance might be their last.   Fred and Maria Wright aren't asking for an overhaul of the Second  Amendment; they are just asking for the adoption of commonsense  solutions.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join us in preventing firearms  from falling into the wrong hands by supporting H.R. 8.                            ____________________
