 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this resolution is the legislative equivalent of  fiddling while Rome is burning. Our President takes to the world stage  to side with a hostile foreign power over his own intelligence  services. Here at home he engages in government-sponsored child abuse  in the form of a family separation policy that continues to terrorize  children as young as 6 months.   This nonbinding resolution before us would do nothing to bring about  a fair and just immigration system. In fact, it would do nothing at  all. It is just a meaningless political stunt to change the subject  from the international and domestic shame unleashed on us by President  Trump.   The President imposed the family separation policy, and his  administration never even considered how to ensure that the children  would eventually reunite with their families. Now, nearly 3,000  children remain separated, and they do not know when, or even if, they  will ever see their parents again. Many of these children were ripped  from the arms of their mothers and fathers, and their anguish is  unimaginable.   But this bill would do nothing to reverse this disastrous and cruel  family separation policy. It would do nothing to ensure that parents  and children are accurately tracked so that families can be reunited,  and it would do nothing to address the horrendous conditions separated  children are being subjected to.   For example, 14-month-old Baby M--we must use a pseudonym--was  separated from his mother for 85 days at 14 months and he returned so  full of dirt and lice that it appeared he had not been bathed the  entire time he was in Federal custody. His mother Olivia  [[Page H6488]]  says that he is not the same since they were reunited, and he cries  whenever he does not see her out of fear that he might be left alone  again.   Mr. Speaker, this is a humanitarian crisis. We do not have the time  to waste with political stunts like this bill while the moral fiber of  our country is torn apart.   I will be voting ``present'' on this bill, because I have no desire  to play the Republican's immoral games right now. We have much more  important things to do.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren), the ranking Democrat on the Immigration and  Border Security Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, what is disgusting is for Congress to sit  idly by while children are ripped from the arms of their parents and  abused.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington  (Ms. Jayapal).  [[Page H6489]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds.   Yes, every Democrat voted against H.R. 6136, which provided for  indefinite detention of entire families, among other obnoxious  provisions. So did many Republicans, thank God.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Hoyer), the distinguished Democratic whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Gutierrez), the distinguished gentleman and a member of  the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Wisconsin an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Costa).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from California an  additional 15 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time remains for each  side.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished Democratic leader of the  House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Perlmutter).    Mr. Speaker, we are prepared to close. I yield the  balance of my time to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Castro).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
