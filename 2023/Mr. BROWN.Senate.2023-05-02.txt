 I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise in support of the CRA that we will  be voting on soon. This vote presents a pretty simple choice: Do you  stand with American manufacturers and American workers or do you stand  with China and do you stand with our continuing to lose our industrial  base?   I fought my whole career for fair trade. One of my first and proudest  votes was against the North American Free Trade Agreement, as a Member  of the House. We saw what that agreement did to Vermont, did to Ohio,  and did to Kansas--and Senator Moran just spoke. We saw what NAFTA did.   These trade fights are not a new fight. Some years ago--about 20  years ago--when I was a Member of the House, I wrote a book called  ``Myths of Free Trade.'' The book wasn't exactly a bestseller. I can  live with that. But telling the truth on trade has not been popular in  this town--by Presidents of both parties, majorities in Congress, and  corporate leaders and CEOs who were lobbying Congress.   Essentially, these trade agreements sold out American workers. These  trade agreements were signed or, at least, negotiated by American  Presidents and voted for by far too many Members of Congress, lobbied  by the most powerful interest groups in Washington.   I remember that during NAFTA--there were two things during NAFTA,  particularly. One was that someone said that there were more corporate  jets at National Airport than they had ever seen, because CEOs were all  flying in to push for NAFTA--to get us to vote for NAFTA--because it  was more money in their pockets because it was fewer dollars in  workers' pockets. The other thing I remember was one of the--this was a  two-party thing. Democrats were pretty bad. Republicans were actually  slightly worse. But both parties were guilty, and Presidents from both  parties--from Trump and all the way back to Clinton, since I came here.   One of the Democratic leaders on this issue in the House said to me:  You know, I hate these congressional recesses because when our Members  go home and go to county fairs and start meeting with people, they  decide that they don't think NAFTA is such a great idea.   So every time we went home, this guy, who was a Member of Congress  who was pushing for NAFTA, had more work to do because the more the  public heard from workers--the more that Congressman heard from workers  and  [[Page S1455]]  from the public--the less they liked this agreement. Workers from Ohio  and around the country watched the people who are supposed to represent  them and stand up for them sell out to corporations again and again.   Let me tell you a real quick story. I grew up in Mansfield, OH, an  industrial city at the time that was roughly halfway between Cleveland  and Columbus. I worked on a family farm nearby through most of my teen  years. But I remember walking the halls at a school called Johnny  Appleseed Junior High. In Johnny Appleseed Junior High, I walked the  halls with the sons and daughters of electrical workers at  Westinghouse, autoworkers at General Motors, rubberworkers at Mansfield  Tire, and machinists at Tappan Stove; and with the sons and daughters  of trades people, laborers, electricians, insulators, sheet metal  workers, plumbers, pipefitters, and operating engineers.   Those kids had a chance in life. Those kids had a pretty good solid  middle-class life because their parents carried a union card. They had  that advantage. We were a country where management would sit down with  workers, and they would negotiate. Management would do well, not the  kind of $10 million-a-year CEO salaries as today, but they would do  well. But workers would do well and be able to buy a car and a decent  home and send their kids to Mansfield OSU or North Central Technical  College or whatever.   By the time I got to Mansfield High School, you could see those jobs  starting to be lost. By the time, years later, when I represented  Mansfield in the legislature, so many of those jobs were gone because  those companies were using words like--first, they moved south for  cheap labor. Then they moved to Mexico. Then they moved to China.   Those companies were moving their production overseas in the name of  ``efficiency.'' Efficiency is always business school speak for lower  wages: We want more efficiency. Actually, we really want lower wages,  but we can't say that in public.   Corporations searched the globe for cheap labor. First, they shut  down production in Mansfield, OH, and Toledo and Dayton. Then they  moved to Alabama and Mississippi. Wages were low, and the unions were  not particularly active there because the governments in those States  kept them out, and the businesses kept them out. Then those wages  weren't cheap enough, and that is when they started going overseas.   They lobbied for tax breaks and bad trade deals always in search of  lower wages. And, you know, Wall Street would reward them over and  over.   Norfolk Southern I pay attention to because of their irresponsibility  and greed and what they did to a community in my State. Every time they  lay off workers--Norfolk Southern laid off a third of its workforce in  the past 2 years. Every time they lay off workers, their quarterly  earnings report gets a little better, and their profits get a little  better.   What does Wall Street do? Wall Street rewards them with a higher  stock price. Then what happens is those CEOs and top executives are  able to cash in, in a bigger and bigger way, with stock buybacks and  other ways.   So look at where we have ended up because of this corporate- dominated, corporate-ridden trade policy. An Ohioan invented the light  bulb. Today, 99 percent of LED bulbs are made in China. On the west  coast, an American invented the semiconductor. Today, 90 percent of  them are made overseas. We cannot and will not make that mistake again  with the technologies that power our economy over the next century.   We have heard a lot of talk in the Senate over the past year about  supporting manufacturing and innovation so we can better compete with  China. Senator Cornyn is on the floor. He and Senator Casey are working  on a really important bill on corporate outsourcing that I hope we  pass, and it will absolutely matter. It is why, in the end, we passed  the CHIPS Act, to bring semiconductor production back home where it  belongs.   We passed a bipartisan infrastructure bill. I worked with Senator  Portman, the other Senator from Ohio, on that and on a number of other  bills that rebuild our bridges and roads.   We passed the Inflation Reduction Act to make sure we lead the world  in new renewable energy technologies, like solar.   But, now, suspending those solar tariffs is antithetical to the good  work we did. We take four steps forward and, today, move three steps  backward. That is not the progress we need.   President Biden has talked about how we are essentially--and I have  been talking to him about this, and he has been repeating it--that we  are burying the term ``Rust Belt'' in my part of the country. You can't  say you want American manufacturing to lead the world and then allow  Chinese companies, subsidized always by their government, to skirt the  rules and dump solar panels in the United States.   We have in my State--I believe it is still--the largest solar  manufacturing company in America. First Solar employs 2,000 workers in  Northwest Ohio. These workers are ready to lead the world in this  industry. They just need a level playing field.   We know China cheats. The Chinese Government, as they have for  generations--unfortunately, American politicians helped them do it, and  American corporations helped them do it, and we build up the Chinese  military that now we are concerned with.   China illegally subsidizes industry, from steel to solar. They have  been doing it for years. They are always coming up with new ways to  cheat. It is sort of a Whac-A-Mole problem, where we stop this  cheating, and then it goes somewhere else. We stop that, and it goes  somewhere else.   We put tariffs on their illegally dumped products, and they move some  aspect of production to other nearby countries to get around those  rules. They move to Cambodia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Vietnam, and wherever  they can find to cheat and to ignore the rules.   Blame them--and I certainly do--but we have allowed it. We have  allowed it because American politicians, Presidents of both parties,  and far too many people in this Chamber--I would certainly say the  Presiding Officer is an exception to that--far too many people in this  body have gone along with it as corporate America has lobbied and  lobbied and lobbied aggressively.   This isn't just a guess. The administration's own Commerce Department  conducted an independent investigation. They released preliminary  results in December. And surprise, surprise, they found that, yes, four  leading Chinese solar cell manufacturers are dodging U.S. tariffs by  routing some of their operations through Southeast Asia.   We can't let them keep doing it.   That is what this vote today is about. It has real consequences for  our leadership in my State in manufacturing and for American leadership  in one of the leading energy industries of the future.   To my colleagues who say we must allow these Chinese imports for the  time being in order to fight climate change, I disagree. Nobody in this  body is more concerned and more active in terms of understanding  environmental issues. As a senior in high school, I started the first  Earth Day in Richland County in 1970. My commitment is absolute.   But when people say this is about climate change, surely, it isn't.  It is about ceding our leadership to other countries, and it will not  result in long-term success.   American workers must know we have their backs. They need to know  they aren't a little side issue: We are for workers, except when we are  doing this; we are for workers, except when we are doing that.   If you believe in the dignity of work, if you put workers at the  center of our economic policy, it makes things better. We have seen how  dangerous it is when we cede American leadership to other countries in  key industries like semiconductors. Now we play catch up.   American workers have proven they can make these solar panels. It is  not a hypothetical. Americans are manufacturing solar panels that can  power our economy right now, today. They need a level playing field.   How are businesses going to expand and scale up production if they  are constantly dealing with a flood--I mean a flood, one after another  after another wave--of illegally subsidized imports? It comes down, as  the Presiding Officer knows, to whose side are you on? Do you stand  with workers in Ohio or stand with the Chinese Communist Party? Do you  stand with the American solar industry or do you stand  [[Page S1456]]  with the solar industry in a country that cheats time after time?   It is that simple. If you love this country, you fight for the people  who make it work.   I ask my colleagues to join me in standing up for workers in Ohio and  around the country.    Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Linda  Robertson in honor of her storied career in public service, including  as a key member of the Federal Reserve's staff for over 13 years. Her  career has touched many of the most important economic events of the  past 40 years.   Originally from Oklahoma, Linda first came to Washington to work for  Congressman Jim Jones. She quickly made her mark working on taxation  and finance matters both in his office and for the Committee on Ways  and Means. It was in this job that she had a front row seat to the 1986  tax reform effort made famous by books like ``Showdown at Gucci  Gulch.'' While continuing her work in Congress during the day, she  attended classes at night to earn her master of laws in taxation.   Based on her exceptional congressional experience and knowledge of  policy, Linda was later nominated and confirmed to serve as Assistant  Secretary for Legislative Affairs and Public Liaison at the U.S.  Department of the Treasury. Following her service at the Treasury  Department, she worked as the top public advocate for Johns Hopkins  University and Johns Hopkins Medicine.   Linda returned to public service in August 2009 as an assistant to  the Federal Reserve Board and head of its congressional liaison office.  She began this position at a time of immense challenge for the country  and as Congress and our regulatory Agencies worked to stabilize the  financial system following the great recession of 2008.   From the global financial crisis through the pandemic, Linda has  served as a trusted advisor to the Federal Reserve Board and has played  an invaluable role in keeping Congress and the public apprised of the  Federal Reserve's work to fulfill its mandates on behalf of the  American people. Federal Reserve Board Chairs Bernanke, Yellen, and  Powell all benefited from Linda's experience and dedication to public  service.   Linda also returned to Treasury in 2021 to advise Secretary Yellen as  she became the first woman to serve as Treasury Secretary. Linda's work  was vital last year when we confirmed President Biden's slate of  Federal Reserve Board nominees. With her countless hours of hard work,  we were able to confirm a full Federal Reserve Board, something that  had not been done in nearly a decade.   Linda's lasting legacy also includes those that she worked with and  mentored throughout her career. Those that had the privilege of  learning from her wisdom have gone on to fill positions throughout  Washington. One of Linda's former interns from her time at the Treasury  Department is my scheduler, Diana Baron, also from Oklahoma, who has  been with me on my staff for nearly 25 years. I am sure many of my  colleagues have similar stories.   Her commitment to public service, formidable talent, and immense  knowledge will be missed by those at the Federal Reserve and many of us  on Capitol Hill, particularly those of us on the Banking, Housing, and  Urban Affairs Committee. I wish Linda much success in her next chapter  which--without hearings to prep for or bills to review--I expect will  include ample time spent with family and friends.                            ____________________
