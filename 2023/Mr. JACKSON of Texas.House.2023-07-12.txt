 Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman of the  committee for yielding me time.   Mr. Chairman, the NDAA is one of the most important bills that comes  before Congress. Not only does this NDAA ensure that we have the  weapons systems and equipment our servicemembers need, it makes a  needed course correction to restore the military's focus to fighting  and winning wars.   Provisions I authored scale back the administration's woke agenda,  prohibit funds for ESG, and restore the apolitical nature of the  Attending Physician to Congress.   This year's NDAA also keeps Texas' 13th Congressional District at the  heart of supporting our military. The NDAA revitalizes the pilot  training mission at Sheppard Air Force Base and accelerates the T-7 Red  Hawk program.   It provides funding for massive infrastructure improvements in the  Pantex Plant in Amarillo and supports Bell Helicopter's development of  the new V-280 aircraft.   Last, I give a special thanks to my defense fellow, Nate Langley, for  his outstanding work in my office throughout this year. Nate is a  rising star in the Air Force and has an extremely bright future in the  military.   Mr. Chairman, I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  to support this NDAA.
