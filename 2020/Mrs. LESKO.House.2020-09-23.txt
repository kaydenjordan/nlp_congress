 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman McGovern for yielding me  the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this rule consists of two bills, including H.R. 4447,  the Democrat's energy package. It consists of 38 bills with a total  cost of $135 billion. The bill includes burdensome mandates and an  incredibly high price tag.   Mr. Speaker, let's be clear, Republicans support reducing carbon  dioxide emissions in the United States by scaling up clean energy  innovation with less regulation. Unfortunately, this bill adds new  regulatory hurdles that make the clean energy technology deployment  much more difficult to build. Regulations hurt innovations, especially  at such a high price tag.  [[Page H4727]]    The bill fails to put forward policies that will reform the  permitting and licensing process required to finance, build, expand,  and modernize energy infrastructure. Instead, the bill spends billions  of dollars on unfocused research without spending money on investments  and infrastructure.   Republicans have introduced numerous bills this Congress that will  build, expand, and modernize our energy infrastructure.                                time  1130    They remove regulatory barriers to building nuclear, natural gas, and  hydropower infrastructure. These are all clean and reliable sources of  generation that will power America, protect the environment, and keep  our country secure.   The mandates contained in the bill will drive up energy and  transportation costs for American consumers. For example, one of the  mandates in the bill will mandate energy efficiency building codes,  which the home building industry says will drive up the cost of housing  to consumers without proportional savings in energy costs.   H.R. 4447 will lead our country down the wrong path. We don't want to  California the Nation with blackouts and high utility costs. Even  minority groups are suing California utilities over their high energy  costs. And believe it or not, California utilities actually pay Arizona  for their renewable energy to take it off of their hands during certain  times of the year. That is totally insane.   I regularly meet with constituents and companies in Arizona who say  they moved from California to Arizona because California's incredibly  burdensome regulations stifle growth. California's current energy  crisis was predictable and avoidable, but they ignored the scientists  and engineers who maintain the electric grid and, instead, mandated  their own version of the Green New Deal. In doing so, California forced  the retirement of stable baseload power generation without a reliable  option in place.   The Democrats may claim that H.R. 4447 is a bipartisan bill. While it  includes some bipartisan provisions, it is not a bipartisan bill. It  was crafted solely by Democrats with no input from Republicans. Many of  the provisions amount to billions of dollars of new and overlapping  programs that had little to no process or regular order.   I sit on the Rules Committee, where my colleagues reminisce regularly  about how we used to operate through a committee system with regular  order: a legislative hearing, a subcommittee markup, a full complete  markup. Apparently, those days are gone. Now the Democrats legislate by  posting a one-sided bill one week and putting it on the floor the  following week.   Public laws do not come out of this process well, only partisan  politics and messaging bills. We all know that.   Mr. Speaker, this rule also contains H.R. 6270, the Uyghur Forced  Labor Disclosure Act.   The United States is an honorable and noble country that must not  tolerate the gross human rights abuses perpetrated by Chinese leaders.  While the bill takes strong action to ensure American businesses are  not complicit in China's forced labor programs, there are outstanding  concerns in the bill that may harm U.S. businesses.   For instance, the bill requires public companies to file disclosures  with the SEC if they imported manufactured goods or other materials  that originated in or are sourced in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous  Region and disclose whether those goods originated in forced labor  camps. These entities would also have to disclose the nature and extent  of the commercial activity related to each good or material, the gross  revenue and net profits attributable, and whether they intend to  continue importing the good.   China's atrocities against Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups  must come to an end, and we voted on that bill yesterday in a  bipartisan fashion. We must ensure that items made with forced labor  are not allowed to enter our markets.   To do our jobs properly in Congress, we must allow bills to run their  course through committees for proper debate, discovery, and amending.   Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), my good friend, the ranking member of the Rules  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the  rule to immediately consider Small Business Committee Ranking Member    Steve Chabot's H.R. 8265 to reopen the Paycheck Protection Program to  America's 30 million small businesses.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, this amendment would ensure our Nation's  smallest and most vulnerable firms get the support they need by  allowing an opportunity for a second PPP loan with specific funds set  aside for small businesses with 10 or fewer employees, expand the list  of eligible covered expenses, simplify the loan forgiveness process,  and extend PPP through the end of 2020.   I think all of us can agree that this is very vital for our small  businesses and their workers in America.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Katko), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, wow, that was an impassioned speech by the chairman, but  I have to remind the chairman that there were a lot of Democrat liberal  wish lists in the relief package that were passed, including releasing  prisoners that were 50 years old and older--didn't matter what they  were charged with--from prison and giving $1,200 relief payments to  illegal immigrants using taxpayer dollars.   So maybe if Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats would have actually  talked to Republicans before they pushed through a bill, there would  have been more bipartisan support to help small businesses and the  American people.   With this previous question and the amendment, we are trying to do  just that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr.  Bacon), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I can guarantee Chairman McGovern, if we  defeat the previous question, my amendment is what will be brought up  to help small businesses and their workers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Reed).    Boy, I have read some media reports where actually there  were members of the Democratic Party in the U.S. House of  Representatives in swing districts who pleaded with Speaker Pelosi to  have a relief package, and she is the one who said: Oh, no.   So I have to respectfully disagree with the gentleman's analogy.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Chabot).    Mr. Speaker, I can guarantee that if we were in the  majority, we would be able to do a relief package that didn't include  liberal wish lists that could actually pass the Senate and get signed  into law.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr.  Kevin Hern).    Mr. Speaker, again, if the so-called HEROES Act would not  have been chock-full of a bunch of liberal wish lists but only  concentrated on things that Republicans and Democrats could have  actually agreed to and would have passed the Senate and then signed  into law, we would have had relief to the American people by now. But I  would assume that Chairman McGovern knows that there were certain  things in that bill that they knew in advance that the Republicans  weren't going to go for, like releasing prisoners into the communities.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington  (Ms. Herrera Beutler).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, at a time when many Americans are struggling  with the economic fallout from the ongoing pandemic, it is unfortunate  that the Democratic majority is not coming up with solutions that can  actually be signed into law. We need to negotiate with the Republicans  in the Senate and the President and the Democrats together. That is  what America wants.   Instead, in this rule, we are focusing on a Green New Deal-type of  energy package--one that didn't work so well in California, as can be  attested to by their rolling blackouts and other energy crises.   Mr. Speaker, I would call on us to defeat the previous question so  that we can add the amendment to, at least, help the small businesses  and their workers. This is something we can do together.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' on the previous question, ``no'' on the  underlying measure, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
