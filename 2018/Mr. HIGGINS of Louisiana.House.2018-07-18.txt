 Mr. Speaker, for weeks now, the abolish ICE  movement has been growing in popularity on the left with many Democrats  embracing this radical policy stance.   I find it extremely ironic that calls to abolish the Immigration and  Customs Enforcement Agency come only 1 year after 159 House Democrats  voted to pass landmark legislation introduced by my colleague, Chairman   Michael McCaul, reauthorizing ICE and other DHS agencies for the first  time since their inception after 9/11.   Mr. Speaker, calls to abolish ICE are reckless, dangerous to  America's national security, and threaten the well-being of our ICE  agents. As a member of the thin blue line, this attack on ICE is  personal to me.   The men and women of ICE serve as America's frontline defenders  against human, drug, and weapons traffickers. ICE agents locate,  arrest, and deport violent gang members and criminal aliens who  threaten public safety.   Last year alone, ICE arrested more than 127,000 criminal aliens  responsible for: 76,000 drug offenses, 48,000 assault offenses, 11,000  weapons offenses, 5,000 sexual assault offenses, 2,000 kidnapping  offenses, and 1,800 homicide offenses.   Further, ICE agents made more than 4,800 gang-related arrests,  rescued 518 victims of human trafficking, and seized 1 million pounds  of narcotics last year.   The campaign against ICE is the latest rallying cry for open borders,  the latest call to prioritize illegal immigrants over American  citizens, and the latest shrill cacophony from the left to vilify and  demonize frontline law enforcement in America.   Democrats are making it very clear to the American people that they  stand against efforts to secure America's borders. Americans  overwhelmingly support law and order. I speak for a coalition of  conservative Members of Congress as I introduce this resolution  affirming support for ICE personnel and condemning the dangerous call  from the left to abolish ICE.   Let me state further that affirming support for ICE should not be the  end of our efforts. We should be doing more to secure our borders and  provide frontline defenders with the resources necessary to accomplish  their mission, and we should end dangerous sanctuary policies.   Today the House will vote on our resolution formally stating  congressional support for ICE personnel and their mission.                                time  1400    Despite the rhetoric being pushed by the left, the American people  support Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Their service should be  respected. Very soon, we the people will know where every Member of  this Congress stands.   Mr. Speaker, it saddens me to say it has been brought to my attention  that some of my colleagues across the aisle plan to vote ``present'' on  today's resolution. I would remind them that our constituents elected  us as their voice in the people's House. We were not elected to be  silent. The American people deserve to know where every Member of this  body stands. To vote ``present'' on this resolution reflects fear. The  American citizenry deserves a courageous vote.   I urge my colleagues to look into their hearts, vote on this  resolution reflective of your own deepest belief, and, as you do so,  remember that we all have been elected to serve American citizens,  American interests, and America's future.
