Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Georgia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, tonight, as we come before the  body, we have come back on a topic we have been here before on. It is  really the hidden enemy, I guess if you would, of people and trying to  get a drug pricing system, something where their community pharmacist,  the independent pharmacist, it is that middle man called the PBM, the  pharmacy benefit manager, who simply snuck in many years ago.                                time  2015    It originally started as a good idea so that you could collaborate,  you could get better drug pricing, you could get it to the consumer  through rebates and through concessions. And as in all things, I guess,  good ideas and greed just get in the way sometimes.   We are at a point where this is an issue that I want to continue to  highlight. We are going to do so in several ways. We are going to talk  about some issues. I spoke with colleagues on the floor before about  the really terrible actions of many in the PBM community, especially  the largest ones that control over 80 percent of the market. There are  only three of those that really control almost the entire marketplace  of this and control plans that folks would understand very quickly.  They control where you go, how much you pay, the formularies. It is  down to that kind of a problem.   Last year, when the world began to wake up to these issues of pricing  and all of this came to light, they began to question why these drugs  were costing so much, such as the EpiPen. Well, what they began to find  out was that these were problematic issues. But if you wanted to really  look at the baseline, you had to look at the pharmacy benefit managers,  and you had to understand what they were doing that was causing a great  deal of problems.   We also have to go back to the basics. Community and independent  pharmacists fill a critical niche in the healthcare system, serving the  primary healthcare providers for over 62 million Americans. Community  pharmacists are some of the most easily accessible health  professionals, particularly in our rural areas.   Mr. Speaker, this is an area that I really have talked about before.  We talk about the healthcare chain being a complete chain, and it is  not just the doctors and the hospitals; it is the pharmacist who is  typically the face of healthcare for those after they have gone to  their doctors or come out from the hospital to get the medicine that  will continue to keep them healthy.   You see, community pharmacists dispense roughly 40 percent of  prescriptions nationwide, and a higher percentage in rural areas, such  as mine. These community pharmacists regularly interact with their  patients outside the pharmacy. They go to church with them. They go to  shop with them at the local grocery store. The pharmacies are the  sponsors of kids' Little League teams. They are the ones who have the  closest personal relationships to the healthcare chain, and they are a  trusted source of medical care and advice.   Pharmacists are also able to better treat patients' illnesses with  their regular interactions, identifying potential risk factors early  on. For example, independent community pharmacists play a key role in  ensuring a patient properly uses their medication. In fact, 83 percent  of community pharmacists perform the critical patient-care role of  providing medication adherent services. Patients' failure to properly  take their medication costs the healthcare system almost $3 billion and  contributes to 125,000 deaths annually.   Face-to-face counseling by a trusted pharmacist has proven to be the  most effective method for ensuring patients take their medications,  saving thousands of lives and billions of dollars annually.   Mr. Speaker, independent and community pharmacists provide multiple  and valuable services, and we can talk about these services and the  importance of a community pharmacist. I would be remiss if I did not  mention the recent and tragic passing of someone known well in the  pharmacists' community for his contributions there.   While I did not know John Carson personally, his death had  reverberations throughout the pharmacists' community. Mr. Carson was  from San Antonio, Texas, and owned and ran his business there, Oakdell  Pharmacy, for almost 50 years. He and his wife were tragically killed  in a car accident on July 7, but the legacy Mr. Carson left behind as a  father, a pharmacist, and former president of both the Texas Pharmacy  Association and the National Community Pharmacists Association will  live on. Tonight we mourn his passing but celebrate his achievements.   I could mention individual pharmacists and their work on behalf of  their patients for the rest of the evening, and I could have probably  every Member of this body do the same. Instead, I will provide some  information that shows the great impact on services the individuals  have had.   Sixty-five percent of community pharmacists offer home or work  delivery; 68 percent of community pharmacists offer immunizations; 83  percent provide medication therapy and management services; and 67  percent of community pharmacists provide monetary support to five or  more community organizations. These are the guys you see sponsoring the  Little League teams, the chili cook-offs, and that are true  participants in our neighborhoods and towns.   Unfortunately, the community pharmacists are in jeopardy across the  country, in part, due to anticompetitive behavior and the lack of  transparency surrounding practices of the pharmacy benefit managers.  They have taken our community pharmacist, and they have abused their  trust. Pharmacy benefit managers, especially in the system that we have  today, are trying, I believe personally, to get rid of our community  independent pharmacists because they have their own chain, their own  distribution, and they own the supply chain. When they do, they want to  take everything else out, and we have talked about that on many  occasions here.   So as we continue tonight, we are going to talk about these issues,  as we go from pharmacists and what they have done well, some new issues  that have come to light, some lawsuits, also some audits that have come  out that show the real problem that we are seeing with this community,  and also that  [[Page H5912]]  they are having, but also just being run out of business.   Imagine, Mr. Speaker, if you were just trying to get up every day and  run your own business, and you had a giant conglomerate tell you and  tell your customers that they can't come see you anymore, not give you  a reason. And if they are mistaken, they make you correct thei mistake.  I don't know how it operates in the rest of the world, but that isn't  the way a business is supposed to operate.    At this point in the evening, I have several of my friends from  Georgia who are here to talk about these issues. First off is my friend  from south Georgia; another one, who has been with me on many of these  occasions, a Member who has seen this up close and personal, to talk  about the issues that we have tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Austin  Scott), someone we have been working with on the Armed Services  Committee on a lot of things that are going on.   Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  our Nation's community pharmacies which play a critical role in our  healthcare system.   Many of these independent businesses operate in underserved or rural  areas--like many of the counties in Georgia's Eighth Congressional  District, which I represent--where access to carriers is already an  issue and would be worse if community pharmacies did not exist.   In areas where a doctor can be many miles away, local pharmacists  deliver flu shots, give advice on over-the-counter drugs, and help with  those late-night drugstore runs for a sick child. Many people in our  rural communities see their pharmacists much more often than their  doctors. There is a very personal relationship between the pharmacist,  the patient, and the physician.   As pillars in their community, they are also the businesses that  contribute greatly to local economies. It is crucial that these  pharmacies have an equitable playing field against large-scale  competitors and middleman pharmacy benefit managers when trying to run  a successful business in a challenging and complex environment.   I want to reiterate, Mr. Speaker, all they ask for is an equitable  playing field. No advantages, just equality. Where I am from, local  pharmacists are often a fixture in their communities. These pharmacists  have known most of their customers all of their lives. They instill a  level of trust that is unparalleled.   I frequently stop in at local community pharmacies when I am back  home in the district and never fail to appreciate the unique value they  add to their customers' lives. Unfortunately, on some of these visits,  I am also troubled to learn how community pharmacies are finding it  extremely difficult to serve the people who have depended on them for  years and to compete with some of the larger entities in the healthcare  marketplace.   Take, for example, the increased prevalence of preferred networks in  Medicare part D plans. Currently, many Medicaid beneficiaries are told  by pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, which pharmacy to use based on  exclusionary arrangements between those PBMs and, for the most part,  big-box pharmacies. What most people don't know is that, in fact, in  several instances, these big-box pharmacies actually own the PBMs that  are creating these preferred networks.   Patients must pay higher copays just because the pharmacy they want  to use is excluded by the PBM, who again, as I said, in many cases,  actually own the larger pharmacy that they force you to do business  with. The majority of the time, the hometown pharmacy is never given  the opportunity to participate in the network in the first place.   Another issue I often hear about from community pharmacies is the  burdensome DIR fees. Most Americans probably assume that it is a pretty  simple transaction when they purchase medication from their local  pharmacy. They go in, they pay a copay, and that is the end of it.   But for the pharmacy, the transaction is anything but clear and  simple. Pharmacy benefit managers use so-called DIR fees to claw back  money from pharmacies on the individual claims long after the claim is  thought to have been resolved. That means that a pharmacy often doesn't  know the final reimbursement amount they will receive for a claim for  weeks, or even months.   Anyone who runs a pharmacy, or any other small business for that  matter, knows you can't operate when you don't know what your  reimbursements are. When competition is stifled and these small  businesses suffer, so do hardworking Americans when they have had their  choice to use a community pharmacy instead of a big-box business taken  away from them.   Another issue I frequently hear about is the lack of transparency in  generic drug reimbursements to pharmacies. Generic prescription drugs  account for approximately 80 percent of drugs dispensed. The  reimbursement system for these medications is largely unregulated and a  complete mystery to all of us. Now, if it is unregulated with  transparency, that is fine. But it is unregulated without any  transparency.   Pharmacists are often reimbursed for generics by what is referred to  as the maximum allowable cost list created by the pharmacy benefit  managers. But the methodologies used to create these lists are not  disclosed, nor are the lists updated on a regular basis, which  frequently results in pharmacists being reimbursed below the actual  acquisition cost for various medications.   In recent years, these extra costs that affect prescription drug  prices in community pharmacies have fallen on consumers. Take  doxycycline, for example. Doxycycline is a drug that is used to treat a  number of bacterial infections. As a generic antibiotic, it has been  around for decades. I want to repeat: it is a generic that has been  around for decades. In 2012, 30 capsules of doxycycline cost  approximately $15. In 2017, the same dosage cost $115. That is a price  increase of 667 percent.   I want to give you a real-world example of the impact this has on  low-income patients in the world. I have a wonderful OB-GYN in my area,  and he told me that prior to the price increase, he would simply keep  doxycycline in his office, and when he had a patient that needed it, he  could simply give the patient--if it was a low-income patient--the  drugs instead of having them go to the pharmacy to pick them up. But  with a 667 percent price increase, they could no longer affor to simply  give the patients the medication that they need.    Nitroglycerin tablets are another example. Nitroglycerin has been  used to treat chest pain and stop a heart attack and has seen similar  price hikes in the past few years. Again, it is a generic drug that has  been around for decades--no excuse in the price increases other than  flat out greed.   A drug that is even more common that has been affected by the lack of  transparency in the drug market is insulin. As you may know, millions  of Americans with diabetes rely on insulin. They have to have it, or  they will simply die. According to the American Diabetes Association,  the price of insulin in America has nearly tripled over the past 15  years, making the drug nearly unaffordable for many diabetic patients.   The dramatic price hikes of insulin is ironic since, in the early  1920s, Frederick Banting, one of the scientists who helped to first  develop insulin, sold the patent for the drug for $3 because their goal  was to make the drug affordable and easy to access for everybody in the  world.   Now, nearly 100 years later, one vial of Humalog can cost nearly $400  in the United States, where it costs a fraction of that in other  countries around the world. In Canada and Mexico, the same dosage of  Humalog costs less than half, or sometimes even a quarter of what it  costs in the United States.   I understand that there is a tremendous cost in developing lifesaving  treatments, new drugs, and the next development that is going to save a  cancer patient, but these are generic drugs that have been around for  decades. These dramatic price increases, the international price  disparities, they are occurring, again, on drugs that have been around  for decades because of this pricing scam put in place by the pharmacy  benefit managers.   In the coming months, I look forward to continuing to work with my  colleagues to address the lack of transparency in the pharmaceutical  industry, giving community pharmacies an equitable playing field to  compete,  [[Page H5913]]  which gives hardworking Americans the choice of affordable prescription  drugs and which pharmacy they choose to purchase those drugs from.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman, Mr. Collins, for hosting  this Special Order today.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend. We have been  talking about this, and I think what is amazing is, the more we have  these, and the more we talk about community pharmacists and the issues  that we find, people are starting to understand the real problem that  exists here.   Mr. Speaker, more than 250,000 individuals employed either on a full- time or part-time basis by community pharmacies, these people's  livelihoods are facing consequential threats due to the often  anticompetitive behavior of pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs.   Many people may have never heard of a PBM. Well, let's give them a  definition tonight. PBMs are middlemen who administer prescription drug  plans. In fact, three primary middlemen control 78--almost 80 percent-- of the market and control the pharmacy benefits of over 253 million  Americans.                                time  2030    PBMs process prescriptions for groups that pay for drugs and control  drug formulation to determine what drugs are covered by specific plans.   The three major PBMs--Express Scripts, CVS Caremark Health, and  OptumRx--produce no tangible product. Let me repeat that. These three  produce no tangible product. Yet they have a major impact on the way  you and I access medication, on small business pharmacies, and even  other small business PBMs.   If you don't believe me, just the other day, I was watching a  business show, and there was a PBM--there was a transparent PBM who  talked through this whole issue of fees, rebates, and everything else.  They said: We show everything.   Well, I challenge the three big ones to do it. They don't want to  because--if you started looking at actually what they did, they are  what I have said many times--they are monopolistic terrorists. That is  all they are in this market.   Mr. Speaker, as an example of the major market power that PBMs have,  I would like to point you to Express Scripts' annual average revenue.  That one company has average revenue of $101 billion. Now, Mr. Speaker,  I am a conservative, free-market business person. I love to see a  business actually make money. But you don't do it the way they are  doing it. I am not decrying their profit. However, I am calling into  question the business model of raking in massive profits on the backs  of patients and small business pharmacists. You don't do it that way.   I brought this up on many occasions and only get excuses and  obfuscations and everything from the PBMs going online and telling  about how great they are but never addressing the real issue. The  problem is relegated to the wayside far too long and is coming into  sharp focus. In fact, Anthem, an insurer, is currently suing to end its  contract with Express Scripts. It claims Express Scripts failed to  renegotiate lower drug prices and withheld billions in savings. This  lawsuit and stories surrounding it have called into sharper focus PBM  tactics that community pharmacists have been grappling with for years.  In just a few moments, we are going to hear firsthand about how that  has actually been going on.   Through a variety of practices, PBMs make life difficult and  undermine competition for our neighborhood pharmacists and the patients  that they serve. For example, PBMs have maximum allowable costs--MAC  lists--that determine the maximum amount a pharmacist will be  reimbursed for certain generic drugs. However, PBMs' reimbursement  price determinations are hidden, and there is no transparency in the  process.   PBMs commonly manipulate drug prices using what is called spread  pricing. I would encourage, Mr. Speaker, those who listen to this and  would want to be a part to look this up. Everything we are talking  about is actual fact. PBMs charge employers a higher price for a drug  than necessary and reimburse pharmacies at the MAC level, which is  typically lower. Spread pricing allows PBMs to skim money from the  difference between the high rate they charge for a prescription and the  low rate they reimburse pharmacies. Spread pricing is artificially  raising the acquisition cost of pharmacy drugs by overcharging at the  expense of retail pharmacists, consumers, and health plans.   You see, when we understand this, people say: Why is this a problem?  Why are we talking about it?   This lack of transparency is also a problem when PBMs administer  taxpayer-funded programs like Medicare part D, TRICARE, or the Federal  Employees Health Benefits Program. Currently, we can't ensure that the  savings generated by cost-saving rebates received by the PBMs are being  passed along to government programs. PBMs can receive rebates to  acquire prescription drugs at lower-than-advertised costs, and PBMs can  then charge the government the full cost for the drug even if a PBM has  a significant discount. This deceptive practice increases the cost of  prescription drugs for beneficiaries of Federal Government prescription  drug programs.   Let's break that down, Mr. Speaker. When we talk about Federal drug  programs, these taxpayer-funded programs, we are talking about my  taxes, your taxes, and everybody else's taxes. That is why this is  important and needs to be addressed. This is what is the problem.   This lack of transparency is unacceptable and jeopardizes the quality  of care for millions of patients across the United States. Northeast  Georgia has a vibrant pharmacy community, but its pharmacies are being  threatened by the unfair practices of the PBM. The fact is--and I have  made mention of this before--several pharmacists tell me that if  something doesn't change, we are going to see more and more of those  pharmacies disappear within the next few years.   I introduced the Prescription Drug Price Transparency Act to help  address this situation. My legislation preserves pharmacy access for  patients by allowing pharmacists to know the sources PBMs are using to  set reimbursement rates for community pharmacists.   PBMs' prices are often based on incentives for manufacturers not  disclosed for long periods of time. Oversights of PBMs ensure taxpayers  are not footing the bill for generic prescriptions by providing  transparency into how drug acquisition costs are determined. The  Prescription Drug Price Transparency Act also prevents PBMs from  forcing their customers to fill or purchase prescriptions from  pharmacies owned and controlled by the same PBM.   Let me go back over that real quickly. The PBMs, the pharmacy benefit  managers, are allowed to force customers to fill or purchase  prescriptions from pharmacies they own and control. There is no  transparency here. They are simply controlling a system and running the  market out. This means patients can keep the pharmacists they like  rather than being improperly incentivized or coerced to use a PBM-owned  pharmacy.   Finally, it would require PBMs to update their MAC pricing list every  7 days, codifying current CMS rules for Medicare part D and expanding  it to TRICARE and FEHP. This legislation is vitally important to  improvin fairness and transparency in drug pricing and reimbursements  to independent and community pharmacists.    I will tell you this: I've heard story after story, and we will  continue these tonight. The community pharmacists may be muzzled by  PBMs, those that are still. There may be fear of retaliations. But I  won't let those concerns go unnoticed. We are going to continue to take  this fight to the floor so there will be a voice for transparency and  fairness for community pharmacists, for patients, and for taxpayers.  Because if they think they can pull a fast one on the Federal  Government at the cost of taxpayers, then they have got another thing  coming. They may go in and intimidate and strong-arm our community and  independent pharmacists. They may threaten them to keep quiet. They may  tell them not to go to their elected officials or have a voice to say  that we think that there is a better way, or just to be able to compete  on a fairness level without anything else except just let us compete.  The PBMs may try to strong-arm them and to silence them into  submission, but they are not going to be able to silence me.  [[Page H5914]]  They can't audit me, and they can't do that to the American pharmacist  who is simply trying to be a part of this system.   There is nobody that can understand that better than my friend from  south Georgia. He is a pharmacist by training. He has left the  pharmacies behind so that he can come up here and help us continue this  fight for patient care and patient health all across this country. He  is a champion in every sense of the word of this industry because, as  the old saying is, he is one. He comes tonight to talk further and  provide insight into this Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter). It  is good to have him back in the fight tonight.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend. He  has brought out so many things. And you know, Representative Carter,  one of the things that is off the top, when we talk about Mack  Transparency, when we talk about this list we talk about, one of things  they come back at us, and they say: Well, it is going to increase cost.  You know, if you do this, it increases cost.   And it is sort of interesting because in Texas, this actually  happened in 2013, they did their top 200 drugs, and they were somewhere  in the neighborhood of a little over $200. And then in just a matter of  3 years, those average prices of those 200 drugs dropped to below $100.   We are both from Georgia when we were talking about it. That is going  down. It is not going up. It is because they are actually having to  show what they are doing. That is why this--don't you agree that that  is why we are having to do what we are doing here?    Continue.    Continue.    Continue.    Continue.    Continue.    Mr. Speaker, it is that, and I think the  interesting thing is the middleman who produces nothing on their own.  That is the thing. They don't produce anything in this. They are  simply--you know, I think I will just sort of describe it like I see it  in northeast Georgia. It is like a tick on the back of a dog. They just  simply suck profit off and do not do what you exactly just said. They  don't do what they just said.   I mean, Caterpillar. You brought up Caterpillar. I will bring you  some numbers with Caterpillar. Caterpillar started moving away from  PBMs. They suspected that they could save as much as, in a quarter,  $150 million in drug prices being spent inefficiently.   They went back and did their own formularies. They worked this out so  that they are on this straight, and just--the company saved 5- to $10  million per year in just cholesterol-lowering statins alone, one of the  most widely prescribed medications, just in that right there.   When you see how PBMs claim to save money, you look at the  Caterpillar model. There are other models out there that are finally  looking at this and saying: We can do this in a better way.   And I appreciate your input tonight. I think that has been--you are  just highlighting this that there are ways to do this. This is not the  only way. And to go into State legislators, and to go into county  offices, and to go into county governments, and the Federal Government,  and to pull the wool saying ``we are saving money,'' while all along we  are seeing this tangled web of DIR fees and clawback and no  transparency.   You know, it isn't amazing to me that they are spending so much money  on advertising right now. It is not amazing to me that they are trying  to spend so much money claiming what we are saying is not true. But  they never address the point. They never say this is not true. They  simply say we are saving all this.   I encourage the Energy and Commerce Committee to take these bills up,  hold hearings on these things. They are not going to deny it, and they  are going to find out that unfortunately what is supposed to be a help  has been really falling backwards, and actually, you know--and really,  even from the Federal Government, those community and independent  pharmacists are not wanting.    Mr. Speaker, it has always been about that. I  have come to this well and come to this floor on many occasions to talk  about it. And when you look at the impacts they are having on DIR fees  and these clawback fees that are coming back after the fact and not at  the time of when there is no really need or cause for it, according to  the Community Oncology Alliance, pharmacists lose $58,000 per practice,  on average, to DIR fees each year. You know, this makes it completely-- I mean, think about that.   Mr. Speaker, if you had a business in which you had $58,000 just  sucked away for no apparent reason, I mean, this is--we wonder why this  is happening, and we wonder why people can't get their drugs. We wonder  why people wonder why can't I get this drug? Why do I have to wait to  get approval here? It is this area right here--DIR fees.   And I do applaud my friend, Mr. Griffith from Virginia, who has  introduced this bill, and I am a proud cosponsor with him on this.   You know, it is amazing today to see when patients--when this happens  in Medicare part D, the beneficiaries are going through this process,  and really what happens, it increases the problem called the doughnut  hole, and they are hitting that doughnut hole sooner, forcing them to  pay out of pocket for their drugs. And when patients pass through the  doughnut hole into catastrophic coverage, CMS takes on most of the cost  of burden-sharing.   Now, here is where it gets important, Mr. Speaker. When CMS picks it  up, the cost increased from 10 billion in 2010 to 33 billion in 2015.  You cannot tell me DIR fees are not part of that problem right there.  You cannot tell me that what they are doing is now taking--they are  simply reaching into your pocket, Mr. Speaker. Maybe you can feel it  right now. You can feel that hand going into your wallet. You can feel  that tax money being taken out and being taken away, sucked away by PBM  through these fees and DIR fees, and they are getting into it through  Medicare part D. And 10 billion to 33 billion increase is simply from  2010 to 2015.   Pharmacists are at distinct disadvantage when DIR is taken and  collected from pharmacies after point of sale. There is a lack of  transparency in the detail provided to pharmacists, and the retroactive  nature of these fees creates operational and cash flow challenges for  pharmacists.   Think about having something that you think you have one price on,  and they come back and say: No, you messed it up   We talked about so many different things. We talked about how PBMs  can come in and audit basically their competitors. We talked about how  they can send out letters to a pharmacy's clients and say: This  pharmacy is no longer taking this prescription plan. And then when the  pharmacist points it out, they say: Yeah, you are right; you still have  the plan.   And the pharmacists have the audacity to ask: Would you please send a  letter to these people who you just sent a letter to and tell them you  were mistaken? And the PBM said: No, we can't do that; you will have to  do that on your own.   Is this America, Mr. Speaker? Where do we operate like that? And we  wonder why our healthcare system and these community pharmacists are  bearing the brunt of it.   At the end of the day, it is about people. It is about moms and dads.  It is about kids. It is about those folks who simply want a healthcare  system that works. And one of the most visible parts of the healthcare  system is the community pharmacist, the one who dispenses the drug and  asks them: How are you doing? How are the kids? Are you taking your  medicine?   And they will ask those questions that maybe some of us just don't  want to ask our doctor. You know, you might just ask that pharmacist  that question and say: Really, what does this do to me?   That is what we need. And as long as they are being frontally  assaulted, retroactively assaulted with DIR fees, and generally  pummelled out of business, the PBM will continue to just drown our  community and independent pharmacists.   And as long as that happens, there will be myself and others in the  well speaking the truth and pushing our committees to do something  about this, because at the end of the day, businesses ought to operate  properly. But when you are affecting the taxpayer dollars, when you are  going after taxpayers, and you are doing so in a way that takes  pharmacists out of the loop, you have threatened them, you have done  everything else you can to them, well, the day is over, this Congress  will continue to fight. And there are many Members who are learning  what is going on, and it is now time I challenge this body and the  committees of relevant jurisdiction to take this issue up because we  are not going to stop.   And we will be back soon, Mr. Speaker, with some more details on this  issue and how much it can be effective. And with that, I yield back the  balance of my time.
