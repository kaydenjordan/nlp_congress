 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge the Senate to confirm  Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Judge Kavanaugh has a clear record as a  thoughtful jurist who respects and will defend our Constitution. Those  who have worked with him over the years and know him best strongly  defend his record as a good man who loves his family and our country.   I am ashamed we find ourselves where we are today. It is shameful the  way that Judge Kavanaugh has had his name smeared, just as it is  shameful that Dr. Ford has been used as a pawn in a political game.  Frankly, my heart hurts for both of them.   Our government is only as good as the people who serve in it, and I  am deeply concerned that this whole series of events will encourage  fewer good men and women to take up the call of government service.   Mr. Speaker, this circus must end. The Senate should vote on Judge  Kavanaugh, approve him to serve on the Supreme Court, and allow our  great country to move forward.                            ____________________
