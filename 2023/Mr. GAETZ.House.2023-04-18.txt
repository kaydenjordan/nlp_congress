 Mr. Speaker, I rise to vindicate the most American of  values, and that is work. When John Smith landed at Jamestown, he said:  ``He who does not work, neither shall he eat.''   We have drifted far away from that, creating a social safety net that  has been converted into a multigenerational hammock for far too many  Americans.   As we reach America's credit card limit, I am proud to stand with my  many House Republican colleagues who believe there should be no  increase in this debt limit absent rigorous work requirements.   If you could see President Clinton and Newt Gingrich coming together  for work requirements in the 1990s, there is no reason we cannot do  that in divided government now to cut spending where it is wasteful and  to grow this economy where it is necessary.                            ____________________
