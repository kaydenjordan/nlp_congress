 Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to  the two bills that the Senate considered this week that would severely  restrict women's access to reproductive healthcare. I have always  believed that a woman's most personal and difficult medical decisions  should be made with her doctor and her family and free from political  interference.   These bills would prevent doctors from providing a full range of  reproductive healthcare that meets the needs of their patients. These  bills put women's health at risk, which is why they are opposed by  groups that represent healthcare professionals, including the American  Public Health Association. They would also disproportionately impact  women of color, LGBTQ people, those facing intimate partner violence,  and those living in rural areas.   All Americans deserve access to affordable, high-quality healthcare,  including the full range of reproductive healthcare. It is for these  reasons that I oppose the motions to invoke cloture on these  bills.  [[Page S1179]]                                ____________________
