 Mr. President, today let the Senate recognize the 50th  anniversary of the Latin American Association based in Atlanta, GA.   Founded and led by Angel Ortiz and Stratton Frank, what started as a  small organization to serve Atlanta's then-emerging Latino population  has become one of the largest service providers and advocates for  Georgia's Latino and immigrant communities.   With a focus on civic engagement, economic empowerment, youth  services, family stabilization, and immigration services, the  association has made a big difference in the lives of hundreds of  thousands of Georgians.   The Latin American Association has been instrumental helping  immigrants who have newly arrived to the United States to assimilate,  feel at home, and positively contribute to our great Nation. Because of  their work, Georgia and the country are better off.   On behalf of the State of Georgia and the U.S. Senate, I express our  heartfelt thanks to the Latin American Association.                            ____________________
