 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor two giants in North  Carolina history: My dear friends and colleagues, Congressman G. K.  Butterfield and Congressman   David Price.   With a combined four decades of experience fighting for North  Carolinians in Congress, G. K. and David have left a lasting legacy on  this Chamber and in their communities. G. K. has been a powerful voice  for voting rights and accessible healthcare.   David has worked tirelessly for efficient 21st century transportation  as well as affordable housing in North Carolina and beyond.   It is not possible to describe the breadth of their distinguished  careers and profound impact on our State and our Nation.   I am incredibly grateful for their friendship and mentorship and know  they will be sorely missed by colleagues on both sides of the aisle.   I wish them the best in the next chapters of their lives.                            ____________________
