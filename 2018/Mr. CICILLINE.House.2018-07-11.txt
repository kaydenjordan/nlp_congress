 Mr. Speaker, Rhode Island's commercial fishing  industry provides thousands of good-paying jobs and hundreds of  millions of dollars of economic activity every year; but later today,  the House is voting on a bill that will jeopardize this critical sector  of our State's economy. H.R. 200 undermines the science-based catch  limits that we have used in recent decades to keep fisheries  sustainable for the long term.   We have seen this movie before. It was just a few decades ago that  Congress first put the science-based catch limits in place. Congress  had to do so because overfishing had brought America's fisheries to the  brink of economic and environmental collapse.   It turns out the science works. Since Congress put these science- based catch limits in place, dozens of fish stocks have been brought  back to sustainable levels and overfishing incidents have been cut  substantially. Good-paying jobs in the fishing industry have thrived.  The industry now, as a whole, generates billions of dollars in economic  activity every year.   H.R. 200 will reverse this progress. We cannot let it pass. It is a  terrible bill that will harm fishermen in my State and all up and down  the coast.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to  reject this bill.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the  time.   Mr. Speaker, Congress is broken. Each day, more and more Americans  are losing faith that their government actually works for them. More  than 80 percent of Americans say they can't trust Washington to do what  is right for them. More than two-thirds feel like our democracy is  getting less responsive under Republican control.   And they know what is going on here. They know they are caught in a  system that is rigged against them. Their voices are ignored. Their  concerns are dismissed. They don't even get a seat at the table.   The Republicans who control this Chamber aren't going to fix it. They  have given away all the seats at the table to corporate special  interests, to billionaires, to the big banks, the big pharmaceutical  companies, and that is why the interests of working people are not  being protected. My Republican friends are advancing the interests of  powerful special interests that fund their campaigns.   The corruption of our political system in this way has become  business as usual here in Washington. In this case, business as usual  means billions of dollars in tax cuts for the wealthy and well- connected Republican campaign donors. It means endless attacks on  workers' rights and consumer protections, and it means trying to deny  the right to vote to millions of eligible citizens while, at the same  time, letting corporations spend as much as it takes to keep  Republicans in power.   Business as usual for Republicans is a raw deal for the rest of us,  and the American people are sick and tired of the raw deal that they  have been getting. Democrats know that. We share their frustration. We  know that Congress can do better. We know that we need to clean up  Washington and get a better deal for our democracy.   Democrats are committed to delivering real reforms to our political  system that will restore government by and for the people of this great  country, and that starts with fixing the way campaigns are run in  America. We need to break the stranglehold that secret corporate  spending has on our elections, and we have a chance to do it right now.   If we defeat the previous question, we will have a chance to vote on  the DISCLOSE Act, one of the key elements of delivering a better deal  for our democracy.   The DISCLOSE Act, which I have introduced, along with 162 cosponsors  in this Chamber, will shine a light on the unlimited secret corporate  spending that has flooded American elections in recent years.   The DISCLOSE Act is simple. It requires that organizations that spend  money in Federal elections have to disclose their donors. It closes one  of the biggest loopholes that the Citizens United ruling opened,  namely, that corporations, billionaires, and even foreign governments  can secretly funnel hundreds of millions of dollars into 501(c)(4)s in  order to covertly influence our campaigns.   This is a huge problem. From 2004 to 2016, secret political spending  in our Presidential elections increased by over 3,000 percent. Special  counsel Robert Mueller is even reportedly investigating right now  whether Vladimir Putin's regime in Russia secretly funneled money  through the NRA to help elect Donald Trump.   And closer to home for all of us, just a few weeks ago, Speaker  Ryan's political fundraising group, the American Action Network,  reported receiving a single $24.6 million contribution from an  anonymous donor. I don't know who gave the American Action Network that  money. You don't know who gave them that money. But I have a feeling  that whoever did is expecting something in return.   It is no secret that the American people have lost faith in this  institution and in their government. They look to Washington and they  see a ruling party that will do whatever it takes to help their friends  on Wall Street get ahead, but they won't lift a finger for folks who  are struggling to get by.   It doesn't have to be this way. We can restore the faith that has  been lost in this institution and in our government. We can build a  government that is worthy of the people we serve. We can end the rule  of big money and begin a new era where working people get all the seats  at the table.   If we want to do that, the first thing we need to do is to make sure  that political spending happens out in the open and not in total  secret.   Let's defeat the previous question. Let's have a real debate about  fixing what is wrong in Washington, and start by passing the DISCLOSE  Act to shine some light on dark money in our politics.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 200, the so-called  Strengthening Fishing Communities and Increasing Flexibility in  Fisheries Management Act, which would undermine the years of progress  made in rebuilding fish stocks and setting effective catch limits under  the Magnuson-Stevens Act.   My home State of Rhode Island is home to a vibrant fishing community  that relies on healthy fish populations in order to make a living.   Traditionally, reauthorization of fisheries management programs  through the Magnuson-Stevens Act has been done on a bipartisan basis  with the goal of strengthening sustainable fisheries. However, this  entirely partisan bill weakens critical tools, like annual catch  limits, which ensure that fisheries remain full for years to come.   This bill will gut science-based management for fisheries, roll back  development of effective fisheries management techniques, and reduce  accountability for recreational fisheries.   H.R. 200 removes several species from science-based quotas which help  ensure that catches are sustainable each year. Under this bill,  hundreds of species of fish would no longer have catch limits, which  would lead to drastic overfishing.   The bill also harms efforts to rebuild fish stocks by including  loopholes which remove rebuilding timeframes from many fish stocks and  would extend recovery timeframes for others, thereby endangering  healthy stocks of fish available to fishing communities.   In the last week, I have heard from fishermen from all over my  district, from Greenville to Portsmouth, who have reached out to my  office to tell me that H.R. 200 will harm their way of life by  threatening already depleted fish populations and increase the threat  of overfishing.   The fishermen in my State need legislation that would build on time- tested tools to strengthen fisheries and prevent overfishing instead of  this bill, which would set management programs back and weaken  effective conservation tools.   I join with those fishermen in opposing this misguided approach to  reauthorizing the Magnuson-Stevens Act. I urge my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to vote ``no'' on final passage.   Mr. Chairman, I again thank the gentleman for yielding.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the  amendment offered by my friend and colleague, Congressman Langevin. I  am proud to be an original cosponsor of my colleague's legislation, the  Fishermen's Fairness Act, which serves as the basis for this amendment.   This amendment would provide our home State of Rhode Island with  representation on the Mid-Atlantic Fisheries Management Council. This  move  [[Page H6088]]  would allow Rhode Island fishing communities to have a voice on the  council which manages stocks for species that are among the most  valuable to fisheries in our State.   Rhode Island fishermen account for nearly 56 percent of total summer  scup landings and 54 percent of all Atlantic squid landings, both  stocks being managed by the Mid-Atlantic Council.   Squid landings are critical to Rhode Island's overall fishing  economy, landing more squid than all other States combined and the  second most of any other State in the country. In 2015, Rhode Island  landed roughly 16 million pounds of squid, nearly 12 million pounds  more than its nearest competitor.                                time  1615    The following year was even more significant for Rhode Island, with  nearly 23 million pounds in squid landings valued at more than $29  million.   All told, Rhode Island accounts for more fish landings under the  jurisdiction of the Mid-Atlantic Fisheries Management Council than any  other State in the region, with the exception of New Jersey.   Yet, despite all of this, my State does not have a seat on this  council, leaving Rhode Island fisheries without a say in how a  significant portion of its industry is managed.   This amendment will provide a commonsense solution to this problem by  adding two additional seats to the Mid-Atlantic Fisheries Management  Council in order to represent Rhode Island's interests in the region.   As Congressman Langevin said, this is not unprecedented. We have done  this before. In 1996, North Carolina, which also had significant  fishing interests in the mid-Atlantic region, was given a seat on the  council. This amendment would extend this same right to a seat at the  table to my State.   I really want to thank my colleague for his work on this issue, and I  strongly encourage adoption of this amendment, particularly out of a  sense of comity, since we have done this in the past. Rhode Islanders  deserve to be treated fairly. Our fishermen deserve a voice. I urge my  colleagues to support this excellent amendment.
