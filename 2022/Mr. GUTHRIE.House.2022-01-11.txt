 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Eric Bergren's  27 years of service to Kentucky's Second District.   Eric, a graduate of UMass, started working for Kentucky's Second  District in 1994. Eric worked his way up from an intern to become the  chief of staff under Congressman Lewis, my predecessor. During that  time, Eric met his wife, Kathy Reding, a native of Howardstown,  Kentucky, in the Second District. Eric and Kathy are now proud parents  of Cecelia and Julia.   Eric has been at my side since 2009 when I was sworn in. I believe I  have had the best chief, and others have affirmed that. On a personal  note, we have both watched our kids grow up and shared with each other  the joys of being a father.   Madam Speaker, I am losing a chief but I am not losing a great  friend. Thanks for everything, Eric, and I wish you the best for your  next chapter.                            ____________________
