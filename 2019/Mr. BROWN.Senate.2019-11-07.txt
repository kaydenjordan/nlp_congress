 Mr. President, I rise today to honor Mr. Todd  Portune, a dedicated public servant, who has spent his career serving  the people of Cincinnati with dedication and enthusiasm. Commissioner  Portune is retiring from politics following this term after more than a  quarter century of service, and I know how much he will be missed by  the people of Southwest Ohio.   Commissioner Portune was born in Cincinnati and from an early age was  known for his work ethic. Throughout his education, Commissioner  Portune remained in Ohio, graduating from Colerain High School, Oberlin  College, and serving as the president of the Student Bar Association at  the University of Cincinnati Law School.   Commissioner Portune's leadership embodies good government in action.  He helped lead the way in improving public health, from working to  reduce infant mortality to expanding oral and dental care. Through  projects to increase housing and job opportunities and secure funding  for local first responders, he consistently focused on what he believed  to be the fundamental goal of public service: to improve people's  lives.   His service, from four terms in Cincinnati City Council to six terms  as Hamilton County commissioner, inspired many to stand up for what  they believe in. Commissioner Portune's fight for human rights will be  a lasting part of his legacy. He advocated for LGBTQ rights before it  was popular, and he always supported disability inclusion, those  battling with addiction, and people without a voice in government.   His political triumphs can only be matched this his incredible  personal tenacity throughout every obstacle thrown his way. But no  matter what, he focused on serving the people in his beloved county.   Commissioner Portune will be remembered for his good humor, passion  for public service, and strength to endure battles of all kinds. I ask  my Senate colleagues to join me in thanking him for his service to our  community and our State.                            ____________________
