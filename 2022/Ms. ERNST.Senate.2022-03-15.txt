 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.  [[Page S1163]]     I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, there are very few things that possess the  power to change the course of history almost instantaneously.  Information is one.   Consider, right now, citizens in Ukraine are holding one of the most  ruthless, autocratic, and powerful men in the world, Vladimir Putin,  accountable for his barbaric assault on their country with their  firsthand accounts being live-streamed from behind the battle lines.   Putin is attempting to censor coverage of the bloody conflict by  threatening to jail journalists and Russian citizens who dare use the  word ``war'' to describe his unprovoked attack.   Even the United Nations instructed its staff not to refer to Russia's  military assault on Ukraine as a ``war'' or ``invasion.'' Yet, every  day, Ukrainians are bypassing this blockade of information and exposing  the Russian tyrant's atrocities in real time by sharing images of  civilians standing up to the heavily armed Russian invaders, the  innocent victims and destruction caused by the bombing, and captured  Russian soldiers in tears testifying that they were lied to and misled  into attacking a peaceful country.   As a result, the people of Ukraine have rallied the world, including  many Russians, behind their courageous struggle to preserve freedom and  democracy against the largest military assault in Europe since World  War II.   This is the power of information.   Authoritarians like Putin cannot hide their dirty deeds in the dark  as long as light can be shined to expose the truth. It should serve as  a reminder to every single American how important it is that we uphold  and defend the fundamental principles of our Nation that make us so  great--in particular, our First Amendment.   We should never take these American freedoms for granted. That is why  it is important we celebrate the freedom of information every year  during Sunshine Week. With widespread distrust in government and the  media and Big Tech controlling what facts and opinions can even be  shared, it has become increasingly important that each one of us has  the power to access facts, unfiltered.   To arm us with information, over the past half century, a number of  important laws have been passed by Congress to increase openness in  government and give our citizens a right to know. These include the  Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, which allows access to government  documents, and the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act,  which provides a detailed accounting of how, where, why, and by whom  taxpayer dollars are being spent.   To demonstrate the importance of these laws, let me give you a  relatively simple example with potentially profound implications.   In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, I teamed up with my  friends at the White Coat Waste Project to use a combination of these  transparency laws to follow a trail of U.S. taxpayer dollars to China's  state-run Wuhan Institute of Virology, where they were being used to  pay for dangerous research on coronaviruses. The world is now demanding  to know if these studies could have been the source of the COVID-19  pandemic that shut down our planet for the past 2 years and claimed the  lives of millions around the globe.   Regretfully, we still don't know the whole truth because communist  China refuses to cooperate and is, instead, destroying evidence and  coercing investigators to dismiss any suggestion that the virus might  have escaped from the lab. Even many within the free press of our own  country, the scientific community, and Big Tech fell for the Communist  misinformation campaign, smearing anyone who even suggested the lab  could have been the source of the outbreak as spreading ``conspiracy  theories.''   We refused to be intimidated by this Communist Party's propaganda and  continued our search for the truth. We followed the science and the  money and discovered the world was being told a story that was very  much different from what was transpiring behind those closed doors.   Thanks, in part, to a transparency law requiring the disclosure of  details on projects paid for by U.S. taxpayers, we knew NIH was funding  a group  [[Page S1180]]  called EcoHealth to conduct experiments on coronaviruses that were  obtained from bats in China and that they were doing so in  collaboration with the now-infamous Wuhan Institute.   The White Coat Waste Project then used FOIA to obtain internal NIH  emails, which revealed the Agency was funding controversial gain-of- function research on coronaviruses at the Wuhan Institute in 2016. They  also revealed Dr. Fauci was told as early as January 2020 that COVID-19  looked engineered.   Was this project, paid for with your tax dollars, somehow related to  the release of the COVID-19 pandemic, which just happened to begin in  the vicinity of the lab in Wuhan?   EcoHealth might know the truth or even provide some clues, but the  group's president refuses to answer questions. In fact, he organized a  disinformation campaign to discredit scientists who dared to ask that  question.   EcoHealth also evaded a number of Federal transparency laws requiring  the disclosure of how our tax dollars are being spent. As a result, we  still aren't even entirely sure how much of our money was sunk into  subsidizing the unsafe, state-run lab in communist China.   Folks, we really deserve the answers, and if EcoHealth won't  cooperate voluntarily, then that information will be obtained with  subpoenas when Republicans are back in control of Congress. You can  mark my words.   This troubling situation demonstrates both the power and the  shortcomings of transparency laws. Armed with information, citizens can  uphold the government and make it accountable and expose malfeasance  but only if the laws are followed, and, right now, many of these laws  are all bark and no bite.   So what can a civic-minded Iowan do to get answers from inside the DC  beltway bureaucracy?   Well, you know what they say: If you want a friend in Washington, get  a dog.   That is why I have introduced the Watchdog Act, which will establish  within the White House a new Director of Openness--yes, you have got  it, D-O-G--Director of Openness in Government, who will be the  taxpayers' best friend. This top dog will hound our government  bureaucrats to fetch the facts for our taxpayers. Agencies that would  not provide information in a complete and timely manner would be dogged  until they do.   In contrast to Russia, where the government controls and censors  information, my bill creates a transparency czar to open government and  spread information.   Folks, we can't have gatekeepers of truth in a free society. That is  why, under my bill, those who censor information, rather than those who  share it, will be held accountable.   The best way to restore trust in our public institutions and to  discredit misinformation campaigns is by shining a light on what is  really going on in Washington, and with the Sun now setting an hour  later every day, we are all reminded what a big difference a little bit  of sunshine can make.                            ____________________     Mr. President, there are very few things that possess the  power to change the course of history almost instantaneously.
