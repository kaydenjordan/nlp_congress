 Mr. Speaker, I condemn H. Res. 26 in the strongest  terms, which seeks to nullify the Revised Criminal Code Act of 2022,  enacted by the council of the District of Columbia (DC). This bill is  nothing more than a naked power grab on the part of House Republicans  to enforce the will of Congress on the duly elected local  representatives of the District of Columbia. I approach the subject of  home rule as a former local government official having served on the  Fairfax County Board of Supervisors for 14 years, including five as  chairman and as a former chairman of the Council of Governments. I know  what it takes to manage public safety. I cannot imagine how a local  government can function efficiently or effectively, if each of its  public safety decisions requires Congressional approval. I have  consistently supported autonomy for the District and would argue  Congress' actions have actually had a deleterious effect on the  District and its residents. D.C.'s lack of autonomy affects the entire  National Capital Region, especially the thousands of my constituents  who are civil servants and work in the District. I hope the irony of  this situation is not lost on those who support the conservative  principles of limited government and states' rights. Let me remind my  colleagues of what my fellow Virginian, James Madison, said in the  Federalist Papers, Number 43, with respect to the intent of the  Congressional authority. In referring to the residents of this federal  District, Madison said ``they will have had their voice in the election  of the government which is to exercise authority over them; as a  municipal legislature for local purposes.'' There is no more basic  exercise of municipal authority than protecting public safety.
