 Mr. Speaker, Friday marks the eighth anniversary of the  Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.   I was Governor of Florida at the time. I remember the tar balls. I  remember them coming up on our beautiful beaches--as the ambassador  does; marine life covered in toxic sludge; the harm done to Florida's  tourism and fisheries industries; and, of course, the tragic loss of  life aboard the Deepwater Horizon itself.   Mr. Speaker, I haven't forgotten it. Florida has not forgotten it. We  must never have drilling off the Florida coast. We should take that  argument off the table.                            ____________________
