 Mr. Speaker, the tax bill passed by the House GOP  today embodies everything that Americans dislike about Congress:   It was drafted behind closed doors where the drafters cast aside  expert analysis and relied instead on special interests and faulty  disproven assumptions.   The plan slashes tax rates for multinational corporations and the  superwealthy, but leaves hardworking Americans in the 47th  Congressional District to pay the bill.   It penalizes taxpayers in California and other blue States for  investing in our schools, in our roads, and in our public services.   It cruelly hits children, seniors, and low-income Americans by  putting at risk Medicare, Medicaid, SNAP, and Social Security.   Mr. Speaker, I could not, and proudly did not, vote for this  disastrous piece of legislation.                            ____________________
