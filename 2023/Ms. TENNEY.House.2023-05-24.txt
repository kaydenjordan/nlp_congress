 Mr. Speaker, I rise to voice my support once again for  this critical, bipartisan legislation to undo the Biden  administration's job-crushing solar policies.   It is unfortunate that we find ourselves here debating this policy  again after both the House and Senate acted in a bipartisan manner to  reject President Biden's solar giveaway to China.   Instead of siding with the American people and American workers, this  administration is putting its Green New Deal agenda ahead of our  economic prosperity.   Even though H.J. Res. 39 would protect American workers, and despite  its bipartisan passage in both Chambers, the President vetoed this  critical legislation.   Now Congress must unite to override this vote. If we succeed today,  we will stop China, the Chinese Communist Party specifically, from  continuing to circumvent U.S. trade laws and undermine U.S.  manufacturers.   If we fail to override this veto today, then Congress will hurt the  ability of American manufacturers to compete fairly.   I urge my Democrat colleagues: Please do not allow this to happen.  Join us in standing up for American jobs.   If you support American workers, then join us in overriding this  veto. We cannot stand by as this irresponsible proclamation allows  Chinese solar companies to flood our market with their products tariff- free, hurting American jobs and industry.   President Biden's proclamation also sends the message to trade cheats  everywhere that the U.S. trade laws just don't matter. This invites  even more cheating which, in turn, hurts American workers.   A recent report from the Coalition for a Prosperous America reveals  so much about the priorities hidden in the Green New Deal agenda.   This report shows that Chinese manufacturers could earn nearly $125  billion in U.S. renewable energy tax credits because of the so-called  Inflation Reduction Act, aka the Green New Deal, as my colleague just  cited its true purpose.                                time  1400    That is $125 billion from U.S. taxpayers that could now be going to  Chinese companies, all because the partisan Inflation Reduction Act  failed to include safeguards that prioritize American manufacturing.   I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who haven't  already joined us in this bipartisan effort, please join us. Join us in  prioritizing American manufacturers. Join us in stopping this giveaway  to the Chinese Communist Party. Hold the Chinese Communist Party  accountable.
