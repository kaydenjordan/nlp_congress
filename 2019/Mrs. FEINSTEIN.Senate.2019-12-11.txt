 Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to  the nomination of Lawrence VanDyke to a Nevada seat on the Ninth  Circuit Court of Appeals.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a number of  letters and other documents relevant to Mr. VanDyke's nomination  following my remarks.   Mr. VanDyke's temperament and integrity have been called into  question by his colleagues and the American Bar Association, which  rated him ``Not Qualified'' for the Federal bench. Mr. VanDyke's  record, including his opposition to rights of LGBT individuals and  commonsense gun control, is far outside the mainstream.   First, I want to discuss concerns raised by Mr. VanDyke's colleagues  regarding his temperament, competence, and work ethic. The American Bar  Association interviewed 60 of Mr. VanDyke's colleagues, including 43  lawyers, 16 judges, and one other individual who have worked with Mr.  VanDyke in the four States where he has worked and who are ``in a  position to assess his professional qualifications.''   In its letter to the committee, the ABA reported that Mr. VanDyke's  colleagues described him as ``arrogant, lazy, an ideologue, and lacking  in knowledge of the day-to-day practice including procedural rules''  and stated that he ``has an 'entitlement' temperament, does not have an  open mind, and does not always have a commitment to being candid and  truthful.''   As Montana's solicitor general, Mr. VanDyke's coworkers raised  similar concerns. They noted that he ``avoids work'' and that he ``does  not have the skills to perform, nor desire to learn how to perform, the  work of a lawyer.'' These concerns were echoed by six retired justices  of the Montana Supreme Court who wrote that Mr. VanDyke ``has neither  the qualifications nor the temperament to serve as a federal court of  appeals judge.'' Based in part on these assessments, the ABA deemed Mr.  VanDyke ``Not Qualified'' to be a Federal district court judge. The ABA  [[Page S6983]]  has rated 97 percent of President Trump's judicial nominees since 1989.  It has a process and standards. It has rated 97 percent of President  Trump's judicial nominees ``Qualified'' or ``Well Qualified.'' Mr.  VanDyke, then, is a clear exception.   Mr. VanDyke's record on LGBT rights is also deeply troubling.   In a 2004 op-ed, he wrote that there is ``ample reason for concern  that same-sex marriage will hurt families, and consequentially children  and society.'' Lambda Legal rightly characterized this claim as a  ``stigmatizing and disproven myth.'' During his hearing, and in written  questions, Mr. VanDyke was given many opportunities to disavow this  statement, which is not supported by the research. He declined to do  so.   I asked Mr. VanDyke whether the Supreme Court's decision legalizing  same-sex marriage in Obergefell v. Hodges has harmed families and  children, and I presented him with research showing that the children  of gay and lesbian parents do as well as children raised in opposite- sex households. Still, Mr. VanDyke refused to disavow his anti-LGBT  statements.   In its letter to the committee, the ABA reported that some  interviewees were unconvinced that Mr. VanDyke would be fair to members  of the LGBT community. The ABA further noted that Mr. VanDyke ``would  not say affirmatively that he would be fair to any litigant before him,  notably members of the LGBT community.'' I am concerned based on Mr.  VanDyke's record and the ABA's assessment that LGBT litigants cannot  expect to be treated fairly in his courtroom.   Finally, I would like to highlight Mr. VanDyke's long history of  advocating against commonsense gun control.   As Nevada solicitor general, he undermined implementation of a 2016  ballot initiative, passed by Nevada voter that would have closed a  loophole by expanding background checks for private gun sales. As  Montana solicitor general, he called assault weapons bans  ``ineffective'' and questioned the Federal Government's authority to  regulate guns in any capacity.   While running for a seat on the Montana Supreme Court in 2014, he  filled out an NRA Questionnaire that highlights how far outside the  mainstream his views on gun control are.   On this questionnaire, Mr. VanDyke indicated that he believes all gun  control laws are ``misdirected.'' He opposed banning the possession,  purchase, or sale of any firearm. He also opposed assault weapons bans  and requiring background checks for guns sold at gun shows.   Mr. VanDyke even appeared to pledge loyalty to the NRA itself. He  wrote on the questionnaire that he had stopped being a member of the  organization because he ``didn't want to risk recusal if a lawsuit came  before [him] where the NRA was involved.'' Mr. VanDyke willingly  offered these views when he was seeking judicial office, and so I asked  him to answer the same questions from the NRA's questionnaire as part  of this nomination process. He declined to do so.   It is distressing that a nominee would offer his views on gun control  to the NRA, but not to a Member of the U.S. Senate who must vote on his  lifetime appointment to the Federal bench.   It is no wonder that gun safety groups, including the Giffords Law  Center and the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, fear that Mr. VanDyke  has demonstrated a ``clear lack of impartiality'' and is ``incapable of  serving as an impartial justice.''   The Nevada Senators strongly oppose Mr. VanDyke, in part because he  lacks ties to the State. Their opposition is justified. It is hard to  believe that this nominee, whose views are so far outside the  mainstream and who is unqualified for the position, is the best the  Nevada legal community has to offer.   Federal appeals court judges must be knowledgeable, and litigants  must have confidence that these judges will treat them fairly and  honestly. Unfortunately, Mr. VanDyke does not meet these basic  standards. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing his nomination.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:       NRA-PVF      National Rifle Association of America      Political Victory Fund                    2014 Montana Candidate Questionnaire         Name: Lawrence VanDyke        Website: www.VanDykeforJustice.com        Campaign Name: VanDyke for Supreme Court-        Campaign ID #: 46-5103703        Public Office(s) Held: Montana Solicitor General        Occupation: Attorney        Office Sought: Montana Supreme Court Justice-        District: Seat 2--        Party: Non-Partisan        For further information on Montana firearm laws, Please       visit www.nraila.org and click on the ``Gun Laws'' feature       located in the menu.        1. Do you agree that the Second Amendment to the United       States Constitution guarantees a fundamental, individual       right to keep and bear arms that applies to all Americans,       regardless of where they live in the United States?        a. X Yes.        b. ___ No.        2. Which of the following statements best represents your       opinion on the prevention of violent crime?        a. ___ Gun control laws will solve the crime problem.        b. ___ Gun control laws will not solve the crime problem,       but they must be a part of the overall solution.        c. X Gun control laws are misdirected; the solution is the       enforcement of existing laws which punish criminals who       misuse firearms and other weapons in the commission of       crimes.        d. ___ Other:        3. Considering current Montana firearm laws, would you       support any additional restrictive state legislation       regulating firearms and/or ammunition?        a. ___ Yes, I support additional restrictive state       legislation regulating firearms and/or ammunition.        b. ___ Yes, I support additional restrictive state       legislation regulating firearms. Please explain:        c. ___ Yes, I support additional restrictive state       legislation regulating ammunition. Please explain:        d. ___ No, current state firearm laws are sufficient.        e. X No, current state firearm laws should be improved to       benefit law-abiding gun owners and sportsmen in Montana.        4. Would you support state legislation banning the       manufacture, possession, ownership, purchase, sale and/or       transfer of any firearms?        a. ___ Yes, for all firearms. Please specify type of       restrictions:        b. ___ Yes, for all handguns. Please specify type of       restrictions:        c. ___ Yes, for some firearms. Please specify types of       firearms/restrictions:        d. X No, I oppose banning the manufacture, possession,       ownership, purchase, sale and/or transfer of any firearm.        5. Many .50 caliber firearms are used in big game hunting       and target competition and the .50 caliber BMG cartridge has       been used for nearly a century. Would you support legislation       prohibiting the ownership and/or sale of any .50 caliber       firearms or ammunition in Montana?        a. ___ Yes, I would support such legislation. Please       explain:        b. X No, I would oppose such legislation.        I personally have hunted with a 50 AE Desert Eagle Pistol       (.50 caliber)        6. In 1994, Congress imposed a 10-year ban on the       manufacture, for sale to private individuals, of various       semi-automatic* firearms it termed ``assault weapons,'' and       of ammunition magazines capable of holding more than 10       rounds of ammunition, which primarily affected handguns       designed for self-defense. Congress' subsequent study of the       ban, as well as state and local law enforcement agency       reports, showed that contrary to the ban's supporters'       claims, the guns and magazines had never been used in more       than about 1%-2% of violent crime. Since the ban expired in       2004, the numbers of these firearms and magazines owned have       risen to all-time highs and violent crime has fallen to a 42-      year low. Would you support state legislation restricting the       possession, ownership, purchase, sale, and/or transfer of       semi-automatic firearms and/or limits on the capacity of       magazines designed for self-defense?        * Semi-automatic firearms have been commonly used for       hunting, target shooting, and self-defense since their       introduction in the late 1800s. All semi-automatics fire only       one shot when the trigger is pulled. They are not fully-      automatic machine guns, which have been strictly regulated       under federal law since 1934.        a. ___ Yes, I would support such legislation for semi-      automatic firearms only.        b. ___ Yes, I would support such legislation for magazines       only.        c. ___ Yes, I would support such legislation for semi-      automatic firearms and magazines.        d. X No, I would oppose such legislation.        7. Federal law requires federally-licensed firearms dealers       to keep records of the make, model, caliber, and serial       number of all firearms sold. Would you support state       legislation requiring all firearm owners to register all       their firearm(s) for entry into a centralized state file or       database?        a. __ Yes, for all firearms.        b. __ Yes, for all handguns.        c. __ Yes, for some firearms. Please specify which       firearms:  [[Page S6984]]         d. X No, I oppose state registration of firearms.        8. Would you support the state licensing* of law-abiding       citizens who own, possess and use firearms?        *Licensing, as used here, refers to state legislation       requiring firearm owners to obtain a license from a       government official or agency to own and possess a firearm.       As a rule, firearm owner licensing laws generally require       fingerprinting, photographing, and/or a background       investigation of the applicant. Note: this is different from       acquiring a ``permit to carry'' a concealed weapon from the       state.        a. __ Yes, for owners of all firearms.        b. __ Yes, for owners of all handguns.        c. __ Yes, for owners of some firearms. Please specify       which firearms:        d. X No, I oppose state registration of firearm owners.        9. Federal law requires all federally-licensed firearms       dealers to conduct a criminal records check prior to the sale       of any firearm, whether the sale occurs at their retail store       or at a gun show. Access to the FBI-run telephone-based       ``instant check'' system is limited to licensed dealers only.       Under federal law, individuals who only occasionally sell       firearms from their personal collections are not ``engaged in       the business'' of selling firearms, and are therefore (1) not       required to be licensed; (2) not required to conduct records       checks prior to transferring firearms; and (3) not permitted       to access the records check system used by licensed dealers.       Although less than 1% of guns used in crimes are purchased at       gun shows (Department of Justice, Bureau of Statistics), gun       control advocates are trying to ban firearms sales at gun       shows by occasional sellers and private collectors, or       require that any transactions involving their legal property       be conducted through a licensed dealer. Would you support       legislation restricting firearms sales by occasional sellers       and private collectors at gun shows?        a.__ Yes, I would support such legislation. Please explain:        b. X No, I would oppose such legislation.        10. In the United States, the number of privately owned       guns has risen by more than 10 million annually to an all-      time high. Meanwhile, according to the National Center for       Health Statistics, firearm accident deaths have decreased by       90 percent over the last century. This trend is due in part       to an increasing use of NRA firearm safety training programs       by tens of thousands of RA Certified Instructors, schools,       civic groups and law enforcement agencies. Nevertheless,       several states have recently considered legislation that       would mandate the placement of locking devices on firearms       kept in the home. These devices greatly restrict access to       firearms for self-defense purposes and potentially increase       the risk of accidental discharge of a firearm. Would you       support legislation that would mandate the use of locking       devices or other locking procedures for firearms stored in       the home?        a. __Yes, I would support such legislation. Please explain:        b. X No, I would oppose such legislation.        11. Recently, some employers have extended their ``gun-      free'' workplace rules to employees' locked private vehicles       in parking lots. Such policies effectively disarm law-abiding       citizens, including concealed weapon license holders, from       the time they leave their house in the morning to their       return home in the evening. Would you support ``Employee       Protection'' legislation that would allow law abiding       citizens to keep lawfully transported firearms locked in       their personal vehicles while parked on publicly accessible,       privately owned parking lots (see 2013 Montana House Bill       571)?        a. __Yes, I would sponsor/cosponsor this legislation.        b. X Yes, I would support this legislation.        c. __ No, I would oppose this legislation. Please explain:        12. Current Montana law (MCA Sec. 45-8-328) lists certain       ``prohibited places,'' including banks, government office       buildings and establishments where alcoholic beverages are       served, where concealed weapon permit holders (and law       enforcement officers) may not carry a concealed firearm. This       puts law-abiding citizens at a disadvantage because, although       they could carry ``openly'' in these locations, criminals       will obviously ignore the law and carry concealed. Would you       support legislation to repeal the restrictions on where law-      abiding citizens may carry a concealed weapon (see 2013       Montana House Bill 358)?        a. X Yes, I would sponsor/cosponsor this legislation.        b. X Yes, I would support this legislation.        c. __ No, I would oppose this legislation. Please explain:        13. Current Montana law allows law-abiding citizens to       carry a concealed weapon for defense of themselves and       others, free from government interference, anywhere outside       the official boundaries of any city or town. In order to       cross into a city or town and still be in compliance with       Montana law, however, a law-abiding citizen must have a valid       concealed weapon permit. Would you support state legislation       to remove the requirement that law-abiding citizens obtain       governmental permission in order to provide a means of self-      protection when they cross into the boundaries of cities and       towns in Montana (see 2013 Montana House Bill 304)?        a. X Yes, I would sponsor/cosponsor this legislation.        b. X Yes, I would support this legislation.        c. __ No, I would oppose this legislation. Please explain:        14. Under the National Firearms Act (NFA), an individual       wanting to acquire an NFA-regulated item, such as a firearm       sound suppressor or fully automatic firearm, must submit the       proper paperwork and fingerprints to the Bureau of Alcohol,       Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE), pay a $200 tax and       have a chief local law enforcement officer (CLEO) sign-off on       the proper forms. Some CLEOs simply refuse to sign such       forms, even for otherwise qualified applicants, because they       oppose civilian possession of these items, are fearful       of liability or the perceptions of anti-gun constituents,       or for other subjective reasons. Legally owned NFA items       are very rarely used in crime, with the total number of       cases documented numbering in the single digits. This       legislation would also include an immunity provision for       CLEOs. Would you support state legislation that would make       this process more objective by requiring CLEOs to sign       such forms if the applicant is not otherwise prohibited       from obtaining an NFA item?        a. X Yes, I would sponsor/cosponsor this legislation.        b. X Yes, I would support this legislation.        c. __ No, I would oppose this legislation. Please explain:        15. Many public colleges and universities allow visitors       with concealed handgun permits to carry concealed firearms on       their campuses, yet nearly all state-funded higher learning       institutions ban faculty, staff and students from carrying       concealed handguns on campus--even if they have permits to       carry concealed firearms. The NRA believes a person with a       permit to carry a concealed firearm should be able to carry       that firearm concealed anywhere he or she has a legal right       to be, except in certain ``sterile'' high-security locations.       Assuming each classification of individuals listed below       possessed a concealed handgun permit recognized by the state,       who do you believe should legally be allowed to carry a       concealed handgun on state college and university campuses?        a. X All law-abiding persons, including visitors, faculty,       staff and students.        b. __ Visitors, faculty, staff and some students. Please       explain:        c. __ Faculty, staff and students.        d. __ Visitors, faculty and staff.        e. __ Faculty and staff.        f. __ Each college or university should determine the       policy for its campus.        g. __ No one should be allowed to carry a concealed handgun       on state college and university campuses.        16. The residents of 39 states can legally own firearm       suppressors. Contrary to Hollywood portrayals, suppressors       are virtually never used in crime or poaching and criminal       misuse carries severe penalties. Suppressors can improve       shooting accuracy, protect against hearing loss, reduce noise       complaints from the public and make shooting and hunting more       enjoyable. The current prohibition on hunting suppressor use,       in effect, requires firearms to be as loud as they can       possibly be, contrary to the manner in which virtually all       other noise-emitting objects are treated. Suppressors are       strictly regulated under federal law. Individual purchasers       must pay a $200 federal tax; submit to an extensive       background check that includes fingerprints and photographs;       and obtain the approval of the chief law enforcement officer       in their jurisdiction. Would you support legislation that       allows the use of suppressors while hunting and allow law-      abiding Montana sportsmen the freedom to protect against       hearing loss, improve accuracy and reduce noise complaints?        a. X Yes, I would sponsor/cosponsor this legislation.        b. X Yes, I would support this legislation.        c. __ No, I would oppose this legislation. Please explain:        17. Many states provide civil liability protection to       private property owners who allow the public to hunt on their       property. Shielding property owners from frivolous lawsuits       eliminates a significant concern for property owners and       encourages them to open their land to hunting. This enhances       public hunting opportunities and assists the state in       effectively managing its wildlife populations. Would you       support passing or strengthening liability protections for       private landowners who allow hunting on their property?        a. X Yes, I would sponsor/cosponsor this legislation.        b. X Yes, I would support this legislation.        c. __ No, I would oppose this legislation. Please explain:        18. Youth/mentored hunting programs have been implemented       in 29 states to help promote our hunting heritage by removing       barriers to participation. This enormous case study has       proven safe beyond anyone's expectations. Mentored hunting       allows novice hunters--young and old--to hunt prior to       completing hunter education requirements if they hunt under       the close supervision of a licensed, adult hunter who meets       hunter education requirements. This is the ``try it before       you buy it'' concept. These programs also dramatically reduce       or eliminate minimum hunter ages. Would you support a youth/      mentored hunting law to help promote Montana's hunting       heritage?        a. X Yes, I would sponsor/cosponsor a youth/mentored       hunting law.        b. X Yes, I would support implementing a youth/mentored       hunting law.        c. __ No, I oppose implementing a mentored hunting law.       Montanans will prove to be the exception to the rule of       extraordinary safety established by the citizens of the 29       states that have implemented this program.

For which of the following reasons do you support       firearm ownership for law-abiding Montana citizens (please       mark any and all that apply)?        a. X Constitutional Right.        b. X Hunting.        c. X Competitive shooting.        d. X Informal sport shooting (e.g., plinking).        e. X Defense of self, family, and home (basic human right).        f. X Collecting.        g.

Are you a member of the National Rifle Association, the       Montana Shooting Sports Association, the Montana Rifle &       Pistol Association or any other shooting/sportsmen's/gun       rights organization?        a. __Yes. Please specify:        b. X No.        I have previously been a member of the NRA, but am not       currently a member. I don't want to risk recusal if a lawsuit       came before me where the NRA was involved.        --Please see the information from the email sent to Brian       Judy on Sept. 16, 2014.        --Please also see the attached article from the Great Falls       Tribune dated 9/18/14.

Candidate Signature: Lawrence VanDyke Date: 9/18/14                                   ____                                         American Bar Association,                                                   October 29, 2019.      Re Nomination of Lawrence J.C. VanDyke to the United States           Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.       Hon. Lindsey Graham,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Dianne Feinstein,      Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Graham and Ranking Member Feinstein: The       American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal       Judiciary has received a full report on Lawrence J.C. VanDyke       and a supplemental review by a former chair of the Committee.       The Committee's work is based solely on a review of       integrity, professional competence, and judicial temperament.       Based on these criteria, a substantial majority of the       Committee has determined that Mr. VanDyke is ``Not       Qualified,'' and a minority determined that he is       ``Qualified'' to serve on the United States Court of Appeals       for the Ninth Circuit. The majority rating represents the       Standing Committee's official rating. I write to offer a       brief explanation of this rating.        The evaluator's Formal Report is based on 60 interviews       with a representative cross section of lawyers (43), judges       (16), and one other person who have worked with the nominee       in the four states where he has worked and who are in a       position to assess his professional qualifications. They       include but are not limited to attorneys who worked with him       and who opposed him in cases and judges before whom he has       appeared at oral argument. The evaluator obtained detailed       background materials such as more than 600 pages of publicly       produced emails involving and/or written by Mr. VanDyke, news       reports where Mr. VanDyke had been interviewed, and articles       and opinions written about him.        Mr. VanDyke is a highly educated lawyer with nearly 14       years of experience in appellate law, including one year as a       law clerk, an associate in a law firm, and as a Solicitor       General for over five-plus years, first in Montana and then       Nevada, two states in the Ninth Circuit where he would serve       if confirmed. The Committee was tasked with balancing Mr.       VanDyke's accomplishments with strong evidence that supports       a ``Not Qualified'' rating.        Mr. VanDyke's accomplishments are offset by the assessments       of interviewees that Mr. VanDyke is arrogant, lazy, an       ideologue, and lacking in knowledge of the day-to-day       practice including procedural rules. There was a theme that       the nominee lacks humility, has an ``entitlement''       temperament, does not have an open mind, and does not always       have a commitment to being candid and truthful.        Some interviewees raised concerns about whether Mr. VanDyke       would be fair to persons who are gay, lesbian, or otherwise       part of the LGBTQ community. Mr. VanDyke would not say       affirmatively that he would be fair to any litigant before       him, notably members of the LGBTQ community.        Even though Mr. VanDyke is clearly smart, comments were       made that in some oral arguments he missed issues fundamental       to the analysis of the case. There were reports that his       preparation and performance were lacking in some cases in       which he did not have a particular personal or political       interest.        While the evaluator was careful in her interview with Mr.       VanDyke not to name interviewees, the nature of the issues       that gave rise to some of the negative comments had been       publicly discussed and other adverse comments could be raised       without identifying interviewees. The negative issues       discussed in this letter were thoroughly discussed with       interviewees and vetted with the nominee. Significantly, the       interviewees' views, negative or positive, appeared strongly       held on this nominee.        The Committee's work is guided by the Backgrounder which       reflects that judgment is a component of professional       competence, and that open-mindedness, courtesy, patience,       freedom from bias, and commitment to equal justice under law       are components of judicial temperament. Based on these       principles, a substantial majority of the Committee       determined that the nominee is ``Not Qualified'' to be a       Ninth Circuit judge.            Very truly yours,                                                William C. Hubbard.
