 Mr. Chairman, I rise today to seek support for my en bloc  amendment to H.R. 3354.   As we all know, drug overdose deaths in our country have dramatically  increased since the turn of the century. Over the past decade alone,  overdose deaths have increased by more than 400  [[Page H7255]]  percent. In 2015, more Americans died from opioids than in the Vietnam  war. Mr. Chairman, that is astonishing.   This is a national emergency. I have seen the effects firsthand in my  district. In 2016, nearly one-fifth of all opioid-related deaths in  South Carolina took place in my district.   My amendment would provide more funds to opioid prevention by  transferring $7 million from the DOJ General Administration account to  the opioid abuse reduction activities. More than ever, we must provide  as much funding as possible to defeat this national epidemic.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to join me in combating this  crisis.
