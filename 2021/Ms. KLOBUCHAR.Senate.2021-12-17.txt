 Mr. President, I rise today to talk about some  nominees and how important it is to keep advancing nominees.   A President should be able to have his Ambassadors in place so we can  deal with the rest of the world, and we have key people who are still  missing from Agencies, many of whom got through committees with strong  bipartisan support. Let me start with one of them.   Today, I rise to discuss the importance of the Senate swiftly  confirming Alan Davidson, one of President Biden's very important  nominees to the Department of Commerce. If confirmed, he will play a  crucial role in the coming months and years in making sure every  American has access to reliable, affordable internet.   Mr. Davidson has been nominated to be the Assistant Secretary for  Communications and Information at the Department of Commerce's National  Telecommunications and Information Administration, NTIA. OK. That  sounds like a lot of words, but what does it really mean?   As head of the NTIA, Mr. Davidson will oversee the distribution of  the $40 billion for broadband infrastructure funding coming out of our  bipartisan infrastructure bill. So his job couldn't be more important  as we look at providing high-speed internet to every corner of this  country. He will also play an important role in expanding wireless  internet networks, promoting fair competition in the digital sector,  and ensuring every American has access to affordable and fast internet.  [[Page S9288]]    As you know, after months of negotiations between Democrats and  Republicans, this Senate came together to pass the President's  bipartisan infrastructure law, making a once-in-a-generation investment  to improve roads, rail systems, and public transit, address climate  change by updating our power grid, and, yes, invest in high-speed  internet.   It is the largest investment our country has ever made in high-speed  internet. I was proud to lead in the Senate the base bill-- Representative Clyburn led it in the House--to make this happen when it  comes to broadband.   Affordable and reliable internet access is more important now than  ever as students and families rely on the internet to learn or work  from home, access telehealth services, and stay connected to loved  ones.   As 42 million Americans, including 16 percent of households in rural  Minnesota, lack reliable broadband access, the need to make the  promises of this law a reality could not be more urgent. As head of the  NTIA, Mr. Davidson will be responsible for overseeing the rollout of  funding for broadband grants across the country. We don't want to wait.  We need someone who knows what he is doing in place now.   With more than two decades of experience in the public and private  sector as an executive, someone who worked in technology, and as an  attorney, it is clear Mr. Davidson is ready for this job.   He served in the Department of Commerce during the Obama  administration, where he was the Department's first Director of Digital  Economy. His background in privacy and internet policy will be  invaluable. I am confident he will protect consumers, promote  competition, and make this historic law meaningful for everyday  Americans.   His nomination has earned support from a broad array of  organizations, including the Chamber of Commerce, the National  Consumers League, the Open Technology Institute, and more than 80  others.   I should also point out that eight former heads of the NTIA,  Republicans and Democrats alike, have urged the Senate to confirm Mr.  Davidson. And he did very well in the committee. He came out of the  committee with bipartisan support.   To me, this should just be done like this. We should just get it done  through this Chamber, but we wait through this morass of rules. Instead  of making the rules easier so we can restore the Senate so we  can actually debate issues, we literally spend hours and hours and  hours and hours on nominees who received Republican support in the  committee because one person decides, well, I am going to hold that one  up.    We need to get this done now because while we wait, students,  parents, and workers without high-speed internet are falling behind. I  have heard too many stories, as I know every Senator in this chamber  has heard, about people from our States who have jumped through hoops  just to get online.   One high school student in Otter Tail County, MN, had such weak  internet at her house that she always had to drive to the parking lot  of a liquor store to take her online biology quizzes. I met her mom.  She told me the story herself. I have also heard from rural doctors who  rely on the WiFi in McDonald's parking lots to read their patients' x  rays when they are outside the office on weekends. That is just  unacceptable. So we need to make sure that this historic broadband  funding gets out the door and that we have someone in place to  administer it.   In addition to this hugely important work, Mr. Davidson will also be  responsible for implementing upgrades to our 9-1-1 system. In a crisis,  no one should be put in danger because of outdated 9-1-1 systems, and  first responders, public safety officials, and law enforcement must be  able to communicate seamlessly.   As a member of the Senate Commerce Committee and as one of the chairs  of the Congressional Next Generation 9-1-1 Caucus, I know that these  upgrades are urgently needed to help move the country's largely  outdated 9-1-1 call centers and related technology into the digital  age. We need to enable 9-1-1 call centers to handle text messages,  pictures, videos, and other information sent by smartphones, tablets,  and other devices when faced with an emergency. Mr. Davidson, with his  vast array of experience, will help to bring our 9-1-1 systems into the  21st century by providing State and local governments with the  resources they need to update our emergency response networks and keep  our communities safe.   I urge my colleagues to support Mr. Davidson's nomination today to  move our country and our economy forward. The stakes are too high to  wait.   Mr. President, I also come to the floor today to speak on the many  Ambassador nominees who are ready for a vote but are being held up by  some of our colleagues on the other side. I emphasize ``some'' because  many of these nominees got strong bipartisan support.   While I appreciate the progress we are now making on some of the  nominees as we speak, many have been waiting months for a vote. When we  finish today--at least tonight or when we finish in the next few days-- more, we know, will still be waiting because we have well over 100  people who have been waiting for a vote, over 150 people waiting for a  vote.   This unnecessary delay is sabotaging our diplomatic efforts around  the world. The State Department is made up of some of the best, the  brightest, and the most patriotic citizens. By failing to confirm  Ambassadors, whether to Iraq--we know how important that is--Equatorial  Guinea, or Japan, we are hurting not only the nominees and our Foreign  Service officers but also all those who look to America as a beacon of  democracy.   First, let's look at Elizabeth Moore Aubin, who was nominated to be  Ambassador to Algeria in April and was reported out of the committee in  June--June--the beginning of summer. We are now in the middle of  winter.   Algeria is an important partner in northern Africa when it comes to  economic and strategic security issues. Aubin is clearly up to the  task. She previously served as the Assistant Secretary for the Bureau  of Near Eastern Affairs and served as the Deputy Chief of Mission in  Algiers, Algeria, during a 2013 terrorist attack.   Aubin knows from her years at the State Department and from her  firsthand experience what it takes to keep Americans safe overseas. Yet  she has been held up for 6 months. Americans and Americans in Algeria  deserve better.   Angola. Another Ambassador who has been waiting since June is  Tulinabo Mushingi, who has been nominated to serve as Ambassador to  Angola and several other islands off the coast of eastern Africa. He  has already served as Ambassador and Deputy Chief of Mission to our  Embassy in Ethiopia, so he will be ready to take on this role on day 1.   Through our country's partnership with the Angolan Government, we  have made significant progress in removing thousands of landmines and  advancing economic growth in the region. The United States and Angola  will be better served with an experienced Ambassador, and he should be  confirmed promptly.   Yet that is not all. We also must move forward with Claire Cronin,  whom President Biden nominated to be the Ambassador to Ireland. Cronin  was the first woman to serve as the Massachusetts House majority leader  and the first woman to chair the Massachusetts House Judiciary  Committee. President Biden nominated her in June, 6 months ago, and she  advanced from committee nearly 2 months ago, in mid-October.    Ireland is an economic partner, a security partner, and, of course,  the United States is home to many proud Irish Americans.   We need Ambassador Cronin to move forward.   I know we are making progress, but I think of a country like Japan,  where Rahm Emanuel has been nominated--Japan.   My good friend, whom we lost this year, Vice President Mondale, was  the Ambassador to Japan, and I remember how proud they were when he got  voted through and went to Japan. They were so proud that the United  States of America sent an ambassador to their country, someone of great  experience.   This is the case of all these Ambassador nominees. Our country  deserves to have people over there representing our Nation. You think  they don't notice, these countries?  [[Page S9289]]    As I said, we are making progress. Today or tomorrow, we may vote to  confirm Denise Campbell Bauer, President Biden's nominee to serve as  Ambassador to France. Bauer was nominated in July, 5 months ago, and is  only now coming to the floor for a vote. She served as Ambassador to  Belgium, including during the 2016 terrorist attack in Brussels. She is  well qualified for this role.   France is our oldest ally and friend, and while we may be making  progress, I am deeply concerned that our Republican colleagues have  needlessly delayed this post.   I urge my friends on the other side of the aisle to lift their hold  on these Ambassadors and the dozens of other qualified, dedicated  nominees.   We know there are negotiations afoot that we can move forward. Let's  get a bunch of these done.   The United States must be able to have strong people in place for our  allies to deal with problems overseas and to represent proudly the  United States of America.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today I rise to honor Minnesota  State Senator David Tomassoni, a public servant, Olympian, and friend.  Even through his battle with Lou Gehrig's Disease--also known as ALS-- he has continued to serve the people of his district on Minnesota's  Iron Range.   David's family has a distinctly American story: His grandfather was  an immigrant, and his father served in World War II. And David, a son  of Chisholm, MN, attended Denver University on a full hockey  scholarship before embarking on a professional hockey career that  brought him to Italy and the Olympics. He then returned to the place he  was so proud to call home: the Iron Range. As David is quick to remind  anyone, the Range ``provided the ore that has forged the steel that has  made the bridges of America.''   Northern Minnesota was also where David found his true calling as a  legislator. In nearly three decades of public service in the Minnesota  House of Representatives and State senate, David has represented his  community with pride, working every day to deliver real results for  workers and families. From bringing good-paying jobs to his district,  to improving schools, to fighting for safe conditions for miners, he  has always been driven by a commitment to making his constituents'  lives better.   When David announced his ALS diagnosis, it sent a shock through the  entire State senate, and his colleagues rushed to wish him  encouragement and good health. But even in the face of his own  illness--and in true Tomassoni fashion--he is still thinking of others.  He is planning to introduce legislation to invest in new research,  care, and ultimately a cure for ALS. He knows he likely will not be  able to benefit from that investment himself, but the possibility that  he could help another person is enough for him.   I want to leave you with David's own words, from the letter he shared  with his constituents about his ALS diagnosis. He wrote: ``I give you  my word that my brain and my body will continue to represent you with  the same passion and vigor I've tried to give in the past. I have been  fortunate and blessed in my life, my career, in sports, and with  friends and a great family. This is the next challenge.''   David, you are an inspiration, not just to me, but to anyone who  values hard work and determination. Thank you for your decades of  service to the people of our great State, and my thoughts and best  wishes are with you. If anyone is up to this challenge, it is  you.                            ____________________
