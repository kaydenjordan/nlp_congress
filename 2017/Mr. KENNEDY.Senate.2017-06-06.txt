 Mr. President, thank you and Senator Cassidy. We just  came back, as we all know, from the Memorial Day recess. I wanted today  not to only reflect on that but also to reflect on our anniversary of  D-day and the day that our Allies invaded France in 1944. In doing so  today, I would like to speak and pay tribute to all of those-- including, but not limited to, Americans, but especially Americans--who  risked their lives to defend our freedoms.   In particular, I come today to recognize a special group of dedicated  soldiers. You probably have not heard of them, but they are referred to  as the Ghost Army--the Ghost Army. This is a unit that served in World  War II. It was comprised of the 23rd Headquarters Special Troops and  the 3133rd Signal Service Company. The personnel of this U.S. Army unit  were handpicked. They were handpicked for their artistic and creative  characteristics, and you will see why in just a moment.   They handled top secret information, and they were among some of  America's most promising artists, engineers, and signals professionals.  The mission of the Ghost Army was very simple: Fool Adolph Hitler--fool  Adolph Hitler by using what was called tactical deception. The Ghost  Army's deceptive creation of fake battles, inflatable tanks, theatrical  props, and other inventive equipment falsified troop movements, and had  our enemies chasing ghosts--hence the name the Ghost Army.   Beginning in Normandy 2 weeks after D-day and ending in the Rhine  River Valley, the Ghost Army staged over 20 fake battles--fake  battlefield deceptions. The German Army did not know whether they were  coming or going, thanks to the Ghost Army. These performances, of  course, were illusions. They were called illusions by the soldiers.  They occurred in the most dangerous spot in the war, on the frontline  of battle.   Now, without the Ghost Army's dedication and fearless perseverance,  Allied successes at the Battle of the Bulge and the final battles in Po  Valley, Italy, would not have been possible. The 23rd unit was composed  of only 1,184 men--1,200 men. They put themselves at risk every day at  the forefront of danger, and they fought tirelessly. They used  ingenious, innovative methods to mislead the enemy, ultimately leading  the Allies to many victories in Europe. Because of their bravery,  because of the bravery of the 1,200 men in the Ghost Army, up to 30,000  American soldiers and 10,000 German soldiers were able to return home  alive.   So why are we waiting until today to honor these 1,184 brave  Americans? Because until recently the Ghost Army's mission was  classified. It was top secret. Nobody except the members of the Ghost  Army knew anything about it. This has finally changed. That is one of  the reasons I am here today. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Ghost  Army soldier bill, a bipartisan effort led by Senators Markey, Collins,  and King. This long overdue legislation will award a Congressional Gold  Medal to the 23rd Headquarters Special Troops and the 3133rd Signal  Service Company.   It is a privilege to share that, in my home State of Louisiana, the  Ghost Army is being recognized at the New Orleans Museum of Art.  Soldier's art is on display depicting many watercolor portraits, as  well as graphite portraits, of civilians, soldiers, and refugees during  World War II. It is a legacy that our great State now gets to honor.   Specifically, I want to recognize six brave men from Louisiana, my  State, who were members of the Ghost Army. Hilton Howell Railey of New  Orleans is a prominent journalist and the author of ``Touch'd with  Madness.'' He recruited several of the handpicked 23rd. Mr. Railey  trained and deployed the 3133rd Signal Service Company, which served in  Italy.   There is Jim Stegg of New Orleans, a longtime faculty member at  Tulane. He was an artist; in fact, there is a retrospective of his work  at the New Orleans Museum of Art's Ghost Army exhibit.   Also, there is Mr. Murphy P. Martin, of St. Martinville, LA; Mr.  Thomas L. Raggio, of Lake Charles, LA; Mr. Roy L. Ravia, of Calcasieu  Parish, in my State; Mr. Alvin J. Picard, of Vermilion Parish; and last  but certainly not least, Mr. Anderson B. Wilson, of Slidell, LA.   Unfortunately, Mr. Wilson is the only Ghost Army solder still alive  in Louisiana. I had the rare privilege and the rare honor of speaking  with Mr. Wilson this morning. In December of 1943, President Roosevelt  authorized the Ghost Army unit. Only 2 weeks later, in January 1944,  Mr. Wilson was on his way to Camp Mack Morris, TN, to join the Ghost  Army. Who says the Federal Government can't move quickly when it wants  to?   Mr. Wilson trained there until May, when his unit was shipped out of  New York to Liverpool, England. It was the largest convoy that at the  time had ever crossed the Atlantic Ocean. From there, Mr. Wilson and  his team traveled more than any other unit. From England they went to  France. They went to Belgium. They went to Holland. They went to  Luxembourg, and they went to Germany.   Mr. Wilson and his comrades fought fearlessly through the war's end  as members of the Ghost Army. In July 1945, Mr. Wilson finally came  home. However, while he came home safely, he could not even disclose,  he couldn't even talk about--even to his own family--the honorable  service unit he was a part of. Now, it is humbling to me to hear a  man's sacrifice, to go through what he went through and not even be  able to talk about it with his family, but he kept his word out of  honor to his country.    The willingness of Mr. Wilson and his fellow soldiers to risk their  own lives to defend the freedom we have today--well, it, too, is  humbling.   Mr. Wilson returned home in 1945. And I hope he is listening right  now. He has been a little under the weather. He was in the hospital  when I spoke to him today. It wasn't until the 1990s, when Mr. Wilson  was married with two grown children, that he could ever talk about his  service to this great country, share his stories, share his  experiences, share his fight to keep the freedoms all of us take for  granted every day.   Mr. Wilson's story only gives a snapshot of the sacrifices and  honorable work these men of the Ghost Army gave to the Allied forces  victory. And I, for one--and I know all Americans join me--thank them  for their service and for the freedoms they protected.   I am proud of this Ghost Army legislation, and I hope to see it move  forward and pass so that these fine Americans can receive the  recognition they have long deserved.   God bless the members of the Ghost Army. And if you are listening,  Mr. Wilson, God bless you.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  recess until 2:15 p.m.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 12:01 p.m., recessed until  2:15 p.m. and reassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer  (Mr. Portman).                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have 6 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
