 Madam Speaker, and still I rise. I rise as a  person who is proud to live in a country where we celebrate the ideal  of liberty and justice for all; government of the people, by the  people, for the people.   I rise today with grateful thoughts on my mind and in my heart. I  rise with gratitude. I am thankful to those persons, the many, who have  signed on to H. Res. 517.   H. Res. 517, Madam Speaker, is a resolution that would allow us to  remember slavery, Slavery Remembrance Day.   Slavery Remembrance Day would be a day that we would set aside, not  for celebration, but for commemoration, for memorialization, to  remember the atrocities that were imposed upon people, human beings,  how they were made chattel. Slavery Remembrance Day.   And for those who may not be aware, we have a 9/11 Remembrance Day.  We have a Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day. We have a Holocaust Remembrance  Day. But we don't have a Slavery Remembrance Day.   Hence, on August 20 of this year, we will commemorate the first  Slavery Remembrance Day, because it was on that day in 1619 that the  White Lion landed in this country with some 20 persons who were held in  captivity as slaves. Slavery Remembrance Day.   So I am rising today to thank the many persons who have already  signed on to the resolution. And I want you to know that we will be  sending you something very special, something comparable to this. It  will have the resolution cited on one side of the page. Each of your  names will be highlighted on the other side of the page. And each of  you will have a special place for your name that will be highlighted.   This is historic, and we have to treat it as such. This is something  that those who will look back on this time through the vista of time,  they will look, and they will conclude that we did not forget, that we  made it a point to remember that those who, unfortunately, don't learn  the lessons of history sometimes repeat history.   We never want to repeat slavery. Hence, we will have a Slavery  Remembrance Day resolution.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to  speak on this issue. And still I rise.   And I rise today because, as a Member of Congress, I believe we have  a duty, a responsibility, and an obligation to act when industry is not  acting, and the health of the American people is at risk.   It is time for Congress to do what it should have done, what EPA has  not done, what we can do. I believe that there is no option but to vote  ``yes.'' No is not an option when it comes to the health and safety of  the American people.    I will vote ``yes.'' I will vote for the American people and their  safety.
