 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise today, and I rise  today to express my gratitude and appreciation for Eduardo. Eduardo,  Mr. Speaker, is a person who was in an auto accident and hurt severely,  and it was discovered that he was at the end stage of severe renal  disease. Upon finding this out, he had to be dialyzed three times a  week.   Mr. Speaker, this picture shows a press event which Eduardo attended  because he was removed from the country. I am here to thank the  President, the Vice President, and the Secretary of Homeland Security,  as well as the Congressional Black Caucus for getting him back into the  country and saving his life.   Mr. Speaker, once he was returned, the question was asked: What would  you like to be when you grow up?   He said: I want to go into the military, the United States military,  so that I can protect the United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, this is an immigrant who wants to protect our country,  and I am grateful to those who saved his life.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a testimony, the  genesis of which is, I believe that President Biden did the best that  he could in developing this legislation. I support him. I thank him for  what he has done. I believe that Leader Jeffries did an outstanding job  in making it perspicuously clear that default was not an option, but  here is the essence of my testimony: I had the preeminent privilege of  serving in Congress in 2008 September, I believe it was, when we had  the downturn in the economy and there was a clarion call for help to do  what was called bail out the banks.   I was adamantly, totally, completely opposed to bailing out the banks  because I thought it was not the thing to do, given that the banks did  not ask for our help in getting into the position that they were in.   I stood in the rear of this Chamber, and I could see the votes as  they were being tallied. I could also see the stock market reacting to  the votes as they were being tallied. The stock market went down as the  bill went down--777 points, a 7 percent drop in the stock market.   My constituents had told me not to vote for that bill, and I  concurred with them. The next day my constituents called, Why didn't  you vote for that  [[Page H2678]]  bill? Why did you let the market go down?   I learned a lesson: Votes like this are votes of conscience, and you  have to vote your conscience knowing what the consequences are.   Mr. Speaker, I will vote for this bill because I understand the  consequences of the market tanking. I was here, and I saw it. I  understand we have to take care of our people.
