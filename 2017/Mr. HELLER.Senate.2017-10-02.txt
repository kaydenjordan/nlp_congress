 Mr. President, today I want to express my sincere  condolences to the victims of the shooting in Las Vegas, NV.   As a lifelong Nevadan, I am overcome with sadness and grief by this  senseless massacre, in which a gunman opened fire on more than 22,000  innocent concertgoers, killing more than 50 people and injuring more  than 500 individuals.   Nevada's communities are all in mourning, and some of our loved ones  and friends have been personally impacted by this carnage.   I stand beside Nevada as they reel from this heinous, wide-scale  tragedy, working to ensure that my State has the resources it needs to  recover from this senseless act of violence. For these reasons, I must  be with the people of Nevada right now.   I have a commitment to serve my constituents and will continue to  work tirelessly on the ground with the people of Las Vegas ensuring  that they have resources to recover and rebuild as a community.   My sincerest gratitude goes out to our first responders, local  medical staff, and police officers for their swift actions and efforts  that without a doubt, saved numerous lives. I also would like to  recognize the countless Nevadans at the show who aided strangers in  need and the wounded, using tourniquets and carrying people to safety,  as the shooting continued.   I have been in contact with the White House, Governor Sandoval, Mayor  Carolyn Goodman, and Sheriff Joseph Lombardo and stand ready to assist  Clark County Commission Chair Steve Sisolak and the Las Vegas  Metropolitan Police Department. I will continue to monitor the  situation as this horrific event unfolds.   Lynne and I are praying for all of the victims and their families who  are experiencing immense pain and grave, shocking loss that cannot be  measured.   Nevada is our home, and I know it will rise again from this perilous  day.    (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
