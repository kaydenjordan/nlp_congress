 Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong support and as a  proud cosponsor of this amendment. I do so in defense of one of our  most magnificent natural resources: the Great Lakes.   The Great Lakes contain a fifth of the world's and 95 percent of our  Nation's surface water. The Lakes are an important asset to our economy  and the quality of life of our Nation, and in my district in  particular.   The National Ocean Policy also helps protect the vitality of our  Great Lakes ecosystem. However, section 505 of this bill will undermine  our National Ocean Policy and the ability of agencies to coordinate  with States, local governments, and other agencies to protect these  beautiful waters. That is why I support striking section 505.   We have a profound obligation to be responsible stewards of the  environment and to pass on a clean, healthy, and dynamic environment  for future generations.   Mr. Chair, I support the Pingree amendment.
