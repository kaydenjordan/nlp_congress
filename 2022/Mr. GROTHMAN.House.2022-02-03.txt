 Madam Speaker, the Biden immigration policy has been  well-documented. We have gone from about 20,000 people a month being  let in the country to 90,000.   Between 2019 and 2021, the number of people kicked out of the country  has fallen over 80 percent. What will the result be? More people on  welfare, more crime, more drugs--particularly fentanyl--more people  untested for COVID.   But there is something else--because apparently that doesn't bother  the Biden administration--they ought to think about: You appear weak.  You may not care, but believe me, all normal people around the world,  when they see we are not enforcing immigration laws, they say we have a  weak President. And when countries like Russia or China and North Korea  and Iran size up the United States, they look at your border policy and  say, we are dealing with a weak person.   And all these decisions, which are very difficult decisions to be  made with all these countries, are going to be that much more difficult  to make because you, Mr. President, are defining weakness in your  immigration policy. That is the price that you will pay.
