 Mr. President, as we all know, Congress has until  Friday to reach an agreement that ensures continuous funding for the  Federal Government. There is too much at stake for Republicans and  Democrats not to come together, particularly while serious bipartisan  conversations are underway on shared priorities, such as rebuilding our  military, fixing our broken immigration policy, and other issues.   Now that a Federal judge has issued a nationwide injunction  preventing the administration from winding down the Obama  administration's DACA Program, it is clear that Congress has at least  until March, at a minimum and possibly even longer, to reach a  compromise that resolves the DACA question but also strengthens our  security and makes other needed reforms to our broken immigration  system. With no imminent deadline on immigration and with bipartisan  talks well underway, there is no reason why Congress should hold  government funding hostage over the issue of illegal immigration.   I am confident that Senators on both sides of the aisle will choose  to avoid a manufactured crisis, reach a bipartisan funding agreement in  the coming days, and then continue our negotiations in these important  areas.                            ____________________     Now, on another matter, later this afternoon the  Senate will vote to advance reauthorization of title VII of the Foreign  Intelligence Surveillance Act. This includes section 702, one of the  most important tools that our warfighters and intelligence  professionals use to wage the war on terror and to keep Americans safe.   It allows the United States to collect communications from foreign  terrorists who wish harm on America and our allies. To be clear, it  does not permit the targeting of American citizens anywhere in the  world. Let me repeat that. Section 702 does not allow the targeting of  American citizens, nor does it permit the targeting of anyone of any  nationality who is known to be located here in the United States. With  respect to foreigners on foreign soil, 702 gives the men and women who  keep us safe the vital tools they need to fulfill their missions.   Five years ago, Congress reauthorized the title with overwhelming  bipartisan support. It is imperative that we do so once again. The  world remains dangerous. Al-Qaida, ISIL, and associated terror groups  are still intent on harming our people and those working with us  overseas.   Yet with each day that passes since the Nation was attacked on  September 11, 2001, it seems that concern over terrorism has waned.  This is in part due to the success of our defense and intelligence  community in preventing another major attack. They rely upon section  702 to accomplish that mission.   I look forward to renewing the bipartisan consensus on this issue and  reauthorizing this important provision as the Senate votes later this  week.                            ____________________     Now, on a final matter, in the wake of last month's  historic tax reform legislation, the news is filled with stories of  economic optimism and increasing prosperity for workers and middle- class families.   In fact, I am proud to announce that earlier today I spoke with the  leadership of Humana, which employs more than 12,000 people in my home  State of Kentucky. Yesterday they notified their staff that they will  be accelerating pay incentives for associates and raising the minimum  hourly wages for both part-time and full-time employees--all thanks to  tax reform. For these Kentucky workers, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will  mean more money in their paychecks.   Just last week, the international automaker Fiat Chrysler announced  that it will invest 1 billion new dollars  [[Page S174]]  in the Warren Truck Assembly Plant just outside of Detroit. The  production line for Ram heavy-duty trucks is leaving Mexico and coming  back to America. This will create 2,500 new jobs and inject relief  right into the local economy. According to officials who announced the  change, all this is only happening because tax reform is remaking the  business climate in our country.   Besides the revival in manufacturing, Fiat Chrysler announced a new  wave of $2,000 bonuses for 60,000 hourly and salaried employees. They  will join a growing list of more than 150 companies that have announced  plans to distribute significant bonuses, permanent pay raises, more  generous retirement contributions, or other benefits to their  employees, all thanks to tax reform.   Prior to tax reform, companies that wanted to manufacture goods in  America and hire American employees faced the highest statutory  corporate tax rate in the developed world. American workers were ready  to clock in, but our outdated burdensome Tax Code told potential  investors to move along and find somewhere else to set up shop. Those  days are over, thanks to the President and Republican majorities in the  House and Senate that voted to modernize our Tax Code.   Now we are the ones with a competitive advantage. The Wall Street  Journal's editorial board believes that our tax reform will benefit  investment in the United States ``at the expense of high-tax countries  such as Germany.'' The Journal also reports that China ``fears the tax  changes could make the U.S. a more attractive place to do business.''  That is China. It is becoming clear that these fears are entirely  justified, and it is good news for families and workers in Kentucky and  all across America.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
