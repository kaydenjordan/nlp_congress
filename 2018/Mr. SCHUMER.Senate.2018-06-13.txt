 Mr. President, talks between President Trump and  Chairman Kim in Singapore, as we all know, concluded yesterday.  Certainly, we are all heartened to see the two leaders engage in a  dialogue. We feel much better when both President Trump and Chairman  Kim are talking rather than trading insults and military threats. We  all want this diplomacy to succeed.   But now that the dust is settling after the Singapore summit, three  things are clear. No. 1, Chairman Kim achieved far more than President  Trump did. No. 2, our adversaries, Russia and China, have gained while  our allies, like South Korea and Japan, have lost footing and some  degree of faith in America's reliability. No. 3, the summit was much  more show than substance--what the Texans call ``all cattle and no  hat.''   Let me elaborate. In past agreements with North Korea, the United  States won far stronger language on denuclearization, and we won  specific measures to ensure that North Korea was taking steps in that  direction. Of course, even with the stronger language, the North Korean  regime repeatedly backtracked from previous American-led agreements.   The joint statement in Singapore includes none of the concrete  details that could make an ambitious goal like ``complete  denuclearization'' close to meaningful. Chairman Kim did not even  mention his ambiguous comment to denuclearize when he returned home to  North Korea. It was absent in all the North Korean press. Often you can  tell how a leader feels from what they tell their people, not what they  say publicly to the world. In this case, denuclearization was not even  mentioned.   Still, President Trump tweeted this morning ``there is no longer a  nuclear threat from North Korea.'' What planet is the President on?  Saying it doesn't make it so. North Korea still has nuclear weapons. It  still has ICBMs. It still has the United States in danger. Somehow,  President Trump thinks that when he says something, it becomes  reality--if it were only that easy, only that simple. That is what  stood in the way of making this meeting more meaningful.   It is not show. It is not verbiage. It is action. President Trump, in  his actions, did things that President Kim wanted. I don't know what  President Kim has done that we want, other than show up, which was a  benefit for him.   President Trump agreed to freeze joint military exercises with South  Korea, and he called them ``provocations''--right out of the North  Korean propaganda playbook--without the knowledge of South Korea or our  own military. I guarantee that our military men and women were  squirming when President Trump called our joint military exercises  ``provocations.''   These exercises and others that the military conduct around the world  are designed to ensure that our servicemembers are fully trained and  ready for action. They are not a provocation, President Trump.   Adopting the North Korean view on American military exercises,  which President Trump did, is nothing short of a public relations coup  for Chairman Kim. It seems that President Trump didn't even think it  through or consult with anybody. You cannot do this stuff on the fly.  Saying that the danger from North Korea is over doesn't make it so.  Saying that these are provocations makes things worse. You cannot do it  on the fly. You need serious thought because it has consequences. If  Chairman Kim walked away from these negotiations thinking that it is  easy to deal with President Trump, Kim might think: I get what I want,  and I don't have to give him anything. That doesn't bode well for the  future.    In the final tabulation, after all the pomp and circumstance has  faded, it seems clear that Chairman Kim walked away the victor,  unfortunately. What President Trump achieved on behalf of the United  States is unclear and difficult to certify. What Chairman Kim achieved  for North Korea is tangible and lasting.   No doubt, our Republican friends would be up in arms if a Democratic  President walked away from a summit with so little to show for it. But,  of course, while we haven't heard full-throated praise from our  Republican side--their reactions have been kind of lukewarm--it is not  close to the criticism they launched at President Obama in similar  situations.   In the weeks and months ahead, President Trump and his team need to  focus on securing real and enduring concessions from the North Koreans  on plutonium and uranium enrichment, on the destruction of nuclear  infrastructure, on an ``anywhere, anytime'' inspections regime, and the  unambiguous end of missile testing.   These are the things that make a strong nuclear agreement.  Unfortunately, the Singapore summit produced none of them and talked  about none of them. We hope that in the future that changes for the  safety of America, but, again, the emphasis on showmanship as opposed  to substance will not serve America or the prospects for peace well in  the long run.   On one final point, congressional oversight and involvement is  critical to this process. Secretary Pompeo needs to make clear what the  process moving forward includes and what, if any, additional agreements  were made in Singapore. Congress needs to learn the terms for any  sanctions relief, whether U.S. troop presence in Korea was discussed  and whether any agreement will include a halt to North Korea's key  missile programs.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, on healthcare. Even as North Korea  dominates the headlines, Democrats are going to continue to focus on  the No. 1 issue on the minds of most Americans: healthcare.   Insurers in State after State are announcing double-digit premium  increases and blaming Republican healthcare policies for the increase.  Now, amazingly, the Trump administration is refusing to defend the  constitutionality of protections for Americans with preexisting  conditions, turning its back on the most popular and most humane  advancement in our healthcare system.   Imagine the return of the days when a mother with a child who has  cancer can no longer find affordable care for her daughter and the days  when hard-working Americans who fall on hard times are made to suffer  and denied healthcare coverage, precisely because they need it so  desperately. How wrong, how backward, and how immoral that system was,  and that is where President Trump wants to take us again.   So we Democrats are going to spend the next few months, including the  August work period, focusing on the critical issue of the Nation's  healthcare system. We will be trying to get premiums down, costs down,  and better healthcare, not the deterioration we have seen under  President Trump and the Republican congressional leadership.   We are going to focus on all that our Republican friends have done to  drive up the costs of healthcare on average Americans and what we  should be doing to reverse that awful trend.                            ____________________     Finally, there is the IG report. Tomorrow, the inspector  general of the Justice Department will release a report about the  Department's handling of an investigation of Secretary Clinton in 2016.  We look forward to the report and learning what it has to say.  [[Page S3866]]    Now, we hope our Republican colleagues don't take the cynical track  of trying to spin the report's contents to somehow sully the completely  separate and ongoing investigation into Putin's meddling in the 2016  election. The DOJ IG report is likely to focus on the conduct of the  Justice Department and the FBI in handling the Clinton email  investigation in the runup to the 2016 election. Mueller was not  appointed at that point. He wasn't a gleam in anyone's eye. So what he  is doing is totally independent of what happened here.   Furthermore, when the President says ``witch hunt'' and somehow  blames Democrats for this, well, whatever Comey did hurt Hillary  Clinton, and he didn't do the same thing to President Trump, which  would have hurt him. He released the details of Hillary's  investigation--many of us thought he did that wrongly--but didn't  release any details of the investigation into possible collusion of the  Trump campaign with the Russians.   So this idea that somehow what Comey did and what Mueller is doing  was designed to hurt President Trump and Republicans at Democrats'  behest is like ``Alice in Wonderland''--it is the opposite of the  facts. The investigation into Putin's meddling in our elections and any  potential associations between Russian intelligence and the Trump  campaign is an entirely separate investigation from what happened with  Hillary Clinton.   It would be erroneous to try to use the information in the IG report  to discredit the special counsel, but we hear rumblings that some of  these very partisan Republicans, led by Chairman Nunes, may try to go  down that road. We hope they won't be so cynical or so willing to twist  the facts inside out and turn truth on its head, all for political  gain.   It is crucial--critical--that Special Counsel Mueller's investigation  get to the bottom of what happened and who was involved in Russia's  efforts to influence the outcome of the 2016 election.   Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a  quorum.
