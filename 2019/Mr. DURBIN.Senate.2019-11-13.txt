 Mr. President, if members of the American public came to  the Senate Chamber this week to witness legislative activity, such as a  piece of legislation on the floor, amendments, debate, votes,  deliberation, or compromise, they are out of luck. We don't do that in  the Senate anymore. We are not going to do it this week; we didn't do  it last week; and we didn't do it the week before.   Now, the Republican leader just said the problem is impeachment. The  problem is not impeachment. The problem is the Senate is not a Senate  anymore. All we do in the Senate--all we do in the Senate is this  serial list of judicial nominations, one after the other, after the  other, after the other. That is it. We don't take up legislation.   Yesterday there was a--right across the street from this Capitol  Building, in front of the Supreme Court, hundreds of people were there  because of a hearing in the Supreme Court on the issue of DACA, which  was created by President Obama, where 780,000 undocumented young people  had a chance to stay in this country and was abolished by President  Trump. Hundreds came out yesterday. They wanted to hear--at least try  to hear the Supreme Court deliberations on their future and what would  happen to them.   It is quite possible that the Court will rule in the President's  favor. I hope not, but it is possible, and the future of these young  people will be deportation. You can imagine how they feel about this  issue. They look back over here at the Capitol and they wonder: What  are they doing in the U.S. Capitol building to deal with an issue of  such grave importance for such a large group of people in the United  States? Here's what we are doing: Nothing--nothing.    The House of Representatives passed the American Dream and Promise  Act in the month of June, and the U.S. Senate and Senator McConnell  will not let us bring it to the floor. Is he going to blame the  impeachment proceedings for the fact that we have waited 5 months now  with this critical bill, having passed the House, not even being  considered in the U.S. Senate? Is that the reason we haven't been able  to take up serious legislation for weeks in the U.S. Senate? Of course  not. It is not about impeachment; it is about a strategy designed by  the Senate Republican leader not to entertain substantive legislation-- just to take up the issues of nominations.   The nominations, of course, are an issue themselves. I mentioned the  judicial nominations. Well, last week in the Senate Judiciary  Committee, we had the ninth Trump nominee for the  [[Page S6517]]  Federal bench who had been found unqualified by the American Bar  Association. That is nine so far. You say to yourself, well, that must  happen from time to time. It never happened one time under President  Obama; not one nominee was judged unqualified. There are nine of them  under President Trump. Why? Because this administration, with the  cooperation of Senator McConnell, is hell-bent to fill these vacancies,  regardless of the competency of the individual who is being nominated.   On the calendar today is another nomination. Today the Senate is  going to vote on the nomination of Chad Wolf. This is technically a  vote for Mr. Wolf to be the Department of Homeland Security's Under  Secretary for policy.   Let's be clear. This is actually a vote on whether Mr. Wolf would run  the entire Department of Homeland Security. He would be the sixth  Secretary in charge of this critical agency, the Department of Homeland  Security--the sixth one since President Trump was elected. Talk about a  fast-moving, revolving exit door. You can hardly get your desk put  together with a few pens and computers on top of it; then, with  President Trump, you are out the door if you are the Secretary of the  Department of Homeland Security.   Next up is Chad Wolf. The President has indicated he is going to  appoint him, not as the Secretary of Homeland Security--no, the Acting  Secretary of Homeland Security. But he first has to be confirmed as an  Under Secretary.   The Trump administration has shown in their immigration policy an  approach to this issue that we haven't seen for decades in Washington  or the United States. The President has been especially harsh when it  comes to families and children. President Trump's ineffective policies  have made our southern border much less secure than when he took  office. The situation has even been worsened by this gaping leadership  vacuum in the Department of Homeland Security. In less than 3 years,  there have been four heads of the Department. Wolf would be the fifth  person--I said six earlier, sorry--to run it and the third Acting  Secretary. Every position at the Department of Homeland Security with  responsibility for immigration is now held by a temporary appointee  ready to be fired at a moment's notice, and the White House is not even  submitting nominations for those positions. This is a conscious choice  by the Trump White House to increase their power and to undermine the  role of the U.S. Senate, and the Republican majority thinks it is just  fine.   The President has boasted about all of his Acting Secretaries. He  even has an Acting Chief of Staff. Donald Trump said: I like acting. It  gives you great, great flexibility.   It sure does. You can just fire a person and call the next up in a  moment, in a matter of days.   Stephen Vladeck, a leading expert on the Senate's confirmation  process, notes that the President's approach is ``depriving the Senate  of its constitutional role--and in the process, of opportunities to vet  his nominees, to reject those who are unqualified, and to conduct  meaningful oversight of the executive branch.''   So what does the Senate institutionalists and the Senator from  Kentucky think about diminishing the roles of the Senate? Just fine,  Mr. President, whatever you want.   Today, the Senate will actually have a chance to vote on this  individual, Chad Wolf, to become an Under Secretary on his quick path  to become an Acting Secretary on his even quicker path to be in some  way retired or fired.   So is Chad Wolf the right person to run the Department of Homeland  Security, one of the most important law enforcement agencies? His main  qualification appears to be that he was Chief of Staff and top adviser  to former Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.   I would say that arguably she may have been one of the worst  performing Homeland Security Secretaries ever in our history. It was  Kirstjen Nielsen who falsely claimed, ``We do not have a policy of  separating families at the border.'' Then came along the Federal judge  in Southern California and demanded an accounting of what actually was  going on at the border. Do you know what the judge found after he  demanded that the Department of Homeland Security under Kirstjen  Nielsen account for family separations? They found that more than 2,800  infants, toddlers, and children had been separated from their parents  at the border. Even worse, there was no effort made to trace where the  parents were headed and where the child was headed. At the end, some of  these children never ever were reunited with their parents, separated  by Kirstjen Nielsen's Department of Homeland Security.   I have seen the results of these disastrous separations. At the  immigration court in downtown Chicago, in a Loop high-rise building  that you would never pick out as a court, you take an elevator to one  of the top floors and get out on a crowded floor. There are people  standing four- and five-deep waiting for the docket call for  immigration court.   I went into the court just last year to see what family separation  was all about. I found a good judge who had been at it for almost 20  years, and she said to me: Senator, please stay for the docket call, at  least the first group of clients.   The first group of clients were called. Marta was one of the clients.  The judge said: Would the clients please take their seats. The  problem--the problem was, Marta was 2 years old. Marta had to be lifted  into her chair and handed a stuffed animal that she was hanging onto  throughout this hearing, which I am sure she never understood.   Hamilton was a little boy who was also a client in the immigration  court that day. He was 4 years old--4 years old in a U.S. immigration  court because of the separation of children from their parents. He did  jump up on the chair because he saw a Matchbox car on the table that he  could play with while this hearing was deciding his fate.    Do you know what happened? They continued their cases for another 6  months. Fortunately, Marta was reunited with her father in less than 6  months. Do you know what happened when separated children were united?  Some of these children would not even let their own mothers hold them.  That is what happens when you separate a 2-year old from her mother for  months at a time. That is what happened over and over again on the  watch of Kirstjen Nielsen, the Secretary of Homeland Security. Mr. Chad  Wolf, who is on our calendar today, was her chief of staff during this  zero-tolerance policy.   These disastrous separations have done permanent damage to countless  children. I saw two of them. Publicly released emails show that Mr.  Chad Wolf, who will be voted on today in the Senate, was deeply  involved in the discussions that led to this policy. As far back as  December of 2017, Wolf was Acting Chief of Staff to Secretary Nielsen.  He sent the Justice Department a list of 16 options for deterring  undocumented immigrants. No. 2 on the list was ``separate family  units.'' His fingerprints are all over zero tolerance.   Mr. Wolf was also intimately involved in the Trump administration's  efforts to use Dreamers as bargaining chips to advance the President's  anti-immigrant agenda. After he repealed DACA, President Trump rejected  numerous bipartisan deals to protect Dreamers. I will not go through  the awful details of our bipartisan efforts to come up with a bill,  which the President time and again rejected. Instead, he said: Here is  my approach to the Senate. Take it or leave it.   The Senate left. It received fewer than 40 votes in a Senate  dominated by a Republican majority.   The administration said that it would support the authorization of  Dreamers if the Congress passed his plan, which included the largest  cut in legal immigration in almost a century. The Senate rejected it.  How do I know that Mr. Wolf was involved in this effort? I sat in on a  half dozen meetings with Secretary Nielsen and Mr. Wolf, just down the  hall from here in the office of Republican Congressman Kevin McCarthy.  He was there. Wolf was part of the program.   In another administration, involvement in family separation and DACA  repeal would be grounds for dismissal. In the Trump administration, it  is grounds for promotion--promotion to become the Acting Secretary and  to see if this flavor of the month as the head of one of these key  agencies can actually gut it out for 6 months. It might be a record if  he did.  [[Page S6518]]    I urge my colleagues to oppose the nomination of Mr. Wolf.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker),  the Senator from California (Ms. Harris), the Senator from Vermont (Mr.  Sanders), and the Senator from Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are  necessarily absent.

[[Page S6520]]     I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker),  the Senator from California (Ms. Harris), the Senator from Vermont (Mr.  Sanders), and the Senator from Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are  necessarily absent.    Reserving the right to object.    Mr. President, let me start by saying I support this  bill, the bill offered by Senators Cornyn and Blumenthal. It is  bipartisan in nature and passed the Judiciary Committee. I not only  voted for it, I cosponsored it, and I think it should become the law of  the land. It will be helpful in reducing the cost of pharmaceuticals.   I am offering a modification to the bill. I believe this modification  is one that should be passed by the Senate as well. In fact, it did  pass the Senate last year by a voice vote. Not a single Senator  objected when it passed the Senate last year. We know--I have been told  by my colleagues--that they support the concept, but they are not  alone. The bill I am offering is also supported by the American Medical  Association; the American Hospital Association; 88 percent of the  American people, Republicans and Democrats; President Trump; his health  Secretary, Dr. Azar; the AARP--a long list.   What could I possibly propose that would have all of these people  supporting it? Simple. When the drug companies decide to run an ad on  television--and you see a lot of them, don't you? The average American  sees nine every day. All we ask is that included in the ad, they  disclose the cost of the drug.   How did I pick this as the cost for the drug? I didn't pick it; it  was chosen by the pharmaceutical company. That is the list price of the  drug. They can go on to say ``You will not have to pay that amount,''  but I believe the American people should know what the drugs cost.   The most heavily advertised drug in America today is HUMIRA. HUMIRA  is used for forms of arthritis and psoriasis. But few Americans know,  as they watch people sitting by the swimming pool with clear skin, that  HUMIRA costs $5,500 per month. The reason I want to disclose this is  because I think consumers have the right to know.   Someone is going to pay that amount--your insurance company. Somebody  is going to pay that amount. When Blue Cross and Blue Shield of  Illinois says that the No. 1 driver in health insurance premiums is  high prescription drug prices, I think people ought to know. It is not  just a matter of being in a bathing suit without a red patch on your  elbow; it is $5,500 per month.   President Trump believes that disclosure should be made, the  Secretary of Health and Human Services believes it, the American  Medical Association, the Hospital Association, all the people I  mentioned, as well as almost 90 percent of Democrats and Republicans.  Who opposes this? Who would oppose disclosing the price of the drug? I  will bet you are guessing the pharmaceutical industry, and you are  right. They are looking for one Senator who will object to what I am  offering. That is what they need. They need just one Senator to say no,  and frankly I am afraid we are going to face that this afternoon.   The bottom line is this: If you believe consumers in America have a  right to know the cost of a drug, if you believe the pharmaceutical  companies have a responsibility to disclose it, if you believe high  prescription drug prices are unfair and costing a lot more in our  healthcare system than they should, then support this basic measure  that passed the Senate last year without one negative voice. None. None  whatsoever.   So having reserved the right to object, I ask that the Senator modify  his request so that in addition to the pending request, the Finance  Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. 1437 and the  Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; that the Durbin-Grassley  amendment at the desk be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be  considered read a third time and passed; that the Durbin-Grassley  amendment to the title be agreed to; and that the motions to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action  or debate.    Reserving the right to object.   I am not a zoologist, so I don't know if crocodiles can cry, but I am  very concerned about the argument the Senator from Pennsylvania made.  He is actually standing here, in defense of senior citizens, by  objecting to disclosing the list price that the pharmaceutical  companies charge for these drugs. I didn't choose that price; they  chose that price.    I will not yield until I am finished.   I said they could put a disclaimer on that saying maybe you will not  pay the full list price depending on your insurance or coverage, but to  argue that you are standing here in defense of senior citizens and  denying this information to them and that the only way we can consider  this measure is call up the Department of Defense appropriations bill-- from where I am standing, this measure, which passed the Senate without  your objection last year, should pass now with the underlying  legislation. Let's get this done in a comprehensive way to help  seniors, and let's not stand in defense of pharmaceutical companies.  They have plenty of people to defend them.    I object.    Mr. President, on September 29, Thomas Owens of Chicago  passed away, leaving a legacy of faith, philanthropy, and friendship.  He was an innovator and an advocate for helping people. Tom was  dedicated to the biblical proverb, ``To whom much is given, much is  expected.''   Tom used to joke that he entered philanthropic ventures because he  spent too much time hovering around the kitchen with his wife, Mary. In  truth, he just believed in helping those less fortunate. Tom and Mary  founded the Owens Foundation in 1985, inspired by the work of Saint  Mother Teresa of Calcutta. Tom and Mary enjoyed a friendship with  Mother Teresa and were instrumental in supporting Missionary of Charity  projects in Chicago, Arizona, and Tijuana, Mexico, to alleviate poverty  and provide hope to those in need.   In the early 1990s, Tom retired from a successful business and having  spent 20 years as an IBM executive. Many people would have considered  slowing down after that, but not Tom. That same year he retired, he  founded Cara Chicago.   Tom started Cara out of the back of his car. He drove shelter to  shelter, connecting women with business colleagues and contacts he had  accumulated over the years. Nearly 30 years later, Cara is a world- class job training and placement program, helping more than 6,000  people into more than 10,000 jobs.   Cara is the Gaelic word for friend, and this program helps give  people a professional friend when they need it most.   Tom earned numerous awards like being one of the Streetwise  Foundation's 20 Most Inspirational Chicagoans. He also was Leo High  School's Lifetime Achievement Award winner in 2018. Leo High School's  motto is Facta non Verba, meaning Deeds not Words. Tom's work as one of  the most caring people I have known speaks for itself.   Tom liked to say, ``Don't just make it a good day . . . make it a  great day!'' Many people have great days because of his work.   Tom is survived by his wife, five children, 22 grandchildren, and the  thousands of people who have better days because of Tom.                            ____________________
