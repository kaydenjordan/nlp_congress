 Madam Speaker, I rise today during the Department of  Veterans Affairs Week of Action to highlight the PACT Act.   I encourage American veterans who are injured by toxic exposure to  avail themselves of the new benefits afforded by this historic  legislation.   Just call the VA at 1-800-MY-VA-411 to submit an application.   Thousands of veterans who served in Vietnam, the Gulf, and post-9/11  conflicts and are suffering from wounds they incurred from toxic  substances are now eligible to receive expanded VA benefits.   A veteran from my hometown in Ohio, pictured here, lives with  internal injuries as well as grievous hand wounds--I have never seen  this condition in another human being--that have seared my conscience  that remind us of the true nature of his battle.   America has an obligation to care for those who bravely bore the  costs of our Nation's battles. I encourage all veterans, their  families, and caregivers to visit www.VA.gov/PACT or call, again, 1- 800-698-2411 to be connected with a VA specialist in order to begin the  process.   Go directly to this phone number or website. You don't have to hire  an outside attorney to apply for benefits. Use the VA.   America's heroic veterans: You have served liberty, and a grateful  Nation stands ready to serve you.                            ____________________
