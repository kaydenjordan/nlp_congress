 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Law  Enforcement Appreciation Day, which was observed this week in honor of  the contributions countless men and women in uniform have made to keep  our communities safe and secure.   This year's observance was particularly difficult for our Kansas  community. Over the last year, three police officers in my district  made the ultimate sacrifice while in the line of duty. Brad Lancaster,  Dave Melton of Kansas City, and Brandon Collins of Overland Park each  lost their lives while protecting our community.   Law Enforcement Appreciation Day is a day to remember them and to  honor the men and women who remain in the field each day keeping our  children and families safe. They are the ones who run into danger when  others run away. They are the true heroes, and we should always regard  them as such. It is also a day to honor the United States Capitol  Police to keep Congress, our staff, and our visitors in this very  Chamber safe.   Mr. Speaker, let us never forget the service and sacrifice of our law  enforcement officers, and let us continue to honor them with the  gratitude and respect they deserve.                            ____________________
