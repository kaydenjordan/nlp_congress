 Mr. Speaker, I want to speak in support of H.R. 4318,  the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act.   The tariff relief that is included in this bill will help lower input  costs for American manufacturers that support thousands of good-paying  jobs. This cost savings can be used to invest in new facilities and  equipment, expand into new markets, and hire more employees. It will  also make the products these manufacturers make more affordable for our  consumers here at home.   This is a concrete measure to create jobs, Mr. Speaker, and help make  our workers more competitive. I am proud of the broad bipartisan  support that this bill had when it passed earlier this year, and I am  pleased to see that same bipartisan support as we take it up once again  on the House floor.            Efficient Infrastructure to Fight Against Alzheimer's     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the BOLD  Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act, bipartisan legislation that  overhauls America's effort to combat a condition that affects more than  5 million Americans. That number is expected to triple, Mr. Speaker, by  2050.   Not only is there a human cost to Alzheimer's, there is an economic  cost as well. Alzheimer's costs Americans more than $259 billion each  year.   This bipartisan legislation will help the Federal Government take a  very comprehensive approach to the fight against Alzheimer's. It  establishes Alzheimer's Centers of Excellence that will educate  healthcare professionals and the public on Alzheimer's and brain  health. By creating a modern, efficient infrastructure for prevention  and treatment, it will improve caregiving for patients.                            ____________________
