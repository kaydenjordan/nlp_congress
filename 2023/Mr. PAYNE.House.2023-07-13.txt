 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address our country's gun  violence epidemic.   This year, our country has suffered more than 400 mass shootings and  mass murders, and they have killed or injured more than 40,000  Americans. This number includes more than 3,500 children or teens.   Gun violence has claimed the lives of Americans in grocery stores,  elementary schools, college campuses, and private homes. Literally,  there is no place in this country that is safe. This is a national  tragedy that demands immediate action.   My bill, the Safer Neighborhoods Gun Buyback Act, would use Federal  grants to get guns out of the hands of criminals. It would reduce gun  violence and make communities safer, and it is one solution of many in  Congress right now.   We need to act on this bill and others like it to protect Americans.  The longer we wait, the more lives we lose.                            ____________________
