 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor Mr. Roberto Estrada.   Mr. Estrada was a beloved icon in the Las Cruces community and  recently lost his life to pancreatic cancer at the age of 84.   Estrada learned how to press tortillas at the age of 15, and for  decades, he shared his cooking talents with enthusiasm and made Whole  Enchilada Fiesta a profound success. His famous tortillas and food  products are popular across a wide variety of businesses in New Mexico.   From 2000 to 2010, Mr. Estrada held the Guinness World Record for the  world's largest enchilada, which was the centerpiece at the annual  Whole Enchilada Fiesta.   Apart from his cooking talents, Estrada was known for his humility,  kindness, strong work ethic, and giving back to his community.   He donated much of his food and money to those who needed it the  most. The Las Cruces community became a better place because of him.   As a testament to the impact Mr. Estrada made on his community, the  Dona Ana County Commission declared Wednesday, September 1, as Roberto  Estrada Day.    Estrada was a man of faith and family, a proud member of the Las  Cruces Chamber of Commerce and the Las Cruces Hispanic Chamber of  Commerce.   The Las Cruces Police Department honored Estrada's legacy, saying:  ``The people who give you their food give you their heart.''   Estrada lived his life selflessly and improved the lives and  livelihoods of countless others.   We mourn the loss of Mr. Roberto Estrada, honor his commitment  serving others, and know that his legacy will be preserved forever.                            ____________________
