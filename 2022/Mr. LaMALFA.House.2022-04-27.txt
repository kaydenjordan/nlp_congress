 Madam Speaker, we are dealing with an awful lot of grave  issues. Indeed, they become crises when they aren't managed correctly  in this country.   So we are hearing a lot about inflation and feeling the effects,  especially regular people, middle-income people, lower-middle-income  people, low-income people are being harmed by the policies put forth  the last year and a quarter.   We hear a lot about how Americans are paying more:   Vehicles. You can't hardly find a new vehicle, and the price of used  vehicles has skyrocketed.   Gas at the pump. Do I need to talk about that anymore?   Lodging.   Airline fares to even get us to our jobs here in Washington, D.C.,  but for regular people on vacation and doing their business as well.   What isn't being talked about enough? The cost of food and the  availability of food.   Inflation is hitting it hard, too.   Cost of inputs.   In my home State, lack of water. Lack of water in California.   Why does that matter to the rest of the country? Well, I will tell  you. Farms and ranches produce about $50 billion in output in  California, but there needs to be water for the crops.   Environmental laws are forcing the release of water down the rivers  and out to the oceans for coho salmon, delta smelt, et cetera.   Our agriculture sector in California is the most important in the  United States. There are a lot of other very important sectors as well.   We lead the Nation in over 77 different crops, including many fruit  and vegetable specialty crops. Our top commodities are milk, almonds,  grapes, cattle and calves, strawberries, pistachios, lettuce, walnuts,  floriculture, tomatoes, rice, broilers, carrots, hay, broccoli,  tangerines, oranges, and lemons, to name a few.   Our State is the only producer--which means 99 percent or more--of  almonds, artichokes, celery, figs, garlic, honeydew, nectarines,  olives, peaches, sweet rice, and walnuts.   For almonds, California grows all the domestic production, and 77  percent of global production comes from California.   So it is kind of important that the water flows through our State.  That is one of the important inputs that we are short on.   I talked about the energy costs. On my own farm, we are fortunate  enough to have a fairly decent water allocation where I live in my part  of the State, but I have neighbors to the west and south of me  receiving, in some cases, zero percent allocations. Zero.   Take rice production, for example. It is going to be down probably by  about half. As a rice grower that gravely concerns me, but as a food  producer, and all of you as food consumers, you need to be greatly  concerned. These policies can be avoided. We still have a point that we  can save this springtime and get crops planted with water that is  available presently.   Instead, we are watching world events here. Ukraine, their farmers  are dodging bombs right now trying to get crops planted. Russia has  actually been somewhat of an important exporter, not so much to this  country but we import some things from them: fertilizer, some of our  energy.   We need to be putting a stop to that and become self-sufficient like  we can. We should have energy independence. We had that up until a year  ago.    So we are going to keep shorting ourselves on crops growing because  of environmental laws, taking the water away, shifting it to a fish  that doesn't even exist in the delta anymore in northern California,  the smelt. Trillions of gallons of water going out into the ocean and  fields being idled; permanent crops being destroyed; trees and vines  just dying because there is no water for them.   We are going to feel that. We are already feeling it in the stores.  When you can go to a major supermarket and see a whole freezer section  has nothing in it, in the United States of America, that blows my mind.  We can grow plenty here, and we always have until these times.  Environmental laws are trumping what people need. Bad energy policy is  driving the cost of everything.   Some of the fertilizer I have to put on my crops has over doubled in  price. That all has to be made up somewhere. Either the farmer eats it  and goes out of business, or it has to be made up on a store shelf.  Somewhere along the chain it has to be made up for.   We can produce the energy that produces fertilizer that fuels the  tractors, the trucks, the combines, everything it takes to bring a crop  in, we can produce it here. We are capable of it. Yet, we are being  paralyzed by policies at the Federal level and at my home State level  as well.   One of the ideas in the legislature on top of everything, on top of  this $6 gas we have in California, is to add more gas tax on top of  that by our State legislature.   That is not your problem, the rest of the country. I mean, sometimes  we are a comic show at what we do out there, and we get laughed at by  the rest of the country, but we won't fix it here. It needs to be fixed  there.   Don't do what we do, okay, rest of the country?   We need to set policy here where we can in Congress at the Federal  level that brings us energy independence and helps put food back on the  table instead of taking the water away and raising the costs of  everything so much that we can't farm this country anymore.  [[Page H4515]]                                ____________________     Mr. Speaker, the situation with our border, it couldn't  be a whole lot worse. Here are the numbers for February and March;  border crossings were 220,000. The numbers keep going up.   So at a time here where a recent decision by a judge enabled us to  not have to wear masks to get on airplanes or other public  transportation because America's health is improving, the President  wants to get rid of the title 42 provision put in place by President  Trump to help keep America safe from those that have health issues or  disease issues from coming across our border exacerbating already this  giant problem we have.   If title 42 is allowed to expire, then this will open the floodgates  even wider. So I appreciate the decision to at least uphold title 42  while our Federal Government fights that decision and resources are  used by legal folks, Department of Justice, whatever, to make it where  title 42 is waived.   I want to ask what side is the President and his administration on,  if not for the American people's health?                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Johnson) for helping us get these important messages out.   It has been about 2 months since Russia invaded our ally, Ukraine.  Russia has spent nearly a year amassing hundreds of thousands of troops  and military weaponry along Ukraine's borders, with the backing of  their northern neighbor, Belarus. Most people were doubtful that  Ukraine would be able to successfully fight off these attacks for more  than a few days.   Amazingly, being surrounded the way they are, outnumbered and  outgunned, they have been able to heroically hold off their Russian  invaders. President Putin has justified his attack as a peacekeeping  mission or a liberating one. In reality, it is really a thinly veiled  attempt to frighten NATO against further expansion and, of course,  muscle Ukraine's neighbors into submission.   Both NATO and the United States have a longstanding tradition of  standing with sovereign nations who face adversarial oppression, and  that is exactly what we are seeing in Eastern Europe as Putin attempts  to forcefully reunite the Soviet Union.   After 2 months of fighting and billions of dollars in aid sent to  Ukraine, I have heard concerns of many people wondering why are we  focusing so much money and attention on a conflict thousands of miles  away?   We have our own problems domestically, of course, which are self- inflicted, with rising inflation, the border crisis, crime, and food  and energy shortages.   Ultimately, this is a matter of freedom and self-sovereignty versus  concession. We could actually extinguish another Cold War from  happening before it has a chance to grow, if we had taken action  sooner. We could still take positive action now.   The world all knew this conflict was coming. It has been brewing for  a year before the invasion actually occurred. We shouldn't have waited  for blood to be shed before acting.   If President Biden hadn't shut down domestic energy production on his  first day in office, the U.S. would have been more economically  empowered to enact harsh financial sanctions at Russia's first minor  incursion.   We could have been producing enough oil to export LNG overseas to our  allies instead of watching Poland being cut off from natural gas. Wow,  is that a surprise or not? We can't dare have anybody speak up;  otherwise, they will get their gas cut off. Why in the world are we  claiming Nord Stream pipeline,  [[Page H4566]]  et cetera? The U.S. should be the one intervening, helping with energy  independence for us and our European allies.   So what is the focus of the Biden administration? Yeah, we are  starting up on Ukraine more, but what we are really looking at is that  our military isn't as ready as it should be. Instead of military  readiness, President Biden wants to put the focus on turning us into a  green Army, a green military, because we are chasing around .04 percent  of the atmosphere of carbon dioxide. That is the priority, not military  readiness. Chasing carbon dioxide instead of helping our allies chase  invaders out of their countries. That is not military readiness.   The Stinger missiles we are sending, we need to be producing more of  them. The Javelin missiles, same thing. We are still caught up probably  in chip shortage problems. We need to be focused on military readiness  for us and being able to be a good neighbor, as is sort of our  obligation when we helped Ukraine become nuclear free back during the  Clinton era.   Let's not let down our ally. Let's focus on what is going to help the  American people work, not chasing CO2, but instead  strengthening our military and looking out for our neighbors and our  allies, such as Ukraine. Taiwan is going to need our help, as well as  the rest of our NATO obligations, as NATO membership seeks to increase,  which will be a good thing for all of us.   We can't let this tyrant Putin keep getting away with this stuff. We  must be strong and not quiver every time he decides to make another  move.   I appreciate this opportunity for all of us here to stand with  Ukraine, stand with our allies around the world, and not just think  that CO2 is going to be the biggest problem we face. Indeed,  it is aggression by dictators that is the greatest threat.                                time  1845    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that reminder about the  importance of peace through strength; that weakness invites aggression  and that is the only thing holding terrorists and tyrants at bay so  many times in so many places over these 245 years of our existence.  Certainly, after World War II it was the perception of a strong  America. And if we project weakness like we are, we are all in danger.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Baird), who  knows about the theater of war.
