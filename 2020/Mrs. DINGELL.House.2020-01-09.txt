 Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for yielding and for  his leadership, and Chairman Pallone's leadership on all of these  issues.   I rise in strong support of H.R. 535.   Exactly 1 year ago, I introduced the PFAS Action Act, and have been  joined by many of my colleagues in this effort in the last year.                                time  1845    I promised my constituents that we would take serious steps to  address that issue, and that is what we are doing today.   Let us be very clear: PFAS is an urgent public health and  environmental threat, and the number of contamination sites nationwide  is growing at an alarming rate, including our military bases.   PFAS chemicals are everywhere. They are in our nonstick cookware;  they are in food containers; they are in carpet, clothing, cosmetics,  and firefighting foams, just to name a few.   PFAS is persistent. It accumulates in your body, and it is toxic.  They are manmade, and they are known as a forever chemical. They don't  break down in the environment; they don't break down in your body; and  they don't break down in the wildlife.   Exposure to PFAS, even at low levels, poses significant health risks,  and we know that now. In a recent review, the CDC identified a number  of health effects associated with PFAS exposure, including cancer,  liver damage, decreased fertility, and an increased risk of asthma and  thyroid disease.   Experts believe that as many as 99 percent--some people say 97. I  have an official source that says 99. Who cares what that number is,  because most Americans at that level have PFAS in their blood, and they  don't even know it.   Michigan has been hit hard. It is ground zero for where PFAS has been  identified. We have 74 sites, but only because, after Flint, we  learned. We look and try to keep our citizens from being poisoned.   According to the Environmental Working Group, PFAS has been detected  in the drinking water of more than 1400 communities across the country;  and those drinking water systems serve 19 million people in this  country, including 300 military installations that have been  identified.   In my district, PFAS is in the water in the Huron River, and we can't  eat the fish. I was at a townhall meeting and a man got up--he was  older--and said to me: I used to eat that fish. I relied on it. When  will I be able to eat it again?   I didn't want to say this to him, but the fact of the matter is  probably not in his lifetime.   Most of these sites are not being cleaned up. And the number of sites  is expected to grow across the country as more States do the testing  they need to do to protect their citizens, to find PFAS.   But the most troubling thing is that the manufacturing companies know  the danger of PFAS and even tracked it in the blood of their employees,  while the EPA has completely abandoned its responsibility to act  swiftly and comprehensively.   And our military is saying they don't have to clean it up. Why?  Because it is not listed under CERCLA and because they are not required  to do so.   Here is the reality. We are not cleaning up the contamination. We  don't even have a protective drinking water standard.   And you talk about science, Governor Rick Snyder, a Republican,  appointed a scientific community that said that the guideline--not a  standard--isn't stringent enough to protect human life.   Now, EPA keeps coming and testifying before our committee, and they  say they are going to do it soon, but I sure don't see them doing it.   Do you all realize that exposures to contaminated water, air, and  soil that include PFAS and toxins kill more people than smoking,  hunger, war, natural disaster, AIDS, and malaria together?   Did the Flint water crisis not teach us in this Congress and the  country something?   Mr. Chair, I thank all of my colleagues who have worked on this  issue.   When you know the facts, I don't understand how anybody could let  American people be poisoned, and it is time for us to act.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from New York for  yielding.   Madam Chair, I rise in strong opposition to the gentleman's  amendment. Superfund is a landmark environmental law and an essential  public health program that works.    There are contaminated sites all across this country that pose direct  threats to human health and the environment because of pollutants like  lead, mercury, PCBs, and asbestos. Superfund is the program that gets  those sites cleaned up.   Superfund does not regulate the use of chemicals; it does not block  the use of chemicals; and it does not assign liability for the use of  chemicals. It only applies to the release of chemicals into the  environment.   Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have  characterized Superfund as a de facto ban. They say that the industry  will so fear liability that they will abandon PFAS chemicals.   Experience shows that that simply is not true. There are hundreds of  chemicals listed under Superfund that continue to be used in industrial  and consumer products and by the Department of Defense. In fact,  Superfund is designed to prevent releases of chemicals that are in  continued use.   When a chemical is listed as a hazardous air pollutant under the  Clean Air Act, EPA sets emission limits for that chemical that are  implemented through permits. Facilities continue to use and emit those  chemicals. At the same time, those chemicals are automatically listed  under Superfund. The same is true under the Clean Water Act.   Madam Chair, the funny thing is that the two PFAS compounds covered  by this bill, PFOA and PFOS, have already been phased out for more than  a decade under a voluntary partnership between EPA and industry.   We have heard many concerns from my Republican friends about the  specter of Superfund liability for different groups. These concerns are  largely unfounded.   Drinking water utilities will handle PFOA and PFOS the same way they  handle the hundreds of hazardous substances they currently remove from  drinking water. The same will be true for wastewater utilities.   Farmers will continue to be able to use biosolids as fertilizer, just  as they currently do, because Superfund already exempts fertilizer use.  Manufacturers of airplane door seals and heart stents will be able to  continue using the PFAS they currently use--all while impacted  communities, like Michigan, will get the cleanup that they need.   The only change this bill makes in how Superfund operates is a  limited exemption for federally required use of PFAS at airports. If  this amendment were adopted, airports would lose that exemption. And if  EPA eventually moves forward with listing PFOA and PFAS, as they have  committed to do, EPA is not authorized to exempt airports. Only  Congress can do that. So the airports need this amendment defeated, and  they need this bill enacted.   A Superfund listing is an essential provision to accelerate PFAS  cleanup nationwide. It is the foundation of the PFAS Action Act. By  gutting it, we cripple our ability to serve and protect the American  people responsibly.   Madam Chair, I join my colleague, the chairman of the Subcommittee on  Environment and Climate Change, in urging a ``no'' vote on this  amendment.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from Maryland for  yielding.   I rise in support of the gentleman's amendment. By requiring the EPA  to develop a national risk communication strategy surrounding PFAS, the  Federal Government will be better able to educate Americans and inform  the public about the danger of PFAS chemicals.   Experts believe that 99 percent of Americans have some level of PFAS  in their blood, and most of them don't even know it.   I thank the gentleman for his strong leadership in addressing the  PFAS crisis head-on and thank him for offering this amendment.   Incorporating this amendment will make the PFAS Action Act stronger  and communicate the urgency to more people. I am proud to support this  amendment and urge all of my colleagues to support it as well.
