 Will the gentleman yield?  [[Page H10046]]         Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas, and I wish  to offer him a Merry Christmas and a Merry Christmas to the people of  the United States of America.   Unfortunately, in your stocking is not going to be something you  probably hoped for. I don't think it is going to be a lump of coal. It  is $1.7 trillion that we don't have. $1.7 trillion, 4,155 pages plus, I  don't know, a couple thousand pages of what is called report language  that barely any of us had an opportunity to read, released in the--was  it last night, Chip?    The shortest day of the year, the darkest day of the year,  and now we are voting on it without--   Let's face it, let's talk about some of the things we know that are  in it. We already know, as the gentleman from Texas told us, that your  tax dollars, the dollars your Federal Government is spending, is  prohibited from stopping people coming across the border illegally.  Prohibited to be used for that.   Here is what can be used: $400 million for the border security of  Jordan, Lebanon, Tunisia, Egypt, and Oman. Think about that. Right now,  while title 42 is on the verge of going away, they are estimating we  literally have 18,000 people per day coming across the border  illegally. We are going to spend $400 million in the Middle East to  secure their borders, and we are going to say to the United States of  America, you can't spend any tax dollars to defend your own border.  That passed in the U.S. Senate today.   $140 million on carbon dioxide removal technologies;   $540 million on energy storage because the preferred sources of  energy by my friends on that side of the aisle don't work. So we need  that.   $220 million on solar energy. I thought solar energy came of age and  was supportive of itself without subsidy.   $380 million for alternative modes of transport because, ladies and  gentlemen of America, my friends on the other side of the aisle  actually don't want you to drive a car or own a car. And if you do have  the temerity to think you are going to go somewhere in your own car, it  better be an electric vehicle that you are going to plug in and charge  when they allow you to charge it. We need $380 million for that.   I was at the grocery store a couple days ago with my family--my wife,  our girls were there--having a conversation about what we are going to  buy for Christmas for the in-laws and family coming over, and a lady  was listening to the conversation, Chip, and she said, ``I am not  paying $5 for a dozen eggs. I am not paying $5 for a dozen eggs.''   I don't see one darn thing in this bill that is going to solve that  lady's problem.   Whether it is the gas prices--right now the temperature is dropping  all across the United States of America, and people are going to have  to pay for the electricity, the heating oil, the propane, the natural  gas, something to heat their homes, and they are going to be paying a  lot. And there is nothing in here for that.   But I will tell you what is in here: $1.3 million in an earmark for  water storage tanks just outside of Washington, D.C. The wealthiest  counties in the United States of America right here, but we have got an  earmark for them because they need a water storage tank.   How about $1.5 million for the Pasadena on-street dining project?  $1.5 million for a student garden in Sacramento?   I am not saying that these projects aren't worthy of discussion for  somebody. If you live in Pasadena and you want on-street dining, God  bless you. It is probably important to you.    You tell me, Mr. Roy, when our country is at $31.4 trillion in debt  and careening headlong into $32 trillion, how in the world is that a  Federal project? The people in Pennsylvania, who would love to go to  Pasadena, we would love to see our team in the Rose Bowl. That is on  our team.    That is on our team, I get that. But how is it the people  of Pennsylvania or Texas or Maine or anywhere across the country's job,  why is it their responsibility to pay for that? I don't get it.   $2 million for programs promoting career pathways into government  service because, goodness knows, there is not enough people in  government service. We need to find a way to get them into it.   How about a $50 million endowment fund at the University of Alabama?   Let's not stop there.   How about $10 million for an Institute on Public Service and  Leadership at the University of Alabama?    Well, the retiring Senate chief appropriator, Senator  Shelby, happens to come from Alabama. I have got nothing bad to say  about Alabama. I spent a fair amount of time down there. I love  Alabama.   Here again, I don't know why Pennsylvanians, Texans, North Dakotans,  Californians, whoever, have to pay for this. What is the Federal nexus  to this spending of money that we don't have?   I am going to turn it back over to my friend here in a minute. We can  just go back and forth because I have got plenty here. I know he does,  too.   How about $4 million for a Bahamian Museum of Arts and Culture,  Florida?   $1.4 million to restore an outdoor amphitheater in California.   $1.7 million for an urban agriculture garden in California.   Look, the list just--we are going to get into it, but, people, when  are we going to start asking ourselves whose responsibility this is and  when are we going to start asking ourselves, is this ever going to  change?   We haven't had the process here where the Senate and the House passed  its own budget, its own appropriations bills, conferenced them, worked  out their differences, and then had a vote on that, that process that I  just described, how our government was set up to spend your money, that  hasn't happened since 1996.   It is 2022. What is it going to take for us to finally say, ``Man, we  have had enough. I call uncle. I can't take anymore,'' and change this  place?   I would submit to you that the leadership that has allowed this to  continue--and not only allowed it to continue, to ensure that it has  continued--is derelict, irresponsible, and accountable to this tragic,  epic, enormous failure. This is a failure, and there has got to be an  accounting for it.   Just because it is hours and days before Christmas, and it is real  cold outside, and we have got worries about our children's schooling,  being able to pay the bills, grocery bills, fuel bills, electric bills,  don't think that we as the American people don't see what is happening  here. We see it, and we see who is doing it. And we are not going to  tolerate it.   Mr. Speaker, I turn it back over to my good friend from Texas.    Will the gentleman yield for a question?    You were talking about defense. Of course, as a citizen  who has been honored to wear the uniform for over three decades,  certainly the number one priority outlined in our Constitution is  defending our Nation and its citizens. When we talk about spending for  defense, are we talking about spending for the defense of the United  States or is there anybody else here that you would like to discuss  that we are spending on their defense?    Is that what the President asked for?    The President is the Commander in Chief, right?    I would agree with that, and I think that the gentleman  from Texas would also agree. Look, neither of us like what Vladimir  Putin or the country of Russia has done to its neighbor, Ukraine. Being  a bully, invading, blowing up their buildings and their infrastructure,  killing their citizens is unacceptable. It is unacceptable. We all know  that, and we all want to help.   At the same time, our military is being destroyed by our own country,  not some other country. We are not focused. As an individual citizen  who has been privileged and honored to serve in uniform, I can tell you  we are not focused on keeping our country safe; we are focused on a  bunch of woke policies that are undermining the good order and  discipline and the fighting spirit and the focus of our military.   If we are spending money on the military, we need to spend money on  our military. If we are spending money on the borders of Ukraine or  Tunisia or Egypt, we certainly need to spend money on the borders of  the United States of America, not just to process individuals coming  across illegally--that is what we are doing--but actually to thwart  those people coming illegally.   And as important, the criminal element is coming in, the cartel  involvement, the human trafficking and smuggling, the fentanyl is  coming in and killing American citizens--now just reported at a record  rate higher than the year before, which was at a record rate.   What will it take, 4,100 pages? What will it take before we start  concentrating on the citizens of the United States of America?   No one raises their right hand in this Chamber and takes an oath to  defend Tunisia or Ukraine or any of those other countries. It is the  United States of America, our Constitution, and our citizens.    Will the gentleman yield?    Of course, I do. Of course, I remember.    That is exactly right. We all want to help, but you don't  write a check that you can't afford. There is no money in your bank  account to pay for somebody's house down the street while leaving your  house unpaid for and your back door open where you know criminals are  going to be walking in and taking your children out and leaving life- threatening drugs on your kitchen table; you would not do that.    Have we had any debate?    Is the gentleman suggesting--even though we all know that  we want to help, what is happening in Ukraine is objectionable, we  disagree with every bit of it, what Russia is doing--but is the  gentleman suggesting that the first time since the war started that the  leader in Ukraine left the country, are you suggesting it is a  coincidence that he ended up in the United States speaking on this very  House floor from that dais right there on the night before the 4,155- page omnibus passed with billions upon tens of billions in funding for  his country was included, are you suggesting that wasn't just a  coincidence?    You don't want to shut the government down right before  Christmas, Chip. That can never happen, which is why the gentleman from  Texas suggests that this is a setup.   The CR, the continuing resolution--because we don't pass budgets,  because we don't complete our appropriations process, so we don't know  what we are going to fund, so the continuing resolution has to keep  going, and we do it right into December right before Christmas  knowing--like this has never happened before--but we know that, guess  what, people that come to Washington, D.C., from around the country,  you know what they would like to do, Mr. Roy from Texas?   They would like to go home to see their families on Christmas. But  the only way they are going to be allowed to do it is if they vote for  whatever is in that bill. They can object or whatever, but they know if  it doesn't pass, if the 4,100-page bill with $1.7 trillion loaded up  with earmarks doesn't pass, what happens then?   Well, you just have to stay during Christmas, and, oh, my goodness,  just like you said, the gentleman from the 28th Infantry Division  fighting in Bastogne fighting to save Bastogne before the 101st could  get there, they spent their Christmas away from home.   This is all designed to get exactly what we got. This is broken, and  the leadership here in the House and the Senate has done nothing to  change this trajectory. It cannot continue.    So to answer the good gentleman from Texas, the Federal  Reserve is trying to cool down the fires of an overinflated, overheated  economy by raising the interest rates and targeting the housing market.  New home buyers that are hoping to get out there and start their lives  in their new homes, they cut their purchases in half or whatever,  because they can't afford it. The Federal Reserve is trying to cool  down this overheated economy, inflationary pressures and food and  gasoline and oil, electricity, housing, meanwhile the House of  Representatives and the Senate and the Presidency here in Washington,  D.C., are throwing the gasoline on the fire, the gasoline of  unaccounted for money, unprinted money, untaxed money, just creating  money out of thin air and throwing it onto the fire.   I would agree with the gentleman from Texas.   I would tell him, as well, that my daughters would like their father  to be home for Christmas, too. My daughter texted me today when she  knew I wasn't coming home yet, she said, ``Stay strong and save  America.''    So me and Mr. Roy, the gentleman from Texas, we are going to stay  here until the bitter end and do our duty, and we are going to say  things like $4.2 million in earmarks for parking spaces in the Northern  Mariana Islands or $6 million to expand the reach of the Ulysses S.  Grant Presidential Library might be important things, but can we afford  them?   What is the Federal responsibility?   And oh, by the way, regarding the Ulysses S. Grant Presidential  Library, look, I am a fan, but the lady that offered that, her party is  in favor of tearing down the statue of Ulysses S. Grant in New York.   The great emancipator, right? The guy that carried out Lincoln's  order to make sure that slaves were no longer held in the United States  of America.   But, you know, you can't tear it down on one hand and then spend $6  million on it on the other hand while people are struggling to buy  their Christmas presents or their Christmas meals.
