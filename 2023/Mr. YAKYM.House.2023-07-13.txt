 Mr. Speaker, 2023 has been a banner year for sports in  Indiana's Second District, and I rise today to highlight another very  special group of Hoosiers for their excellence in athletics.   Last month, the New Prairie High School softball team won the 3A  State championship for the very first time in school history.   The Cougars' 4-2 win over Tri-West Hendricks in the championship game  [[Page H3495]]  was especially meaningful as it marked New Prairie's very first State  title in any sport.   In their big win, the Cougars were led by star pitcher Ava Geyer, who  struck out nine batters to close out a season where she amassed an  incredible 28-2 record.   On offense this year, the Cougars were carried by senior slugger Abby  Robakowski, who broke the State's home run record and is headed to play  at Indiana State in the fall.   Congratulations to Head Coach Derek Hicks and all the players for  bringing home the hardware and another State championship to Indiana's  Second Congressional District.    Thank you for making the New Prairie community and all of LaPorte  County very proud. God bless you, and go Cougars.                            ____________________
