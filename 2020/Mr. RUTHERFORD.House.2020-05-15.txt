 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Oklahoma for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this political and  insincere attempt at coronavirus relief.   Over the past few months, Congress came together in a bipartisan way  and passed four major packages to combat coronavirus, but now, for  whatever reason, the Speaker has decided she is done working with  Republicans.   Despite what you may hear from my friends on the other side of the  aisle, they know this is not a serious bill. They also know that it was  drafted in secret, without input from the minority, and many of them  are just as disappointed that there was no attempt at bipartisanship.   Mr. Speaker, almost 40 million Americans are out of work, and here we  are in Washington considering a bill that will never, ever become law.   How do you think those unemployed Americans feel right now?   I would say that they are not interested in watching the Speaker, who  is still receiving a full salary, by the way, play these political  games.   I do support elements of this bill.  [[Page H2226]]    So let me be clear: I do support additional coronavirus relief for  hardworking Americans. I also support sending additional relief to  States and cities to help them respond to the coronavirus and its  costs.   However, I will not ask taxpayers to wipe out years of debt many of  these localities incurred long, long before the coronavirus pandemic.   Let's get back to working together and write a bill we can all  support.   Take out federalizing the elections process, which should be left to  the States; take out the early release of criminals; take out the  incentives for illegal immigration; take out all of the new government  programs that keep communities from reopening and keep people from  getting back to work.   We can do this the right way, but this isn't it.   Our constituents expect better, and so should we.
