 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to reintroduce the Coral Reef  Conservation Reauthorization Act. This bipartisan, comprehensive bill  builds on legislation that I have sponsored in the House since 2009 to  reauthorize the Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000.   I want to thank each of my 13 original cosponsors for their support:  Representatives Soto, Wasserman Schultz, Hastings, Crist, Castor,  Hanabusa, Gabbard, Radewagen, Gonzalez-Colon, Rutherford, Sablan,  Plaskett, and Mast.   Our bill for this 115th Congress makes amendments to update and  strengthen the 2000 law and reflects coral reef conservation work  governmentwide.   Coral reefs are God-given natural infrastructure that provide real,  tangible benefits to our coastal and island communities, as well as the  Nation at large.   Healthy, resilient coral reefs safeguard against extreme weather,  shoreline erosion, and coastal flooding and serve as natural  breakwaters for maritime ports and harbors of refuge. Without the reefs  to absorb the blunt force of wave action, many island and coastal  communities would simply wash away.   Coral reefs also support countless American tourism jobs and valuable  fisheries across the United States. According to the National Oceanic  Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, coral reefs support upwards of 12  percent of global fisheries and an estimated 25 percent of all known  fish species.   In addition, coral reefs are the world's greatest source of  biodiversity, covering less than 1 percent of the ocean floor but home  to some 25 percent of all known marine species. U.S. territorial waters  in the Pacific support the majority of our Nation's shallow water  corals.   Guam, my home, sits adjacent to the western Pacific Ocean's Coral  Triangle, one of the most biologically diverse and important marine  ecosystems on the planet, and yet the planet's coral reefs are in  crisis. 2017 marked a prolonged, unprecedented global coral bleaching  event. Guam and the western Pacific, long home to some of the most  well-preserved reefs in the world, were impacted severely.   Ocean acidification, warming sea temperatures, coastal pollution,  invasive species, and other stressors linked to human activity and  global climate change threaten to wipe out these incredibly productive  ecosystems. These threats have necessitated special protections and  listing under the Endangered Species Act for 25 coral species, to date.   The Coral Reef Conservation Reauthorization Act addresses these  challenges head-on, with concrete Federal actions and policy changes  that will make a difference by:   First, strengthening the Federal response to coral reef emergencies,  including vessel groundings, natural disasters, harmful algae blooms,  and unexploded ordnance underwater;   Second, minimizing damage to coral reefs from invasive or nuisance  species, vessel impacts, marine debris, and derelict fishing gear;   Third, directing new Federal grant making for local coral reef  conservation projects;   Fourth, recognizing the importance of coral reef fisheries and the  expertise of local fishery and wildlife management agencies;   Fifth, developing the first-ever national guidelines for  environmentally responsible artificial reefs; and   Last, engaging our Nation's marine laboratories, aquariums, Sea Grant  colleges, and coral reef institutions in federally funded research on  coral biodiversity, propagation, and resiliency.   In particular, our bipartisan bill provides congressional  authorization for the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force, codifying Executive  Order 13089.   Since 1998, Mr. Speaker, the Coral Reef Task Force has coordinated  Federal and local actions to protect coral reefs nationwide. Our bill  preserves full voting membership on the task force for the Governors of  all five U.S. territories and the States of Florida and Hawaii.  [[Page H4742]]    The Coral Reef Conservation Reauthorization Act also authorizes the  U.S. Department of the Interior to take action to conserve our coral  reefs. Many of our most spectacular coral resources lie within national  parks, national wildlife refuges, and marine national monuments.   Congress needs to take action to protect our Nation's irreplaceable  coral reef resources, and that starts with reauthorizing the Coral Reef  Conservation Act. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members of our House to join  us in cosponsoring the Coral Reef Conservation Reauthorization Act of  2018, and I look forward to working with our House and Senate  colleagues to advance this important legislation.                            ____________________
