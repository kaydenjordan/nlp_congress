 Mr. President, I am here to address an issue that I  think is of great importance to this country and to this  administration; that is, the nomination of Scott Pruitt to be the new  EPA Administrator.   We are nearly 8 years removed now from what we consider--many of us,  I think, particularly as we look back--the great recession. However,  many American workers, their families, and their communities have yet  to feel the benefits of any kind of a recovery. A key component to a  slow recovery--the  [[Page S1235]]  slowest recovery since World War I--is the regulatory overreach coming  out of this city--Washington, DC.   Since the end of the recession in June 2009, Federal agencies have  burdened a weakened economy with thousands of pages of new rules,  costing consumers billions of dollars. Tens of thousands of workers  have lost their jobs. The EPA has perhaps become the poster child for  this overreach, from restricting carbon emissions without the direction  of Congress--and according to the clean air direction of Congress of  what is important--to federalizing every stream, every pond, every  wetland under the waters of the United States rule, to unilaterally  banning virtually Appalachian coal mining by obstructing the permitting  process and pursuing ozone standards that the vast majority of the  country cannot meet. The vast majority of the country is still trying  to meet the ozone standards that were established under the last  regulation.   I support the mission of the EPA in protecting human health, in  protecting our air and our water, but there has to be a balance. There  has to be a balance between growing the economy and preserving the  environment. Over the last several years, we have seen that balance  very disrupted. This disruption is at odds with the law and the well- being of many of our working families.   This has been acutely felt in my State of West Virginia where we have  lost more than 35 percent of our coal jobs since the year 2011. That is  more than 7,000 jobs eliminated in a relatively small State like West  Virginia, and many of these jobs are very high-paying jobs.   As a nation, we have lost more than 60,000 coal miners in the same  timeframe. This has hurt our workers, our families, our communities,  and our State.   The loss of good-paying jobs means less commercial activity. It means  less tax revenue to support our education, our county school systems,  our county ambulances, our county sheriff's departments, and our law  enforcement. For example, little old Wayne County in West Virginia has  lost 88 percent of its coal severance taxes between 2013 and 2016. This  year, our Governor and our legislature are struggling right now with a  $500 million budget deficit, largely due to the loss of our coal jobs.   Patching that shortfall could mean significant tax increases, painful  cuts in public services, or both, which could further hurt and cripple  our local economy. It will be a long road undoing the legal and  economic damages suffered over the last several years.   Voters in my State and across the country have made it clear that  fixing Washington includes meaningful reforms for the way that the EPA  operates and has been operating.   So what do we have before us? We have a great nominee for EPA  Administrator, Scott Pruitt, who is presently the attorney general of  another energy-producing State--Oklahoma. Scott is committed to  returning the Agency to its core mission of protecting our air, our  water, and our land without undercutting the economy. At least, we know  that he will listen to the other side and try to be reasonable.   He will ensure that the EPA abides by congressional intent, and he  will be an active partner with State and local stakeholders in the  rulemaking process.   Going back to the stream buffer rule and the reason that fell apart-- and I am so pleased that the President is going to be signing the CRA  on that today--the EPA invited States to come in and speak about the  rulemaking process. Within months, it became very apparent to the  States that are charged with protecting the water that this is just  window dressing. They realized: They are not listening to us, and they  don't really want us to buy in. Eight of those States left.   So as the attorney general for the State of Oklahoma, he has held  industry to account as well protected lakes and streams in his State. I  asked him in the committee: If the State or local government doesn't  intervene in what looks to be an environmental issue--not just a  crisis, but if they are not doing their job in protecting the air and  the water--what would you do as the EPA Administrator? He said: That is  where we should be stepping in. That is where we should be helping  those States meet those standards, helping those States get the right  information.   So I think he is going to be unafraid to take on the EPA when it is  set to ignore a State's sovereignty.   Mr. Pruitt is the most thoroughly vetted candidate for this position  in history. He fielded 6 hours' worth of questioning before the  Committee on Environment and Public Works, where I serve. During that  hearing, he assured me that he will engage directly with the State of  West Virginia and visit our State. We could never get the EPA  Administrator to visit our State and listen to our side. He will visit  our State, listen to our side, and reform the rulemaking process to  prevent another open assault on our economy by unelected bureaucrats.   He also committed to me that he would pursue full implementation of  the bipartisan Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century  Act, a bill on which we joined together--Republicans and Democrats,  both sides of the aisle, with President Obama--to modernize our toxic  chemical regulations in terms of water.   This is important to me. I was talking to my colleague from Michigan  about this issue. We had a water crisis in West Virginia where we had a  large chemical spill. This bill, under Scott Pruitt's leadership and my  pressing for the implementation, as others will be, will help us in  situations like this.   Beyond the over 200 questions he answered in the hearing, he answered  more than 1,000 followup questions. He is the most thoroughly vetted  nominee for Administrator in the history of the EPA. I am confident-- very confident--as he assured me in committee and in personal meetings,  and I have watched him in action in terms of questioning the overreach  in the court systems. He has worked with our attorney general, Patrick  Morrisey, to be the leader in this.   I have confidence that he embodies the leadership that we need to  restore the balance and accountability to the EPA in a way that will  benefit the public health and benefit environmental preservation, as  well as restore much-needed economic growth that needs to be a part of  the balance that we want to see restored back to the EPA.   With that, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.    Mr. President, I have seven requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate.
