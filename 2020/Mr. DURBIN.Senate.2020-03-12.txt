Mr. President, On April 29, 1983, Justice Charles Freeman  made history as the first African-American jurist to swear in Chicago's  first, elected African-American mayor, Harold Washington. Justice  Freeman went on to become the first, and so far the only, African- American justice to serve on the Illinois Supreme Court. During his  more than four decades, Justice Freeman helped shape Illinois's history  through his achievements, his jurisprudence, and his mentoring of a  generation of new lawyers he guided to the bench. On March 2, he passed  away, and I rise today to honor his memory.   Charles Freeman was born in Richmond, VA, in 1933. He was descended  from slaves freed by Quakers before the Civil War. As a child, he  brought newspapers to legendary civil rights attorney Oliver W. Hill's  office. His father was a hard-working man who loved to read and always  stressed that he wanted Charles and his brother to become lawyers. The  Freemans lived walking distance from Virginia Union University in  Richmond, and that is where Charles and his brother went to college.  Charles Freeman graduated from college in 1954 and served in the U.S.  Army from 1956 to 1958, stationed in South Korea. After his service, he  married Marylee Voelker and moved to Chicago. While in Chicago, he  attended John Marshall Law School at night, and he worked for the Cook  County Department of Public Aid.   After law school, Justice Freeman started working as a precinct  worker for former Representative Ralph H. Metcalfe, cofounder of the  Congressional Black Caucus. Justice Freeman befriended Harold  Washington while helping Metcalfe, and they formed a law practice  partnership. In 1965, Governor Otto Kerner appointed Freeman arbitrator  for the Illinois Industrial Commission administrating workers'  compensation cases. In 1973, Governor Dan Walker appointed him a  commissioner for the Illinois Commerce Commission.   In 1976, Justice Freeman was elected to serve as a judge on the Cook  County Circuit Court. In 1986, he was elected to the Illinois Appellate  Court, and 4 years later, he became the first African American elected  to the Illinois Supreme Court. His peers chose him to serve as chief  justice in 1997 until 2000. As chief justice, Freeman reorganized the  rotation of appellate judges in the First Judicial District. Before,  appellate judges sat on the same panels for  [[Page S1736]]  their entire careers. He helped improve the Family Violence Prevention  Program. Justice Freeman also improved the educational program for  judges statewide and pushed for the creation of a special committee to  study the death penalty and reforms.   While Justice Freeman was a great jurist, his legacy is also  reflected in his efforts to promote a diverse judiciary. He appointed  11 of the 16 African Americans who have served on the First District  Appellate Court since 1990. It was important to him that people saw in  the courtroom judges and lawyers that reflected society. He mentored so  many in the field.   During his career, Justice Freeman received many awards for his  service, including the Freedom Award from the John Marshall Law School,  the Seymour Simon Justice Award from the Jewish Judges Association, the  Earl Burrus Dickerson Award from the Chicago Bar Association, and the  Ira B. Platt Award and the Presidential Award from the Cook County Bar  Association.   Charles Freeman is survived by his son Kevin and daughter-in-law  Cami, by two grandchildren, and by his brother James. I want to extend  my sympathies to his family and loved ones. The loss of Justice Freeman  is a loss for our State and for the whole country.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 125th  anniversary of the founding of Northern Illinois University, or NIU, a  renowned institution with a long record as a public research university  and the proud home of Huskies.   Like many great State universities across this country, Northern  Illinois University began as an expansion of the normal school program,  otherwise commonly known as a teachers college. Near the end of the  19th century, as our Nation's population continued to experience rapid  growth, the State of Illinois recognized the need to prioritize teacher  training in Northern Illinois to increase access to education in the  bourgeoning community. NIU was founded in DeKalb, IL, in 1895 to help  more students receive a high-quality education, and it still serves  those same goals today.   NIU is a university of diversity. From its very first day, NIU has  charted a course of inclusion and accessibility that focused on the  students and their education. NIU has proven its commitment in this  area by expanding opportunities and pathways to college for students  from underserved communities and to those that are the first in their  family to attend college. Over the years, NIU has been at the forefront  of recognizing the unique challenges of these communities and has  worked tirelessly to identify ways to address them as part of its  strong commitment to students.   NIU is a university of opportunity. Today, nearly three quarters of  NIU students fall into one or more of the following categories: about  45 percent of the students are Pell grant-eligible, 50 percent are  students of color, and 50 percent are first-generation college  students. I would like to commend NIU for its work to make higher  education more accessible for families from all communities and walks  of life.   NIU is a university of excellence. NIU has a nationally recognized  faculty that includes prominent experts and leading scholars from a  variety of disciplines, including science, East Asian studies, and  visual and performance arts. After receiving a first-class education at  NIU, over 200,000 alumni have gone on to make a difference in the  Midwest and across the world, teaching people about the value of NIU as  they do.   The State of Illinois has been enriched by NIU, and I look forward to  the school's many contributions in the years ahead. It is my distinct  honor to congratulate President Lisa Freeman and the entire NIU  community on its 125th anniversary.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
