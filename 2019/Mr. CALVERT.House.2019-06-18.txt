 Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I rise in support of the en bloc amendment, and I thank  the Defense Subcommittee chairman for working with our side to include  many amendments important to our Members. The chairman has been a great  partner and has been very fair throughout this process.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Walberg).                                time  1515     Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Madam Chair, I accept the gentleman's amendment.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, this amendment risks undermining the  readiness of our military at a time when we can least afford it. It  does so by prohibiting the implementation of a careful and thoughtful  policy developed by a panel of military experts last year regarding  military service by transgender individuals.   Then-Secretary of Defense Mattis wrote that, in his best professional  judgment, allowing military service by transgender individuals in the  absence of this policy could ``undermine the readiness, disrupt the  unit cohesion, and impose an unreasonable burden on the military that  is not conductive to military effectiveness and lethality.''   This current policy is not--I repeat, not--a ban on service by  transgender individuals. It carefully balances the readiness needs of  the military with the medical needs of transgender individuals who wish  to serve.   As new recruits, those individuals can serve openly under their  biological gender so long as they have not suffered from gender  dysphoria within 36 months and have not undergone gender transition  procedures.   Furthermore, the new policy only applies to those seeking to join the  military after its April 12, 2019, implementation and allows the  service and the Coast Guard to waive its application in individual  cases.   This issue is not one of social policy but of deployability.  Individuals with medical conditions that do not allow them to deploy,  such as those identified in the policy, adversely impact military  readiness and reduce the military's warfighting capability.   I would also point out that individuals who require daily injections  for other medical conditions are also not deployable, such as people  who have diabetes.   Madam Chair, the military is an institution with one primary mission:  to fight and win our Nation's wars. Anything that interferes with its  readiness for that mission poses an unacceptable risk to our men and  women in uniform.   Unfortunately, this amendment poses just such a risk by disregarding  the military's professional judgment and interfering with the policy  developed to preserve warfighting readiness.   Madam Chair, I strongly oppose this amendment. I urge my colleagues  to do so as well, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, may I ask the Chair how much time is  remaining?    Madam Chairwoman, section 702 authorizes the  intelligence community to target the communications of non-U.S. persons  located outside the United States for foreign intelligence purposes.   This FISA section 702 program is an important tool for the  intelligence community to gather foreign intelligence information to  protect the homeland against international terrorism, weapons  proliferation, hostile actions, cyber actors, and other threats to the  national security.    Importantly, its focus is on foreigners located abroad. It does not  allow the intelligence community to target U.S. persons. Section 702  collections already include significant protection for civil liberties  and privacy.   While the amendment may be well-intentioned, I fear it will upset the  delicate balance reflected in current wording of this provision. The  recent comprehensive review and bipartisan reauthorization of section  702 by Congress would strongly suggest that additional changes to the  program without a full review of the potential impact is ill-advised.   Madam Chairwoman, intelligence officials from the Obama  administration and the Trump administration have asserted, as FBI  Director Christopher Wray recently reiterated, that section 702 is one  of the most viable tools we have in our toolbox to keep America safe.  Accordingly, I oppose this amendment.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although I  support the amendment.    Madam Chair, the Army identified a $75.6 million  unfunded requirement for the future vertical lift program, and this  amendment helps to address that by adding an additional $9 million, as  the chairman brought out, to this program.   Madam Chair, this is a good program. I support it, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's  amendment.    Madam Chair, just 5 months ago, the Department of  Defense completed a public assessment titled ``Report on Effects of a  Changing Climate to the Department of Defense.''   The report accompanying the bill includes further directive language  regarding additional reporting requirements for the department.   How many reports do we need on this topic in 1 year? This amendment  is extraneous and unnecessary; I urge my colleagues to oppose it; and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition, although I am not  opposed to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for this amendment.  They make that fine ship in San Diego, California, and we want to  defend it to the hilt, so we appreciate this amendment.   It makes the bill a better bill, and I thank the gentleman for  bringing that bill forward.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, at the outset, it should be clear: There is  no country that is more hostile to the interests of the United States  and our allies, especially Israel, than Iran.   In fact, as we debate this bill, the U.S. and our partners in the  region are under serious threat from Iran and its proxies.   As our commander of the U.S. Central Command, General Frank McKenzie,  said recently, the Iranian threat remains imminent.   Just last week, Iranian Revolutionary Guard forces used a type of  magnetic mine--a limpet mine--to attack Japanese and Norwegian oil  tankers in the Gulf of Oman.                                time  1630    In addition to this threat to international freedom of navigation and  commerce, Iran's Houthi proxies have launched sustained attacks on  airports and other infrastructure targets within Saudi Arabia.   In this context, it is clearly in the national interest of the United  States to ensure that our partners in the region have the capabilities  they need to counter a hostile Iran.   The sweeping scope of this amendment, however, seeks to block all 22  of these arms sales instead of those few that may be of particular  concern. For example, it would attempt to prevent the transfer of  precision-guided munitions to our ally Jordan, as well as a number of  other seemingly noncontroversial cases.   Madam Chair, we need to work with our partners in the region to  accomplish common objectives on counterterrorism and in deterring Iran,  including through timely U.S. defense transfers.   Arbitrarily stopping a large number of arms sales, regardless of  their sensitivity, will hinder the ability of our combatant commander  to accomplish these goals. It will also undermine the reputation of the  United States as a reliable security partner and provide opportunities  to China or Russia to erode U.S. influence in the region.  [[Page H4724]]    I want to acknowledge that all of us are deeply concerned with the  ongoing humanitarian crisis in Yemen. I support the efforts of the  executive branch to work with the U.N. Special Envoy toward a political  resolution of this conflict.   It is also unfortunate that the Department of State decided to  utilize an emergency waiver authority on the arms sales that are the  subject of this amendment. Congressional oversight over arms transfers  is an important responsibility, and it would have been best had these  sensitive matters been handled through the traditional consultative  process.   This is not the appropriate vehicle to vindicate those congressional  prerogatives. That responsibility rests with the Foreign Affairs and  Foreign Relations Committees, and not in this bill.   Madam Chair, accordingly, I oppose this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, we need to stand by our allies and oppose  Iran. This amendment is not helpful. I encourage all of our colleagues  to vote ``no'' on this amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I will be very quick.   I am shocked: The Russians are cheating.   Now that our treaty obligations are suspended, the United States  needs to move forward with developing ground-launched INF missile  capability.   Madam Chair, I support the gentleman's amendment.                                time  1645     Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, do you trust the Russians? I don't trust  the Russians.   Those who think they are making the world safer by refusing to  support the programs should remember the ancient Latin adage, ``If you  want peace, prepare for war.''   That has never been more applicable than in regard to this program.   Madam Chair, this amendment is vital to maintaining deterrence and  peace. I would urge my colleagues to support it.   I might point out that the Russians are under the perception that  this is a strategic imperative from their perspective. So from my  perspective, let's remove that misconception and vote in favor of this  amendment.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Madam Chair, this amendment would prohibit the use of  2020 funds for development of a long-range standoff weapon program.   A long-range standoff missile will be a nuclear-armed air-launched  cruise missile that the U.S. Air Force is scheduled to first deploy in  the early 2030s.   The LRSO is necessary for maintaining the deterrent capability  currently provided by a rapidly aging air-launched cruise missile.  According to the Department of Defense, the current air-launched cruise  missile is already decades beyond its originally planned service time.    As General John Hayden, Commander of the U.S. Strategic Command, has  stated: ``The ALCM is encountering sustainability and viability issues  from age-related material failures . . . and diminishing manufacturing  sources. Parts and materials designed for a 10-year service life are  now 35 years old and are obsolete.''   In addition to severe problems with maintenance and reliability, the  ALCM has a significant degraded ability to survive modern air defense  systems. We also need the long-range standoff weapon because  conventional air-launched cruise missiles are unable to effectively  meet the same deterrence requirements.   Madam Chair, sustaining the nuclear standoff capability in the air  leg of the U.S. strategic triad strengthens our deterrence.  Conventional weapons are not capable of fulfilling the nuclear-armed  cruise missile's contribution to, and role in, an effective deterrence  and reassurance of U.S. allies.   Effective deterrence requires that an adversary believes that the  United States can and may respond in kind to a nuclear attack.   For these reasons, I urge the defeat of this amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to my colleague from  Indiana (Mr. Visclosky).    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I am not in opposition to the gentleman's amendment, I just find it  unnecessary. There is robust funding in the bill for this activity to  fight encroachment on our military bases, and that is really kind of  between the local government and local State and local groups.   Madam Chair, I make that point, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I rise as the designee of the ranking member  from Texas (Ms. Granger), and I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chair, I thank Mr. Visclosky for the great working  relationship we have had going through this legislation in detail. We  do this for the men and women who serve the United States military. We  want to make sure that they have the best quality of life and,  obviously, that we procure the best weapons that are available to make  sure that if ever we are in unfortunate circumstances, we do not have a  fair fight.   It has been a great experience. I also thank all the staff for the  great work that they have done on both the majority and the minority.   I do want to point out one thing to the chairman. There is going to  be a meeting tomorrow at the White House, hopefully, about a budget  agreement. Hope springs eternal, but, hopefully, we can get a budget  agreement with the White House, the House, and the Senate so that we  don't have to go into sequestration later this year, which, as the  gentleman knows, would be a disaster for the United States military.  Let's wish them well as they try to work out an agreement.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
