 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the legacy of the  last remaining AVG Flying Tiger, Frank Losonsky, who passed away last  week at 99 years of age.   Mr. Losonsky was one of 300 men who comprised the American Volunteer  Group, which sailed to China in 1941 to defend against the Imperial  Japanese in World War II.   Mr. Losonsky was the crew chief of the Hell's Angels Squadron, where  he was responsible for maintaining three to four, maybe five, aircraft  at a time.   The Flying Tigers were a unique unit because most of their pilots and  support personnel were enlisted in the United States Army Air Corps,  the U.S. Navy, and the U.S. Marine Corps, but they flew under Chinese  colors.   This elite group was devised and commanded by Louisianian and LSU  graduate Lieutenant General Claire Chennault. On his recommendation,  President Franklin Roosevelt signed an order allowing American regulars  to be lent to the Chinese Air Force. They first flew combat 12 days  after Pearl Harbor on December 20, 1941.   Mr. Losonsky's legacy lives on at the Chennault Aviation and Military  Museum in Monroe, Louisiana, and we are proud to host it.   Please join me in honoring the contributions of Frank Losonsky and  the rest of the AVG Flying Tigers to the liberation of the Pacific from  Imperial Japan.                            ____________________
