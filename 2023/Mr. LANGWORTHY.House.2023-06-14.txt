 Madam Speaker, when Winter Storm Elliott hit my  district in western New York over Christmas, causing blackouts and  tragically taking the lives of over 40 people, many of my constituents  had to rely on their gas stoves for heating sources.   Soon, if left unchecked, access to this safe and reliable natural gas  energy will be cut off by the Biden administration so that they can  make their dreams of implementing the Green New Deal a reality.   This isn't just an empty threat. Governor Kathy Hochul and New York  Democrats already passed a statewide ban on natural gas hookups in new  residential and commercial buildings.   Heating bills in New York rose by 30 percent this past winter, and  they will continue to climb if we allow the Biden administration to  further regulate Americans out of affordable energy.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the House and Senate to tell  the unelected bureaucrats in the Biden administration that we won't  stand idly and silently by while they take away our gas stoves.                            ____________________
