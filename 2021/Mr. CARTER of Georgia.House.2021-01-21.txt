 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this  waiver.   General Lloyd Austin grew up in south Georgia, where he was raised by  his parents in Thomasville. A graduate of West Point, he would go on to  a career that spanned numerous units, responsibilities, and  engagements. His first assignment was to the 3rd Infantry Division, now  stationed in my district at Fort Stewart.   In the early 2000s, he served as assistant division commander for the  3rd Infantry Division during the invasion of Iraq. He would later go on  to serve as a division commander and the chief of staff of the United  States Central Command, CENTCOM; the commander of the XVIII Airborne  Corps; the Army vice chief of staff; and, finally, the commander of  CENTCOM.   He has been described as a private individual who is committed to  carrying out his duties.   I, like others, have my reservations about continuing down a path of  waivers for former military leaders to serve in civilian positions.  What first started with a waiver for General Marshall in 1950 and then  again for General Mattis in 2017, we have now seen several requests for  what many see as a once-in-a-generation issue. However, General  Austin's service and assignments are a reflection of his success in his  military career.   If confirmed, it is my hope that General Austin will carry out his  commitment to civilian control of the Department of Defense and  advocate for the priorities central to national security, such as the  modernizing of the triad.   In a time when our adversaries seek to capitalize on any weaknesses,  we need strong leadership. General Lloyd Austin will provide us with  that.
