 Madam Speaker, as has been said earlier by Darrell Issa,  it was Rahm Emanuel that pointed out, don't let a good crisis go to  waste.   So here we have a crisis on our southern border and Afghanistan, and  what do we do? The majority comes in here and says, we don't want our  Members to have to vote on a $3.5 trillion spending bill, so we will  just pass a rule that says without anybody voting on it we pass a $3.5  trillion spending bill. And then we will immediately jump over to a  noble man with a great name that did such great work for America along  with Dr. King, John Lewis, the John Lewis Voting Rights Act bill.   Well, I was here when that was reauthorized, when that was redone,  and I begged, after talking to some liberal constitutional professors  of law, I begged Jim Sensenbrenner and John Conyers not to go forward  with section 4(b) the way it was and section 5. Let's do this right so  that it won't be struck down. Mr. Sensenbrenner was not open to that  whatsoever; John Conyers, to his credit, was. I said, please talk to  some professors, let them tell you, it is at risk of being struck down.  And he said, well, they say there is a decent chance of that, but let's  see what happens.   What happens now? We come in here, and we are going to disenfranchise  American voters by taking over the voting across America. The  Constitution reserves those provisions to the State legislature. We  shouldn't be doing this.   Back after the 2000 election when there were some people in Florida  that were not as smart as fifth graders because they couldn't figure  out the butterfly ballots, this body jumped in, took over, and said  everybody go to electronic ballots and electronic voting, and they have  caused us misery ever since.   Let's let States and local government do the job the Constitution  gave them.    Mr. Speaker, we got a couple of calls at the office  today. We got numerous calls. But two veterans fighting in Afghanistan  wept in the calls about the sacrifices that they made, the friends they  had lost fighting in Afghanistan, and the Afghan people.   I have been meeting with Northern Alliance leaders for a decade or  so. They have asked not that we stay forever. We couldn't do that, and  they didn't want us to do that. But they said: Whatever you do, leave  us in a position to fight the Taliban when you are gone because if you  don't, they will kill every one of us who fought for you and with you,  and then there will be nobody to fight them after you are hit worse  than you were on 9/11.   This is an atrocity. Let's leave the Northern Alliance the weapons  that the Taliban should never have, and let's get the Americans out.                            ____________________
