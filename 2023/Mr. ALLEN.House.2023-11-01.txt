 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Utah for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today as a cosponsor of H. Res. 798, a  resolution that demands Congress' immediate attention and action in  condemning the recent surge of support for Hamas, Hezbollah, and other  terrorist organizations at American universities.   Let's be clear. The targets of Hamas on October 7 were not Israeli  military installations. The targets were innocent men, women, and  children. It was demonic and barbaric.   What are we seeing on our college campuses?   This is not just cause for concern, it is an outrageous affront to  the principles of peace, tolerance, and safety that our educational  institutions espouse.   From the explicit endorsements of violence to the violent targeting  of Jewish students, we are witnessing a blatant disregard for the well- being and security of young people.   This is not a matter of political correctness. It is a matter of  ensuring the safety and dignity of every individual on our college  campuses. The incidents outlined in this resolution are occurring  across the Nation and threaten the very fabric of our educational  institutions. From student organizations calling on fellow students to  demonstrate with armed confrontation to school administrators failing  to clearly speak out, it is time to take a stand to safeguard the well- being of our students and to uphold the principles that our Nation was  founded on and holds dear.    Madam Speaker, I implore my colleagues to join me in  supporting H. Res. 798. We must send a resounding message that we will  not tolerate the spread of hatred within the halls of our universities.
