 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, in the first  two decades after the Revolutionary War, America was under siege and  our Capitol was ransacked, but I don't recall in reading history that  any of our Founding Fathers said that they would flee the country or  leave and give up on the quest for liberty.   The quest for liberty requires fighting by the people who have been  given their liberty, the people whom we have helped to get their  liberty. You can say the people in Afghanistan helped us or you can  also say we helped liberate them as well.   They have been free for 20 years. It seems like it might precipitate  the overcoming of the Taliban if you take 18,000 of the most  westernized, those who speak English, and you say: Flee, flee, flee.  The end is coming. Well, guess what. The end comes quicker if they all  leave. So I would encourage them, rather, to stay and fight. I think it  would be good to have many English speakers in Afghanistan. The future  of Afghanistan could be a bright future, but they are going to have to  fight for it. And, ultimately, it is their fight. And if we offer easy  escape and easy plans to leave the country, we are assuring the defeat  of the people who are our friends in Afghanistan. So I object to this  piece of legislation.    Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I will  recognize an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the  American entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to  recognize a woman-owned small business, Rustic Roots on Second of  Pikeville, KY, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   Located in downtown Pikeville, Rustic Roots on Second opened its  doors in 2015. After graduating from the University of Kentucky,  founder and owner, Maura Minix, wanted to provide a place for Kentucky  artisans to showcase and sell their work. Maura, who grew up in  Prestonsburg, KY, saw an opportunity to set up a shop in neighboring  Pikeville. She established Rustic Roots on Second, providing a retail  outlet for Kentuckian and Appalachian artisans.   Today, Rustic Roots on Second continues supporting and promoting  small businesses and artisans in eastern Kentucky. Over 30 local  vendors sell their goods at the store, ranging from food and textile  goods to artwork and furniture made from used bourbon barrels. Maura's  mother, Brenda Minix, is a key part of the operation, working as store  manager and serving as the ``face'' of the business around town.  Customers are regularly greeted by name and treated according to the  golden rule. Rustic Roots on Second also serves as an event venue,  renting out its shop for celebrations, fundraisers, and business  events. The store works with local artisans to host classes and  workshops, rotating offerings to meet community interest. From painting  to dulcimer playing, teaching and celebrating the arts is a priority.   Notably, Rustic Roots on Second is a leader in downtown Pikesville's  business community. They regularly participate in local and regional  events, including the Appalachian Vintage Street Market, Wine-Tasting &  Retailgating, and Pikesville's famous Hillbilly Days festival. Rustic  Roots on Second is a member of the Southeast Kentucky Chamber of  Commerce and is involved with Shaping Our Appalachian Region--SOAR-- Kentucky, which fosters entrepreneurship and innovation in the region.  They are committed to revitalizing and promoting downtown Pikeville  through their support of the Pikeville Main Street Program, Inc.   Like many small businesses, Rustic Roots on Second actively supports  charitable and civic organizations. For several years, Maura and Brenda  have teamed up with local businesses to host picnics and decorate their  storefronts to thank police officers, firefighters, and first  responders for their service. They regularly support fundraisers for  clubs, churches, and sports teams and have sponsored silent auctions to  benefit local schools. Rustic Roots on Second's advocacy and community  leadership has been recognized in local and regional publications.   When the COVID-19 pandemic occurred, Pikeville rallied together to  support Rustic Roots on Second. As a nonessential business, Rustic  Roots on Second was impacted by the lockdowns. Maura and Brenda  adapted, overhauling and expanding their online store to continue  serving customers nationwide. As Kentucky reopened, Maura and Brenda  worked with local small businesses to ensure downtown Pikeville  reopened safely, welcoming locals and visitors alike to their vibrant  community.   Rustic Roots on Second is an outstanding example of the critical role  small businesses play in uplifting and advocating for their  communities. Congratulations to Maura, Brenda, and the entire team at  Rustic Roots on Second. I wish them the best of luck and look forward  to watching their continued growth and success in Kentucky.                            ____________________
