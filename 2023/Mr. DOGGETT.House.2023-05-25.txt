 Mr. Speaker, the leader they worship, Donald J. Trump,  is the ``king of debt,'' as he described himself.   Spellbound, whenever he commands, they would crash our government and  default on America.   Never concerned with the soaring Trump debt that they supported,  their sudden interest now in deficit reduction is really about  undermining education, health, environmental protection, and social  service initiatives that they never supported in the first place.   Their plan is not about debt reduction. It is only about making room  for another round of tax cuts that they have already scheduled for June  to benefit the superrich, the giant multinational corporations, those  who refuse to pay their fair share of our national security and other  vital public services.   Don't make Americans pay for Republican hypocrisy.                            ____________________
