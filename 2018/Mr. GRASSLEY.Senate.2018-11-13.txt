 Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a fallen  soldier from Iowa, PFC Matthew A. Cox. Private Cox, of Leon, joined the  Iowa National Guard in October 2017 after completing home-schooling. He  was a member of the Iowa National Guard's 186th Military Police Company  and had deployed to Cuba to support the joint military task force at  Guantanamo Bay. Matthew Cox enjoyed participating in the children's  ministry at 1st Baptist Church in Urbandale. He was inspired to join  the National Guard by his grandfather and enjoyed farming with his  grandparents. His family and friends describe him as an outstanding  young man, always willing to help others. While in the National Guard,  Matthew Cox was awarded the National Defense Service Medal and the Army  Service Ribbon. He died at the age of 19 in a swimming accident.   My prayers are with his parents, Jason and Beth Cox, as well as his  brother Mark Cox and his grandparents Fred and Linda Cox. Our country  owes a debt of gratitude to Matthew Cox and all those who make the  choice to serve a cause greater than themselves. His service to our  State of Iowa and to the Nation will always be remembered.                            ____________________
