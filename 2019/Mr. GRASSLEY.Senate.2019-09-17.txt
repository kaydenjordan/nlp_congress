 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute as in morning business.    Since the day I was born, I have celebrated  Constitution Day. That is because the 39 delegates signed the U.S.  Constitution on September 17, which is exactly 146 years before I was  born. It is a gift to share my birthday with the historic signing of  our Nation's founding charter.   The Constitution lends weight to the resilience of our heritage and  to the heroes who fought to defend and protect our borders at home and  from distant shores around the world.   On this Constitution Day, it is my hope that Americans of all ages  will reflect upon the blessings of freedom handed down from one  generation to the next and protected by the U.S. Constitution.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
