 Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record letters  of support for the PRO Act from the TWU, ATU, and AFSCME.                                          Transport Workers Union of                                                America, AFL-CIO,                                   Washington, DC, February 3, 2020.        Dear Representative: On behalf of more than 151,000 members       of the Transport Workers Union (TWU), I am writing to urge       you to support the passage of Protecting the Right to       Organize (PRO) Act (H.R. 2474), as well as to oppose any       weakening amendments or motion to recommit. As written, his       bill directly addresses the needs of the middle-class in the       21st century and will help ensure that our next generation       economy is one that puts working families first.        Our labor laws are designed to provide access to the time-      tested process of collective bargaining. Under the National       Labor Relations Act, certain workers, through their elected       representatives, negotiate directly with their employer over       the terms of their labor. How often will they work? How much       will they be paid? What benefits will they receive beyond       their salary? Through collective bargaining, these questions       are answered in a unique way for each work group and at each       company. This is an incredibly flexible process that has       allowed TWU to successfully negotiate contracts for everyone       from flight attendants to mechancis to railroad inspectors to       bus operators to bikeshare workers.        In the nearly 75 years since Congress last took action to       substantially reform our labor laws, our economy has       undergone significant changes. However, the central role that       workers play in generating wealth for our nation has not       changed. While Facebook bikeshare workers (TWU members since       2019) may be employed at a company and in a job that did not       exist in 1947, they still deserve the right to collectively       bargain to improve their compensation and benefits. The       reforms in the PRO Act will ensure that gSains in the 21st       century economy include working families.        The proportion of unionized workers in the U.S. is at a 90-      year low because of structural hurdles which make joining a       new union very difficult. Companies misclassify workers as       independent contractors, engage shell companies to hire       employees, and ignore our labor laws on a daily basis in       order to deny their workers the right to organize and       collectively bargain. Tactics like these have driven down the       percent of unionized workers in the U.S. along with salaries       and benefits for the middle class. Our era of historic income       inequality can only be fixed by reforming our outdated labor       laws and empowering working families.        The PRO Act would directly address these issues and give       workers across the entire economy equal access to the       collective bargaining process. In order ensure workers'       rights keep pace with the new economy, the Transport Workers       Union strongly urges you to to vote for final passage of H.R.       2474 and oppose any weakening amendments.            Sincerely,                                                    John Samuelsen,      International President.                                   ____                                        Amalgamated Transit Union,                                Silver Spring, MD, February 3, 2020.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the Amalgamated Transit       Union (ATU), the largest union representing transit workers       in the U.S., I am writing to urge you to vote in favor of the       Protecting the Right to Organize Act of 2019 (H.R. 2474).        Public transit employees work under difficult       circumstances. Bus drivers work long shifts, refraining from       drinking water because they don't get adequate time to use  [[Page H892]]       the restroom. Operators frequently get assaulted by angry       passengers who don't want to pay increased fares for reduced       service. Transit maintenance employees do their jobs under       dangerous conditions, from the garages they work in, to the       tools they use, to the air they breathe.        Often times when low paid transit employees attempt to       improve their standard of living by joining a union, they are       thwarted by ruthless multinational companies which do       everything they can to squash workers' dreams, and current       U.S. Labor Laws authorize and enable them to do so.        Private transit employers regularly violate the National       Labor Relations Act (NLRA) with no consequences. Workers are       forced to attend ``captive audience'' meetings whose sole       purpose is to convince them to vote against the union.       Companies place massive pressure on the shoulders of low       income individuals with families and tell them lies about       what it means to be in a union.        Sometimes, the companies hide behind definitions in the law       to get their way. Last year, in the case of SuperShuttle DFW,       Inc. v. Amalgamated Transit Union 1338, the National Labor       Relations Board (NLRB) ruled that a shuttle company's drivers       were correctly classified as independent contractors, making       it difficult for gig-workers to be classified as employees       under the NLRA because protected bargaining is only granted       to traditional employees.        Moreover, even when workers actually vote to join a union,       the companies still fight, working ruthlessly to decertify       bargaining units and bust unions even before they get a       chance to negotiate a first contract. It never ends, and it       is not a fair fight.        The PRO Act would modernize the NLRA by bringing its       remedies in line with other workplace laws, imposing       appropriate financial penalties on companies that violate the       code. It would also establish a process for mediation and       arbitration to help the parties achieve a first contract,       making the freedom to negotiate a reality for countless       workers who form unions but never get to enjoy the benefits       of a collective bargaining agreement. It would generally       provide a more level playing field so that an increased       number of workers could join unions and have a better chance       to successfully fight for their wages, benefits, and working       conditions.        On behalf of the members and potential future members of       the ATU living in your congressional district, we urge you to       support H.R. 2474. Thank you for your consideration of our       views.                                                          AFSCME,                                   Washington, DC, January 27, 2020.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: The American Federation of State,       County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) strongly supports       passage of the ``Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act''       (H.R. 2474). As the largest public-sector union, our members       believe that all workers, both private and public sector       workers, deserve the right to organize and bargain       collectively to improve their working conditions.        At a time when the economy is strong and unemployment is       low, there are still people who have to work two or three       jobs to make ends meet. Some workers cannot take time off of       work due to a cold or to take care of a sick family member       because they will lose pay and won't be able to cover rent or       buy food. When workers can form or join a union, they can       negotiate a contract that provides livable wages, paid leave,       health insurance and retirement benefits. Workers have       protections if they are retaliated against by their employer.       They can demand safe workplace environments. When workers       have protections and good working conditions, the products       and services that they provide are better. This is good for       the company, consumers and the economy.        According to a study by David Madland at the Center for       American Progress (CAP), there is a direct correlation       between the strength of unions and the middle class. Union       membership rates have fallen over the past 50 years, along       with the share of income that goes to the middle 60 percent       of American households. In 1968, this group of households       brought home 53.2 percent of national income. That same year,       28.2 percent of American workers were union members. As union       membership rates began to slide downward, so too did the       share of income accruing to the middle class. In 2017, just       less than 11 percent of American workers were unionized, and       the middle 60 percent of households now earn just 45.5       percent of national income, barely up from 45.4 percent in       2016, a record low share.        For decades, abusive employers have been able to violate       federal labor laws with relative impunity, making it more       difficult for workers to organize and negotiate for fair pay,       benefits and working conditions. The PRO Act builds upon       collective bargaining rights for private sector workers by       expanding coverage to more employees. It increases penalties       for violations of workers' rights. It strengthens support for       workers who suffer retaliation and it prohibits employers       from interfering in union elections.        AFSCME strongly urges Congress to pass the PRO Act. This       bill will improve the rights of workers, which will make our       country stronger.            Sincerely,                                                        Scott Frey,                            Director of Federal Government Affairs.     Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of the PRO  Act to protect workers against an unprecedented tide of attacks on  hardworking Americans.   Unions are the backbone of our economy, and, for too long, Congress  has watched as unions are trampled on in the name of shareholder value.  Well, no more.   For far too long, the Democratic Party has treated unions as if they  were fully owned subsidiaries, talking to them only during times of  elections. Well, with this Congress, we say that those days are no  more.   For too long, the Democratic Party stood on the sidelines and watched  nonunion members go to war with union members, all in the working class  and the middle class, and we had forgotten that, when the union  movement works well, when the union movement grows, the entire middle  class prospers. Well, that ends today.   With this bill, we reaffirm workers' rights to organize a union and  to negotiate higher wages and better benefits. By passing this bill, we  uphold the bedrock values of this country.
