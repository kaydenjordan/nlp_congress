 Madam Speaker, I rise to congratulate Thomas Edison  Middle School of Meriden, Connecticut, for being named a National  Magnet School of Distinction by Magnet Schools of America.   Thomas Edison is one of 12 schools in Connecticut and one of only 142  schools in the country to be given this prestigious distinction. Its  challenging curriculum, full engineering program, innovative technical  supports, and strong family and community partnerships have resulted in  high student achievement at the school.   Thomas Edison started an innovative program that provided every  student  [[Page H1292]]  with a laptop to take home. This kind of investment in all students and  commitment to reducing disparity pays dividends in student success.   Even with plentiful resources, success takes staff buy-in, strong  leadership, and tireless work. I commend the staff at Thomas Edison for  their commitment to their craft and dedication to students.   But it also takes a community, parents devoted to their children's  learning, and students empowered and motivated to go the extra mile.  Thomas Edison has implemented a family and community partnership. It  has also partnered with the Community Health Center to provide  behavioral health and dental health to all students.   This comprehensive approach to supporting students with wrap-around  service makes a difference. Every school in America has the potential  to be a school of distinction; we just need to prioritize education.   Again, I congratulate the Thomas Edison Middle School community for  this award and honor.                            ____________________
