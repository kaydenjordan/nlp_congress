 Madam Speaker, I rise in honor of the Honorable Margie  Rice, former mayor, council member, and community leader of  Westminster, California, who passed away this past Sunday, July 25,  2021, at the age of 92.   Margie had dedicated her entire life to public service, including 22  years on the Westminster City Council, with 12 of those years as the  city's elected mayor. She also served as a Westminster School District  trustee for 17 years.   Up until her passing, Margie served on the Midway City Sanitation  District, ending her 30 years of service on that board this past  Sunday. Madam Speaker, in 2019, I was honored to join Margie and other  board members in celebrating the 80th anniversary of the Midway City  Sanitation District.   As an active community leader and a public servant, Margie Rice was  passionate, dedicated, focused, hardworking, and, above all, outspoken.   Margie achieved many results for the residents of Westminster and  among her legacy is the building of the Westminster Rose Center  Theater, a performing arts center for the whole community to enjoy.   Margie was born in Alabama, but she called Westminster her home for  more than 60 years. She is survived by two of her four children, 19  grandchildren, 23 great-grandchildren, and 12 great-great- grandchildren.   I will always remember Margie Rice as a pioneer and a leader who  loved and cared for the Westminster community with all her heart.   She will be missed.                            ____________________
