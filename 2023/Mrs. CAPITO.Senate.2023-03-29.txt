 Madam President, I want to thank the chair for  presenting his side of the argument.   Now I think we are going to hear the other side of the argument on  why taking this rule down will pass today--because of the strong  opposition to it.   Today, we are going to have the opportunity to bring a divided  Congress together, united in rejecting misguided and unnecessary  overreach by the executive branch.   In its attempt to regulate basically anything and everything, the  Biden administration, once again, overstepped its boundaries in the  Waters of the United States rule, or WOTUS, as we have heard, and they  did this this past December. It is the third major change in 8 years.  The chairman talked about all of the uncertainty. This is the third  change in 8 years to the definition of what ``waters'' are and what is  a subject of Federal jurisdiction. With this comes more uncertainty,  more redtape, and more government for millions of Americans.   It is clear we need to take action in the face of this burdensome  rule, and it is exactly why I have introduced the Congressional Review  Act resolution of disapproval that we are about to vote on. So let's  take a look at the new rule issued by the EPA and the Army Corps of  Engineers.   President Biden's new WOTUS rule repeals the 2020 navigable waters  protection rule that provided predictability and certainty for our  farmers, our ranchers, our miners, our infrastructure workers, our  homebuilders, and our landowners such that they can rely on. That 2020  waters rule properly implemented the Clean Water Act by protecting  America's waterways through coordination and cooperation between the  States and the Federal Government. Who knows their States better than  the State regulators?   This new definition, however, drastically expands Federal  jurisdiction over streams, wetlands, and private property at the  expense of the States and their citizens. It also adopts a subjective  ``significant nexus'' test for determining what is and isn't subject to  Federal regulation under the Clean Water Act, up to and including dry  ditches--it doesn't sound like a navigable water to me--that could fill  with rain during a storm event even in the middle of the desert.   To sum it up, the Biden administration's WOTUS rule tells States and  individuals that the Federal Government knows best. It is true to form  for this administration so we shouldn't be too surprised.   It is also important to note that this is all happening while there  is a pending court case at the Supreme Court, right now, that will make  many of these same determinations, but they couldn't wait. Of course,  they couldn't wait. They had to grow the Federal Government's authority  and redesignate waters that had never been designated before.  [[Page S1023]]    So let's take a look at the impacts this WOTUS rule would have on  farmers and on small businesses.   There are 17,000 small businesses in the small State of West Virginia  that will be impacted by this rule and our own ability to build in the  future. We should be setting predictable, reliable policy for America's  farmers and ranchers. Instead, under the Biden WOTUS rule, if I am a  rancher in Arizona or a cattle farmer in Montana or own a family farm  in West Virginia, I will literally have less control over my own land.  Previously converted cropland and even irrigation ditches may now  require a permit under this new regulation.   The American Farm Bureau says:         Farmers and ranchers should not have to hire a team of       lawyers and consultants to determine how we can farm our       land.    Do you know what will happen? They won't hire the team of lawyers.  They just won't farm their own farmland. Yes, that is what millions  fear from this new ``waters of the United States'' definition.   The National Association of State Departments of Agriculture says  that this rule will ``significantly increase the regulatory burdens and  create further uncertainty for state departments of agriculture,  farmers, and ranchers across the country.''   Along with those who live and work in rural America, this rule will  target employers of all sizes across our country as well. The National  Federation of Independent Business writes that the Biden WOTUS rule  will ``make compliance a nightmare for small businesses,'' adding, ``If  there was ever a time to not impose additional burdensome regulations,  that time is now.''   Often the cornerstone of our communities, small businesses need  policies that support, not penalize them.   Our Nation's future depends on our ability to build. That includes  transportation, infrastructure, and energy projects of all kinds.  President Biden knows that our Nation's broken permitting process  threatens to undercut some of our own shared legislative  accomplishments on infrastructure investment.    Yet, at a time when we should be streamlining our Nation's permitting  and review process, the Biden waters rule makes things worse. It comes  at a time when we are trying to build here in America. It will require  more people and more projects to seek more Federal permits, which is  time and money and doesn't improve the environmental oversight. The  environmental oversight is there, but it will cause fear that the EPA  will take enforcement action at any given moment with eye-popping  fines.   The Associated Builders and Contractors writes that the Biden WOTUS  rule will ``cause building delays due to regulatory uncertainty, plus  increased permitting and mitigation costs, which will make it more  difficult and expensive to grow food, produce energy and build critical  infrastructure for the 21st century.''   We have heard our Nation's farmers, small businesses, and our  builders loud and clear: President Biden's waters rule is bad policy at  an even worse time.   Now, I have been asked what a Congressional Review Act resolution  would do, and during a recent Environment and Public Works hearing,  this issue came up.   If approved by both Houses of Congress and signed into law, this  resolution would overturn the overreaching and expansive WOTUS rule  issued in December and return to a narrower and more practical  definition that was put in place prior to 2015. You may hear that this  will leave waters unprotected. That is simply not true. The regulatory  authority for waters that are not navigable nor travel interstate will  be returned to the States as Congress intended in the Clean Water Act.   Importantly, my resolution would prevent a substantially similar and  overbroad definition from being written again. It would not prevent the  EPA and Army Corps from issuing a narrower replacement rule that  actually is common sense and addresses stakeholders' and elected  officials' concerns and seeks to clarify the status quo.   As you have just heard, States and the regulated community, including  farmers and ranchers, have been very clear in their conclusion, and I  agree: The Biden final rule on WOTUS is a significant expansion--not a  narrowing--of Washington's role in regulating land and waters across  the country, and it creates more uncertainty than it cures.   The expansion of Federal authority and the encroachment on States'  rights and private lands is the precise reason we have seen  overwhelming support for my CRA resolution.   When I introduced this resolution of disapproval, I was proud to do  so with our friends and counterparts in the House of Representatives.  Led by House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chair Sam  Graves, the House passed this measure with bipartisan support,  including nine Democrat votes. It is important to note that two of  these Democrat votes came from the ranking member of the House  Agriculture Committee and the ranking member of the House  Appropriations' Agriculture Subcommittee. These are folks who know the  needs of our farmers and rural Americans very, very well and who  bravely put the best policy forward ahead of partisan politics. So I  thank them for their support in this effort.   It demonstrates, again, that it isn't about party; it is not about  party lines. It is about standing up to the needs of those who live and  work in rural America. Well, we can stand by them today. We can also  give a boost to our future transportation, infrastructure, and energy  projects of all kinds across our country.   With this resolution, we are sending a clear message that Congress,  even a divided Congress, will defend working Americans in the face of  Executive overreach.   With that, I appreciate the support we have received in our effort to  place this important check on Executive overreach, and I encourage my  colleagues to vote yes on my resolution of disapproval.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the importance  of unleashing American energy, the consequences of President Biden's  refusal to invest in American energy, the impact this is having on  energy States like West Virginia and Texas, and what steps we can take  to move forward to fix the mistakes made by the White House and the  jeopardy that they have put our country in.   President Biden has made his stance on American energy clear since  day one of his administration. As President, his policies and personnel  choices have delivered on his campaign promises, and high prices are  just part of the bargain. The administration has canceled pipelines,  rescinded previously issued approvals for others, and raised barriers  to building new ones. They have frozen oil and gas leasing and proposed  raising royalties--costs that will be passed on to the consumer. The  Biden EPA has continued to layer regulation on regulation, though I am  pleased to report that, earlier today, through the congressional  resolution, we pulled down the WOTUS rule that the EPA recently put  forward last December.   These are just a few of the unreasonable and misguided policy  decisions this administration has made that have led to what we are  facing today.   Congressional Democrats have not been shy about their stance on an  ``all of the above'' energy future. Look no further than the two pieces  of legislation that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle boast  about the most--the American Rescue Plan and the so-called Inflation  Reduction Act. Just last week, while I was questioning President  Biden's head of the Environmental Protection Agency, I was asking him  about his Agency's budget. Administrator Regan admitted that, because  of the Inflation Reduction Act,  [[Page S1029]]  coal capacity and natural gas generation will plummet in the future.   This is the coal capacity with the IRA. It is way down here below 50.  If there had been no IRA, it would have been somewhere here, around 80.   Let me say that again.   Through data generated by the EPA and admitted to be true by the head  of the administration, coal capacity and natural gas generation will be  significantly lower in our country because of the Inflation Reduction  Act.   Here is natural gas with no IRA, up here. With the IRA, it will be  way down here by 2040.   He went even further--Administrator Regan did--and admitted the  misguided policies with the Inflation Reduction Act will lead to the  closures of coal and natural gas plants. This will lead to the  shuttering of proud energy-producing communities across my State of  West Virginia and our country, moving us further away from the energy  independence that we desperately need and want. This clearly spells out  the priorities of this President and underscores the urgency needed in  reversing these policies.   On top of all of this, the out-of-control reckless spending and Green  New Deal priorities that are packaged in the American Rescue Plan have  caused energy prices to soar alongside record inflation. So let's take  a look at the consequences of President Biden's war on American energy  by the numbers.   When he took office, the average price for a gallon of gasoline was  $2.39. Now the average price is $3.44--a 44-percent increase. And let's  not forget what we just lived through 9 months ago when the record was  set, when gas prices averaged about $5 a gallon for the first time in  history.   High gas costs like this just create a domino effect. In fact,  increased fuel costs and shortages have made it more expensive to  manufacture goods, to deliver goods, and, ultimately, to provide what  we want and need in this country. It has made everything more  expensive. This creates additional strain on our supply chains and  feeds into the inflation that so many families continue to struggle  with.    Think about the cost of food at the grocery store. Add to this the  price that Americans paid to heat their homes when winter came on. No  matter what utility you used, it went up. Whether it was natural gas,  electric, oil, or renewables, all prices went up. Those who heat their  homes with natural gas are at the highest disadvantage in paying 25  percent extra this winter just to keep their homes warm. This truly  shows that, no matter what, there is no escaping the consequences that  President Biden and congressional Democrats have created by turning  their heads on American energy.   The good news is we know what we need to do to unleash American  energy and move critical projects forward. Republicans and Democrats  alike know it. We all know it. We must make genuine reforms to our  Nation's permitting and environmental review processes. For example, it  should not take 7 to 10 years to permit a mine or a large  transportation project in the United States. It should not be typical  for endless legal challenges to be filed, one after another, for the  sole purpose of postponing and, ultimately, killing key energy  projects. Projects that create jobs, that produce energy of all kinds,  and that drive down costs should not be delayed or stopped because of  burdensome regulations. The current system hamstrings States and  employers that are trying to build anything here in the United States,  and it needs to change.   We need to provide regulatory certainty to our States. We need to  expedite permitting and review processes while ensuring all  environmental considerations are completed. We need to codify  substantive environmental regulatory reforms and jump-start key  projects like, in my State, the critically important Mountain Valley  Pipeline.   Together, we should address section 401 of the Clean Water Act. We  should streamline the NEPA process with real deadlines for Agency  reviews, and we should limit judicial review to avoid endless  litigation that delays and sometimes cancels projects.   I want to be very clear when I say ``projects.'' I mean projects of  any kind. That means both renewable and conventional sources of energy.   We have made great strides in advancing cleaner energy sources, but  without the ability to build and build quickly, we will not capitalize  on that process.   Unfortunately, at every turn, the Biden administration has made it  harder for any of these projects to move forward. I mentioned earlier  the waters of the United States rule, the WOTUS rule. It significantly  expands the Federal Government's authority when it comes to water  sources across the country, and it will mean more people will have to  get more permits and deal with more redtape--many times, on their own  private farmland.   Fortunately, we challenged that rule through a Congressional Review  Act, and it passed in a bipartisan way in both the House and the  Senate, and it will go to the President's desk. It is up to him.   Have you listened to the voices of the American people or will you  continue with these tactics that you have been doing?   So what do we need to do? Why do we need to do it? How do we get it  done?   I have been saying all along that I believe the best solutions are by  going through regular order--bipartisan, through our committees-- through the Environment and Public Works Committee, through the Energy  Committee--and through any other committee that has relevant actions  toward permitting. It is where we can hear those who know these issues  the best. We can formulate solutions, hash out our differences, and  compromise. I believe that is the only way that we can get permitting  reform across the line, and I am willing to do whatever I can.   I am glad the House is taking the first swing at this and sending us  a great starting point for how we can finally address America's broken  permitting process and give a boost to energy production right here at  home. There is no denying there is growing momentum in the Senate to  get real, legitimate permitting reform across the finish line and  signed into law. I have had many, many conversations.   I encourage my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to heed the  increased call for energy independence and help us deliver that ``all  of the above'' solution, which we all say we want, that increases our  national security, creates jobs, keeps good jobs at home, and that,  lastly and very importantly, lowers the energy costs for American  families.   With that, I am proud to be here with my fellow Republican Senators  who have the solutions to energy independence.   With that, I yield the floor.
