 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to  3 minutes.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak in  support of the confirmation of Judge Myong Joun to the U.S. Court for  the District of Massachusetts.   In a few minutes, the Senate will vote to invoke cloture on Judge  Joun's nomination. And this afternoon, once we have invoked cloture, we  will vote on his confirmation.   When Judge Joun was a child, his family immigrated to the U.S. from  South Korea with only a few dollars in their pockets. He was raised by  his single mother who earned a living as a seamstress. He attended New  York City Public Schools, served in the Massachusetts National Guard,  and graduated from the University of Massachusetts Boston and Suffolk  University Law School in Boston.   In private practice, including at his own law firm, Judge Joun  litigated extensively before the Massachusetts State and Federal  courts, eventually earning an appointment as a justice of the Boston  Municipal Court.   Judge Joun has shown a steadfast commitment to civil rights and  access to justice. In private practice, he often took on cases  involving police misconduct, wage theft, and housing violations. As one  of his many colleagues writing in on his behalf put it, Judge Joun's  ``professional life has been devoted to working with people who need  legal assistance but are unable to navigate the system because of  language, financial, or educational barriers.''   Judge Joun has also consistently and generously given his time to  service, holding leadership roles in organizations such as the Asian  American Lawyers Association of Massachusetts, the Massachusetts Bar  Association, and the National Lawyers Guild. For many years, he has  taught trial advocacy to law students.   Over the course of his career, Judge Joun has exemplified the highest  standards of the legal profession. He is a dedicated public servant who  will bring knowledge, experience, and compassion to the Massachusetts  Federal district court. As the first Asian-American man and first  Korean American to serve on the district court of Massachusetts, Judge  Joun will be a trailblazer. I have no doubt that he will continue to  serve the people of Massachusetts with distinction, and I look forward  to his confirmation.   Senator Warren and I absolutely endorse his candidacy with the  strongest possible recommendation to the full Senate, and I urge all of  my colleagues to vote yes on cloture and on his nomination.                            ____________________
