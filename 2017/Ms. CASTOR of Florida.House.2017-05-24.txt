 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of  National Foster Care Month, and I am pleased to welcome Yves Luma and  Anabel Sanchez-Senofonte for the Sixth Annual Congressional Foster  Youth Shadow Day.   I would also salute Congresswoman Karen Bass, who is the most  outspoken, energized advocate for foster youth anywhere in America. I  am very proud of Yves and Anabel. They are an inspiration for all of  us.   Yves has persisted in the face of true adversity and is now a first- generation college student at Florida State University. She was born in  Haiti, faced challenges at a young age that most of us will never  understand. Not being able to count on a stable home environment in  Haiti, Yves, with her younger siblings, moved around between extended  family and friends before moving to the United States.   Once in the United States, Yves did not have a consistent home. Yet  through everything, she persevered, working to provide for her younger  siblings while continuing her high school education at Plant High  School and Blake High School in Tampa. She carried a heavy burden  without parents that no child should have to endure. Due to the hard  work and help of her school social workers, Yves was referred to  Starting Right, Now, a Tampa-based group home for homeless youth who  value and desire a higher education. It was this support system and the  help of a lot of others that enabled Yves' talent and drive to catapult  her to a promising future.    Anabel is 21 years old, also a student at Florida State University,  getting a BA in economics and sociology. Anabel grew up in Miami, where  she spent most of her life in foster care. She was taken from her  mother three times before permanently being removed from her custody.  At that point, she entered a group home at about 5 years old. She  [[Page H4513]]  went to a number of group homes before moving in with her parents who  adopted her.   Foster care was hard because she was separated from her brothers, but  she had her sister. But sometimes having that sister around made it  tough as well because the sister didn't know how to read and had severe  temper tantrums around her foster care parents, and they were usually  taken away because of something her little sister did.   So Anabel liked to slide under the radar and focus on school, but she  is resilient as well. Now at FSU and working in Tallahassee, she is an  Unconquered Scholar. And Unconquered Scholars either have to have  experienced homelessness, foster care, or group homes, but now she is  on the path to graduate school. And as a lesson for all of us, she  advises that: ``I believe that to get the results you want, you must  insert yourself into the conversation.'' That is right around here,  Anabel, and we look forward to learning a lot from you here today and  in the future.   Yves and Anabel are just two of more than 400,000 youth in foster  care in America. It is important to recognize the programs,  initiatives, and people who contribute to the success of children in  the foster care system, but it is tough when they age out.   It is really an honor to have these young people here to shadow us on  the Hill today, to share their life experiences directly with Congress,  to help inform policy that will help them succeed. Their firsthand  knowledge experience, and ultimate success, is a great resource, and  the best evidence of our Nation's commitment to providing basic  protections to make this the great country that it is.   Every child deserves a safe, supportive family, but when that doesn't  happen, it is incumbent upon all of us to help them succeed. And I  can't help but think, the day after President Trump submitted a budget,  that really will take us backwards, in this case, and we are not going  to let that happen. We are going to stand up and support our foster  care kids and all children across America, but that budget is not going  to be helpful.   In any event, I want to thank Yves and Anabel for joining us today  and for having the strength to share their perspectives and insights.  Their resiliency is moving, and I hope my colleagues can mirror their  bravery and find the will to support capable, bright, young people like  Yves and Anabel, and provide them with the tools they need to be  successful.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, as the co-chair of the  bipartisan Congressional Soccer Caucus, along with my co-chairs,  Representative Don Bacon, Darin LaHood, and Eric Swalwell, I am pleased  to inform the House that last night a group of bipartisan Members came  together to play in the fifth annual Capital Soccer Classic, a charity  benefit for the U.S. Soccer Foundation and children in underserved  areas across the country.   The U.S. Soccer Foundation transforms abandoned fields and vacant  lots into state-of-the-art soccer fields to create safe places where  kids can play. The U.S. Soccer Foundation also partners with our local  communities back home for free afterschool programs to help kids  establish healthy habits: put the cellphones aside, turn off the TV,  get outside, and learn good sportsmanship.   The Republican team was very tough: Congressmen Don Bacon, Darin  LaHood, Gus Bilirakis, Steve Knight, Erik Paulsen, and David Valadao,  who scored for the Republican team. We had a number of outstanding  congressional staff and former professional soccer stars as well, but  they were not enough for the Democratic team. The Democratic team  notched a 5-3 victory to deliver this trophy for America's blue team.   Great fun was had by all. We would like to invite you to join us next  year because the real winners are the kids across the country and the  opportunity to be healthy and well.    I yield to the gentleman from Nebraska.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman.  [[Page H4550]]                         Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Huffman    The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, 2-minute voting will continue.

The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment in the nature of a  substitute.   The amendment was agreed to.   The Acting CHAIR. Under the rule, the Committee rises.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Hultgren) having assumed the chair, Mr. Young of Iowa, Acting Chair of  the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported  that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 953)  to amend the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act and  the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to clarify Congressional intent  regarding the regulation of the use of pesticides in or near navigable  waters, and for other purposes, and, pursuant to House Resolution 348,  he reported the bill back to the House with an amendment adopted in the  Committee of the Whole.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is  ordered.   The question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute.   The amendment was agreed to.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third  reading of the bill.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was  read the third time.                              Motion to Recommit    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I am opposed to the bill in its current  form.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to  recommit.   The Clerk read as follows:         Mr. McGovern moves to recommit the bill H.R. 953 to the       Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure with       instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith       with the following amendment:        At the end, add the following:       SEC. 4. PROTECTING AMERICAN FAMILIES FROM SPECIAL INTERESTS                     SEEKING TO UNDERMINE PUBLIC HEALTH THROUGH                     POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS.         This Act, including the amendments made by this Act, shall       not apply to the discharge of a pesticide if the manufacturer       or distributor of the pesticide has made a political       contribution to the President or to any Federal official       charged with registration, regulation, or approval of the use       of the pesticide.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Massachusetts is  recognized for 5 minutes.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill,  which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted,  the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, I regret to say the Republicans are again bending over  backwards to help corporations and the wealthiest among us while  ignoring science and leaving hardworking American families to suffer  the consequences. This administration's decisions have placed special  interests and their financial contributions ahead of  [[Page H4551]]  the health and the safety of our citizens, and this Republican-led  House has been complicit.   Earlier this year, a toxic chemical manufacturer convinced the Trump  administration to discard decades of scientific research just so they  could continue to profit off of chlorpyrifos, a pesticide that has been  proven to be harmful to human beings, especially infants and children.  The pesticide was well on its way to being banned by the EPA, which  said, in 2015, that it could not be declared safe for human health and  for the environment; but the pesticide manufacturer wrote a check for  $1 million to President Trump's inaugural committee, and just weeks  later, the proposed ban on the pesticide was magically reversed. It is  amazing how that worked out.   What I am wondering is: Did President Trump and the Republicans in  Congress think we wouldn't notice? Did they think the American people  would be okay with them knowingly allowing a dangerous pesticide to be  used on farms and affect our food supply? Republicans should be ashamed  of this blatant disregard for the health of the families they were  elected to represent.   In 2000, the EPA banned most home uses of the chemical, citing risks  to children, yet it continues to be used in agriculture production  across this country. Does this really sound like something that should  be used on the food we feed our kids?   On the campaign trail into the White House, President Trump has made  clear that he will always side with deep-pocketed polluters and  corporations over the health and safety of families.   In January 2017, Dow Chemical was reported to have contributed $1  million to President Trump's inaugural committee. The CEO of Dow  Chemical was a frequent guest of President-elect Trump, including at an  appearance at a postelection rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan. In March  2017, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt signed an order reversing the ban  on the pesticide.   Also in March 2017, Scott Pruitt signed an order reversing the ban on  this pesticide suggesting, in a statement, that ``by reversing the  previous administration's step to ban one of the most widely used  pesticides in the world, we are returning to using sound science and  decisionmaking rather than predetermined results.'' Public health  advocacy groups strongly disagreed, not to mention conservation  organizations.   Mr. Speaker, you know what? I think I trust public health experts  when it comes to protecting our families over Administrator Pruitt, who  sued the EPA at least 14 times as Oklahoma's attorney general opposing  important protections for our air and our water. Talk about the fox  guarding the henhouse.   Mr. Speaker, we were not sent here to auction off the health and  safety of millions of Americans to the highest bidder. Every day the  Trump administration gets more brazen with their giveaways to special  interests, raising serious questions about corruption and conflicts of  interest.   Donald Trump promised to drain the swamp. He has created a cesspool.  We are talking about people's lives here, Mr. Speaker. This pesticide  has been shown to harm women, children, and families. It has no place  on our farms or in our food system. Our health should not be for sale.   It isn't hard to connect the dots here. The EPA abruptly reversed its  efforts to ban a toxic chemical just weeks after the chemical's  manufacturer made a political contribution to the newly elected  President. And we know their decision wasn't based on science. The  former head of the EPA's Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution  Prevention suggested that the Trump EPA is ``ignoring the science that  is pretty solid'' and putting farmworkers and exposed children at  unnecessary risk.   Now, I can see how people might start to wonder whether this  administration is on the side of special interests or the American  people. This amendment fights back against the corrupting influence of  political contributions from pesticide companies. It would ensure that  existing science-based protections for our families and our environment  cannot be overturned by a well-timed contribution to President Trump or  to those in his administration charged with implementing the law.   The American people deserve to know that their leaders will stand up  to protect their health and their safety rather than protecting the  bottom line of wealthy special interests. Mr. Speaker, I urge my  colleagues to do the right thing and adopt this amendment and show the  American people that our government is not for sale.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
