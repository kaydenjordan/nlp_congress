The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentlewoman  from New York (Ms. Tenney) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment to  increase funding to the Community Services Block Grant program. I am  proud to represent the 22nd District of New York, a once thriving hub  of innovation and manufacturing. My district has suffered the fate of  too many Rust Belt communities.   Against the backdrop of crushing taxes and soaring costs, it is  harder than ever for my constituents to find good-paying jobs that  match their skills. A tragic result of this lack of opportunity has  been increasing poverty, especially among our most vulnerable  populations.   In addition to supporting commonsense pro-growth policies in Congress  to reduce regulations and encourage innovation, programs like the  Community Services Block Grant play a vitally important role in  fulfilling the unmet needs of our neighbors.   CSBG funding directly supports programs aimed at reducing poverty and  assisting low-income individuals, the homeless, and the elderly. It  allows States and community action agencies in each of our districts  the flexibility to improve living conditions, increase self- sufficiency, and foster strong family support systems.   In my district, the Mohawk Valley Community Action Agency in Utica  has received more than $640,000 from the CSBG program, which they have  used to support Head Start programming that promotes early childhood  development, and the Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps  seniors meet ever-rising energy costs in the very cold Northeast.   All told, the CSBG program accounts for more than $55 million in  financial assistance to New York State funding, which touches the lives  of more than 705,000 New Yorkers. This number includes more than 46,000  individuals with disabilities and more than 317,000 children in my  district. Cuts to this program will have a disproportionate impact on  some of the most at-risk and forgotten constituents in our district.   I am grateful that this committee has recognized the importance of  this program, and I am especially thankful for Chairman Cole's  leadership on this issue. The committee has expressed a willingness to  work with me to ensure that the final appropriations bill worked out in  conference includes robust funding for this CSBG program.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr.  Cole).    Mr. Chairman, because of Chairman Cole's great  willingness to work with and help the truly needy people in our  communities, I am going to be withdrawing my amendment this evening. I  look forward to working with Chairman Cole as we move forward in this  process, and I just want to say thank you.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time, and I withdraw my  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn.                    Amendment No. 152 Offered by Mr. Nolan    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 152  printed in House Report 115-297.
