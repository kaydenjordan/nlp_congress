 Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this  reckless budget resolution. Congress had an opportunity to start on a  bipartisan note, to work on creating jobs, building an economy that  works for everyone, and investing in our infrastructure. Instead, House  Republicans are ringing in the new year by repealing the Affordable  Care Act, stripping more than 20 million people of their health  insurance. What is worse, there is still no plan for what comes next,  threatening massive disruption to the entire healthcare system.   I offered a number of amendments to this legislation, none of which  were allowed a vote today. My amendments would have stopped this  dangerous process from moving forward if the Republican budget reduces  access to treatment for those suffering from addiction, reduces access  to health care in rural areas, forces seniors to pay more for care, or  privatizes Medicare. I also cosponsored an amendment by Congresswoman  Lee to protect women's access to reproductive health and family  planning services.                                time  1115    Apparently, the majority is not concerned with these issues. Before  the ACA, the situation was unacceptable. It was a time when people went  bankrupt because they got sick, when individuals with preexisting  medical conditions found it virtually impossible to obtain affordable  coverage.   But now, more than 120 million Americans with preexisting conditions  are no longer denied coverage, and young adults can stay on their  parents' plans until they are 26.   Over 10 million seniors have received help with their prescription  drug payments, and all insurance plans are required to cover  preventative services with no copayments.   Rather than focusing on commonsense reforms to strengthen the ACA,  Republicans want to eliminate vital lifesaving policy with no plan for  what comes next. I strongly urge a ``no'' vote.
