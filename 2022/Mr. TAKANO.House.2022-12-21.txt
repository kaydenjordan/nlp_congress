 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 5016) to designate the medical center of the Department of  Veterans Affairs located in Anchorage, Alaska, as the ``Colonel Mary  Louise Rasmuson Campus of the Alaska VA Healthcare System'', and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 5016         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Colonel Mary Louise Rasmuson       Campus of the Alaska VA Healthcare System Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Mary Louise (Milligan) Rasmuson was born April 11,       1911, in East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.        (2) Mary Louise received a Bachelor of Science degree from       the Carnegie Institute of Technology and a Master of       Education degree from the University of Pittsburgh.        (3) Mary Louise was one of the first two women to receive       an Honorary Doctorate of Laws degree from the Carnegie       Institute of Technology.        (4) In 1942, Mary Louise joined the Women's Army Auxiliary       Corps as a Private and was in the first graduating class.        (5) Mary Louise worked up the ranks, and in 1957, President       Dwight Eisenhower appointed Mary Louise as the Fifth Director       of the Women's Army Corps and she was reappointed to this       position by President John F. Kennedy in 1961.        (6) In 1962, Colonel Rasmuson retired from the Army.        (7) Colonel Rasmuson was recognized for her outstanding       service in the Women's Army Corps with the Legion of Merit       award with two Oak Leaf Clusters for her work in expanding       the roles and duties of women in the Army, as well as her       role in integrating Black women in the Women's Army Corps.        (8) Colonel Rasmuson became Director of the Women's Army       Corps during tumultuous times and is credited with enhancing       the image and recruitment of women into the Women's Army       Corps during her years as the Director.        (9) Colonel Rasmuson expanded opportunities for women to       serve in assignments previously reserved only for men,       starting with the assignments of 12 enlisted women into the       First Missile Master Unit at Fort Meade, Maryland.        (10) Colonel Rasmuson was instrumental in enabling women to       be promoted above the grade of E-7 into the highest enlisted       ranks of the Army, E-8 and E-9.        (11) During her time in the Women's Army Corps, Colonel       Rasmuson was the guiding force behind the Army opening up the       college enlistment option to women under the self-enhancement       programs and witnessed the first female enlisted member       attend college under those programs.        (12) The career of Colonel Rasmuson also laid the       groundwork for women to be fully integrated into the United       States Army when the Women's Army Corps was disbanded in       1978.        (13) In 1961, Mary Louise married a prominent leader in       Alaska, Elmer E. Rasmuson, and she was the first Director of       the Women's Army Corps to be married while serving in that       position.        (14) After her retirement from military service in 1962,       Mary Louise moved to Alaska where she continued her       leadership as a veteran in her community in Alaska.        (15) Mary Louise served as First Lady of Anchorage after       the devastating magnitude 9.2 earthquake in 1964, after her       husband, Elmer, was elected as mayor, serving from 1964 to       1967.        (16) Mary Louise was an advocate of social justice,       education, and the arts during her 45 years of work on the       Board of the Rasmuson Foundation.        (17) Mary Louise served as the Honorary Chair and was a       major founder to renovate the Anchorage Veterans Memorial on       the Delaney Parkstrip in downtown Anchorage.        (18) Mary Louise also contributed to the Army Women's       Museum, the National Museum of the American Indian, and the       National Museum of the United States Army.        (19) Mary Louise was the Chair of the Anchorage Museum       Foundation and helped establish the museum in Anchorage,       serving as its Chair for 21 years.        (20) On July 30, 2012, Mary Louise died at her home in       Anchorage, at the age of 101, but her legacy of character and       leadership will endure as an example to all who serve in the       United States military.       SEC. 3. DESIGNATION OF COLONEL MARY LOUISE RASMUSON CAMPUS OF                     THE ALASKA VA HEALTHCARE SYSTEM.         (a) Designation.--The medical center of the Department of       Veterans Affairs in Anchorage, Alaska, shall, after the date       of the enactment of this Act, be known and designated as the       ``Colonel Mary Louise Rasmuson Campus of the Alaska VA       Healthcare System''.        (b) Reference.--Any reference in any law, regulation, map,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       medical center referred to in subsection (a) shall be       considered to be a reference to the Colonel Mary Louise       Rasmuson Campus of the Alaska VA Healthcare System.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on S. 5016.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the memory of Colonel Mary Louise  Rasmuson, an Army veteran, a tireless advocate for women  servicemembers, and a decades-long champion of women's and civil  rights.   The bill before us, S. 5016, would appropriately name VA's medical  center in Anchorage, Alaska, the Colonel Mary Louise Rasmuson Campus of  the Alaska VA Healthcare System.   I thank Senator Murkowski for her work on this bill in the Senate,  and my colleague, Representative Peltola, for leading this effort in  the House. Colonel Rasmuson was born in East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,  in 1911. She graduated with a bachelor's degree in education from the  Women's College at Carnegie Mellon University, and later earned a  master's degree in school administration from the University of  Pittsburgh.   Soon after, Colonel Rasmuson became one of the first two women ever  to receive an Honorary Doctorate of Laws degree from the Carnegie  Institute of Technology, anticipating a long career ahead of breaking  barriers for women.   In 1942, Colonel Rasmuson enlisted in the World War II effort,  joining the Women's Army Corps as a private. Thanks to her diligent  service, she quickly worked her way up through the ranks and, in 1957,  President Dwight Eisenhower appointed Colonel Rasmuson as the fifth  director of the Women's Army Corps.   In her capacity as director, she pushed for the integration of Black  women into the Army, while working to change laws which denied women  promotion opportunities and service credits. During her tenure, for the  first time, women were authorized for appointments at the highest  enlisted ranks of the Army, E-8 and E-9.   Colonel Rasmuson would be reappointed as director of the Women's Army  Corps in 1961 by President Kennedy before retiring from the Army in  1962. For her valuable service as director, she earned the prestigious  Legion of Medal award with two Oak Leaf clusters, in recognition of her  brave contribution to female servicemembers.   In retirement, she moved to Alaska with her husband, Elmer Rasmuson,  serving as first lady of Anchorage from 1964 to 1967 during her  husband's mayorship.   Afterward, Colonel Rasmuson served for 45 years on the board of the  Rasmuson Foundation, directing more than $200 million in grants to  Alaskan nonprofit organizations, veterans' memorials, and educational  services.   On July 30, 2012, Colonel Mary Louise Rasmuson passed away at her  home in Anchorage, Alaska, at the age of 101. Thanks to her lifelong  leadership, she will always be remembered for the lasting impact she  left on the U.S. Army, pushing it ever-closer to gender equality.   Indeed, it was thanks to her impactful work as director of the  Women's Army Corps that, in 1978, this segregated branch of the United  States Army was disbanded, integrating all female and male units into  one cohesive force.   While the fight for gender equality for our servicemembers and  veterans continues, Colonel Rasmuson's leadership reminds us of the  great strides our country has made toward justice, freedom, and  equality for all.   S. 5016 has letters of support from several veterans service  organizations, including The American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars,  and Disabled American Veterans.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record these letters of support.                                  Congress of the United States,                                   Washington, DC, November 8, 2022.      Chairman Jon Tester      Committee on Veterans' Affairs,      Washington, DC.      Chairman Mark Takano      Committee on Veterans' Affairs,      Washington, DC.      Ranking Member Jerry Moran      Committee on Veterans' Affairs,      Washington, DC.      Ranking Member Mike Bost      Committee on Veterans' Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Tester, Ranking Member Moran, Chairman       Takano, and Ranking Member Bost: We, the members of the       Alaska delegation, write to recommend renaming the Alaska       Veterans Affairs Healthcare System Muldoon Road Campus in       Anchorage, Alaska to honor the legacy of Colonel Mary Louise       Rasmuson.        Colonel Rasmuson was an exception leader throughout her       distinguished military career. After retiring, she continued       to tirelessly serve Alaska and the veteran community in many       remarkable ways.        Whereas the VA system only has three clinics named after       women and Alaska boasts the most veterans per capita in the       nation, we can find no better way to honor Colonel Rasmuson,       her family, and most importantly, our veterans in Alaska.        Renaming the center after Colonel Mary Louise Rasmuson is       fitting and deserved recognition for such an exemplary       veteran and American hero. Thank you for your consideration       of this important matter.            Sincerely,                                                    Lisa Murkowski,                                             United States Senator.                                                      Dan Sullivan,                                             United States Senator.                                              Mary Sattler Peltola,      Representative for All Alaska.                                   ____                                                The American Legion,                                            Department of Alaska,                                 Anchorage, Alaska, August 22, 2022.        To Alaska's Congressional Delegation: The American Legion,       Department of Alaska, fully supports the State of Alaska's       Department of Military and Veterans Affairs and Alaska VA       Medical Center's Director Mr. Thomas Steinbrunner's request       to rename the Alaska VA Medical Center to the Colonel Mary       Louise Rasmuson VA Campus.        Colonel Rasmuson dedicated her time and energy to her       military career and to her Alaska communities. She served       with great honour. It would be a privilege for Alaska to have       the Alaska VA Medical Center named in her behalf.            Sincerely,                                                     Deborah Davis,      Department Commander.                                   ____                                           VETERANS OF FOREIGN WARS,                                            Department of Alaska,                         Veterans Administration Medical Center,                                                      Anchorage, AK.        Letter of Support:        The Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) in Alaska is honored to       support the redesignation of the VA Medical Campus to       recognize Colonel Mary Louise Rasmuson. Her many       accomplishments and support to veterans is well known.        We of the Alaska VFW are eager to lend our support in any       way. Let's do what's necessary to cement her legacy.                                                       Troy D. Eck,      Commander, Department of Alaska.                                   ____           KEEPING OUR PROMISE TO AMERICA'S VETERANS,                                                 September 2, 2022.        Dear Secretary McDonough: What an honor and privilege to       recommend the Anchorage VA Campus be renamed ``Colonel Mary       Louise Rasmuson VA Campus''.        Colonel Rasmuson paved the way for our military female who       serve our country today. Mary Louise did so much for Alaska       Military and Veterans while she was alive, and even though       she is no longer with us, her legacy continues through a       trust fund that continues to bring light to our Military and       Veterans here in Alaska.        The Alaska DAV is proud to be Veterans that stands and       recommend this change immediately.                                                   Pamela F. Beale,                                        Commander, Metro Chapter 7.     Madam Speaker, I wholeheartedly support this bill, and I  urge all my colleagues to do the same.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Alaska (Mrs. Peltola), my friend and a strong supporter of this piece  of legislation, which is fitting as someone who has broken barriers  herself in supporting this legislation of someone who broke barriers  for the U.S. military.                                time  1645     Madam Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in  passing S. 5016, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in  the Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 7939) to make permanent certain  educational assistance benefits under the laws administered by the  Secretary of Veterans Affairs in the case of changes to courses of  education by reason of emergency situations, and for other purposes.

SEC. 23. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 7939, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7939, as amended, the  Veterans Auto and Education Improvement Act of 2022.   This comprehensive package from Chairman Levin of the Subcommittee on  Economic Opportunity includes several improvements for student veterans  and disabled veterans who require modified vehicles for transportation.   This bill passed the House in September with bipartisan support. The  Senate combined the original bill with H.R. 3304, Representative  Fletcher's CARS for Vets Act, which also passed with bipartisan  support. The Senate passed this amended package unanimously last night,  and I am urging this House to move speedily to pass this important  legislation, which is supported by Disabled American Veterans,  Paralyzed Veterans of America, Veterans Education Success, Student  Veterans of America, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the VA.   The COVID-19 pandemic exposed many flaws in student veteran benefits.  We never could have anticipated the need to shift nearly all students  to remote learning, but without action, the VA would have been forced  to cut housing benefits for hundreds of thousands of student veterans  nationwide because the students technically were no longer attending  classes in person.   However, my committee and the House acted swiftly during 2020,  passing several crucial acts, including my Student Veteran Coronavirus  Response Act of 2020, which was swiftly signed into law. These actions  meant student veterans were protected from losing their benefits, but  only for a limited time.   While I am relieved we never left student veterans without their  benefits, we came far too close too many times.   H.R. 7939, as amended, does away with these artificial benefit cliffs  for student veterans and makes permanent many of the student veteran  protections passed as short-term measures during 2020 and 2021.   That means the next time there is an emergency, be it a flood,  tornado, another pandemic, or another event that forces them to take  their classes online for a short period of time, the VA will be ready  to fully pay out benefits to student veterans who are forced to attend  classes remotely.   I thank Subcommittee Chairman Levin for introducing H.R. 7939, as  amended, to safeguard these benefits.   In addition, included in this legislation is H.R. 5752, also from  Chairman Levin. This provision will allow servicemembers to get out of  contracts they may be wrongly bound to because of their orders.  Families suffered fines, excessive bills, and damage to their credit  scores due to circumstances completely outside of their control.   Also from Chairman Levin, H.R. 7939, as amended, includes the text  from H.R. 7369, the VENTURE Act, which allows more disabled veterans to  use the self-employment track for the Veteran Readiness and Employment  program. Previously, this option was only available to a very small  cohort of veterans. The VENTURE Act keeps prioritization of several  disabled veterans but also allows additional veterans to pursue this  option if they wish.   Significantly, H.R. 7939, as amended, includes H.R. 3304, the CARS  for Vets Act, which I was honored to introduce with Congresswoman  Fletcher. Currently, disabled veterans are only allowed a single grant  to modify a vehicle to provide them mobility. That means there are cars  that are 30 or even 40 years old on the road because the veteran has no  other option.   The CARS for Vets Act finally expands the eligibility for disabled  veterans to obtain vehicles modified for their disabilities more than  once.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I want to give my gratitude to the  gentleman from Montana for not calling for a roll call vote on the bill  to honor Colonel Rasmuson. I think the heart of the Freedom Caucus has  grown three times, just like the heart of another character near the  Eve of Christmas.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman and the Freedom Caucus, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 7939, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.
