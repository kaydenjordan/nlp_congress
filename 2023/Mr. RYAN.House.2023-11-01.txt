 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in defense of the Hudson River in  New York State.   For too long, too many that have enough wealth and enough power have  gotten away with dumping toxic materials into our river, putting their  profits ahead of the health and safety of our families.   Now those same forces are at it again, attempting an end around  maneuver that would turn our precious Hudson River into a parking lot  for dangerous barges carrying oil, asphalt, and other toxic materials.   To be very clear, this presents a clear and present danger to our  community, and we must and we will stop it.   Mr. Speaker, that is why I demanded that the Coast Guard uphold the  anchoring ban on the Hudson River and why I am calling on every single  Hudson Valley resident to join me in this fight to protect our river.   This is where my kids and your kids and grandkids play. It is where  we get our drinking water for over 100,000 of our residents. It is the  lifeblood of our community, not a parking lot for big corporations  looking to make even more money.   We owe it to our kids, our seniors, and our future generations to  fight for our river with everything that we have.                            ____________________
