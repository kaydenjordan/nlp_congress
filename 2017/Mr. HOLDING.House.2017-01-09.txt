 Mr. Speaker, just before Christmas, the U.N. Security  Council passed a resolution condemning Israel.   I believe it goes almost without saying that Israel is our most  trusted ally in the Middle East, which is why I find this so troubling,  Mr. Speaker. The Obama administration had the power to veto the  resolution and support one of our only allies in the region, but  President Obama, less than a month from leaving office, dictated the  United States would sit on the sidelines.   Well, Mr. Speaker, I am committed to preserving our alliance with  Israel and ensuring a lasting peace is found in the region--a position  that has been expressed multiple times on the floor of this House by my  colleagues--and I believe we can't afford to sit on the sidelines  anymore.   Mr. Speaker, the United States supports Israel. The Obama  administration is leaving behind a failed foreign policy legacy, but  our alliance with Israel will endure.   Former Senator Jesse Helms believed the United Nations required  fundamental reform to address these kinds of problems. I believe this  latest action by the Security Council underscores that need.                            ____________________
