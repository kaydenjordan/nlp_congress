 Mr. Chairman, my amendment would reinstate the Federal  Rules of Civil Procedure rule 11(c)(2) safe harbor provision, which  allows parties to avoid penalties, by withdrawing or correcting the  claims within 14 days from when the alleged violation of rule 11(b)  becomes known, anytime up until the end of the discovery period.   This bill would force attorneys to assess their case blindly as it  stands. Every attorney knows to assess their case based upon an  objective set of facts regarding the situation.   A good attorney would never overpromise a cause of action, but this  bill prevents even a fair assessment of a case. A full and accurate  analysis of the merits of the case must be done on day one, because  this bill requires mandatory sanctions with no grace period. We have  tried this already, and it did not work.   This bill will eliminate rule 11(c)(2)'s safe harbor provision, which  currently allows the target of a rule 11 motion for sanctions to  withdraw or correct the paper claim, defense, contention, or denial  that is the subject of the motion for sanctions within 21 days after  service.   Between 1938 and 1983, there were only 19 rule 11 filings. In 1983,  rule 11 was changed to the standard being proposed by this bill. In the  10 years without this safe harbor provision, nearly 7,000 motions for  sanctions were made. A 1989 study showed that roughly one-third of all  Federal civil lawsuits involved rule 11 satellite litigation, and  approximately one-fourth of all those cases on the docket involved rule  11 actions that did not result in sanctions. Thus, attorneys had a dual  job: one to try the case, and the other to try the opposing counsel.   We can't go back to a failed system. The amount of sanction  litigation that clogged the system was so extensive that in 1993, a  mere 10 years after this failed legal experiment began, a safe harbor  provision was established to unclog the system, and it worked. Since  then, the amount of rule 11 sanction satellite litigation has come  down, and the courts are now better able to focus on the case at hand.   In committee, Mr. Cicilline of Rhode Island, recommended the  reimplementation of the 21-day safe harbor provision.                                time  1000    Instead of following this commonsense proposal, the committee  rejected it by an 18-4 vote. I believe such an important provision  needs to be revisited, but with a compromise. That is why I drafted  this amendment that offers a 14-day safe harbor provision; and as a  measure to protect further abuse, my safe harbor amendment is only  available prior to the completion of discovery, yet another attempt to  have a compromise here.   The intent for this discovery provision is that an attorney, during  discovery, may realize a flaw in their case. Such a revelation should  allow an attorney to correct or withdraw their claim without having the  fear of having mandatory automatic sanctions imposed on them. Instead,  this bill, as written, immediately places sanctions on the mistaken  lawyer. This is well-intentioned, but it does not acknowledge the  realities of litigation or the legal process.   In the real world, clients can easily misrepresent a situation to  their counsel, and the truth won't be known until discovery. This bill  will have a stifling effect on the legal community and will lead to  denied justice because attorneys will not be willing to take a case  unless it is a guaranteed win.   We should take the lessons learned from the 1983 experiment and  preserve the safe harbor provision to protect well-intended plaintiffs'  attorneys and not stack the deck against those who seek justice.   Mr. Chair, I urge support for my amendment, and I reserve the balance  of my time.  [[Page H2031]]         Mr. Chair, there is a sanction in place. You have to remove  your claim or your assertion that is in question, and there is the cost  of time that any attorney has to put in. But at the end of the day, we  have already been down this road and it has failed. Now all we are  going to see is more litigation again without the requisite increase in  funding to our Federal courts.   And so what we are going to see is anybody who sued--whether you are  a plaintiff suing or defendant--is going to now have far more complex,  dual-track litigation, and that is going to increase costs on  businesses and on individuals who are facing litigation in our Federal  courts. I believe we need to keep the lessons learned from the past,  and I urge Members to adopt my amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
