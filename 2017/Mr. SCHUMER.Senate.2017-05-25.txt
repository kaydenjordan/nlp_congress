 Mr. President, first, let me thank my good friend from  Illinois for, as usual, his articulate, compassionate, and outstanding  work and for the great job he and others did yesterday when they  invited the people here. I reiterate just what the Senator from  Illinois stated; that is, once they take repeal off the table--they are  having real trouble with repeal--we want to sit down and make our  healthcare system better. It is not perfect. No one thought it was.   It is better than it was. Many more people are covered. Preexisting  conditions, college kids--kids get out of college, and they get  healthcare. All of that is better. We don't want to get rid of  everything, but we want to improve it. We are working. Forty-eight  Senators, as my colleague from Illinois knows--every Democrat signed a  letter to Leader McConnell saying we want to work with you to improve  this system, not to sabotage the existing system, not to repeal the  good things we have but to improve it.   And we have gotten no answer in that regard.
