 Mr. President, before Senator Casey leaves the floor, I  just want to make a couple of remarks, as the senior Democrat on the  Finance Committee, a ranking member. I particularly want to praise  Senator Casey for being our go-to person on the whole issue of  Medicaid.   Ever since we began to see the substantial cuts in 2017, as Senator  Casey knows, he has been the person we have said is our go-to leader  for the most vulnerable Americans who count on Medicaid being there for  them.   I want to tell a short story about one of Senator Casey's many  contributions to those who find Medicaid to be just a healthcare  lifeline. When the Trump administration began its attack on Medicaid  benefits, I had been the director of the Gray Panthers at home before I  got involved in public service, and a lot of folks came to me. They  said: Ron, that probably isn't a big deal for seniors because Medicare  covers most of those nursing home bills. And I had to say: Gosh, that  is really not the case. Medicare really covers only a small fraction of  nursing home bills. It covers the bills that are essentially for  hospital-like services, and most of nursing home care in America really  ends up getting picked up by Medicaid. Something like two out of every  three beds in long-term care facilities, which are custodial  facilities, end up being funded by Medicaid.   Senator Casey basically took it upon himself, as part of this effort,  to lead the Democrats on the Finance Committee and to lead the  Democrats in our caucus to go out and talk about what this really means  to the most vulnerable people in America. As my colleagues know,  probably 4 or 5 months into this debate with this relentless attack on  Medicaid coming week after week after week, most Americans began to  understand a little bit about what was on the line for millions of  senior citizens.   I thank my colleague because he really began the effort to make the  point that growing older in America is really an expensive proposition.  Even when you save and you scrimp, you don't go on a vacation, you  don't buy the boat, and you don't do the extra, growing older is really  an expensive proposition. So if you have a widower on the corner in  your neighborhood, and he always mowed his lawn, and he always helped  with the sports teams and the like, and now he is getting kind of frail  and may need some nursing home care, now we still have a safety net, an  essential safety net for those people.   I am going to talk a little bit about some of the challenges of  Medicaid. But I would like particularly to begin my remarks--Senator  Cardin has been an advocate in the Finance Committee, as well, on  Medicaid--by pointing out that Senator Casey, really, at the very  outset of this discussion, began the effort to make the case that a lot  of people weren't aware of, and that is that Medicaid is a safety net  for millions of older people.   Here is the story of Medicaid in 2019. For the vulnerable in America,  our people want to make sure that there is more access to Medicaid.  Unfortunately, on the other side of the aisle, Republicans are taking  that very access away. Just for a few minutes, I am going to draw out  this contrast because there is quite a difference of opinion between  how the majority party in the Trump White House are working against the  interests of vulnerable folks across the country.   As I mentioned, 2016 saw the beginning of this all-out attack by  Republicans on Medicaid--hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts,  proposed caps, block grants, basically an unravelling of the program as  we know it today.   Essentially, from Portland, OR, to Portland, ME, people said: No way.  We  [[Page S3352]]  are not going to support this kind of attack on Medicaid. So in some  States, like Utah, they chose the ballot box to actually expand  Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. The voters chose more access to  Medicaid, not less. But Republican lawmakers in Utah had decided to  deny them their choice. Just think about that one.   I sure hear a lot of talk on the other side of the aisle about  States' rights and empowering people at home. This is an example of  where voters chose more access to Medicaid, not less. The Republican  lawmakers said: Hey, we know better than that. We are not going to give  folks that choice. So Utah lawmakers took a hatchet to the plan that  voters approved on election day and started carving it out. The only  expansion they would allow is a lot smaller than what voters wanted-- spending more money to cover fewer people.   Then lawmakers in Utah followed a path cleared in other Republican- controlled States, and that was to punish those who were enrolled in  Medicaid with essentially bureaucratic water torture, with such a  barrage of paperwork that it was almost impossible to penetrate what  was really necessary to get through the program. This has been seen in  Arkansas, Kentucky, and elsewhere.   All of this, of course, is not couched in the bureaucratic maze of  redtape it actually is. The discussion is always: Well, this is just  about work. That is just not true. It is about getting people kicked  off their healthcare.   When you talk about Medicaid patients, you are talking about people  who are working and people who want to work. What we are up against are  a host of Republican schemes that are basically putting stacks of  paperwork between those who need healthcare and their doctors.   These are busy working people with kids to raise, older parents to  care for, and bills to pay. Yet lawmakers are trying to force them to  fill out stacks and stacks of paperwork just to make sure that somebody  can actually find their way through the maze and see a doctor.   If you look at what happened in Arkansas in 2018, you get a sense of  how destructive these bureaucratic schemes are to people's healthcare.  There were 18,000 people who lost their Medicaid coverage--18,000  people. Trump officials swore up and down that those paperwork  requirements wouldn't hurt anybody, but as we saw when the Secretary of  Health and Human Services came before the Finance Committee earlier  this year, they shrugged when you asked why so many people lost their  coverage in Arkansas after the paperwork requirements were put in  place.    A Federal judge even weighed in, blocking all of this paperwork,  while the Trump administration continued to push the States to take  them up. The schemes spread to States across the country, and it was  not just paperwork.   With the Trump administration's blessing, Tennessee is the first  State trying to turn its Medicaid Program into a block grant. This  basically takes a sledgehammer to Medicaid as we know it now. Medicaid  block grants mean putting nursing home care--which I just outlined  earlier in discussing Senator Casey's important role here--at risk for  millions of seniors. You risk children and people with disabilities  having to be cut off from their healthcare. But block-granting Medicaid  is one of the top goals for Republicans in the Trump administration.   Finally, Trump administration budget slashers are trying a new,  additional scheme that is going to hurt so many people across the  country. In this particular area, they basically are trying to bring  some mathematical sleight of hand so they can change key economic  measures in ways that boot vulnerable people off Medicaid and off food  stamps.   What they are doing here--again, this is all shrouded in language  that just sounds eminently reasonable--is basically talking about where  the poverty line ought to be, and then they want to find an artificial  way to push the poverty line down without doing anything to lift people  out of economic hardship. So you are talking about parents who work  long, hard hours and still struggle to make ends meet, people who are  trying to find affordable housing, who have practically given up the  idea of being able to save for retirement, and who are still trying to  pay college tuition. What does the Trump administration say? These  people just have life too easy.   The impact of this change would be enormous. Three hundred thousand  children could lose comprehensive health coverage, and a quarter  million adults could lose their coverage.   Colleagues, this is the Medicaid agenda for Senate Republicans and  the Trump administration: Let's go out there and look under every  possible rock to find a scheme to restrict access to Medicaid. That is  the agenda. Find a way to cut the funding, to deny expansion after the  voters approved it.   We now have two members of the Finance Committee with a long, long  history of advocating for vulnerable people facing health challenges,  so I am going to close and just say this: Ever since I was director of  the senior citizens--the Gray Panthers--I always said that the single  most important issue in America is healthcare. Whether it is North  Dakota or Michigan or Maryland, if you and your loved ones don't have  your health, everything else pretty much goes by the board. Somehow  that message has not gotten through to the majority here in the Senate  because under this majority and under the Trump administration's  healthcare agenda, they are buying into a completely different set of  principles. They are willing to set millions of Americans back with  respect to their healthcare needs. On this side of the aisle, we are  going to keep fighting to protect Medicaid.   As I indicated, our next two speakers have a long track record of  advocating for the vulnerable. I am just going to make a unanimous  consent request. Senator Cardin has been very patient with respect to  waiting to speak.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the passing of  Molly Holt. Known affectionately as the Mother of All Korea's Orphans,  Molly Holt dedicated her life to advocating for disabled, often  homeless, children and adults in South Korea. Born to international  adoption pioneers Bertha and Harry Holt, Molly carried the family  legacy with a steadfast dedication to serving those less fortunate.   Molly first traveled to South Korea as a young nursing graduate,  eager to assist her father as he attempted to provide care for the many  children left orphaned by the Korean war. She spent most of her life  working tirelessly with the residents of the Holt Ilsan Center in  Korea, a long-term care facility for children and adults who have  special physical, medical, or mental needs. Molly was a champion for  the children at the Holt Ilsan Center, who affectionately referred to  her as Unnie or big sister. It was through her steadfast advocacy that  many children housed at the center were able to find permanent, loving  homes.   Molly Holt will be remembered as an exceptional Oregonian, a woman  who was guided by her strong convictions towards a life of charity and  compassion. Even in the face of a debilitating illness, Molly remained  committed to serving the people that she loved with her whole heart.  Her passing is a loss that will be felt across the world, but her  legacy of earnest, passionate service will continue to inspire us for  decades to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, marine energy technologies generate  electricity using the natural power found in ocean waves, tides,  currents, and temperature differences in ocean water. This  nontraditional form of hydropower has the potential to fuel American  homes and businesses with renewable electricity and address the very  real challenge of climate change. Additionally, establishing a  commercially viable marine energy industry in the United States would  support a robust manufacturing and construction supply chain and create  thousands of good-paying clean energy jobs.   The Department of Energy (DOE) estimates that marine energy could  produce enough renewable energy to power millions of homes.  Furthermore, with more than half of the U.S. population living within  50 miles of a body of water, there is vast potential for marine energy  to efficiently provide clean electricity to communities across the  country--from large cities to remote coastal communities.   Because these promising marine renewable energy technologies are  still in the early stages of development, federal support is needed to  encourage private investments in marine energy projects, moving the  United States closer to large-scale deployment of these innovative  clean energy technologies.   The Marine Energy Research and Development Act advances this research  by reauthorizing DOE's marine renewable energy programs from 2020  through 2021. The bill gives priority to projects and technologies that  have the highest likelihood to lead to commercial utilization of new  marine energy systems.   The bill also directs DOE to research ways of building a stable  marine energy supply chain in the United States, as well as ways of  harmonizing marine energy development with ocean navigation, fisheries,  and critical infrastructure such as undersea cables.   The bill includes funding authorization for the National Marine  Renewable Energy Research Centers, which are located in Florida, Hawaii  and the Pacific Northwest. These three centers make use of federal  funding and the resources of five universities to test and refine  various marine energy technologies. The bill also provides DOE new  authority to establish new National Marine Energy Centers.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Reed, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr.          Brown):   S. 1823.
