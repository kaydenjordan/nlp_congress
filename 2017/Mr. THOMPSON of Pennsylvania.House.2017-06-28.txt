 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak  about TRIO programs, which, for more than 50 years, have helped  millions of low-income students attend college. Often, these students  are the first in their family to earn a college degree. TRIO programs  have helped low-income and disabled students who want to pursue a  higher education, but thought college was unaffordable and out of  reach.   Children from disadvantaged families often struggle to access  important mentoring, tutoring, and other hands-on services designed to  help encourage high school completion and the pursuit of postsecondary  education.   Sadly, these students are often unprepared for college academics and  require remedial courses that add to the challenges of completing a  program. Too many disadvantaged students simply give up on even  applying to college because they are confused by the application  process, overwhelmed by the cost, or are unaware of the available  financial aid options, despite our best efforts to ensure the  information is available and understandable.   Recognizing these challenges, the Federal Government has created  several programs to help disadvantaged students access the support  necessary to realize the dream of a college degree. For example,  college preparation and retention programs such as TRIO, Upward Bound,  Talent Search, and Student Support Services provide a pipeline of  support services that encourage low-income students to graduate high  school and earn a postsecondary degree.   Mr. Speaker, just last week, the House unanimously approved the  Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act  to reauthorize the Carl D. Perkins Act and support skills-based career  education. This bill will help close the skills gap that exists today  and prepare students for in-demand jobs.   TRIO programs are just as important to help those who want to pursue  a college degree have the resources necessary to do so.   As a senior member on the House Education and the Workforce  Committee, I am a strong supporter of TRIO. I am also a member of the  House TRIO Caucus. I want all Americans to have higher education  opportunities if that is the path that they choose.   The TRIO program dates back to the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964  in response to the administration's War on Poverty. That is when Upward  Bound was formed. In 1965, Talent Search, the second outreach program,  was created as part of the Higher Education Act.  [[Page H5237]]                                     time  1015    In 1968, Student Support Services, which was originally known as  Special Services for Disadvantaged Students, was authorized by the  Higher Education Amendments and became the third in a series of  educational opportunity programs. By the late 1960s, the term TRIO was  coined to describe these three Federal programs.   Over the years, the TRIO programs have been expanded and improved to  provide a wider range of services and to reach more students who need  assistance. In 1990, the Department created the Upward Bound Math and  Science program to address the need for specific instruction in the  fields of math and science.   Mr. Speaker, as you can see, TRIO programs have a long history of  helping low-income individuals, first-generation college students, and  individuals with disabilities reach their full potential. I support  these programs, and I want to see every American reach his or her  educational goals.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  five high school honors students from Pennsylvania's Fifth  Congressional District chosen to represent the Commonwealth of  Pennsylvania as delegates at the Congress of Future Medical Leaders.   The following students were selected to attend the event which began  Sunday and concluded yesterday in Lowell, Massachusetts:   Donovan Brubaker of Boalsburg;   Catherine McQuitty of Rixford;   Hannah Mull of Genesee;   Mackenzie Wilcox of Duke Center; and   Sarah Zakrzwski of Tyrone.   They were nominated by their teachers or The National Academy of  Future Physicians and Medical Scientists based on their academic  excellence and aspiration to join the medical field. Each of these  dedicated students achieved a minimum 3.5 GPA to be nominated for the  honors-only program.   The event aims to encourage and guide the top students in our country  who hope to become physicians or medical scientists. Chosen delegates  at the Congress represent all 50 States including Puerto Rico.   I wish these students the best of luck in their future studies to  lead our country's medical profession.   Congratulations.                            ____________________
