 Mr. Speaker, given that last week I took the oath of  [[Page H536]]  office as a Member of the new 115th Congress of the United States and  given that next week we will watch President-elect Trump also take the  oath of office, I want to share a few thoughts on the deep importance  of this constitutional duty that we share.   Mr. Speaker, as you are aware, last week on Capitol Hill was marked  by a day of celebration. It was a day of renewal of friendships, even  between people who have deep, deep disagreements in this body. Families  and guests all gathered to share in the moment's excitement and  meaning, and Members of Congress congratulated one another on their  recent victories. We all took a reprieve from the intensity of the  policy debate for just a moment. But amidst all of that swirl of  activity, the day was set apart by the oath of office.   Mr. Speaker, the oath lays down a clear marker of the serious  obligations ahead for all of us. In our day and time, we no longer are  deeply connected to this concept of oath. We see it in the courtroom  when somebody is required to tell the truth. We will see it again next  week when President-elect Trump is sworn in. But we rarely take the  time to reflect on its deeper meaning.   We see it more like an old tradition, a nostalgic option that we  exercise out of deference to our history. However, the oath is much,  much more. It is a solemn declaration. It is a pause, the start of  sacred duty.   By taking an oath, you effectively hold your very self at ransom. You  commit, at the deepest levels, that you will perform the tasks ahead of  you to the best of your ability.   The oath is the ultimate test and measure of integrity. If you  violate it, you tear at the center of your being, to the detriment of  not only yourself but to the community, to those you are sworn to  serve. This is a very high bar, indeed, Mr. Speaker.   I am reminded of the words of Sir Thomas More, who was the Lord High  Chancellor of England during the 16th century. He strove to live a life  worthy of excellence in public service. But in the end, he was put to  death by the very state that he sought to so nobly serve.   In an earlier reflection on the idea of oath, Sir Thomas More had  this to say:   ``When a man takes an oath, he's holding his own self in his own  hands like water, and if he opens his fingers then, he needn't hope to  find himself again.''   Mr. Speaker, throughout that wonderful day last week of our swearing  in here in the body, I was reflecting personally on a singular word.  That word is replenishment.   Our American system of governance has an extraordinary capacity to  replenish itself with new ideas, new people, and refreshed  perspectives. Our political system starts with the belief that  political power is derived from each person's dignity.   By voting, citizens invest that very power in the Representatives  that are sent here to make judgments on their behalf. But, of course,  to earn that right in the first place, the Representative must make his  case to the people. In spite of the drama, in spite of the raucous  nature of elections--and we have just come through one--the fact that  America goes through this cycle of constant replenishment is truly an  extraordinary gift.   Mr. Speaker, as I stood in the center aisle right here last week, I  raised my right hand. I raised it right along with everyone else who is  a Member of this new 115th Congress, and I took that oath of office.   Mr. Speaker, I just think it is worthwhile to read these powerful  words:   ``I do solemnly swear, or affirm, that I will support and defend the  Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and  domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that  I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or  purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the  duties of the office on which I am about to enter, so help me God.''   Mr. Speaker, indeed, this is a very high bar. This is a sacred duty.  This is a solemn task. It sets this body and our system of governance  apart by forcing each of us who have been given this extraordinary  privilege of taking on the heavy mantel and weighty responsibility of  making decisions on behalf of this great country, and to do so to the  best of our ability, having put our very self, the integrity of what it  means to be a person, on the line to uphold that commitment.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 4 o'clock and 9 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until Tuesday,  January 17, 2017, at noon.                            ____________________
