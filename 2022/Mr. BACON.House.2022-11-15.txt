 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Sergeant Dennis L. Pavlik,  who is believed to be the last living Korean war POW from Nebraska.   Sergeant Pavlik joined the United States Army in October of 1952 when  he was inducted at Fort Omaha in Nebraska. Sergeant Pavlik was then  assigned to B Company, the 22nd Armored Engineer for artillery basic  training, which he completed at Camp Chaffee, Arkansas.   Following his completion of basic training, Sergeant Pavlik was  assigned to C Battery, the 555 Field Artillery, also known as the  Triple Nickel.   Sergeant Pavlik then moved to a variety of locations across Korea,  finally landing near Kumsong in a location known as the Kumsong  Salient. It was there, on the night of July 13, 1953, that Sergeant  Pavlik's artillery was under intense enemy counter barrage ending in  the eventual imprisonment of multiple United States soldiers.   Sergeant Pavlik and his fellow soldiers were then forced to march  north to a POW camp the Chinese referred to as Camp Six. It was here  Sergeant Pavlik spent 42 days as a prisoner of war, which he has  referred to as ``the longest 6 weeks of my life.''   Sergeant Pavlik stated the most important lesson he learned during  those 6 weeks is the knowledge of freedom. As the war in Korea ended,  Sergeant Pavlik was then released from Camp Six and eventually returned  to United States soil on August 25, 1953, just 1 month after the  official end of the Korean war.   Sergeant Pavlik ended his military service on July 20, 1954, and was  awarded the Bronze Star with the ``V'' for Valor Device, the Good  Conduct Medal, the POW Medal, National Defense Service Medal, the  Korean Service Medal with two Battle Stars, United Nations Service  Medal, and the Korean Presidential Unit Citation.   Today, he resides in Omaha, Nebraska, with his wife, Luella, and has  three children and five grandchildren.   Sergeant Pavlik also serves as the Post Commander for the American  Ex-Prisoner of War Department of Nebraska.   It is with great honor that I recognize the last-known prisoner of  war survivor for the Korean war, and my good friend, Nebraska Sergeant  Dennis L. Pavlik.                            ____________________
