 Mr. President, we ought to be aggrieved, we ought to  be angry, and we ought to be furious--not just frustrated but furious-- at this sad, even pathetic, objection to moving forward with a bill  that is supported by 95 percent of the American people. The simple fact  is that our Senate colleagues have been talking to us in good faith,  not only about a background checks bill but also about emergency risk  protection orders, because we know there is no single solution, no  panacea, and that emergency risk protection orders are the other side  of the coin to background checks.   Last week, the Washington Post reported that President Trump has  given up on passing lifesaving gun violence legislation. The reason is  fierce lobby by the NRA.   Let's face the stark truth here. The objection on the floor today is  not the result of any lack of clarity about the need for background  check legislation. It is the result, purely and simply, of the  President saying no.   We need to do our job. We have continued talks, in fact, with members  of the White House staff after the impeachment proceedings began. My  hope is that the Washington Post article is untrue. I believe it,  certainly, in no way forestalls or prevents these discussions from  continuing. I think there is a reason to hope, but it will take courage  and strength to do it.   The President said yesterday that he was too busy doing his job  meeting with the President of Turkey--an individual who has potentially  enabled war crimes in northern Syria. If he wasn't too busy to do that  kind of meeting, he shouldn't be too busy to do gun violence  prevention.   The fact is that the stakes are simply too high for there to be  delay, and 36,000 Americans are killed every year, or more. That is 100  every day. Gun deaths are, in fact, rising, not declining.   The trends are absolutely alarming and appalling, and we are  complicit in these deaths if we fail to act. As I speak on the floor  right now, there is a school shooting in Santa Clarita, CA. How can we  turn the other way? How can we refuse to see that shooting in realtime,  demanding our attention, requiring our action? We are complicit if we  fail to act. It is not just a political responsibility. It is a moral  imperative. The unconscionable loss of life is our responsibility.   This problem is one that we can solve. We may not be able to prevent  all the deaths that occur--all 100 every day in America--but we can  save lives. Our goal has to be to save as many lives as quickly as  possible.   I have been hopeful for the first time in a long time, as I have  talked with my colleague Senator Graham. He and I have worked together  conscientiously and closely on ``extreme risk protection order''  legislation. There have been a series of encouraging conversations with  the White House, and all seemed to be proceeding well, until there was  a report of the President talking to Wayne LaPierre of the NRA.  Apparently, it takes only a phone call--or a couple of them--with the  NRA to turn around the White House and stop the progress we have been  making and throw out the window all the good work we have done.   Over these past several months, Senator Graham, the White House, and  my office have made important strides on emergency risk protection. We  know that they work. They enjoy broad popular support. At least 70  percent of the American people support some type of ``extreme risk  protection'' legislation, including two-thirds of Republicans and 60  percent of gun owners.   States like Connecticut, which was the first to adopt them, have  shown they have a palpable, tangible, measurable effect. They are a  crucial tool for law enforcement. The full implementation of  Connecticut's ``emergency risk protection order'' law was associated  with a mere 14-percent decline in firearm suicide rates, and the  passages of Indiana's law in 2005 is associated with a 7.5-percent  decline in the firearm suicide rate.   We know these laws work. In the 17 jurisdictions that have passed  them, there has been a decline in suicides and homicides and domestic  violence shootings. We can save lives. We can put together a measure  that combines background checks, emergency risk protection orders, and  other sensible steps. We can work through this body. The objection that  we are bringing it to the floor precipitously is absolutely ridiculous.  There is no reason we have to give up now and throw away all our work  simply because the House is doing something unrelated, on impeachment.   There has been too much good work as well by groups doing the  grassroots task of mobilizing public support--Moms Demand Action,  Students Demand Action, and all of the groups that have rallied around  for gun safety. In Connecticut, the Newtown Action Alliance,  Connecticut Against Gun Violence, and Sandy Hook Promise show us the  way.   In the last election, gun violence was on the ballot. Gun violence  prevention won. That is the reason the House has passed H.R. 8. That is  the reason why  [[Page S6586]]  we should do it here. History will judge my Republican colleagues  harshly if they fail that, and the voters will judge them even more  immediately equally harshly.   The NRA is imploding. Its vice-like grip should be crumbling in this  body. They may have the ear of the President, but they should not have  the ear of my Republican colleagues.   To the President, I say: The NRA is telling the American public they  own you and that all they have to do is snap their fingers, and you  fall into line. Prove them wrong. All you need to do is take the final  steps on this legislation. Give us a green light. Tell us that we can  move forward and that you will sign this bill.   To the majority leader I say, whether or not the President gives us  that green light, we need to do our job. Please do your job. Let us  have this vote.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I rise to recognize The  Last Green Valley National Heritage Corridor as it celebrates 25 years  of protection and preservation of this environmentally sensitive,  pristine area.   Originally designated as the Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley  National Heritage Corridor, the valley was officially designated as a  critical natural resource by President Clinton on November 2, 1994.  Twenty years later, it was officially renamed The Last Green Valley.   For a quarter of a century, The Last Green Valley advocates have  worked to care for the corridor through nonprofit stewardship. Overall,  the valley comprises a 1,100-square-mile area, which ranges from  eastern Connecticut to south-central Massachusetts. One of the most  notable aspects of the valley is its rural characteristics despite its  proximity to three of New England's largest urban areas. Among its  707,000 acres, 77 percent of this range is farmland and forest.   The Last Green Valley's designation as a national heritage corridor  by Congress acknowledges its status as a unique national resource.  Included in this designation are 26 towns in Connecticut and 9 in  Massachusetts. The underdeveloped, green area so close to many large  urban spaces makes it a point of special ecological interest and a  great environmental asset to Connecticut and the nation.   Dedicated to preserving the natural beauty and resources of New  England from development and despoilment, The Last Green Valley sets a  positive example of environmental conservation and protection. I  applaud its accomplishments and hope my colleagues will join me in  congratulating The Last Green Valley on 25 years of excellence.                            ____________________
