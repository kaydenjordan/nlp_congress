 Mr. Speaker, we all continue to mourn the  passing of our dear friend Elijah Cummings. He was an honorable man  with a deep commitment to our Nation. He inspired many of us to always  do what is right and to seek the truth. It is, therefore, fitting that  H.R. 3 will be renamed in his Honor.   It is wrong and immoral that Americans spend more money per person on  prescription drug prices than any other country in the world. No  American should have to decide between life or death because they can't  afford their prescription drugs.   This is personal to me. Many of my family members suffer from  diabetes, as do many of my constituents. This is why I support H.R. 3.  Let us honor the legacy of our dear colleague with action. Let's  deliver lower prescription drug prices for the American people on his  behalf and in his Honor.   Rest in power, Mr. Cummings.                            ____________________
