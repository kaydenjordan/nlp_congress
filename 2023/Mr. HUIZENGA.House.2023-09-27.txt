 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment to  protect farmers, the agricultural business, and small businesses  throughout west Michigan, and, frankly, across America from a costly  new fee.   Along with a host of additional fee increases for H-2A and H-2B  visas, the Biden administration has proposed a brand-new $600 per- petition fee, Mr. Chair, on employers seeking visas for temporary  workers.   This impacts a wide range of guest worker categories, such as H-2A  and H-2B. H-2As, of course, are used for temporary agricultural work,  and H-2Bs are usually used in the tourism industry. Frankly, I know my  friend from Texas has been very involved in the H-2B and H-2A space. We  have had this discussion before.   Furthermore, the administration--not me, not Republicans--but the  Biden administration itself is dubbing this increase the ``asylum  program fee.'' This $600 fee will be coming directly out of the pockets  of farmers and small businesses and funneled to the asylum process  backlog caused by this administration's failed border policies.   In April of this year, six Republicans and six Democrats from  Michigan--nearly our entire delegation--joined together to oppose this  increase in a bipartisan letter to Secretary Mayorkas requesting that  he reconsider reimplementing this fee and other significant fee  increases that we view as harmful.   Making ends meet in the face of soaring prices and record inflation  is hard enough. The Federal Government should not be inventing  additional costs that raise prices for consumers and make it harder for  family farms and small businesses to keep their doors open.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support  this commonsense amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I wish the gentleman hadn't necessarily  yielded back his time because I would have loved to have a little bit  of a colloquy on this.   I fully understand the USCIS is a fee-based institution. It takes in  those fees.   In addition to the $600 per petition fee, they also had proposed a  tripling of a fee for the named employee. If you are putting in--and  the gentleman knows this issue very well. If you have a particular  person that you are requesting to come into the country, this  administration tripled that fee. If you have an unnamed person for an  H-2A or an H-2B, they doubled that fee increase.   I had an amendment that was going to attempt to address those two  issues, as well. The Rules Committee ruled that nongermane. We can have  that discussion outside of that, but they did rule this particular  proposal and this amendment as germane, as relevant to this discussion.   While we have seen a fee already that is in place be increased, we  are not able to do that, but this is a brand-new fee that the  administration, again, has labeled the ``asylum program fee.''   We all know that there are serious issues at the southern border, and  it is something the gentleman has talked about pretty extensively. I  just don't see how penalizing small businesses and people who are using  the system legally and increasing their costs which are going to be  passed along to the general public, how that makes sense in this case.   I talked to a farmer back in southwest Michigan who regularly employs  about 100 seasonal temporary workers. It doesn't take a math genius to  figure out 100 H-2A visas with a $600 fee, that is $60,000 in  additional fees that this farmer is going to have to put up front  before they have done the harvest, before they have actually reaped any  of the benefit of the work.   That is why I believe this is so crucially important to U.S.  agriculture.                                time  2215    While I understand the gentleman may oppose this particular amendment  as it is sitting, I hope he wouldn't oppose the spirit of this. I would  love to work with him on this because I do believe we need to address  this issue.   Mr. Chair, I again urge all of my colleagues to vote for this  amendment. I believe it is a commonsense amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
