 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the tens of  thousands of veterans who served on radar stations across the world  during the Cold War.   From 1947 to 1991, American servicemembers faced extremely  challenging climates and conditions in the most isolated locations to  successfully mitigate threats from the Soviet Union to ensure the  maintenance of peace.   These veterans were highly trained and from every United States  military branch, including the National Guard and Reserve units. They  were also supported by allied forces and civilians, as well.   These brave watch guards were on a mission of the utmost importance  to detect, track, intercept, and destroy hostile airborne intruders  when they entered the free world airspace.   Although the protection of allied airspace was successful following  the end of the Cold War, the United States never officially recognized  the countless hours of surveillance that these servicemembers provided  to our country and the world.   Several years ago, a dedicated group of Air Force Cold War-era radar  station veterans formed a nonprofit organization to raise funds for the  construction of a monument commemorating their fellow servicemembers'  sacrifices.   The monument was unveiled on November 7, 2019, at Wright-Patterson  Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, with some 100 veterans and their family  members in attendance.   Today, I thank these veterans for their service during such a tense  and a turbulent time in our history. Their dedication to our security  and the prosperity of peace never wavered an iota.   As a veteran stationed in Germany during the Cold War, I can relate  to many of the sacrifices that these courageous individuals made, and I  am forever grateful for them.   I include in the Record a letter by one of the United States Air  Force Radar Station Veterans Monument Association founders, 1st  Lieutenant James E. Muecke, which contains more information about the  hard work that went into making the dream of a monument into a reality.                      Radar Station Veterans Monument         Several years ago, three Air Force veterans who served on       various radar stations during the Cold War began discussing       how to honor their service and others who held the same job.       A monument was suggested, but they lacked funding and a       location. Washington, D.C., was thought to be the most       obvious location choice, but given how long it took to       construct the World War II Memorial, they decided to look       elsewhere. After many discussions with their fellow veterans,       they formed a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called the       United States Air Force (USAF) Radar Station Veterans       Monument Association. Five veterans volunteered to serve as       officers for the association, and 26 agreed to become board       members.        Once the association was formed, donations were sought from       many Cold War-era manufacturers and suppliers of radar       equipment. Unfortunately, most were out of business or had       merged with other companies. As a result, the association       contacted as many radar station veterans as possible to ask       for their donations for the monument. Eventually, the       National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-      Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, was selected as the       location for the monument's placement. The museum indicated       that the project would cost approximately $30,000. After much       aid from their fellow veterans, they raised $43,000.        When designing the monument, their goal was to educate the       public in an appealing way. They decided on a monument made       from black granite stone, with images of 23 radar sites       etched into it. A mission statement and description of the       radar station operating conditions were inscribed on the       front, and a globe sat on top, symbolizing worldwide       involvement. The monument was completed and placed in section       two of Memorial Park at the National Museum of the United       States Air Force. The dedication ceremony was held on       November 7, 2019, with some 100 veterans and family members       in attendance. It was an outstanding program; the Air Force       honor guard members gave a flag presentation. After the       program, the USAF Radar Station Veterans Monument Association       members formally turned the monument over to the museum.        Following the ceremony, an evening banquet was held, and       the association's officers were recognized for their work in       commissioning the monument. They received a standing ovation.       All officers were presented with a framed picture of the       monument, the USAF Radar Station Veterans Monument       Association's logo, and a statement of appreciation.        This is just one example of what it means to be a United       States veteran: We are loyal, are proud to have served this       great country, and can still stand tall for a monument       dedicated to this purpose. We give a proud hand salute to all       who attended, to those who could not attend because of       distance or health, and especially to those who served but       are no longer with us.                                          1st. Lt. James E. Muecke.     May God bless these heroes and may history remember them.                            ____________________
