 Madam Speaker, in a Budget Committee hearing  yesterday, I could not restrain my pain to raise the question of three  little babies and three adults killed in Nashville with assault  weapons.   Does anyone know the costliness--over $200 billion of gun violence in  America. I raised that in the Budget Committee because the witnesses  were trying to blame all of the deficit on President Biden.   I believe in a balanced budget for States and cities like Houston. We  can do that. Please understand that the Federal Government is the  umbrella on a rainy day.   A disaster in Mississippi--the Federal Government comes. A disaster  in Ohio, in East Palestine--the Federal Government comes. Raging  hurricanes--the Federal Government comes. Raging fires.   As a member of the Budget Committee, I can assure you we will look to  the President's $6.7 trillion budget, but we are looking to also bring  down the deficit as we responsibly need to do.   I will not support eliminating Medicare payments for those who need  it, Social Security payments for those who need it, education funding  that the Federal Government does through Pell grants, climate change  dollars, or being able to ensure that we are the umbrella on a rainy  day.   The budget of the American people must respond to the American  people. We will get the right budget and lift the debt ceiling.                            ____________________
