 Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I urge my colleagues to support the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Democracy and Accountability Act of 2018.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel  for their very strong support of this legislation and for their strong  statements today.   I think this is, again, another example of bipartisan legislation and  the House uniting over a very egregious situation that is occurring in  the DRC.   I would point out to my colleagues that I have visited the DRC  myself, been to Kinshasa, the capital, raised a number of human rights  issues when I was there.   But I also traveled to Goma, where there was terrible acts of  bloodshed committed by both the government troops. As well as those  that were combating the government, and even terrible acts by the  peacekeepers, the U.N. peacekeepers, some years ago, where they were  complicit in human trafficking, particularly of little children.                                time  1745    In my subcommittee, I chaired four hearings on this horrible practice  of the peacekeepers themselves causing such violence against kids.  There is now a much better situation, but it is still awful, and,  again, we are now facing another serious crisis.   I would also point out to my colleagues that Karen Bass and I had a  trip planned to Kinshasa for August 24 and 25. We made part of that  trip where we went to Ethiopia, but we were denied visas. We could not  get visas to go to the DRC. We wanted to raise issues with Kabila,  himself, with regards to the election and human rights abuse. We were  denied that by not getting a visa.   This bill could not be more timely. Indeed, there is an urgent need  to focus attention on the DRC, a strategically located, resource-rich  country, which has been misgoverned for much of its history and again  is in crisis today.   The wonderful people of the DRC deserve better, far better than they  have gotten from the Kabila regime. Next month, just before Christmas,  the country is scheduled to vote to replace Joseph Kabila, who has  retained power in defiance of constitutional term limits for some 2  years beyond his mandate.   Right now, there is talk of further postponement of the election,  which would accord with Kabila's desire to postpone a transfer of power  for as long as possible. If such a delay occurs, it would be  attributable to the obstacles placed by the Kabila government to  holding a free and fair election.  [[Page H9600]]    This bill before us today shows congressional resolve that there be  accountability and codifies three executive orders by three Presidents:  President Bush, President Obama, and President Trump.   It points out that there needs to be significant progress towards  holding free and fair elections or else they will not be lifted, and it  does so for 7 years. We are talking about respecting fundamental  freedoms of the press, expression, and assembly, as described in the  December 2016 Saint Sylvestre agreement and in U.N. Security Council  Resolution 2348.   It also points out that there needs to be, in the legislation, a free  and fair Presidential election in accordance with the constitution of  the DRC and that a democratically elected President has been sworn in  and taken office.   It also supports the humanitarian and accountability efforts of civil  society groups pushing back against civil strife and political  repression. In particular, it acknowledges the role of the faith  community and the Catholic Church, which educates and heals the  Congolese people through its schools and hospitals, while upholding the  need for the rule of law and respect for constitutional principles in  the DRC.   Indeed, the Congolese Conference of Catholic Bishops, known as CENCO,  has played a singular role in promoting restoration of democracy and  respect for fundamental civil and political rights, including brokering  the December 2016 Saint Sylvestre agreement.   Mr. Speaker, this is a critical time for the DRC. We have an emerging  Ebola crisis in the eastern part of the country. I note that, over the  weekend, our Embassy in Kinshasa was forced to close due to ``credible  and specific'' terror threats. The Embassy will remain closed at least  until tomorrow because of those threats and perhaps even beyond that  date. We are hurtling towards a political inflection point within the  next month, which will either mark a turn towards proper constitutional  governance or a downward spiral towards growing chaos and bloodshed.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New  York for his comments and for his strong support.   Mr. Speaker, this is a true bipartisan bill. Our fingers are crossed  for the people of the DRC. They deserve a free and fair election.  Whoever emerges as the winner hopefully will take them on a new course.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  concur in the Senate amendments to the bill (H.R. 390) to provide  emergency relief for victims of genocide, crimes against humanity, and  war crimes in Iraq and Syria, for accountability for perpetrators of  these crimes, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the Senate amendments is as follows:   Senate amendments:        Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the       following:       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Iraq and Syria Genocide       Relief and Accountability Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The Secretary of State of State declared on March 17,       2016, and on August 15, 2017, that Daesh (also known as the       Islamic State of Iraq and Syria or ISIS) is responsible for       genocide, crimes against humanity, and other atrocity crimes       against religious and ethnic minority groups in Iraq and       Syria, including Christians, Yezidis, and Shia, among other       religious and ethnic groups.        (2) According to the Department of State's annual reports       on international religious freedom--        (A) the number of Christians living in Iraq has dropped       from an estimated 800,000 to 1,400,000 in 2002 to fewer than       250,000 in 2017; and        (B) the number of Yezidis living in Iraq has fluctuated       from 500,000 in 2013, to between 350,000 and 400,000 in 2016,       and between 600,000 and 750,000 in 2017.        (3) The annual reports on international religious freedom       further suggest that--        (A) Christian communities living in Syria, which had       accounted for between 8 and 10 percent of Syria's total       population in 2010, are now ``considerably'' smaller as a       result of the civil war, and  [[Page H9601]]         (B) there was a population of approximately 80,000 Yezidis       before the commencement of the conflict in Syria.        (4) Local communities and entities have sought to mitigate       the impact of violence directed against religious and ethnic       minorities in Iraq and Syria, including the Chaldean Catholic       Archdiocese of Erbil (Kurdistan Region of Iraq), which has       used predominantly private funds to provide assistance to       internally displaced Christians, Yezidis, and Muslims       throughout the greater Erbil region, while significant needs       and diminishing resources have made it increasingly difficult       to continue these efforts.       SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise today to urge strong support for H.R. 390, the bipartisan Iraq  and Syria Genocide Relief and Accountability Act.   I want to begin by offering my special thanks to Majority Leader  Kevin McCarthy for his strong and sustained support for the victims of  genocide, for  [[Page H9602]]  this bill, and for the work of his amazing staff, especially Luke  Murry, who has done yeoman's work on making sure that this moves  forward; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his chief of staff,  Sharon Soderstrom, for their work; as well as our friends on the Senate  side.   I especially want to thank Ed Royce, our chairman, and Ranking Member  Eliot Engel for their wonderful support for this bill, and for all the  Members.   I want to thank Anna Eshoo, who has been tenacious in her support for  genocide-targeted communities in Iraq and Syria, and Matt McMurray, her  chief of staff, who has also been a great friend to work with on this  legislation.   My thanks to Mary Noonan, my chief of staff; Piero Tozzi, my staff  director for the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee; Nathaniel Hurd at the  U.S. Helsinki Commission, who has been lead staffer on the bill; David  Trimble, senior fellow at the Religious Freedom Institute; and so many  others who have been a part of this effort to get this across the  finish line.   Mr. Speaker, in September of 2013, I chaired my first of 10  congressional hearings focused in whole or in part on Christians,  Yazidis, and other religious and ethnic minorities targeted by ISIS for  genocide and other atrocity crimes, frustrated and deeply disappointed  that the previous administration was failing to direct aid to these  survivors and to support criminal investigations into the perpetrators.  Three years later, on September 8, 2016, I introduced H.R. 5961.   It was clear then, as it is now, that local overstretched,  underfunded groups on the ground were being forced to fill a huge gap,  like the Chaldean Catholic Archdiocese of Erbil in the Kurdistan region  of Iraq, supported by the Knights of Columbus under the extraordinary  leadership of Carl Anderson and by Aid to the Church in Need. To date,  the Knights of Columbus has contributed $20 million and Aid to the  Church in Need has contributed more than $60 million to the response  for these people who are the survivors of genocide. Without this  support from private charities, Mr. Speaker, many people, especially  children, would have died or have been afflicted with serious disease  or disability.   Where was the United States? Nowhere to be found.   Just before Christmas of 2016, I led a delegation to Erbil at the  invitation of the Chaldean Archbishop of Erbil, Bashar Warda, who was  heroically leading the effort to sustain more than 70,000 Christians  who had fled ISIS, as well as some Yazidis and Muslims.   There I met with genocide survivors, almost all of whom told me that  they had family members who were murdered, tortured, beaten, and raped  by ISIS. Their stories were tragic beyond words and heartbreaking  beyond words, but members of my delegation and I were in awe of their  deep and abiding faith in God, their resiliency, and their courage.  They simply would not quit. They would move on and try to live a life  and try to thrive.   We visited a camp of 6,000 internally displaced persons, managed by  the archdiocese, that the U.S. Government had not even visited until  just before our trip in 2016, even though it was only 10 minutes away  from the consulate. I was told I shouldn't go because it was too  dangerous. I asked, ``Was there a specific threat?'' and there wasn't.   When we got there, we were met by about 250 to 300 children, all  about fourth or fifth graders or thereabouts, singing Christmas carols,  and I felt, ``Boy, that is a real threatening situation.'' It was  foolish in the extreme.   They needed our help. They were not getting enough food. They were  not getting enough medicine, and their shelter was very meager, to say  the least.   On January 10, 2017, I introduced H.R. 390, a stronger version of the  previous bill. The House unanimously passed it--again, totally  bipartisan--on June 6. On October 11, the Senate passed it with a  slightly amended version, which is why it is here before the House  today for reconsideration.                                time  1800    H.R. 390 authorizes the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for  International Development and the Secretary of State to direct  humanitarian, stabilization, and recovery assistance to these  communities to enable them to survive and someday thrive in Iraq and  Syria.   It also authorizes the Secretary and the Administrator to fund  entities conducting criminal investigations into ISIS perpetrators who  committed atrocity crimes in Iraq. The evidence these entities collect  and preserve will be used to apprehend, prosecute, and convict  perpetrators in a range of court settings.   We have learned from the courts in Rwanda, in Sierra Leone, as well  as the court in Yugoslavia, you have to capture this information. You  have to get the testimonies from survivors and eyewitnesses to  effectuate effective prosecutions.   The surviving religious and ethnic communities have begun to receive  some targeted aid from the United States under the leadership of Vice  President Pence, USAID Administrator Green, and Secretary Pompeo. The  governments of Hungary and Poland, as well, have stepped up to provide  assistance to those in need.   However, we have to move quickly on this bill and on implementation  on this. As Archbishop Warda, the head of Chaldean Catholic Church  there, told me today: ``Christians in Iraq are still at the brink of  extinction. H.R. 390 is vital to our survival. If it becomes law,  implementation must be full and fast. Otherwise, the help it provides  will be too late for us.''   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), the chairwoman emeritus of  the Foreign Affairs Committee who currently chairs the Subcommittee on  the Middle East and North Africa.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I will be very brief. I thank, again, Eliot Engel,  Chairman Royce, and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who is the former chairwoman  of the committee. I thank her for her very kind remarks. She has been a  leader on human rights herself all over the world, especially with  regard to Iran and some of the legislation she has gotten enacted into  law. I thank her for that extraordinary leadership.   Again, this is an example of us pulling together and helping a group  of people, survivors of ISIS genocide, who are in desperate need of  assistance. We are now past the emergency level in most cases.   When we originally introduced the bill, I named it ``the emergency.''  We didn't get it passed fast enough, but there is so much more that  remains to be done when it comes to recovery and sustainability of  these precious lives that have been so wounded by ISIS through mass  murder and genocide, which has been recognized by both the Obama  administration and the Trump administration.   So this is an idea whose time has come, and my hope is that it will  be implemented faithfully and aggressively from the moment it is  signed.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
