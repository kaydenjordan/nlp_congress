 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory and in celebration  of the life and legacy of my friend, Suzanne Kling Post, a tremendous  force for good in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.   Suzy passed on January 2, after having spent her entire life in  service to others, fighting for school desegregation, civil liberties,  fair housing, women's rights, equality for all, and more. There was no  challenge too daunting and no issue too controversial for Suzy to take  on.   As reliable as the sun rising and setting each day, if there was  injustice, prejudice, or discrimination, Suzy was right there,  organizing and empowering. She helped lift the voices of those wronged,  and demanded more from our city and our Commonwealth on behalf of those  in need.  [[Page H2510]]    Born into a white, middle-class, Jewish family in the Highlands of  Louisville in 1933, Suzy was quick to put others first. She joined the  NAACP as a student at Indiana University. She returned home and helped  organize sit-ins and demonstrations of civil disobedience in protest of  housing discrimination; and she helped lead efforts for civil rights  and against the Vietnam War.   She led the ACLU of Kentucky, founded by her uncle, Arthur Kling, and  eventually became the founding director of the Metropolitan Housing  Commission. After decades of service, she was inducted into the  Kentucky Human Rights Commission Hall of Fame in 2007.   Though small in stature, she was larger than life. She had a fire in  her belly and a passion for her work that was contagious. Her low voice  had the power to move you, and she never missed an opportunity to use  it and move us forward as a city.   In the Louisville Courier-Journal's thoughtful obituary recounting  her life, they noted that, once asked why she became an activist, Suzy  replied: I guess I just don't like injustice. It ticks me off; it  really does. Although she didn't use the word ``ticks.''   She was as uncomplicated as she was powerful; straightforward,  straight to the heart and an invaluable source of strength for me, our  city, and our Commonwealth. To say we are better off because of her  decades of service is an understatement. She expected more, gave more,  and got more from all of us because she demanded it of her community  and of herself.   I will always value her friendship, her leadership, and for never  shying away from a fight.   To her children and grandchildren, I hope you can take some solace in  knowing that your mother and grandmother was the conscience of the city  that loved her dearly, and we will all work to carry her legacy  forward.   May her memory be a blessing.                            ____________________
