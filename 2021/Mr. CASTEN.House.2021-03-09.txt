 Mr. Speaker, for the one in eight Americans who will go  to bed hungry tonight; for the 60 million Americans out of work and the  40 million who fear they might be evicted tomorrow; for the 2.3 million  women, a million mothers, who have left the workforce, the American  Rescue Plan is for you.   It will put money directly in your pockets; expand access to  affordable healthcare and childcare; extend unemployment insurance and  housing and nutrition assistance; and support 27 million children with  an expanded child tax credit.   Mr. Speaker, for the 1.4 million public-sector employees who are out  of work--our firefighters, our teachers, our frontline public health  workers, our first responders--we are going to provide $350 billion for  States and localities, including $13.7 billion for my State of  Illinois, to get you back to work, too.   We can't fix everything. 524,000 American lives lost to COVID are  never coming back. But tomorrow, when we vote to pass the American  Rescue Plan, we will honor their memory. We will make things a little  easier for their loved ones. We will get their kids back in school  safely, their family businesses back in the black, cut child poverty in  half, create 4 million new jobs.   Most importantly, we will emerge from this crisis with an economy  that is stronger, more equitable, and poised for growth for years to  come.   Mr. Speaker, I thank all of my colleagues in the House and Senate who  made this possible. Let's get this done.                            ____________________
