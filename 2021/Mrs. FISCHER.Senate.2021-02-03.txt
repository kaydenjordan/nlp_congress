 Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to  recognize the 70th anniversary of KRVN, a longtime Nebraska radio  station.   KRVN was founded in 1951 to bring the news to Nebraska's rural  communities, and they have remained committed to that mission  throughout their existence.   From the very beginning, Nebraska's farmers and ranchers have  depended on their straightforward approach to the stories that matter  most, and their outstanding reporting continues to be a crucial part of  our agriculture industry's success.   As everyone who has listened to KRVN knows, they have achieved 70  years of success because they put their audience first. That is no  accident--KRVN is one of the only radio stations in the country that is  owned by a cooperative of farmers and ranchers.   As a cattle rancher myself, my family, friends, and neighbors have  listened to their daily livestock reports for decades, and I always  enjoy stopping by their studios when I am in Lexington, NE.   As a lifelong Nebraskan, I am immensely proud of all they have done  for our State.   I congratulate them on reaching this historic milestone. Here is to  70 more years.                            ____________________
