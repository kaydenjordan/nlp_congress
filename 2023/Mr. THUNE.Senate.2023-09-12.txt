 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, 3 weeks ago, President Biden officially  launched the second part of his student loan giveaway--his dramatic  overhaul of the REPAYE program, an income-driven repayment plan for  Federal student loans.   The President's revamp flew under the radar a bit when it was first  announced, overshadowed by his plan to forgive up to $10,000 of student  loan debt outright--or $20,000 for Pell grant recipients. But the truth  is that the President's new income-driven repayment plan, which he has  dubbed the Saving on a Valuable Education plan--or the SAVE plan--is  just as problematic, if not more, as the President's scheme to forgive  student debt outright because the new SAVE plan will create a system in  which the majority of future Federal borrowers will never fully repay  their student loans.   The nonpartisan Penn Wharton Budget Model estimates that just 24.6  percent of future borrowers will repay their loans in full--in other  words, less than a quarter of borrowers.   The Department of Education estimates that borrowers with only  undergraduate debt enrolled in the SAVE program can, on average, expect  to pay back just $6,121 for each $10,000 they borrow. That amount the  Federal Government is taking on, on average, is almost 40 percent of  the cost of these undergraduates' student loans.   Let's call this what it is: It is loan forgiveness by another name.  You don't have to take my word for it.   One scholar from the left-leaning Urban Institute had this to say on  NPR the other day:         I think it's going to be less obvious that it's a big loan       forgiveness program to both borrowers and onlookers as well.       But, yeah, it's a big loan forgiveness program. . . . So no       longer a safety net like it has been in the past for       undergraduates--this looks more like a broad-based subsidy       for undergraduate degrees through loan forgiveness.    That, from a scholar at the left-leaning Urban Institute. Let me  repeat that: ``a broad-based subsidy for undergraduate degrees through  loan forgiveness.''   Or, in other words, in the words of one scholar from the American  Enterprise Institute, ``a functional entitlement program'' whose costs,  he adds, ``will prove difficult to control.''   I don't need to tell anyone that the problems here are myriad. Just  think about it. For starters, someone is going to have to bear the cost  of all these unrepaid student loans. And that someone is the American  taxpayers, including taxpayers who worked hard to pay off the full  balance on their own student loans, without a handout from the Federal  Government, and taxpayers who worked their way through school to avoid  a heavy loan burden and parents who scrimped and saved to send their  children to college debt-free and individuals who covered the cost of  their education by enlisting in the military and risking their lives  for their country. And I could go on.   I am at a loss to understand why taxpayers, as a whole, should assume  a substantial part of the educational burden for individuals, who, if  they graduated from college, have greater long-term earning potential  than many of the Americans who will be helping to shoulder the burdens  for their debts.   And, of course, this program isn't just being offered to help  undergraduate debt. No. Graduate students, including those in  professional degree programs like medical school and law school, will  also be eligible for the so-called SAVE program.   And I don't need to tell anyone that the lifetime earning potential  of a doctor or a lawyer is usually pretty good. But leaving aside  questions of fairness, let's talk about the costs of this de facto new  entitlement program. Again, the Penn Wharton Budget Model estimates the  SAVE program will cost roughly half a trillion dollars over the next 10  years.   We have a national debt today of $32 trillion and a Federal budget  that has increased by 41 percent since 2019. Contrary to what President  Biden seems to believe, we can't afford to be constantly expanding  government programs. We simply don't have the money to be subsidizing  the college--and graduate--education of a group of people whose earning  potential will exceed the earning potential of a lot of the people  subsidizing their schooling.   Perhaps the worst thing about the President's new program is that we  will be spending all that money and doing nothing--nothing--to solve  the real problem, and that is the high cost of a college education.   President Biden's student loan giveaway provides actually zero-- exactly  [[Page S4362]]  zero--incentive for colleges to contain costs. In fact, there is reason  to fear that it could actually encourage colleges to raise their prices  or, at least, make them significantly less reluctant to do so.   And, of course, the President's proposal does nothing to discourage  students from borrowing substantial amounts of money to finance their  education. Indeed, there is a good chance students will increase their  borrowing as a result of the President's plan.   The President's ill-conceived student loan giveaway is a tremendous  disservice to taxpayers--and a terrible move for our economic health.   As I said, it does nothing to address the real problem, which is the  high cost of higher education, which is why last week, I joined Senator  Cassidy to introduce a resolution of disapproval to block the  President's plan. And I encourage Members of both parties to support  this resolution. Anyone who cares about actually addressing the cost of  higher education should oppose a program that not only fails to solve  the underlying problems but is actually likely to make things worse.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Texas (Mr. Cruz).
