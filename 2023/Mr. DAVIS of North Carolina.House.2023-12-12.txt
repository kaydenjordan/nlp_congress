 Mr. Speaker, I stand with the Eelam  Tamils in Sri Lanka.   Following the British departure in 1948, the unification of these  kingdoms under a Sinhalese-dominated Sri Lanka led to the  marginalization of the Tamil people.   This process disregarded the Tamils' right to self-determination.  State-sponsored discrimination and violence against Tamils sparked a  tragic 30-year ethnic conflict, resulting in the 2009 Tamil genocide.   Despite the United Nations Human Rights Council's efforts for  accountability, Sri Lanka, with China's support, withdrew in 2020,  further blocking justice for the Tamil community.   The recent arrest of Tamils for participating in peaceful events  under the Prevention of Terrorism Act are deeply troubling.   Therefore, I call upon my colleagues in Congress to recognize and  address the ongoing oppression of the Tamil people. We must support a  permanent solution that ensures stability and peace in this vital part  of the Indo-Pacific. We must honor our commitment to human rights, and  we must honor democracy.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the  retirement of an incredible human being and leader, Fred Yates, who  served as the mayor of Winfall, North Carolina, for more than 30 years.   He was the first African American to hold this position. His  leadership brought transformative projects, including a new town hall,  a sewer system, and public safety for the town residents.   I congratulate Mayor Yates on his well-deserved retirement and thank  him for his commitment to making eastern North Carolina better. His  impact will be felt for generations to come.                            ____________________
