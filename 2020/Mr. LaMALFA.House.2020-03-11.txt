 Madam Speaker, China considers the United States their  biggest threat in their search for global dominance. However, the truth  is that China's recent rise is being enabled by institutional and  individual investors in the United States, including Federal, State,  and public pension funds like the TSP and CalPERS in California.   A number of Chinese entities, which are receiving American  investments, are engaged in activities that violate U.S. law and hurt  our national security interests, especially our military, like China  Telecom's social credit score system and their repression of the  Uighurs, which the House voted to condemn earlier this year.   Our public pensions should not be allowed to become a new funding  vehicle for Communist China, which serves as a threat to current and  retired Federal and State employees who are unknowingly enabling their  aggression against U.S. interests.                            ____________________
