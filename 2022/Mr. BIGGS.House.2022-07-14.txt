 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Kelly for holding this Special  Order and I thank him for his leadership on  [[Page H6616]]  this incredibly important issue, particularly the heartbeat bill.   The heartbeat bill criminalizes an abortion that is performed after  knowingly determining that a fetus has a detectable heartbeat.   The Democrats have the most radical position on abortion. They have  zero regard for life. It is so radical that they want to shut down all  crisis pregnancy centers in America. These centers help pregnant  mothers in need and after the child is born.   Tomorrow, they plan to pass a piece of legislation that will strip  away every protection for children in the womb, the protection for  their mothers and healthcare providers.   It would allow abortion up until birth, and it could be used for sex  selection. If it is signed into law, we will become the most barbarous  country in the world with regard to abortion--more radical than even  China, North Korea, or Vietnam, which have no limitations.   Well, what do we have now?   We have States that could regulate this now, and they do. So it is a  lie to say that you don't have abortions in these States. Here is the  deal. Even in France they regulate it and it is prevented after 14  weeks; Germany after 12 weeks, Greece after 12 weeks, Hungary after 12  weeks, Ireland after 12 weeks, and it goes on and on in the EU.   The United States--if this bill passes tomorrow--will be the most  barbarous to unborn babies in the world. I hope and pray that doesn't  happen. It must not happen in a civilized country like the United  States, I pray it won't.
