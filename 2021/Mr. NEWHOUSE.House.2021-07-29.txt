 Madam Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Westerman for  partnering with the Western Caucus to try to bring some attention to  this really critical issue for our States out West and for all of our  communities. So thank you very much.   Water. It is perhaps our most vital resource in the American West,  and unfortunately all of our States and our communities know all too  well what the impacts are of severe drought and water shortages.                                time  1830    With over 90 percent of the West in a catastrophic drought, the Biden  administration and House Democrats have truly failed to act.   As chairman of the Congressional Western Caucus, I represent Members  whose districts, like my own, are literally running out of water, water  that is used to produce food to feed the world or to generate clean and  renewable energy, water used to nourish our lands and our environment,  water to cook and clean and to drink. We can no longer sit idly by as  this historic drought ravages our communities.   In April, the Biden administration announced the formation of an  interagency working group tasked with finding solutions to address the  drought that plagues the West. This working group, led by the  Departments of Interior and Agriculture, has yet to provide clear  objectives or produce any sort of plan.   Earlier this month, members of the Western Caucus and Republicans  from the House Natural Resources Committee sent a letter to the  administration calling on them to provide to us the solutions and the  ideas that they have for relief from the drought's impacts. As of this  date they have not delivered.   So as drought conditions become more common, we must find modern  solutions. For over 30 years--well before my election to Congress--as a  farmer in the Yakima Valley, as a State legislator, and as director of  the Department of Agriculture for the State of Washington, I have  worked in partnership with State, local, Tribal, and national leaders  to bring forth collaborative solutions that improve water storage and  delivery in my home State of Washington. I am proud of that work, but  we have much to do.   As we continue developing and deploying water conservation efforts,  certainly there is more work that needs to be done. We must find short- term as well as long-term solutions to address this issue that  threatens our economies  [[Page H4276]]  and our environment and truly our way of life.   Drought is not a partisan issue, and I urge the administration and my  colleagues, my Democratic colleagues from the other side of the aisle  to acknowledge the West's urgent needs and to work with us to provide  actual relief, not just talk to our communities who truly are  struggling.   I thank Mr. Westerman of the Natural Resources Committee for drawing  attention to this critical issue, for shedding some light on it, and,  hopefully, by educating more people as to the seriousness of this  critical issue we can truly make some progress in bringing some  solutions forward that will help people all through the Western United  States.
