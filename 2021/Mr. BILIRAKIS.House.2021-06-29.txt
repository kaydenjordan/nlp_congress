 Mr. Speaker, crime rates spike when you give in to  leftist demands and defund the police. It is as simple as that. Sadly,  we are seeing this play out in major cities across the country.   The New York Times reports a sample of 37 U.S. cities saw an 18  percent increase in murders in the first 3 months of this year when  compared to last.   Mr. Speaker, this rhetoric and policy is dangerous and, worst of all,  it is responsible for the dismantling and demoralization of police  departments across the country.   We have also seen the dramatic increase on a tax against law  enforcement this year. Tragically, two of my constituents are among  those who have recently been killed in the line of duty. We must have  law and order and support our heroes who place their lives on the line  to keep our communities safe.  [[Page H3250]]    In short, we must defend, not defund, the police.                            ____________________
