 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bipartisan  infrastructure package.   We have heard the stories of cracked roads, crumbling bridges,  flooded farm fields, even kids doing homework from fast food  restaurants so they can glom onto the internet access.   Sadly, this isn't the exception. It is the status quo, and it is time  to fix it.   In my corner of Illinois, 1 in 10 bridges is classified as  structurally deficient, 1 in 3 roads is rated in poor or mediocre  condition, and 1 in 4 households don't have internet access of any  kind.   Our communities deserve much better than this. Americans deserve much  better than this.   Now is the time to think boldly in this once-in-a-generation  investment in rebuilding America. Now is the time to create millions of  good-paying union jobs. Now is the time to lay the foundation for the  economic opportunity for years to come.   There is plenty of work left to do. But if we do it together, we can  get it done.                            ____________________
