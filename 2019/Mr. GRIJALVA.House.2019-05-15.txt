 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 375) to amend the Act of June 18, 1934, to reaffirm the  authority of the Secretary of the Interior to take land into trust for  Indian Tribes, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 375         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. AUTHORITY REAFFIRMED.         (a) Reaffirmation.--Section 19 of the Act of June 18, 1934       (commonly known as the ``Indian Reorganization Act''; 25       U.S.C. 5129), is amended--        (1) in the first sentence--        (A) by striking ``The term'' and inserting ``Effective       beginning on June 18, 1934, the term''; and        (B) by striking ``any recognized Indian tribe now under       Federal jurisdiction'' and inserting ``any federally       recognized Indian Tribe''; and        (2) by striking the third sentence and inserting the       following: ``In said sections, the term `Indian tribe' means       any Indian or Alaska Native tribe, band, nation, pueblo,       village, or community that the Secretary of the Interior       acknowledges to exist as an Indian tribe.''.        (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section       shall take effect as if included in the Act of June 18, 1934       (commonly known as the ``Indian Reorganization Act''; 25       U.S.C. 5129), on the date of the enactment of that Act.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, 10 years ago, the Supreme Court handed down what is  known as the Carcieri decision. In that decision, the Court determined  that trust land acquisition under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934  only applies to Tribes that were under Federal jurisdiction in 1934.   Mr. Speaker, up until 2009, the Department of the Interior, under  both Republican and Democratic administrations, had consistently  construed that the IRA authorizes the placement of land into trust for  any Tribe so long as the Tribe is federally recognized at the time of  the trust application.   The decision overturned 75 years of agency practice, both Democratic  and Republican administrations, and created a two-tiered system for  trust land acquisition. This also opened up the Tribes to frivolous  lawsuits on land  [[Page H3814]]  that they had held in trust for years, sometimes decades.   While this has been great for lawyers and their firms, it is  detrimental to the health of a Tribe. The money to defend these  lawsuits could, instead, be used to provide and improve the lives of  their members.   We have had to pass standalone bills for individual Tribes on a  piecemeal basis to protect their lands, and we should, since these  Tribal lands are under direct assault right now. We must also address  this going forward so that other Tribes do not find themselves in the  same dire straits.   Passage of H.R. 375 will restore clarity and stability for all  federally recognized Tribes by ensuring they are all treated equally,  regardless of date of recognition.   Let's not forget history and the decimation of Tribes and their  homeland by the hand of the Federal Government. It has taken almost a  century for us to even attempt to undo the damage we inflicted upon the  indigenous peoples of this Nation.   This work is not complete. We are still federally acknowledging  Tribes to this day. We are still striving to return merely a portion of  the land back to Tribes. To say that Tribes that were recognized after  1934 are somehow inferior to Tribes that were recognized by 1934 is  dangerously ignorant of history.   H.R. 375, introduced by Representative Cole of Oklahoma, is short,  simple, and to the point. It will amend the IRA to ensure that all  federally recognized Tribes are treated equally, regardless of their  date of recognition.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, we have one speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gallego), my colleague and chair of the  Subcommittee for Indigenous Peoples of the United States.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy).    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, when a Tribe applies to have land taken  into trust through the Department of the Interior, local concerns are  already strongly considered, even more so when the land is located away  from existing reservation lands.   However, I do recognize there is a desire from some Members on both  sides of the aisle to work on stand-alone legislation that would codify  some of the process.   I agree with the gentleman's statement about veto abilities. Any  provision which would give counties or local governments veto power  over trust land decisions is, frankly, a nonstarter. Local input is  vital to these decisions and should be taken into account. However,  Tribal consultation is solely the responsibility of the Federal  Government, as is any final decision on transferring land into trust.   And I think because of the national implications of the question of  trust land and the role that communities, i.e., counties and  municipalities, would play, I think there is a need to somehow  accommodate a level of Tribal consultation, because they are going to  be the most affected party by any decision that is made.   With that said, I do commit, Mr. Speaker, to looking at any proposal  on the issue and to work moving forward if it is to the betterment of  all the stakeholders and I would assist the legislation in its final  passage.    Mr. Speaker, for 10 years, the Carcieri decision has  caused anxiety and confusion in Indian Country, creating dangerous  legal ambiguities related to Indian trust lands.   Today, we can finally end all that. We can remove the ambiguity and  uncertainty, and finally offer Tribal nations peace of mind that their  lands are protected.   Mr. Speaker, I urge swift passage of H.R. 375, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 377, I call  up the bill (H.R. 312) to reaffirm the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe  reservation, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 312.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 312, the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe Reservation  Reaffirmation Act, will reaffirm the trust status of Mashpee's Tribal  land and protect the Tribe from further attacks on its land and its  sovereignty.   The Mashpee relationship with the Federal Government is one of the  oldest in the United States. In fact, their ancestors are the ones who  welcomed the pilgrims who landed at Plymouth Rock, as well as the  people who aided those pilgrims through hard times in 1621, in what we  now refer to as the ``First Thanksgiving.''   Like many Tribes, the Mashpee were intentionally and systematically  rendered landless, through no fault of their own. They fought long and  hard over the years to reestablish both their Tribe and their land  base.   The Tribe first petitioned the Federal Government for recognition in  1978. Finally, after 30 years, the Bush administration extended formal  recognition to the Tribe in 2007. However, they still remained  landless.   This was remedied in 2015, when the Department of the Interior took  approximately 320 acres into trust to serve as the Tribe's reservation  lands. The two parcels that compose the 320 acres are both within the  Tribe's historic and ancestral homelands.   The Tribe constructed a government center on the land, which includes  their schools, courtrooms and multipurpose room, as well as a medical  clinic facility. And they broke ground on a gaming facility that would  eventually bring in much-needed revenue for Tribal operations and  programs.   However, in 2016, a group of Taunton residents, backed by an out-of- state commercial gaming company, filed a Carcieri suit in federal court  to challenge the Department of the Interior's action.   Initially, the executive branch defended the decision to create the  Mashpee reservation. However, in May 2017, the Department of Justice,  under the Trump administration, inexplicably withdrew from the  litigation and is no longer defending the status of the Tribe's land.   Then, in September 2018, the Department of the Interior issued its  first Carcieri decision in which it refused to reaffirm its own  authority to confirm the status of the Tribe's lands into trust. The  effect of this decision cannot be overstated. For the first time in  this century, a Tribe was stripped of its sovereign rights to its land.  It would mark the first time since the dark days of the termination era  that the United States acted to disestablish an Indian reservation and  render a Tribe landless.   These attacks on the reservation and on the Tribe's very status have  been devastating. The legal uncertainty that has been imposed by these  events is forcing the Tribe to borrow thousands of dollars every day  just to keep its government running, resulting in devastating cuts to  essential services, and massive layoffs of Tribal members.   This is completely unacceptable. We cannot idly stand by as Tribal  people are once again harmed by yet another action by the Federal  Government. Let's be honest, the Federal Government has done a terrible  job of living up to its moral and legal obligations to Indian Country.   Housing, education, healthcare, and basic needs often go unmet in  Tribal lands. These are not extras or handouts to Tribal people. It is  part of a trust responsibility, enshrined in numerous treaties, court  rulings, and laws.   But the needs still need to be met, despite the Federal Government's  failings. So how do Tribes attempt to make up for that shortfall? By  utilizing their land for economic development, including gaming.   Economic development on Tribal lands is vital to the prosperity of a  Tribe and the ultimate goal of self-determination and self-reliance. We  have seen it numerous times across the Nation: Tribes using those  dollars to fund their programs, construct housing and health clinics,  and take care of the needs of their people.   The Mashpee Tribe should not be hindered from economic development on  their land solely because the State of Rhode Island wants to protect  its own State-run gaming interest.   H.R. 312 is widely supported in Indian Country, with letters of  support from over 50 individual Tribes and pan-Tribal organizations.   Additionally, the bill has strong support, including from the cities  of Taunton and Mashpee, the Chambers of Commerce of both cities, the  State of Massachusetts, numerous Members of the Massachusetts State  House and State Senate, the Mayflower Society, and many local  businesses and business leaders.   Passage of H.R. 312 will protect the Mashpee Tribe's reservation  lands and make clear that the Tribe is entitled to be treated the same  way as other federally recognized Tribes.   Mr. Speaker, I urge its adoption, and I reserve the balance of my  time.                                time  1430     Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Keating), the sponsor of the  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  to address a point that was brought up during the debate on this bill,  that the Mashpee Tribe will not lose its Federal recognition if H.R.  312 does not pass. That is true. We have never stated the Federal  recognition was in jeopardy.   What we are talking about, which is fundamental to the survival of  the Tribe, is destroying a Tribe's sovereign government. That is really  what is at stake.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), another sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Keating).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Kansas (Ms. Davids).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Upholding the establishment of Tribal homelands should be, and is,  one of the most important actions that this Congress can take. It is  not just about tax-exempt status or economic development, both of which  are vitally important to Tribal communities.   It is also about the construction of schools, housing, clinics, elder  care facilities, things that are extremely vital to the quality of life  and well-being of Tribal members.   It is also about recognizing a Tribe's historical, cultural, and  spiritual connection.   It is not about protecting a market share. It is not about the tweets  from the President. It is not about the scare tactics and hysteria of  off-reservation gaming that is constantly used in trying to fight the  self-determination and the ability of Tribes to take care of  themselves.   And it is about identity.   I want to just follow up on the gentlewoman from Kansas' comment. To  ensure Tribal sovereignty and self-governance, land is critical to the  connection of people to their land. And the real-world decisions that  we are making have real consequences.   To strip people of their land is to strip them of their identity, to  strip them of their self-governance and their self-determination. It is  a sad state that, nearly 400 years later, the Mashpee still have to  fight for land that is rightfully theirs.   But we can remedy that today.   I want to thank our colleagues Mr. Keating and Mr. Kennedy, as well  as the entire Massachusetts delegation, for spearheading this effort to  save the Mashpee's land, preserve their way of life, and reestablish  and not allow a precedent to stand where trust land that was given is  taken away.   This is an important piece of legislation with implications across  Indian Country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the swift adoption of H.R. 312, and I yield back  the remainder of my time.
