 Madam Speaker, I rise today to address the  devastating impacts on American lives and business because of Biden's  lack of preparedness in handling COVID-19.   The disruptive testing shortages and record-breaking number of cases  are a direct result of Biden's failed leadership.   In the spring, the administration ignored a request from a health  agency to purchase millions of rapid tests and then rejected a proposal  for free rapid tests for the holidays back in October.   To solve this self-inflicted shortage, this administration's new plan  will require private insurers to cover the cost of tests instead of  using the nearly half a trillion dollars from the COVID relief bill  passed last March.   Madam Speaker, Biden has failed to deliver on his promises to the  American people. He said he would shut down COVID-19 and that all  Americans would have access to regular, reliable, and free testing.  Sadly, that couldn't be further from the truth.                            ____________________
