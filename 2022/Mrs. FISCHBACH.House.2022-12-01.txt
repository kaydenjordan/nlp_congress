 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of a  staple in Minnesota's farm community, Frank Schiefelbein. Frank passed  away earlier this week on his beloved farm.   Frank, better known as ``Big Frank,'' led a life centered around  faith, family,  [[Page H8679]]  farming, friends, and food. He started his Angus herd, now the largest  in the State, in the late 1950s with the mission of making the perfect  steak.   He met his wife, Frosty, when he was only 16 years old. Through their  69 years of marriage, they raised 9 sons and have 32 grandchildren and  31 great-grandchildren to carry on his legacy.   He truly left an impression on everyone he met, and he will be  greatly missed by everyone.                            ____________________
