 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate confirmed David  Tapp of Kentucky to serve on the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. Today,  we will turn to more of President Trump's impressive nominees for the  Federal Judiciary.   Last week, Senate Republicans had hoped to proceed to the urgent  priority of funding our national defense, but for the second time in 2  months, Senate Democrats filibustered defense funding. They blocked the  Senate from funding our Armed Forces.   Over the summer, the Speaker of the House and my colleague the  Democratic leader both signed onto a bipartisan, bicameral budget deal  that Democrats hammered out with President Trump's team in order to  avoid  [[Page S6412]]  exactly--exactly--the kind of partisan stalemate that we are now  experiencing and avoid a 12-bill omnibus. The agreement laid out  specific top-line numbers and ruled out poison pills--the agreement we  all reached just a couple of months ago.   With respect to Presidential transfer authorities, the agreement that  we all agreed to 2 months ago specifically stated that ``current  transfer funding levels and authorities shall be maintained.'' The  President's transfers authorities as they relate to border funding, or  anything else, were to remain exactly as they existed in current law.  This is the deal we signed off on just 2 months ago. The deal just  simply preserves the status quo that was established by bipartisan  legislation last fiscal year. The same transfer authorities, by the  way, would also be preserved if Democrats tank the appropriations  process and we end up with a continuing resolution. That was the deal.  Democrats were onboard. I entered the terms into the Congressional  Record and both the Speaker and the Senate Democratic leader posted the  terms of the deal in their press release, but now our Democratic  counterparts have gone back on their word.   Contrary to the agreement, Democrats are now insisting on poison  pills and, thus, blocking the resources and certainty our men and women  in uniform need.   While Senate Democrats block defense funding, House Democrats  continue to hold up USMCA and the 176,000 new American jobs it would  create. All their time and energy seems to go to House Democrats' 3- year-old impeachment journey and the unfair, precedent-breaking process  by which the House has conducted its inquiry so far.   Last week, House Democrats passed their first votes on impeachment  and codified their irregular process. They passed a resolution that  fails--fails--to provide President Trump the same rights and due  process that past Presidents of both parties have received.   Here is what the Democrats' resolution effectively says: No due  process now, maybe some later, but only if we feel like it. I repeat:  No due process now, maybe some later, but only if we feel like it.   Well, while we wait for our Democratic counterparts to come back to  the table and allow this body to complete urgent bipartisan  legislation, we are going to continue confirming more of President  Trump's impressive nominees and giving the American people the  government they actually voted for.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, on another matter, I have come to  the floor frequently in recent months to warn about dangerous anti- speech, anti-First Amendment headwinds blowing out of Washington, DC. I  have warned about proposals from our Democratic colleagues that seemed  tailor-made to chill the free exchange of ideas and make it more  difficult for Americans to engage in political speech.   Just a few days ago, on October 23, I explained how the threat of  heavy regulatory burden has already ``frightened media platforms into  rejecting political ads altogether. It's a textbook example of policy  designed to reduce the amount of free speech in this country.''   Then, 7 days later, here is what happened. Twitter announced that  their platform will ban all political ads. The online platform is  banning advertisements for candidates for office and political  campaigns.   What is more, they say they are also banning issue ads, which do not  even reference a specific campaign but merely seek to give one  perspective on a subject.   Twitter's leadership has tried to produce a rationale for banishing  paid political speech. The argument boils down to the same  misunderstandings that have been used to undermine free speech for  decades.   Here is what Twitter's CEO said: ``We believe political message reach  should be earned, not bought.'' This kind of surface-level argument may  sound good at first, but it quickly gives way to an arbitrary process  of picking winners and losers in the competition of ideas. Here is what  I mean: Twitter's new rules would seem to forbid either a small liberal  nonprofit or a small conservative nonprofit from putting money behind  an issue ad to amplify their perspective. But what about the press?  Will media corporations large and small remain free to buy paid  advertising to promote editorials and opinion writers? Will cable news  networks and national newspapers remain free to advertise their  political speech?   It would seem that Twitter will either have to ban opinion  journalists and the press from advertising their own work or else  create an enormous double standard that would just amplify the already  privileged speakers who already possess multimillion-dollar platforms.  It would just help clear the field for those elites by denying the same  tools to fledgling speakers who are not already famous.   Consider this: Back in July, the CEO of Twitter praised two  Democratic Presidential candidates in a Twitter post of his own. This  gentleman has 4.3 million followers. It seems fair to conclude that  these subscribers have not followed him solely due to the standalone  merits of his commentary but in part because they are interested to  hear from a powerful person who runs a hugely influential company. And,  of course, Twitter has worked hard and spent money for years to grow  its business and make itself famous--efforts that have raised the  profile of its CEO. There is nothing wrong with that, but it  illustrates the impossibility of any top-down standard to determine who  has earned an audience.   How many millions of dollars go into publicity campaigns for  Hollywood actors or musicians or media personalities? How many millions  of dollars in advertising and corporate strategy have made CNN, FOX,  MSNBC, and the New York Times into what they are today? When these  people and these institutions speak out on politics, are they using  megaphones they have earned or megaphones that have been bought?  Obviously, such distinctions are impossible to draw. This is exactly  why the act of free speech is not separate from the resources that make  speech possible. Let me say that again. This is exactly why the act of  free speech is not separate from the resources that make speech  possible.   Twitter's announced policy would not level the playing field. It  would only reinforce echo chambers. It would prevent a local candidate  on a shoestring budget from using a small amount of money to promote a  tweet so more of his neighbors can learn about his campaign. It would  seemingly reserve a special privilege for major media corporations,  while denying nonprofits the same opportunity. Such a policy would not  bolster our democracy. It would degrade democracy. It would amplify the  advantage of media companies, celebrities, and certain other  established elites, while denying an important tool to the Americans  who disagree with them.   My personal view is that the American people do not need elites to  predetermine which political speakers are legitimate and which are not.  I believe that holds true whether the elites live in Washington or  Silicon Valley or anywhere else.   Obviously Twitter can set whatever policy it wants. It is a private  sector company. But companies respond to incentives. It is easy to see  the influence of Washington and leading Democrats behind this  announcement--pretty easy. My Democratic colleagues have threatened to  impose huge regulatory liability on platforms that run political ads.  And now a prominent platform has preemptively decided that allowing  certain kinds of political speech is more trouble than it is worth. It  does not serve our democracy for Democratic leaders to chill or  suppress the free exchange of ideas through Federal policy. It does not  serve our democracy for private sector leaders to take away a crucial  tool that helps less prominent speakers make their case to the American  people.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk that is due a second reading.    Mr. President, in order to place the bill on the  calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to further  proceedings.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
