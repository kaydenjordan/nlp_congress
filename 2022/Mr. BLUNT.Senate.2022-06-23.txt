 Madam President, before I get to my topic today, I would  like to say that when Senator Sullivan first came to the Senate, I  hadn't been here very long, either, and this was my presiding time  every week. I loved the Alaskan of the Week. I don't think they are  ever going to run out of Alaskans of the Week as long as Senator  Sullivan is here. So I was right back in that chair, where you are,  thinking of the many times I heard Senator Sullivan do the presentation  on the Alaskan of the Week and how much I enjoyed it.                                   S. 2938    Madam President, I would say the topic today is tragic in so many  ways but, I think, moving forward in others.  [[Page S3121]]  Last month, 19 kids were killed in their own school rooms and 2  teachers were killed in Uvalde, TX. It was a horrific act, an agonizing  thing for family, an agonizing thing for community, and I think, along  with the Buffalo, NY, event, an agonizing thing for our country.   One thing that almost all these mass shootings have in common is a  perpetrator who had a mental health issue that wasn't dealt with  properly.   Let me say before Senator Stabenow and I talk any more about mental  health--and I believe I will repeat this again--be sure we know what we  are talking about here. People with mental health conditions are not  dangerous. Mental health is a health issue, and we ought to treat it as  a health issue, but in rare and tragic occasions, people with a mental  health issue not dealt with can become dangerous, and that is what we  have seen in this and other similar circumstances.   So one of the responses is always, Well, we need to have a better  mental health delivery system. That is true, but we should realize  that, according to the National Institutes of Health, for at least a  decade now, they have estimated that at least one in five Americans has  a diagnosable and almost always treatable mental health or behavioral  health issue. Frankly, the pandemic made that even greater.   A June 2020 survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  found that 41 percent of adults in the United States said they had had  at least one symptom of a mental health condition in a recent time, and  11 percent said they had seriously considered suicide in the previous  month. Now, those are extraordinary numbers, but even if half of those  numbers were correct, you see the size of the problem we have and the  importance of dealing with that problem.   Of course, we had even more alarming numbers with children and young  adults during that. The lockdowns, months of virtual learning, time  away from their friends, I would argue too much time on screens--the  effect of the pandemic on close family members had a staggering toll on  the country.   Children's hospitals saw mental health emergencies among 5- to 17- year-olds increase by 14 percent in the first half of 2021 compared to  2019 and a 45-percent increase in self-injury and suicide for children  in that age group. Pediatric hospital needs and pediatric mental health  care needs are greater than they have ever been.   We need to be sure that everyone who has a mental health crisis or  has an ongoing mental health problem has the help they need when they  need it. The bipartisan legislation we are debating today expands  access to high-quality mental health and behavioral health through what  Senator Stabenow and I will point out we believe to be a truly proven  model of community-based care: the Excellence in Mental Health Program,  a program that we brought to the floor in 2013 and then got passed and  signed into law in 2014.   At the time, Senator Stabenow mentioned that bill marked the most  significant expansion of community mental health and addiction services  in decades.   When we pass this bill, it will be even more dramatic in its long- term impact. And we have worked on these issues together with pilot  States. We worked on these issues together that brought projects in  individual States that weren't part of that eight-State original and,  eventually, nine-State pilot.   And so today we are able to come with 5 years of history in this  program, a reimbursement model that matters, and results that we think  make a big difference. And I am glad to be here with my good friend  from Michigan. And we are going to kind of do this together for the  next few minutes, talk about what can happen because of a critical  piece of this community safety bill that is in so many ways a mental  health and mental health delivery bill that we are going to see  expanded in the country in unique ways.   Senator Stabenow, I would like to turn to her for a few minutes to  talk about this, and then I have got some things to say, too.    Yes. I think the point you are making here, too, are that  these are--we now have 5 years of evidence in several States, multiple  years in other States. So this isn't just assuming what will happen but  looking at what we have carefully tried to keep track of, of what does  happen. And as you pointed out, that de facto mental health system,  mental health delivery system of the emergency rooms and police--nobody  was well-served by that. Certainly, the police weren't well-served. The  emergency rooms weren't well-served. And people had many mental health  challenges that weren't served by that as well. And seeing those  numbers go down dramatically of people having to go to the emergency  room for mental health services or being kept in jail overnight or  longer than overnight for mental health services, nobody benefits from  that system.   And so we are seeing real numbers where the people who work at the  emergency room, the people who are in the police department are among  the biggest supporters of this system when it gets in place. Also, the  whole idea of crisis intervention, there are opportunities in this law  for that to happen.   In any of the new structures, whether that is drug court or veterans  court or other places you would go to try to be sure somebody is  getting the help they need when they need it, there also would be due  process involved in anything added; that we use this bill to add to the  system due process where people have a right.   If there is an emergency moment, obviously, you have to deal with  that as an emergency moment. But people then have a right to have their  day in court as well, if they are not part of that crisis intervention  moment of seeing that happen. And so that is important.    But in Missouri, 150,000 people are now part of this excellence in  mental health effort. That is about a 40-percent increase on what some  of the same facilities were doing before, but now, they do it with more  certainty that they are going to get their cost reimbursed. They do it  with the right kind of staff, and 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, 7  days a week, they have to be available. And the new States that enter  the program will go through that same type of competition to be among  the 10 States every 2 years that could enter the program and get us to  all 50 States in that program and have the kind of staff they need, the  kind of accessibility they need.   I think, originally in our bill, which was 8 years ago now--2014--24  States applied to be one of the first 8 States in the pilot program; 19  of them went through the whole process, and 8 States were selected. But  in the other States, there are now 30 States that have big units that  were able to qualify as individual demonstration grant units to show  what they could do. And we really, I think, both believe that those  units in those States will become both the models and the incentive to  bring the whole State into that program now that that is possible and  seeing what we are seeing with results and also results on the  nonmental health side.   One of the unique things I think that this pilot did was--part of the  pilot was to see what happens with the other healthcare issues that  people have who have mental health concerns. And what has happened is  that they have seen those costs go dramatically down. If you have a  behavioral health problem that is being dealt with, you are much more  likely to show up to your doctor's appointment. You are much more  likely to show up to dialysis. You are much more likely to take the  medicine that has been prescribed, whether it was for your mental  health situation--and occasionally, that is the best way to deal with  mental health--or your other health situations. And so those costs go  down.   And even in the immediate healthcare space, we are seeing that States  believe they are saving money in the immediate space of healthcare.  There has never been any question that in the long run you would save  money if you treat mental health like you treat all other health. There  has never been any question, whether it is the prison system or law  enforcement or your personal income capacity, that all those were good  things to do.   I think what we have shown in these early States is that even in the  immediate healthcare space, you save as much money or virtually as much  money or even more money on the other health costs for the one in five  adult Americans--and now big numbers among the younger Americans who  have a mental health problem--you save as much space for their other  health problems, and one in five adult Americans are going to have a  lot of other health problems. It is a pretty big segment of our  society.   And I think, Senator Stabenow, seeing what happened there has also  been persuasive to States as they are beginning to think about making  this part of their permanent program when these pilot projects are  over.    Just one final thought, we want to be sure that we are  encouraging people to get the healthcare they need. You know, if this  system works like it should work, you really never know what you are  doing in terms of how you have changed people's lives in the future or  the lives of people they might impact.   We don't want to create any stigma here that a resilient, broad-based  mental health system that is part of this bill means that you should be  hesitant to seek mental health help. You know, if you have a mental  health problem, you are more likely to be the victim of a crime than  you are the perpetrator of a crime.   But if those problems get out of control--often suicidal thoughts  first before you have homicidal thoughts--but if this system works the  way it should, who knows what good you have done by just letting people  go through their normal lives as contributing citizens with treating  their mental health and talking about their mental health.   As Senator Stabenow said, being able to talk about somebody in your  family that has a mental health challenge as readily as you talk about  somebody in your family that has a cancer challenge or a dialysis trip  that they have to make multiple times a week to go somewhere or  medicine that they take for something else and talking about this in  the context of the good it does in making our society safer should, in  no way, be interpreted to mean that people with a mental health concern  are unsafe.   But if you don't deal with that problem in the right way at the right  time, it has the potential to be unsafe. Most of these shootings we  have seen, the shooter goes into that shooting clearly anticipating  that they will not come out of that shooting alive either. So it is  suicide; it is homicide; it is things that if you dealt with that  problem a decade earlier--and maybe in some cases, the specific problem  even a week earlier--but if you dealt with it a decade earlier, as  people began to see that, you know, We need to get you some help.   Just like if your hearing is going bad or your eyesight is going bad,  people say, ``Let's get an appointment and go see what we need to do,''  and anybody can be seen at these certified community behavioral health  centers. Anybody can be seen if you are covered by--it is very much  based on the federally qualified health center model. If you have  insurance that covers this, you can go there. If you have a government  program that covers it, you can go there. If you need to pay cash, you  can go there on a very affordable sliding scale. But people are seen,  and nobody--in our State, at least, and I think this would be the case  in all nine of the pilot States--nobody who needs to be seen that day  is not seen that day. Nobody who needs to be seen that day is not seen  that day.   And nobody who needs to be seen isn't seen pretty quickly as you have  time to schedule that appointment. It changes people's lives; it  changes communities; it changes the way we talk about mental health.   As Senator Stabenow said on the floor, the last 50 years after  President Kennedy signed his last bill into law--now, here we are,  almost 60 years after that bill was signed into law taking what would  be, so far, the biggest step toward accomplishing what that Community  Mental Health Act envisioned.   And Senator Stabenow, I will turn to her for any final comments.
