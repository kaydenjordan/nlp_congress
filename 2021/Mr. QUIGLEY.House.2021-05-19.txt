 Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss what we must do  to prevent the next pandemic and why it is not only a global health  issue, but also an environmental one.   The origins of the pandemic we are battling now are clear:  unsanitary, unsafe wildlife markets.   These markets, which are prevalent in some areas of Asia and Africa,  but are present everywhere, including in the United States, are fed by  trade in wildlife; some of it legal; some of it illegal; all of it very  dangerous.   They are breeding grounds for a strain of viruses known as zoonotics,  which are diseases born from the unnatural intermingling of the bodily  fluids of different species in an unsafe and unsanitary market that  sold wildlife, living and dead, for human consumption.   Other zoonotics include SARS, MERS, Zika, Ebola, swine flu, bird flu,  HIV/AIDS, and now COVID. COVID-19 has truly opened the world's eyes to  the danger of these markets and the global impact, and it should open  our eyes to just how urgent the need for legislation around this is in  order to prevent the loss of millions of lives.   That is why over the course of the last year I wrote the Preventing  Future Pandemics Act along with my friend, Mr. Fred Upton, and Senators  Cory Booker and John Cornyn in the Senate. We may not agree on much,  but we agree on this: We have the power to prevent the next pandemic,  and to do nothing would be an act of negligence.   A vital lesson that we need to learn from COVID is that we must  fundamentally change the way that we interact with wildlife globally if  we want to stop this from happening again. This means stopping  deforestation and other habitat destruction, slowing and ending global  climate change, and global shutdown of live wildlife markets.   Already we have seen how changes in temperature and weather patterns  and encroaching human development have brought people and wildlife into  more frequent and more intimate contact. Human consumption of wildlife  is simply the most dangerous form of that contact.   To get at the root of this problem, the Preventing Future Pandemics  Act would establish the official foreign policy of the U.S. to be that  we would work with other countries to shut down these markets, end the  trade in terrestrial wildlife for human consumption, and build  international coalitions to reduce the demand for wildlife as food.   The bill would authorize funding for USAID to work on reducing demand  for consumption of wildlife from wildlife markets, and support shifts  to alternate sources of food and protein in communities that rely upon  this consumption for food security.   Moreover, to truly lead by example, this bill would end the import  and export of wildlife for human consumption in and out of the United  States.   While wildlife is not a major source of protein in our country, these  markets do exist here, and they still pose a danger. If we are to  establish and maintain a position of international leadership on this  issue, we must practice what we preach.   This bill will help us take significant steps to break down the silos  between global health and conservation, because we know unequivocally  that if we try to treat these as separate problems, we fail to solve  either problem.   After the economic and social devastation of the past year, and the  way that COVID-19 has upended all of our lives, it is my view that the  Preventing Future Pandemics Act is a national security bill, a  conservation bill, an animal wildlife bill, a small business bill, a  travel industry bill, a manufacturing bill, a retail bill, a mental  health bill, a housing bill, and a public transit bill. It is a bill to  protect our lives and livelihoods from the threat of human consumption  of wildlife and the associated wildlife trade.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to rally around this  in order to potentially save the world from suffering the consequences  of inaction and standing by hopelessly as we watch another pandemic  ravage our world.   The next pandemic can be stopped, and the Preventing Future Pandemics  Act is a vital first step. Let's do it together.                            ____________________
