 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 1:30 p.m. on  Thursday, March 1, 2018.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  when the House adjourns on Thursday, March 1, 2018, it adjourn to meet  on Monday, March 5, 2018, when it shall convene at noon for morning- hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business.    Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on  Rules, I call up House Resolution 748 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 748         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 1865) to amend the Communications Act of 1934       to clarify that section 230 of such Act does not prohibit the       enforcement against providers and users of interactive       computer services of Federal and State criminal and civil law       relating to sexual exploitation of children or sex       trafficking, and for other purposes. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. It shall be in order to consider as an       original bill for the purpose of amendment under the five-      minute rule the amendment in the nature of a substitute       recommended by the Committee on the Judiciary now printed in       the bill. The committee amendment in the nature of a       substitute shall be considered as read. All points of order       against the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute       are waived. No amendment to the committee amendment in the       nature of a substitute shall be in order except those printed       in the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution. Each such amendment may be offered only in the       order printed in the report, may be offered only by a Member       designated in the report, shall be considered as read, shall       be debatable for the time specified in the report equally       divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent,       shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject       to a demand for division of the question in the House or in       the Committee of the Whole. All points of order against such       amendments are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. Any Member may demand a separate vote in the House       on any amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the       bill or to the committee amendment in the nature of a       substitute. The previous question shall be considered as       ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage       without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with       or without instructions.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only,  I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Slaughter), my friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on House Resolution 748,  currently under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring forward  this rule on behalf of the Rules Committee.   The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 1865, the Allow States  and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017. The rule  provides for 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the  chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. The rule also  provides for a motion to recommit.   In addition to an amendment offered by the chairman of the Judiciary  Committee, the rule makes in order amendments offered by Mrs. Mimi  Walters of California and Ms. Jackson Lee of Texas.   Yesterday, the Rules Committee received testimony from numerous  Members, including Mr. Marino, Ms. Jackson Lee, and the legislation's  sponsor, Mrs. Wagner.   In addition to consideration at the Rules Committee, the legislation  was marked up at the House Judiciary Committee last year.   Mr. Speaker, I cannot think of any crime more debased than when one  person forces a fellow human being into sexual slavery.   Through many pieces of legislation that the House considered this  year, we have been fighting to rid our communities of sex traffickers  and the anguish they leave in their wake. Today, we have the  opportunity to pass an important piece of legislation that will further  this fight by ensuring that we hold websites that turn a profit by  aiding sex traffickers accountable.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the committee for its hard work on  this legislation, but also, more, importantly, I would like to thank  the legislation's author, Mrs. Wagner, for her tireless efforts in  championing this bill, which extends both compassion and justice to  trafficking victims. As a result of her efforts, the legislation we  consider today will empower law enforcement, State attorneys general,  and, most importantly, victims to fight against the sex trade and its  predators.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation would give Federal, State, and local  prosecutors the tools they need to hold websites and their operators  accountable for supporting the sale of sex trafficking victims.  Specifically, it would create a new Federal statute with increased  penalties for promoting sex trafficking online and would amend section  230 of the Communications Decency Act to permit State authorities to  prosecute operators of trafficking websites for criminal acts.   In consideration of this legislation, we must also reflect on why  this legislation is necessary.   Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act was created to ensure  that websites would not be considered the publishers of, and thereby  held responsible for, the content that actually originated with a third  party. The statute was never intended to shield websites that profit by  creating a marketplace for sexual slavery, like Backpage.com, from  facing the legal consequences of their criminal enterprises.   Nevertheless, some websites have successfully invoked the section 230  immunity provision despite engaging in actions that venture far outside  the scope of those envisioned by the statute. The authors of the  Communications Decency Act did not imagine that wicked men and women  would turn vulnerable young people into sexual commodities and then  say, ``Let's protect those predators.''   Mr. Speaker, no law condones such sexual exploitation, and no law  should be manipulated to condone such abuse. With the addition of Mrs.  Walters' amendment, this legislation strikes the important balance of  preserving section 230 of the Communications Decency Act for law- abiding websites, while ensuring that bad actors can no longer hide  behind a misused statute.   This legislation will ensure that our society continues to protect  the innocent and punish those who seek to profit from their sexual  enslavement.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H1278]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), the sponsor of  this legislation and a tireless advocate for this issue.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and  I am prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Judiciary Committee, I am proud to  support H.R. 1865, the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex  Trafficking Act of 2017.   This legislation will prevent websites like Backpage from hiding  behind section 230 of the Communications Decency Act while  simultaneously empowering law enforcement, State attorneys general, and  victims to fight against the sex trade and its predators. I look  forward to supporting this rule and the underlying bill.   The material previously referred to by Ms. Slaughter is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 748 Offered by Ms. Slaughter         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       3440) to authorize the cancellation of removal and adjustment       of status of certain individuals who are long-term United       States residents and who entered the United States as       children and for other purposes. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 3440.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution. . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.
