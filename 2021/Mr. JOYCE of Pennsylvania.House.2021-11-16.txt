 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Thomas family of Meyersdale, Pennsylvania, who tragically lost their  son, Trevor, a student athlete who played baseball at Allegany College  of Maryland and at Penn State.   In the face of that loss, the Thomas family has responded with love  and compassion for their community. In honor of their son's commitment  to serving others, the Thomas family printed small cards that  encouraged their neighbors to help others through acts of kindness.   Those cards have inspired incredible gestures of generosity in our  community. The acts of kindness were wide-ranging. From preparing care  packages for the homeless to donating blood to handing out doughnuts  and even delivering flowers to strangers, members of the community  looked to see what they could do to help one another.   Together, the people of Somerset County are working to keep Trevor's  memory alive through their acts of service for one another.   On each card that the family has distributed is a simple mantra that  defined the way that Trevor lived his life. It is a mantra that we  should all aspire to: Be somebody who makes everybody feel like  somebody.                            ____________________
