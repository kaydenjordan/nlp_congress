 Mr. Speaker, I ask that President Trump rescind his  refugee ban on children like the 12-year-old Yemeni girl, Eman Ali, who  was not allowed to board a plane to join her U.S. parents, leaving her  in limbo.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman's time has expired.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.
