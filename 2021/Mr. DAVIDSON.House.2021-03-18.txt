 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill.   It purports to solve an important problem for our country's ag  workforce, for our ag community, and for food security for our country,  but it exploits a bigger problem and a real emergency by creating a  gaping hole in our broken immigration system. Rather than address the  root issue with our immigration laws, it exploits them.   Frankly, I don't know how many noncitizens some of my colleagues  represent. I came here to represent American citizens. This bill  disadvantages American citizens, and it disadvantages people who follow  our admittedly broken immigration laws and come here legally, and it  rewards people who come here illegally.   It is going to exacerbate the humanitarian crisis we see at the  border instead of cure it. It is not a remedy; it is a harm. It is a  harm to American citizenship, which should be treasured. We do welcome  new Americans. We are unequaled in the world. No country welcomes more  new citizens per year than the United States of America.   We will continue to be the land of opportunity, but we can only do  that if we protect the cherished value of American citizenship.  Citizenship matters. We cannot destroy it by adopting these policies. I  plead that people oppose it.
