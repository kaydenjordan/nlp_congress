 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business for 30 seconds.    Madam President, last week, I held a hearing on foreign  threats to taxpayer-funded research, and a classified briefing was held  on the very same subject. We learned a great deal of information  regarding the very real and ongoing threat from foreign governments to  U.S. research.   Congress must continue its oversight to ensure that the Federal  Government has the right mix of authorities as well as focus to protect  our research and intellectual property. The government spends billions  and billions of dollars a year on research. Congress and the executive  branch have a responsibility to the taxpayers to get the job done.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, for nearly 2 years Special Counsel  Mueller's investigation captivated Washington. Most of the media  reporting focused on speculation and false allegations of a criminal  conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. This reporting  was fueled by critics eager to all but guarantee the President's guilt.  After a very exhaustive investigation--and, of course, millions and  millions of taxpayer dollars being spent by the Mueller investigation-- many of those same critics still can't accept that Mueller and his  investigative team of Democratic donors found no collusion or crime.   The continuing political noise over the last 2 years, however, risks  drowning out critical siren warnings of another real threat--self- interested and surreptitious foreign influence in our political  discourse. Mueller's team indicted dozens of Russians for a scheme to  sow discord in American politics through our social media and the  release of hacked emails. However, not enough attention has been paid  to foreign interests secretly enlisting American cutouts to directly  influence our laws, our public policies, and, most importantly, public  opinion to destroy our social cohesion.   This is a very serious problem that should send shivers down the  spine of anyone in government who meets with lobbyists. If lobbyists or  public relations firms are pushing policy preferences at the behest of  foreign powers and foreign interests, we ought to know about it.   This week I introduced legislation to strengthen and also fine-tune  enforcement authorities to better expose clandestine foreign influence  campaigns. My bipartisan bill, the Foreign Agents Disclosure and  Registration Enhancement Act, will encourage greater compliance with a  very often ignored requirement for lobbyists working on behalf of  foreign entities to tell the U.S. people who they are working for. It  accomplishes this by creating critical updates to one of our Nation's  oldest lobbying disclosure laws.   Way back in 1938, Congress first passed a bill to accomplish a way to  expose this foreign influence in America, particularly within our  government. That bill passed in 1938 is called the Foreign Agents  Registration Act. The bill was meant to unmask Nazi propaganda and  identify foreign attempts to influence Congress and the American  public. Until recently, however, this Foreign Agents Registration Act  has been seldom used.   Now--get this--only 15 violators of this act have been criminally  prosecuted since 1966, and 1966 was the date when this law was last  updated. Of course, now I am trying to update it again. About half of  these prosecutions, of the 15, stem from the work of Special Counsel  Mueller's investigation, though that is not due to the lack of foreign  influence efforts to affect our Federal decision making.   As part of my oversight efforts, I first raised concerns about the  shoddy Foreign Agent Registration Act enforcement in 2015. Now, I did  this before Donald Trump launched his Presidential campaign. I did it  when a former Clinton White House staffer and a lawyer for a Georgian  political party failed to register as foreign agents.   I also raised concerns about work for Ukranians by Paul Manafort and  the Podesta Group, and about reports that the Democratic National  Committee worked with Ukraine to undermine the Trump campaign. I raised  concerns when the firm behind the discredited Steele dossier failed to  register for its lobbying work to repeal U.S. sanctions against Russia.   Now, as it turned out, that is the same lobbying effort that was  behind the bait and switch at the Trump Tower in June of 2016. I don't  have to go into details about that Trump Tower meeting. That is a very  famous and well documented meeting.   I even subpoenaed Manafort to testify at the Judiciary Committee  hearing on lax Foreign Agents Registration Act enforcement, and I  praised Mueller for dusting off the law that had been ignored by  lobbyists and prosecutors for so long because they really didn't want  the American public to know that they were working for a foreign  country.    Now, that may sound like that is something illegal. What is illegal  is that you don't tell the American people whom you are working for. It  is not, as far as I know, illegal to work for the interests of another  country, as they might have some legitimate interest in our  policymaking, but the point is that the public ought to know whom they  are working for.   Now, I talked about subpoenaing Manafort, and in the end Manafort,  his colleague Rick Gates, and former Obama White House Counsel Greg  Craig were among those indicted for violating this Foreign Agents  Registration Act.   My Foreign Agents Registration Act oversight activities have been  done without regard to power, party, or privilege. I happen to have a  reputation as an equal-opportunity overseer to see that the laws are  faithfully enforced, and I believe that this very act of registration  of foreign agents ought to be better enforced and enforced equally.  [[Page S3307]]    Now, all of this talk about this law may have started as a creative  tactic by an aggressive team of investigators to pressure Manafort into  spilling nonexistent details on the Trump campaign, but Mueller's probe  had the positive effect of shining a light on the Justice Department's  registration unit on the enforcement of this law of 1938, and it also  has shown light, as well, on a legion of lobbyists who work for foreign  agents who had flown under the radar for very many years.   Now, because of all this transparency, the charges spurred a rush on  K Street. New foreign agent registrations increased by 50 percent from  2016 to 2017. Now, I can't believe a single one of those people  registering of that 50 percent increase in registration didn't realize  this law existed, but they probably thought they could get away with  something that most people have been getting away with for decades.   Now, Attorney General Barr also recently pledged to prioritize  enforcement of that law as he heads up the Justice Department, and, of  course, we all ought to be pleased to hear that from the Attorney  General.   However, even though the 1938 law is finally being taken more  seriously, that law still lacks key enforcement authorities needed to  investigate and hold accountable covert conveyors of foreign interests.   The 1938 law also includes a broad exemption for anyone already  registered with Congress as a lobbyist. It is time that we ask whether  this exemption continues to serve the public interest and operates as  intended.   Moreover, even those registered under the 1938 law aren't required to  clearly disclose that they are working on behalf of a foreign  government or entity if they happen to be meeting with Capitol Hill or  administration officials. Policymakers need to know when these meetings  are driven by foreign interests.   Now, getting back to the legislation I am introducing, this  bipartisan bill, based on my oversight work, grants Federal  investigators a lot of new tools, such as civil investigative demand  authority to help the Justice Department gain access to material needed  to identify covert foreign influence and improve the act's compliance.  This bill strengthens the Justice Department's hand in rooting out  those who attempt to shield their operation from the American people  and policymakers.   We have to ensure accountability, and to accomplish that goal, my  bill provides key controls on who in the Justice Department can use the  new authority, and it provides due process protection. This authority  will also sunset after 5 years, requiring the Justice Department to  demonstrate that the law has been appropriately used if Congress is to  reauthorize it.   In addition, the bill requires a review of the new authority by the  Justice Department's inspector general.   This bipartisan bill also improves deterrence by strengthening the  penalties that scofflaws face for violating the law's registration and  disclosure requirements.   It also requires foreign agents to immediately disclose their  clients. That way, policymakers--including those of us in the Senate-- can evaluate their positions in light of those associations.   Even my own office has, in the past, been targeted by secretive  lobbying efforts orchestrated by foreign powers, whose policy interests  were diametrically opposed to those of our great country. I saw through  the ploy, but anyone in government should have full awareness into who  they are meeting with and why those meetings are taking place.   The bill requires the Justice Department to craft a comprehensive  enforcement strategy for the law to better coordinate agency efforts,  to analyze the law's current exemptions and fee structure, and to  promote transparency by ensuring the ongoing proactive release of the  law's advisory opinions.   Finally, it establishes a review of the Lobbying Disclosure Act  exemptions to determine whether and to what extent it has been abused  to conceal foreign influence.   Legitimate interests engaging in legitimate conduct shouldn't bear an  unnecessary burden. Hopefully, in the way we have written this law,  that unnecessary burden is avoided. But, at the same time, we must also  be certain that this exemption hasn't created an opportunity for abuse  by those who wish to operate in the dark. With this increase in  registration under the 1938 law, we find that a lot of people must have  been operating in the dark.   This bill is a product of my years-long oversight into the 1938 law  as well as bipartisan cooperation. It reflects a consensus that the  curtain over foreign influence has to be peeled back.   This year, compared to the bill I introduced last year--and we had  competition with other bills last year--we have been able to find a  bipartisan effort that combines what other Members' thinking is on the  subject. So I am happy to announce that Senators Feinstein, Cornyn,  Shaheen, Rubio, and Young are cosponsors at the time of this  introduction, and I hope that other Members will join us as well.   The Mueller investigation might not have brought the legal charges  that many of the President's critics were hoping for. They were hoping  for an excuse to get President Trump out of office. But at least that  investigation by Mueller was a powerful indictment of our government's  lax enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act and also of our  willingness to take the bait of foreign powers seeking to wreak havoc  on our civic discourse.   In the wake of the Mueller investigation, it is on us, right here in  the Congress, to keep our eye on the ball. It is on us to strengthen  our defenses against hidden foreign influence and preserve the voice of  the American people. I believe with the introduction of the bipartisan  Foreign Agents Disclosure and Registration Enhancement Act that we will  accomplish these ends.   Again, I welcome a lot of additional cosponsorship of my colleagues.  This is definitely a good government piece of legislation.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
