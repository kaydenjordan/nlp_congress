 Mr. Speaker, as he prepares to retire as CEO after four  decades, I rise to recognize a constituent of mine, Chris Martin, for  his leadership of Martin Guitars, an exceptional business in Nazareth,  Pennsylvania, that has been a source of pride in my community for  generations.   For almost 200 years, C.F. Martin & Company has produced acoustic  guitars widely recognized as the finest in the world. The product of an  unparalleled legacy of craftsmanship, Martin Guitars have been proudly  used by legendary musicians across our country and the world: Bob Dylan  and Eric Clapton, Paul McCartney and Joan Baez, Willie Nelson and Kurt  Cobain, to name only a few.   I want to express my gratitude to Chris and the Martin Guitars team  for their continued dedication to contributing to a made-in-the-USA  economy based on excellence; for their commitment to maintaining and  expanding music education in our classrooms; and for their  determination to advance social, economic, environmental, and racial  justice.   I congratulate Chris on all he has achieved. As he looks forward to a  new chapter, I wish him the very best.                            ____________________
