 Mr. Speaker, this legislation, this bill, this movement,  and this purpose that we are debating today really found its genesis  long ago with a Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education  of Topeka, Kansas, when, on May 17, 1954, nine men robed in black  assembled not far from here to announce on the steps their unanimous  decision to end segregation in public education. On that day, among the  Nation's Black citizens, there was, indeed, a celebration, and it was a  celebration, indeed, by many of its Whites.   Many of us thought that this decision was the launching of the  threshold of a new era in life when education all across this Nation  would be treated the way it should be for all of its citizens. Many  people felt in the bowels of their being and in their very existence  that this Nation again at long last would find a way to launch itself  into a new era.   So this is the manifestation of that new era. This legislation  extends the guarantees, the protections, and the expectations of that  decision; and it is the expectations that we are talking about today:  to be able to provide the kind of education and the kind of treatment  of education that would extend to all people, to increase diversity,  and to do away with those things that have held us back for so many,  many years.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the sponsor of this bill. I urge my  colleagues to understand her intent and the expectations that it brings  with it so that we might do the right thing and pass it. I urge an  ``aye'' vote, Mr. Speaker.
