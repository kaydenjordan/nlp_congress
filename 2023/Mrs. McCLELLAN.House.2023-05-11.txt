 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember Shawn Soares, a  young public servant and former congressional staffer from my district,  who was tragically killed in a traffic accident last week.   I first met Shawn during my time as a State legislator. He was a  genuinely kind person who always had a smile on his face.   Shawn was a bright light everywhere, and he was well known in the  Richmond community for his commitment to climate advocacy and his  desire to better the Commonwealth.   He accomplished so much in his short life. He served under my  predecessor, the late Donald McEachin, and in State government under  former Governor Ralph Northam and Delegate Suhas Subramanyam.   He was a leadership member in the Virginia Young Democrats and most  recently worked for the Virginia Conservation Network while pursuing  his graduate degree at Virginia Commonwealth University.   Shawn's commitment to having a positive impact on his community was  evident in his life and work, and he will be sorely missed by many.   My sincere condolences to the Soares family, his loved ones, and  every community he touched.                            ____________________
