 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment,  which would simply prohibit the executive branch from using the term  ``Latinx'' in official public documents.   Although 98 percent of Latinos reject the term ``Latinx,'' the White  House has made a point to continue referring to us, the Latinos, as  ``Latinx.''   Mr. Chair, let's talk about the epidemic of wokeness in our  community. Wokeness has taken over our schools and our children, and  now it wants to take over the Hispanic culture.   The reality is that the Spanish language has two genders, masculine  and feminine--male and female, period. There is no x.   A new generation wants to modify a universal Hispanic reality. It  wants to erase a grammatical rule that has been place for centuries.   In 2004, the term ``Latinx'' first appeared online on Google Trends.  It is supposed to signify a nonbinary option for Hispanics by removing  the ``a'' for female or the ``o'' for male when addressing someone.                                time  1900    ``Latinx'' has been overwhelmingly rejected by the Hispanic community  in this country. Only 2 percent of the Hispanic population uses the  term ``Latinx,'' while 90 percent prefer to use ``Hispanic'' or  ``Latino.''   What we are seeing is that the use of ``Latinx'' is growing in  university classrooms, where gender ideology and political correctness  have taken over academics and intellectual rigor.   Listen to this. We are seeing the use of ``Latinx'' in government  documents at a time when the people it refers to don't even want to use  it. How could that be? That is imposing on us. We don't even want it.   That is why I have introduced this amendment to prohibit the Biden  administration from using ``Latinx'' in official, public-facing  government documents.   This is an important move that would prevent this wokeness from being  forced onto us, the Hispanics, a conservative community that uses  ``male'' and ``female,'' period.   Mr. Chair, I strongly urge my colleagues to support my amendment and  to stand with the Latino community--``Latino'' with an o and ``Latina''  with an a, not with an x. I urge them to choose our traditional  Hispanic culture over woke culture, to choose our history over  political correctness to please a small group of people who don't even  know anything about us.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
