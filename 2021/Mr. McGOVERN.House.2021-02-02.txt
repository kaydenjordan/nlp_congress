 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Morelle), a distinguished member of the Committee on Rules, for  yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, I support the underlying measures before us today, but I  take a moment to discuss something else included here.   Mr. Speaker, just outside these doors is something students walk  through every day to prevent gun violence in their schools, something  travelers pass through every time they board an airplane, and something  the public goes through every time they enter a Federal building:   Magnetometers. Metal detectors.   They are a modern-day inconvenience that we are all used to, and,  frankly, they are a small price to pay to keep Americans safe.   Metal detectors were installed outside this Chamber following the  recent deadly insurrection at the Capitol. Although these machines are  new, the policy they are enforcing is not. That has been on the books  for more than 50 years.    President Lyndon Johnson signed a law outlawing weapons on Capitol  grounds back in 1967. The Capitol Police Board, the entity that  oversees security regulations in the complex, then issued regulations  soon after. They prohibited firearms from being carried into the  Chamber and in the connected rooms and galleries.   Mr. Speaker, now some Members, like myself, want to see these  regulations go further. Representatives Huffman and Speier have been  instrumental on this front, and I hope that we act. Others want no  prohibitions at all.   Mr. Speaker, regardless, the rules are the rules. I thought that was  clear, but apparently some of my friends on the other side think  differently. Some are acting as though, by being elected to Congress,  they have been anointed to some sort of special club, one that gets to  pick and choose what rules to follow.   A Member on the other side ran an ad depicting her walking around our  Nation's Capital with a loaded firearm,  [[Page H269]]  tweeting: ``Let me tell you why I will carry my Glock to Congress.''   Another Republican recently bragged that he was armed during the  recent riots, and another was stopped by Capitol Police bringing a gun  into this Chamber.   Mr. Speaker, I could go on. We have people in this Chamber who have  posted disturbing and threatening rhetoric against Members of this  body. And there is speculation that maybe some Members were complicit  with those who attacked the Capitol on January 6. You know, these words  and actions raise serious safety concerns.   Mr. Speaker, these metal detectors are manned by the same police  officers who saved our lives during the insurrection while risking  their own, yet some Members on the other side have disrespected these  Capitol Police Officers, verbally abused them, pushed them aside, and  disregarded their orders, all to avoid this basic safety measure. That  is no way to treat our heroes.   Some of these very same Members have been quick to send press  releases and cut advertisements about the need to respect the police;  but here in these Halls, when they think no one is watching, apparently  their message is different. It is: ``Do as I say, not as I do.''   Mr. Speaker, that is why we must act today. This isn't a messaging  bill. This is as serious as it gets. This elitist mentality must end.                                time  1730    Apparently, it will take a rules change to ensure that all Members  follow the rules just like everyone else.   Included in this measure is language to change the rules to fine  Members who interfere with the Capitol Police's ability to do their  jobs at the magnetometers outside this Chamber: $5,000 for the first  offense, $10,000 for each one thereafter.   This is modeled after a change my Republican friends made in the  115th Congress, which fined Members for taking photos or videos on the  floor.   We are taking steps to make sure this process is transparent and  fair. Violations will be posted online, and Members will have the  chance to have their appeal considered by the bipartisan Ethics  Committee.   And let me assure all Americans that these fines will be paid  directly by Members.   Now, Mr. Speaker, I am not a mind reader, but I have been here long  enough to know how this debate will go. Some on the other side will act  like this is some grand inconvenience. Tell that to the millions of  Americans who go through metal detectors every day in this country.   Why are you any different? Give me a break.   We need to protect not just Members but staff and all the people who  work up here. We need to protect our constituents and the public who  visit the people's House.   That is why I urge my colleagues to support this change. The rules  apply to us, too, and it is time all of us acted like it.
