 Mr. President, I wish to honor an exceptional  officer in the U.S. Army. LTG Karen E. Dyson will retire in July after  more than 37 years of distinguished service to the Army and our great  Nation. General Dyson's long and distinguished career admirably  culminates as military deputy to the Assistant Secretary of the Army,  Financial Management and Comptroller. This is the highest military  position within that office.   For nearly four decades, General Dyson has personified the Army  values of duty, integrity, and selfless service to our Nation's  defense. She comes from a legacy of selfless service, as her father  served as a special forces officer in Germany. Lieutenant General Dyson  began her own legacy upon graduation and commissioning as a second  lieutenant into the regular Army, Finance Branch, from the ROTC program  at Southwest Missouri State University. Her extraordinary career is a  testament to her hard work and dedication; she is an exemplary role  model and mentor who made Army history as the first female finance  officer to obtain the rank of lieutenant general.   Lieutenant General Dyson has commanded soldiers at all levels through  brigade, leading soldiers in peacetime, stability operations, and war.  During her command of the European-based 266th Finance Command, she  deployed with her troops in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq.  Her command funded each and every Army mission within the contingency  operation, the infrastructure of all military operating bases, and  critical equipment that ensured warfighters were ready to fight. She  also commanded the 208th Finance Battalion during Operation Joint Guard  and Operation Joint Forge in Bosnia; and the 66th Finance Detachment in  the 101st Airborne Division during Operations Desert Shield/Desert  Storm in Saudi Arabia.   Lieutenant General Dyson was an integral part of the of the White  House team during her time serving as the chief of staff and  comptroller, White House Military Office. She is also a familiar and  respected presence in the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill. During her time  as the military deputy for budget and the director of the Army budget  under the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army, Financial  Management and Comptroller, she dedicated herself to engaging Congress  on important financial issues for the Army, answering questions that  ensured transparency and understanding of the Army's funding  requirements. She served in numerous positions within the Pentagon to  include the chief of the Army Coalition Provisional Authority Support  Team, the director of Business Operations Office of Business  Transformation, the director of operations and support Army Budget  Office and the executive officer to the Assistant Secretary of the  Army, Financial Management and Comptroller, and to the Under Secretary  of the Army. She influenced the way the Army viewed auditability and  was the driving force behind numerous initiatives to make every dollar  count, ensuring accountability to Congress and our Nation's taxpayers.   Together with her husband James Chamberlain, a retired Air Force  officer, she will undoubtedly continue her service to our Nation in  some capacity following her retirement. On behalf of the State of West  Virginia and the U.S. Senate and a grateful nation, I congratulate LTG  Karen E. Dyson on her retirement from the U.S. Army. I wish Karen and  Jim the best in their future endeavors and the next chapter of their  lives.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to an  exceptional officer in the U.S. Army. LTC Rebecca B. McElwain has  served admirably as a senior budget integrator for the Assistant  Secretary of the Army, Financial Management and Comptroller, for the  past year.   Lieutenant Colonel McElwain began her career in North Dakota where  she spent time as a medic in the Army Reserves, later transferring to  the Minnesota National Guard. After graduating with a bachelor's of  science in business administration from North Dakota State University  in 1997, she received a commission into the Finance Corps.   LTC Rebecca McElwain's earliest Active-Duty assignment was with the  125th Finance Battalion in Hawaii, where she assumed her first company- grade command and participated in Asia-Pacific training exercises such  as Cobra Gold in Thailand. After her time in Hawaii, she transitioned  to Schweinfurt, Germany, where she assumed detachment command in the  106th Finance Battalion and deployed her unit to Kosovo in support of  Task Force Falcon. She also served as a military mentor in support of  the U.S. Ambassador's efforts to encourage Kosovar women to assume  leadership positions in Kosovo's developing government.   After her return from Kosovo, she moved across Germany to support  U.S. Army Europe transformation initiatives as the 266th Finance  Command executive officer. Shortly after, she was selected for graduate  school and attended Hawaii Pacific University, where she earned a  master's degree in business administration with an international  finance focus. After graduation, she returned to Germany, activated and  assumed command of the 106th Financial Management Company, deploying  her unit in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom to establish a new  headquarters in southern Iraq.   While in Germany, Lieutenant Colonel McElwain was selected to attend  the Australian Command and Staff College, a joint military school.   During her time in Australia, she earned an additional master's  degree in strategy and management from the University of New South  Wales and attended classes with 182 students from 22 different nations,  to include China, India, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab  Emirates.   Next, Lieutenant Colonel McElwain served as the chief of financial  management security assistance in the CENTCOM J8, supporting the fiscal  requirements of 17 security cooperation offices throughout CENTCOM. She  also served as a primary member of the CENTCOM operational planning  team for Afghanistan transition. As the division G8 comptroller for the  25th Infantry Division, she managed funding for five rapidly deployable  brigades and received broad exposure to the ongoing Pacific partnership  efforts within the PACOM footprint, as well as joint force engagements.   Lieutenant Colonel McElwain's husband, James, has deep family roots  in West Virginia and served as an Army ordnance officer. Since leaving  the military, he spends his time as a health and fitness consultant and  independent chef. Together they have a 13-year-old son, Andrew, who  enjoys Boy Scouts, loves all types of sports, and keeps them on their  toes.   Throughout her career, Lieutenant Colonel McElwain has positively  impacted her soldiers, peers, and superiors. Her extraordinary career  is a testament to her hard work and dedication. Our Nation has been  enriched by her leadership, thoughtful judgment, and exemplary work. On  behalf of the State of West Virginia and the U.S. Senate and a grateful  nation, I join my colleagues today in recognizing and commending  Rebecca on her service to our Nation. We wish Rebecca, James, and  Andrew all the best as they continue their journey in the Army.                            ____________________
