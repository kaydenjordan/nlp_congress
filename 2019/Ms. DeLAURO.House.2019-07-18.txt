 Mr. Speaker, let's be clear. Since Franklin Roosevelt,  the Federal Government has been increasing the Federal wage.   Don't let them get away with this hogwash about what we do and what  we don't do here.   Wages for the top 1 percent have grown 150 percent since 1979.   Wages for middle-class families and working families have stagnated.  Their wages do not keep up with the skyrocketing costs of healthcare,  prescription drugs, childcare, housing, and a college education.   This is the single biggest economic challenge of our time. So, today,  full-time, year-round work at the Federal minimum wage of $7.25 leaves  a family of three below the Federal poverty line. It is unacceptable,  because working people have more than earned a raise.   According to the Economic Policy Institute, if the minimum wage  increased equal to the increases in workers' productivity, it would be  more than $20 an hour.   Congress needs to make this right. Clearly, my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle do not respect the work of 34 million  Americans. They don't respect the dignity of the work that these folks  do.   It is our job. Let us pass the Raise the Minimum Wage Act. Working  people are doing their jobs. Let us do ours.   I include in the Record a letter from the AFT, the American  Federation of Teachers.                                 American Federation of Teachers,                                      Washington, DC, July 17, 2019.      Hon. Robert ``Bobby'' Scott,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Rep. Scott: On behalf of the 1.7 million members of       the American Federation of Teachers, I thank you for       introducing the Raise the Wage Act of 2019 (H.R. 582). By       raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 per hour       by 2024, H.R. 582 would empower millions of struggling       Americans to make ends meet and support their families.        The federal minimum wage was last raised to $7.25 per hour       in 2009, and, over the past decade, the cost of living has       increased at a pace that significantly exceeds the average       earnings of a minimum wage worker. Raising the wage is a       matter of economic and social justice because a $15 minimum       wage would lift millions out of poverty, help close the       racial and gender wage gaps, and help reverse decades of       growing pay inequality.        The Economic Policy Institute estimates that increasing the       federal minimum wage to $15 by 2024 would give more than 1 in       3 working women a raise, including 43 percent of African       American working women, 38 percent of working Latinas, 32       percent of white working women, and 20 percent of Asian and       Pacific Islander working women.        Of particular note for the AFT, our research tells us that       one-fifth of educators and one-fourth of healthcare workers       would get a raise under H.R. 582--including but not limited       to preschool teachers, who on average earn $13.84 per hour;       substitute teachers,  [[Page H7116]]       who average $13.47 per hour; child care workers, who earn an       average of $10.18 per hour; and home healthcare workers, who       on average receive $10.87 per hour. With higher wages, more       Americans would be better able to afford food, clothing,       housing and other necessities, which, in turn, would support       local businesses and economic growth.        Too many hardworking families in the United States are       being forced to depend on poverty-level wages. Congress can       help strengthen our economy and lift families out of poverty       by raising the federal minimum wage.        Thank you for your introduction of H.R. 582.            Sincerely,                                                  Randi Weingarten,                                                         President.
