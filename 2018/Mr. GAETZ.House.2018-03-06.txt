 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time. I  also thank the gentleman from Tennessee for introducing this  responsible legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to circumstances where this  administration will have additional tools to deal with transnational  criminal organizations, and I hope that we will use those tools to  counter the threat posed by Hezbollah.    Hezbollah is not a political party. It is not a quaint reflection of  history. It is a web of terrorists and criminals, and that web extends  here to our hemisphere.   In fact, in 2009, there was an arrest made in Philadelphia, where  Hezbollah operatives were looking to move 1,200 machine guns into  Syria.   More recent arrests have been made in Latin America, where countries  like Argentina, Peru, and Paraguay are dealing with an enhanced  Hezbollah presence.   This important legislation will help us build a plan to leverage our  allies, to leverage the Organization of American States and other  assets so that we recognize the threat that Hezbollah and other  terrorist organizations pose and so that we meet that threat head-on.
