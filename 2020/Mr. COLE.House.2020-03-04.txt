 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this Supplemental  bill, which will provide $7.8 billion for our country to prepare for,  prevent, and respond to the coronavirus.   Congress thankfully began preparing for public health emergencies  like the coronavirus five years ago, by including generous increases  for the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention and the Strategic National Stockpile.   Beyond that, in 2018 this Congress established the Infectious Disease  Rapid Response Reserve Fund, which enabled our Administration and  public health officials to direct a swift and decisive response to  protect our citizens from day one.   The funding provided in this Supplemental bill will further target  resources to state and local health officials. It will enable the  government to procure medical supplies to supplement the Strategic  National Stockpile. It will provide over $800 million for research into  a vaccine, and provide additional funds to develop medicines,  diagnostic tests, and aid in hospital preparedness.   The bill also includes language waiving certain telehealth  requirements during this time to ensure Medicare beneficiaries can  receive the care they need at home to avoid placing themselves at  greater risk of the virus.   I'm glad we were able to come together in a bipartisan fashion to  speed these funds to where they are needed.
