 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this year, we will observe the 20th anniversary of the  terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. It will serve as a somber  reminder of the fragility of our security, the bravery of our law  enforcement and first responders, and the resilience of our democracy.   After the attacks on 9/11, Congress recognized the importance of  establishing a bipartisan commission to investigate these brazen acts  of terrorism. This body recognized the need to find the truth and help  all of us understand how these heinous acts that not only forever  changed our country, but also the entire world, could have been carried  out.   The highly respected 9/11 Commission identified numerous challenges  that needed to be addressed, which ultimately led to many concrete  recommendations that were later enacted into law. These critical  reforms vastly improved our information sharing, intelligence  collection, vetting capabilities, and broader homeland security  enterprise.   The security breach that took place at the U.S. Capitol on January 6  was completely unacceptable. It was a major breakdown in information  sharing and preparedness, much like the shortfalls that existed prior  to 9/11. It was not only an attack on this institution but an attack on  our law enforcement brethren who defend us every day.   Unfortunately, we know that the Capitol, Federal buildings, and even  Members of Congress remain a target for extremists of all ideologies,  as we all saw most recently during the April 2 vehicle attack that took  the life of Capitol Police Officer William ``Billy'' Evans.   The bill before us today, H.R. 3233, would create an independent,  bipartisan commission to investigate the relevant facts and  circumstances relating to the January 6 attack on the Capitol, as well  as targeted violence and domestic terrorism relevant to that attack.   It also charges the commission with providing and finding  recommendations to, among other things, prevent, prepare for, and  respond to similar attacks; improve the security posture of the Capitol  complex; and ensure the security of Members of Congress and  congressional staff.   Modeled after the 9/11 Commission, this bill creates a 10-member  panel with five commissioners appointed by each party and equal  subpoena authority.   While the expedited December 2021 deadline would only give the  commission about 6 months to do its job, there is good reason for that:  The American people and the Capitol Police deserve answers and action  as soon as possible to ensure that nothing like this ever happens  again.   We must find answers to the many questions surrounding that day. What  information was known leading up to January 6? Why was that information  not shared with the proper entities? Why were Capitol Police officers  left so unprepared? Who failed to provide them with support? Why did it  take so long for reinforcements to come to their aid? How can we  improve the decisionmaking and bureaucracy that is clearly hampering  the Capitol Police and the security of the Capitol complex? How can we  ensure that the Capitol, Members of Congress, and our staffs are secure  from attacks? And how do we ensure that this is a safer place for the  members of the Capitol Police force who risk their lives every day to  protect us?   These are only a few of the many questions that need to be answered.  The American people and the Capitol Police deserve those answers.   As I have called for since the days just after the attack, an  independent, 9/11-style review is critical for removing the politics  around January 6 and focusing solely on the facts and circumstances of  the security breach at the Capitol, as well as other instances of  violence relevant to such a review.   Make no mistake about it, Mr. Thompson and I know this is about  facts. It is not partisan politics. We would have never gotten to this  point if it was about partisan politics.   Thanks to the strong partnership with Mr. Thompson, the Homeland  Security Committee remains a bipartisan committee focused on securing  the Nation while leaving partisanship at the door, which is exactly  what the American people expect of us.   Chairman Thompson and I were able to work together to block out all  the political noise surrounding the January 6 attack and turn the  Speaker's partisan proposal into a reasonable, nonpartisan bill.   Now, H.R. 3233 is nearly identical to the original commission bill,  H.R. 275, that I, along with 30 other Republican cosponsors, introduced  on January 13, 6 days after the attack.   I sincerely appreciate Chairman Thompson's robust collaboration and  strong commitment, as well as his friendship, by working together on  this effort. The American people expect Congress to put partisanship  aside for the sake of our homeland security.   I fully recognize that in a diverse body like this, Members come down  on different sides of different issues. I welcome that. We all should.  That is America; because, after all, none of this is personal. It is  about our mutual desire to keep America safe and secure. To my friends  on both sides of the aisle, I welcome honest, vigorous, and civil  debate.   At the end of the day, I strongly believe this is fair and necessary  legislation. I encourage all Members, Republicans and Democrats alike,  to put down their swords just for once and support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Meijer).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Upton).    Mr. Speaker, I just want to note for the Record that the  subpoena to which my colleague from California mentioned can only be  issued if there is a consensus by both sides of the aisle on the  commission. It is not something that one side can do unilaterally. And  that is one of the key provisions of this, because it depoliticizes the  process and it is a consensus-driven process.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Speaker for her comments.   I want to reiterate for everyone to understand: The way that Mr.  Thompson and I crafted this bill, we crafted it in such a manner to  make sure it would be depoliticized entirely. There is an equal number  of members on both sides appointed by both sides. They have equal  subpoena power. They can't subpoena one person without the other person  on the other side of the aisle agreeing. They have to hire staff  together, all those things.   I want to make sure people understand that we did this for a reason  because that is exactly what made the 9/11 Commission successful and  made it effective.   As someone who was in Federal law enforcement for 20 years before I  took this job, I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, that our country is  infinitely safer because of what the 9/11 Commission did. We are much  stronger against terrorism, and we share information in much better  ways than we ever did--for example, the Joint Terrorism Task Forces,  which are all over this country.   I ask my colleagues to consider the fact that this commission is  built to work. It will be depoliticized, and it will get the results we  need because the Capitol itself and the Capitol Police officers will be  better off for it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs.  Greene).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. Bishop).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Gohmert).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Roy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to take a few moments to address some of the  arguments that have been made here today, and some of the arguments  that have been made in opposition to this bill.   One of them is talking about the scope of the commission being too  narrow. I want to note that the commission is granted sufficient scope  and flexibility to investigate targeted violence and domestic terrorism  relevant to the January 6 attack. It will be up to the commission to  decide how far they want to go with that perimeter.   Do I feel that the attack on the Capitol on April 2 that killed a  Capitol Police Officer is relevant? I do. I hope the commission does,  too.  [[Page H2589]]    Do I feel that the June 17 attack on Republican Members of Congress  is relevant to the January 6 attack? I do. I hope the commission does.  They have the flexibility to do so, if they want.   If there are other issues outside of this scope, we can look into  them. We can have separate legislation. I encourage my colleagues, who  are concerned about that, to do that.   Another charge I heard was that the commission could be controlled by  partisan staff hired unilaterally by the commission chair. That is  simply not true.   Here is what the bill does. It requires consultation between the  chair, appointed by the Democrats, and the vice chair, appointed by the  Republicans, for any hiring of staff. Further, it requires that it be  in accordance with the rules agreed upon by the commission. The  commission creates the rules as a team. They then hire as a team.   Lastly, there has been some concerns or arguments made about the  criminal investigations. Make no mistake about it. This commission has  nothing to do with the criminal investigations. This commission, by  law, cannot interfere with criminal investigations. Criminal  investigations alone won't get us what we need, like the 9/11  Commission concluded. It won't get us the recommendations, the insight,  the expertise from the people on the commission who can come in, look  at the Capitol security matrix, and say this is what needs fixing. A  prosecutor can't tell you that. The commission can. That is what we  want to do.   Second, the bill specifically requires the commission to respect  ongoing investigations and build upon the investigations, learn from  them, and avoid unnecessary duplication.   This language, in that respect, goes further than the 9/11 Commission  in H.R. 275 in granting deference to other ongoing investigations.   So I just want to make sure people are clear about that going  forward.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1730     Mr. Speaker, I ask that we all take a deep breath right  now. Everybody breathe for a minute and everybody stop the theatrics,  and everybody stop the arguments that are not relevant to this issue.   This is a very solemn moment. We are here to talk about something  that is very important to the entire of our Government and the entire  of our country. I ask that we think about the officers and their  families and conduct ourselves accordingly.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time remains?    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close and I yield myself the  balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is not about partisan politics. It is  about finding the truth and addressing the vulnerabilities of our  security apparatus so that we can emerge stronger and better prepared.   The January 6 attack was a completely preventable failure of  intelligence, information sharing, decisionmaking, and preparedness.  The Capitol Police and D.C. police suffered greatly and continue to  suffer as a result.   The institutions of our democracy are and will continue to be a  target for extremists set on using violence to further their ideology.  We, in Congress, owe it to this Nation, to our constituents, and to the  dedicated men and women who risk their lives every single day to  protect those institutions--and I honor them--to see that we learn from  those attacks, that we get answers to the hard questions, and that we  do not repeat the mistakes of the past.   Capitol Police Officers Brian Sicknick and Howard Liebengood, as well  as D.C. Police Officer Jeffrey Smith, all lost their lives in the wake  of the January 6 attack. Over 140 more law enforcement officers--140-- were injured as a result of that attack.   Less than 4 months later, on April 2, Capitol Police Officer William  ``Billy'' Evans was killed and another officer was injured when yet  another extremist attacked the Capitol.   And, of course, we can't forget the 2017 terrorist attack against  Republican Members of Congress during practice for the Congressional  Baseball Game. Were it not for the officers involved, there would be  scores of dead Congressmen. That is the plain truth. I acknowledge the  heroic efforts of David Bailey and Crystal Griner.   We owe it to all of these officers and their families to ensure that  nothing like this ever happens again. This legislation is modeled  directly on the legislation that created the 9/11 Commission. I  sincerely believe that this commission, with strong support from this  body, will embark on an objective, nonpartisan search for answers and  solutions, just as the 9/11 Commission did.   Again, I want to thank my friend, Chairman Thompson, for his  partnership.   I urge everyone in the body, on both sides--not just my side and not  just the other side, all of us--to set aside politics just this once-- just this once. I beg Members to pass this bill.   I was a prosecutor for 20 years prior to coming here to Congress, and  many times we would meet at 4:30 in the morning or 5:00 in the morning,  and they would get ready to go out and do the raids and arrest very,  very dangerous people. I was always the last person to see them before  they went out to get these awful, dangerous people off the street: drug  dealers, murderers, violent people. They did their job every day, and I  was sending them into harm's way. It always made my heart sink.   Imagine being a family member of these officers who do this. So let's  take a deep breath and think about what is really important here. These  people, every single day, are willing to lay down their lives for us.   They deserve better, and we are going to deliver this. We are going  to deliver it on behalf of Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick. We  are going to deliver it on behalf of Capitol Police Officer Howard  Liebengood. We are going to deliver it on behalf of Capitol Police  Officer William ``Billy'' Evans. We are going to deliver it on behalf  of D.C. Police Officer Jeffrey Smith. We are going to deliver it on  behalf of D.C. Police Officer Michael Fanone and so many others who  struggle with the events of that day. We do so on behalf of the people  who risked their lives for us and continue to, like Capitol Police  [[Page H2590]]  Officer David Bailey and Capitol Police Officer Crystal Griner.    I want these officers and their families to know that we are doing it  not for us and not for politics. We are doing it for them. We are doing  it for them.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
