 Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend, the  distinguished chairman of the Oversight and Reform Committee, for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, what we just heard might be described as hyperanimated  chutzpa to bemoan accountability, to talk about a kitchen table that  is, I think, imaginary.   I can tell you it doesn't characterize the kitchen tables in my  district, and it probably doesn't characterize them all across America,  which is maybe why the minority leader is called that instead of the  ``majority leader'' in this Congress, because my Republican friends  abrogated any accountability, any oversight of this administration in  the 2 years they were in the majority and Mr. Trump was in the White  House.   Americans are focused on economic and health issues, but that doesn't  mean they don't care about what is happening to their country. They do.   The Census, the distinguished minority leader doesn't want you to  focus on why the Census question was so important because it is in a  context that is disturbing. It is in a context of voter suppression all  across America: Get rid of early voting; restrict absentee voting; have  stricter ID laws; make it harder for students and people of color to  vote; purge voting rolls; have manufactured assertions about phony  voting, as if that were the major problem in America.   Asking the citizenship question on the Census is part and parcel of  that scheme to discourage minority voting in America, to frighten  immigrant communities.    Finally, Madam Speaker, maybe the worst of all, to  bemoan the change yesterday to allow the Speaker to have her words  considered and to allow her back on the floor. Why? Because we don't  care about rules? No. Because we care about the impact on millions of  Americans of harmful, racist words, and we felt that the duty to  provide some comfort to those people that this House cared was more  important than a juridical commitment to an ancient rule.
