 Mr. President, the Senate is currently considering  the nomination of Scott Palk to a lifetime appointment as a Federal  district court judge on the Western District of Oklahoma. I voted  against Mr. Palk's nomination in the Judiciary Committee, and I will  oppose his nomination on the floor.   While his nomination was pending for a lifetime appointment to be a  Federal judge, Mr. Palk changed his membership with the National Rifle  Association to take out a life membership in the organization. When I  asked Mr. Palk about this change, he asserted he expects to maintain  this ``lifetime member'' status, even if he is confirmed, and he  refused to commit to recuse himself from any cases where the National  Rifle Association has taken a legal position.   What I find disconcerting about this is Federal judges must be  impartial. Federal judges must not have any appearance of conflicts of  interest. When individuals come before a court, they need to trust that  their case will be heard fairly and on the merits.   Every American must believe that they will get a fair, unbiased  hearing no matter who their judge is. Federal judges must follow  applicable laws and regulations that severely limit the kinds of  organizations they can participate in.   For example, the code of conduct for Federal Judges says, ``[A] judge  should not participate in extrajudicial activities that detract from  the dignity of the judge's office, interfere with the performance of  the judge's official duties, reflect adversely on the judge's  impartiality, lead to frequent disqualification, or violate the  limitations set forth below.''   That is why members of the Senate Judiciary Committee often ask  judicial nominees at their hearings what steps they will take to  prepare for the bench. It is the committee's duty to determine whether  a nominee is prepared to leave their former roles and personal beliefs  at the door and instead serve in an impartial arbiter.   In fact, when nominated for lifetime appointments, most nominees try  to rid themselves of conflicts and limit their affiliations, especially  with advocacy organizations. However, Mr. Palk not only chose to  maintain his membership with the NRA, he chose to extend his membership  for life.  [[Page S6809]]    The fact that we are considering this nominee, given this issue with  his background, just 3 weeks after the Las Vegas shooting, should  really give us all a reason to pause. Las Vegas is now the deadliest  mass shooting committed by an individual in the United States. It has  only been a year since the Pulse Nightclub massacre in Orlando, which  was previously the deadliest mass shooting in our Nation's history. It  has been only 5 years since 20 6-year-olds and 6 adults were murdered  at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, CT. What happened after  each of those shootings?   After Sandy Hook, the NRA opposed any legislation that would have  restricted high-capacity magazines or military-style assault rifles.   After the Pulse Nightclub shooting, the NRA opposed any legislation  to expand background checks on gun buyers or to prevent gun sales to  people on terrorist watch lists.   After the Las Vegas shooting, the NRA, despite initial statements to  the contrary, has come out opposed to any legislation to ban ``bump- fire stocks,'' even though such devices allow guns to function as  machineguns, which are already banned under the law.   The NRA has never supported any commonsense gun legislation. The  NRA's views on gun control issues could not be clearer, which is why it  is so problematic that a judicial nominee chose to double-down on his  NRA membership while his nomination was pending, rather than extricate  himself from his prior commitments and then refuse to commit to  recusing himself on cases where the NRA has made its views abundantly  clear. This should trouble all of us.   Our job in evaluating judicial nominees is to ensure our Federal  courts are an independent part of our system of checks and balances. To  do that, we need confidence that judicial nominees will safeguard their  own impartiality. I think all of my colleagues feel that way.   That is not what Mr. Palk has done. Instead of taking steps to  separate himself from strong political views, he has proactively taken  steps to increase his commitment to specific views of the law.   I will vote against Mr. Palk's nomination and urge my colleagues to  do the same.    Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Breast  Density and Mammography Reporting Act,'' a simple, yet potentially  life-saving solution to ensure that women receive their own medical  information. I thank Senator Heller for working with me on this  bipartisan bill and I appreciate Representatives DeLauro and  Fitzpatrick for introducing a House companion to this legislation.   We have accomplished so much in the treatment and diagnosis of breast  cancer, and it still continues to be the second leading cause of death  for women in the United States and the leading cause of cancer death  among Hispanic women. Mammograms have aided tremendously in early  detection efforts, helping many more women survive this diagnosis.   For women with dense breast tissue, however, a mammogram may not be  capturing the whole picture. Dense breast tissue and cancer tumors look  similar on a mammogram and make cancer harder to detect in women with  higher breast density. Unfortunately, many women are never told about  their tissue density on the report they receive after their screening,  even though it is assessed and reported to their health care provider.  This leaves women unaware their mammogram could be missing signs of  cancer. If a patient doesn't have information to begin with, how would  she know to ask her doctor about what additional screening might be  right for her?   There is currently no Federal requirement for women to receive notice  that they have dense breast tissue on their mammogram report. This bill  would require that women be informed on the mammogram report, something  they already receive, if they have dense breast tissue, as well as a  recommendation that they talk with their health care provider to  discuss any questions and if they might benefit from additional  screening. The bill also requires the Department of Health and Human  Services to focus on research and improved screening for patients with  dense breast tissue.   The bill does not impact State laws and simply sets a minimum Federal  standard on a report that women already receive. Any State wishing to  have additional reporting requirements would be able to do so.  Withholding from women their own medical information just does not make  sense. Having access to your breast tissue density could mean the  difference between catching breast cancer early and surviving, or  waiting until it's too late.   This bipartisan bill has the support of major cancer organizations,  including American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, Are You Dense  Advocacy, Susan G. Komen, DenseBreast-info, Tigerlily Foundation,  Prevent Cancer Foundation, Facing Our Risk of Cancer Empowered, Don't  be a Chump! Check for a Lump!, Sharsheret, National Association of  Nurse Practitioners in Women's Health, Black Women's Health Imperative,  and Men Against Breast Cancer.   I look forward to working with my colleagues on this important issue,  and I urge my fellow Senators to cosponsor the Breast Density and  Mammography Reporting Act. Thank you Mr. President and I yield the  floor.                            ____________________
