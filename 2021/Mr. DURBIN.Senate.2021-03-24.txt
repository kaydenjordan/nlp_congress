 Mr. President, first, let me salute my colleague and  friend from South Dakota. I hope we can achieve what he has asked for:  bipartisanship in the U.S. Senate.   He made a point that I would like to amplify: that they have not even  used the filibuster; Republicans have not invoked the filibuster so far  during this Senate session. Well, there is a reason--because the three  things that we have done in this session are not, under the rules of  the Senate, subject to filibuster.   Let me note as well--I ask unanimous consent that I be given 10  minutes to speak before the rollcall begins.    Mr. President, there are three things that are not  subject to a filibuster: an impeachment trial, which we have  accomplished so far this year; the nominations, which the Senator from  South Dakota alluded to; and the reconciliation bill. It is true,  Republicans did not apply the filibuster to that. But it wasn't their  good will that motivated it; the Senate rules demanded it.   The question is, Can we reach a point where we do things on a  bipartisan basis, or will it be stopped by a filibuster? So let me  pause at this moment and say to those following the debate what a  filibuster is all about. It is a time-honored tradition in the Senate,  going back to Aaron Burr serving as Vice President, that people can  speak in an unlimited fashion on the floor--there is nothing to stop  them--until there came a cloture vote, which didn't appear until the  early 20th century. Before that, the Senator could hold the floor  indefinitely and slow things down to a crawl, to a stop if necessary.  The filibuster allowed them to continue that, but then came the cloture  motion, which stopped the filibustering. It initially took a two-thirds  vote, 67, and eventually 60 votes. But that is what it boils down to.   If you want to get anything done on the floor and you don't want one  Senator to stand up and say ``I refuse to accept the vote,'' then you  have to have 60 votes. So in a majority Senate, 51 would clearly be  sufficient. Under a filibuster, 60 is required. There are 50 Democrats,  50 Republicans. Vice President Kamala Harris can be the tie-breaking  vote, the 51st vote. So the Republicans, by applying the filibuster  rule, could require 60 votes, which, of course, the Democrats by  themselves, even with the Vice President, couldn't come up with.   There was a statement made by Senator McConnell, the Republican  leader, yesterday which was nothing short of amazing. At a press  conference, he said of the filibuster: ``It has no racial history at  all--none.'' Amazing that he would say that.   If you go back and study the history of this body, John Caldwell  Calhoun, a Senator from South Carolina, started in the early parts of  the 19th century using this unlimited debate to protect slave States,  to protect the interests of the Southern States. That progressed in  history to the point where, in modern times, at least in the 20th  century, the filibuster was used consistently to stop federalization of  the crime of lynching. I don't know who would argue in Kentucky or  anywhere else that the crime of lynching has nothing to do with race,  but the filibuster was used to prevent the federalization of that  crime.   It was used in an effort to stop the bills that were trying to outlaw  a poll tax. Poll tax? That meant you had to pay to be able to vote. It  was used in the South to try to discourage African Americans from  voting. It clearly was racial, and the filibuster was used over and  over again to protect a vote on the Senate floor, this Senate floor,  from taking place on the poll tax.   Then fast-forward several decades to the 1960s. Richard Russell of  Georgia engineered--he was the architect, the legislative architect of  the filibuster that stopped the civil rights bills in the 1960s.  Certainly Senator McConnell, who was working in the Senate at that time  as an intern, if I am not mistaken, must remember the filibuster being  used against the civil rights bill. And to say that the filibuster  ``has no racial history at all--none'' is to ignore the obvious.   Here is the point we are getting to. Senator Schumer has said it on  the floor, and others have said it as well. We have to be productive in  this session of the Senate. After the last 4 years, we have seen the  Senate really break down to the point where they weren't productive at  all. We weren't productive at all.   There were 29 amendment votes in the last year of Senator McConnell's  reign as Republican leader. Twenty-nine amendment votes in 1 year? The  previous year under Senator McConnell: 22 amendment votes; no activity  on the floor of the Senate. We can't let that happen. There are things  that need to be done.   Let me mention, too, that one of them that certainly needs to be done  is to protec America's right to vote. The Senator from South Dakota  comes and says: Well, we had this big turnout on November 3, 2020, and  now the Democrats are meeting and talking about changing the voting  laws. Why would we want to change if we had such a big turnout?  [[Page S1727]]    He ignores what happened in between. After the election returns of  November 3, 2020, Republicans across the Nation, in 40 different  States, introduced hundreds of bills to limit people's right to vote.  That is why we are responding with this Federal response that is now  being considered in the Senate Rules Committee.   He missed part of the equation. It went from November 3rd's big  turnout to efforts in State legislatures to restrict turnout, to limit  the rights of people to vote across America, especially African  Americans and Latinos and those who are not wealthy--to limit their  right to vote. And then came this response on the Federal basis. That  is an important point. If we believed that the filibuster would not be  used against it, if there was some promise that it wouldn't be, we  certainly could bring that bill to the floor for debate, and we should,  if we are given that kind of assurance.    Madam President, reserving the right to object.    The Senator from Iowa tells us a compelling story of  Sarah Root, whose death at the hands of a drunk driver is a tragedy.  However, I respectfully suggest this legislation is not the answer.   This bill that she is proposing would require the mandatory detention  of immigrants charged--not convicted--charged with certain crimes. The  mere allegation of criminal conduct would result in months, possibly  years, of detention before case adjudication.   Indefinitely detaining immigrants, regardless of whether they  actually  [[Page S1734]]  committed a crime, regardless of circumstances, violates a principle  that is deeply embedded in the American legal system: innocent until  proven guilty. Under this bill, someone wrongly arrested wouldn't be  eligible for individualized bond determination. This is not consistent  with the basic tenets of due process in our Constitution.   Creating a new category of immigrants subject to indefinite detention  for being charged also could be harmful to the survivors of domestic  violence. Over 20 years ago, I was introduced to a group in Chicago.  The name of the group--and I am sorry if I don't pronounce it  correctly, pretty close--is Mujeres Latinas en Accion. This is a group  that came together to try to protect undocumented mothers and wives  from domestic abuse. The reason they came together was these poor women  were being victimized and abused in ways unthinkable and were so afraid  to report it to police because of their undocumented status. So this  group of women in the community came together and said: We have to  build a shelter. These women had to get away from their abusive  husbands who, many times, were also abusing the children. That is what  happened. Today it is still there, and it is still needed.   These survivors of domestic abuse, many times in desperation, would  finally strike back at the abusive husband, and some of them were even  subject to arrest for assault against the abusing husband. Under the  proposal today that is being suggested by the Senator from Iowa, that  woman, having been abused by that husband for so many years, finally  striking back and assaulting the husband and being charged, would  automatically be incarcerated. There wouldn't be a judge to consider  the reality of the circumstances in her life.   Survivors of human trafficking, sexual assault, and domestic violence  are often at risk of arrest initially, but many times in court, the  circumstances are explained, and a different conclusion is reached.   In one study, nearly half of the incarcerated women in the study  described assaults they had committed in their own defense. This bill  has no exception for immigrants who are charged with crimes that  resulted from their defending themselves against violence.   Let me add, too, that this bill is not necessary. Our immigration  laws give to ICE the authority to detain people who are deported. In  fact, there are thousands of people detained, right now, using this  authority.   There is no question that our immigration system is far from perfect  and is a broken system. We have a responsibility and we have authority  in Congress to reform our immigration law.   If the Senator from Iowa is interested in working on bipartisan  immigration reform, I welcome the opportunity to ask her to join us to  try to find pragmatic, bipartisan solutions. We had an initial meeting  today, a bipartisan meeting of Senators, to open the conversation. But  trying to pass this bill by unanimous consent is not the way to  approach this very complex problem. We need to roll up our sleeves and  say: Let's, as Senators on a bipartisan basis, do it.   I stand ready to do so. I hope the Senator from Iowa does too. As  tough as it may be, we need to tackle these issues and not ignore them  as they were for the last 4 years under the previous Republican  President.   For those reasons, I object    Reserving the right to object.    Madam President, we face a challenge at the border; there  is no question about it.   It really strikes me as strange--maybe unusual--for Members of the  Senate from the other side of the aisle to come and yearn for those  wonderful days of the Trump administration when it came to the issue of  immigration and border policy.   Remember when we had the longest government shutdown in history,  paralyzing immigration courts and other Agencies? It was, of course, a  shutdown that was sanctioned by the President of the United States over  his immigration demands.   Under President Trump, the Department of Homeland Security,  incidentally, experienced unprecedented leadership problems. The  Department of Homeland Security lurched from one Secretary or Acting  Secretary to the next. Listen to this: There were six different  Secretaries in that Agency in 4 years, only two Senate-confirmed--more  Agency heads in the last 4 years under President Trump than in the 13- year history of the Department of Homeland Security prior to President  Trump. They couldn't keep anybody on the job. They quit. They were  fired. Nobody could agree with this President's bizarre ideas on what  to do with immigration. Are we longing for a return to those days?   President Trump unlawfully diverted billions of dollars in Department  of Defense funds to build a wasteful, ineffective border wall, which  was supposed to be paid for by the Mexicans, if I remember, and then he  created a humanitarian crisis at the border with a policy known as zero  tolerance--zero tolerance.   I remember when Attorney General Sessions came before the American  people and actually quoted the Bible to justify the forcible removal of  infants, toddlers, and children from their parents' arms. Over 2,200  children were physically separated from their parents as part of the  zero tolerance policy.   It wasn't until a Federal court judge in Southern California finally  said to the Trump administration, ``I demand that you account for these  children, and I demand that you reunite them with their parents'' that  they set out to do it. Today, years later, years after zero tolerance,  there are still hundreds of children separated at that time who have  never been reunited with their parents.   Do we want to return to those wonderful days of the Trump  administration immigration policy? I don't think so. Children in cages,  children lost, adrift on the bureaucratic sea, doesn't speak well of  America's values.   President Trump tried to end asylum protections for children and  other vulnerable migrants. He cut aid to Central America, directly  harming efforts to fight poverty and violence in the region. More  refugees were driven to our border because the President shut down  legal avenues for immigration and blocked all assistance to stabilize  the Northern Triangle countries, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.   Now comes the Senator from Utah--and he and I have worked on  legislation together in the past. I know that we can find bipartisan  solutions. I don't think this approach is one of them, but perhaps it  is the beginning of a conversation.   The President's former Republican allies in Congress claim that the  real cause, the real problem behind immigration policy is humanitarian  protection for children. They claim that we  [[Page S1741]]  can protect children by overturning these humanitarian protections,  either that have been entered into in a consent decree in court or by  law, and subjecting children at the border to indefinite detention and  deportation without adequate due process. But there is no evidence that  this will deter desperate families from fleeing to our border.   There is one thing the Senator from Utah and I certainly agree on.  Many of these children and families are being horribly, horribly  exploited by coyotes and kidnappers and very bad people. Many of these  people and their children are suffering in unimaginable ways because of  this.   I renew the plea that has been given across Central America by this  administration: Don't send your people to our border. Don't send your  children to our border.   It is not something we should encourage under the circumstances. It  has to be orderly, and this is not in many respects.   There is no evidence that ending this humanitarian protection for  children will deter desperate families fleeing to our border.   The bill before us today includes no assurances that children will be  humanely treated or that they will be safe from violence once they are  deported. This notion that once these children come across the border  or are taken into custody by the U.S. Government, that sometime--2  weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks--later they are turned loose again does not  dispense our moral obligation. We want these children to be safe, and  that is what the laws are, the Flores decision and others.   This bill does nothing to address root causes that are causing  migrants to flee the Northern Triangle in record numbers. If people  were migrating because of so-called legal loopholes, they would be  coming to our southern border from all over the region.   Instead, the vast majority come from three countries: Honduras, El  Salvador, and Guatemala. Those countries have the highest homicide  rates, some of them, in the world, and girls face a constant threat of  sexual violence with little prosecution from local authorities. We are  doing desperate things because of the desperate situations in these  countries.   We are told by the Senator that we have to overturn the bipartisan  Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, which passed by  unanimous consent in the Senate and was signed into law by Republican  President George W. Bush. But the TVPRA ensures that the United States  meets its international obligations to protect unaccompanied children  seeking safe haven in our country. It was a response to bipartisan  concern that children apprehended by the Border Patrol were being  returned to countries where they might be exploited even more.   Under TVPRA, unaccompanied children from the Northern Triangle are  transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services and placed  in deportation proceedings, which gives them a chance to finally make  their case to a judge.   Consider Samuel and Amelie, siblings ages 3 and 6, from Honduras.  They arrived in the United States traumatized, ages 3 and 6. They said  nothing--silent. After being transferred to HHS, Amelie revealed that  both children had been raped by drug cartel members. Without TVPRA  protection, Samuel and Amelie would have been returned to Honduras and  almost certain further exploitation.   Democrats are trying to work on a bipartisan repair of this  immigration system. It is long overdue.   In 2019, after President Trump finally agreed to end the longest  government shutdown in history, Congress passed an omnibus  appropriations bill that included $414 million for humanitarian  assistance at the border and then passed an emergency supplemental for  $4.6 billion of additional funding to alleviate overcrowding in  detention facilities.   In 2018, Senate Democrats supported a bipartisan agreement, including  robust border security funding and dozens of provisions to strengthen  border security, but President Trump threatened to veto it and,  instead, pushed for his hardline plan with the largest cut in legal  immigration in almost a century.   When it comes to refugees, after World War II, when the United States  sadly turned away hundreds and thousands of ultimate victims of the  Holocaust and would not accept their refugee status, we set out to  prove to the world that we had learned a valuable lesson, and we led  the world in offering refugee status until President Trump, who brought  the numbers down to record low levels. That does not speak well for the  United States, or it shouldn't be a source of pride for anyone  reflecting this administration.   We need comprehensive immigration reform. I support it. Eight years  ago, in 2013, I was part of the Gang of 8, a bipartisan group of four  Republican and four Democratic Senators. We produced comprehensive  immigration reform legislation that passed the Senate 68 to 32. The  Senator from Utah voted against it. Unfortunately, Republicans who  controlled the House of Representatives refused to consider it.   So here is my invitation to the Senator from Utah and to everyone  else interested. Let us sit down again and write that bill. Let's do it  in a fashion that really does bring reform to our system.   I just talked at a bipartisan meeting on the subject earlier. One of  the Senators from a border State said: People in my State don't expect  the Federal Government to do anything because it has been so many years  since they have done anything.   It is time for us to prove them wrong. We have the authority. We have  the opportunity. We have the challenge.   Making this sort of request on the floor, I know, is symbolic, but I  have to say that it is not the symbolism we should follow, and I  object.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that cloture on  [[Page S1742]]  Calendar No. 30, the nomination of Adewale O. Adeyemo, to be Deputy  Secretary of the Treasury, be withdrawn and, notwithstanding rule XXII,  on Thursday, March 25, at a time to be determined by the majority  leader in consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate proceed  to executive session and vote on the nomination without intervening  action or debate; that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate; further, that no further motions be in order, that any related  statements be printed in the Record, that the President be immediately  notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative  session.    Mr. President, the clock struck 12, and the chaos of  whistles, bells, and sirens echoed down Michigan Avenue. All across  Chicago, you could hear--feel--the jubilance erupting in the streets.  Women of all ages sat on the hoods of Studebakers and Model Ts, waving  American flags as they rode through The Loop in celebration.   A decades-long fight for equality had finally come to an end. Just  days earlier, on August 26, 1920, U.S. Secretary of State Bainbridge  Colby had issued a proclamation. The 19th Amendment had been ratified,  and women in America had secured the right to vote, once and for all.  And though this victory was monumental, America still had a long way to  go.   Nearly a century later, on the morning of Saturday, November 7, 2020,  [[Page S1760]]  jubilance once again erupted in the streets of Chicago. Drivers honked  their horns all along Michigan Avenue, while passengers leaned out of  their windows, waving American flags. Joe Biden had finally been  declared the victor of the 2020 Presidential election, his running  mate: Kamala Harris, the first African-American and first woman Vice  President of the United States. The scene in Chicago was a fitting  tribute to the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment's ratification.   This month, America celebrates Women's History Month. And the people  of my State are proud of the leading role Illinois has played in  America's long struggle for gender equality. In 2018, Illinois  lawmakers ratified the Equal Rights Amendment. Our State attorney  general, along with the attorneys general of two other States, is now  pressing in Federal court for the ERA to be officially recognized as  the 28th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, as it should be.   We are proud of the remarkable women our State has produced. Some  were Illinoisans by birth, others by choice. They include Ida B. Wells,  the courageous journalist, anti-lynching leader, and suffragist; Jane  Addams, the first American woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize and a  cofounder of the Hull House, a Chicago landmark; Mamie Till Mobley, a  mother who forced the world to reckon with the brutality of racism when  she opened the casket of her only son, Emmett; Betty Friedan, author of  ``The Feminine Mystique,'' a book that inspired a new wave of American  feminism; Gwendolyn Brooks, poet laureate of Illinois from 1968 until  her death in 2000 and the first Black woman inducted into the American  Academy of Arts and Letters; Sandra Cisneros, a renowned writer and  educator whose work is taught in classrooms across the country; Jeanne  Gang, a world-class architect whose work graces the skyline of Chicago,  including the tallest building in the world designed by a woman, the  St. Regis Chicago; Jackie Joyner-Kersee, one of the world's greatest  track and field athletes and the founder of the Jackie Joyner-Kersee  Foundation, which offers athletic and educational programming to kids  in my hometown of East St. Louis, IL; Precious Brady-Davis, an  environmentalist and transgender woman who has shed light on the  experiences of transgender parents; Oprah Winfrey, the host of a  daytime talk show you may have heard of--her career as a talk show host  actually began on ``A.M. Chicago''; Hillary Clinton, the first woman to  be nominated for President by a major political party, she may have  represented New York in the U.S. Senate, but her roots are firmly  planted in Park Ridge, IL; Michelle Obama, another former First Lady  who broke barriers--she is the pride of Chicago's South Side, and I am  grateful to call her a friend; and my colleague in this body, Senator  Tammy Duckworth, an American hero.   In 2018, the people of Illinois elected Juliana Stratton as our 48th  Lieutenant Governor, the first woman of color ever elected to hold a  constitutional office in our State. She is a dynamo and part of a new  generation of women who are taking their rightful place as political  leaders in our Nation. In the 2020 elections, women across America  turned out in historic numbers, and voters elected a record number of  women to higher office.   But we still have a long way to go. America lags well behind other  developed nations when it comes to gender equality in our government.  Women account for fewer than 30 percent of our representatives in  either Chamber of Congress. Countries like Finland, Sweden, and New  Zealand are far closer to 50 percent, meaning complete gender parity.   So it is certainly welcome news that President Biden has nominated 12  women for Cabinet and Cabinet-level positions, including Janet Yellen,  the first female Secretary of Treasury, and Congresswoman Deb Haaland,  who would be the first Native American to ever serve as a Cabinet  Secretary.   While the past year has been one of historic triumph for women, it  has also been one of unprecedented challenge. The pandemic has  disproportionately devastated women. In December, the Bureau of Labor  Statistics reported that the United States lost 140,000 jobs in a  single month. A staggering number that is even worse than it seems,  women accounted for every single one of those job losses. Men,  meanwhile, managed to gain 16,000 jobs that month.   Working women, and especially working women of color, have been  hardest hit by this pandemic. When schools across the country were  forced to shut their doors, these women were thrust into the dual roles  of breadwinner and primary caregiver. They shouldered the burden of  keeping our families and children safe. This is essential work. And  just as frontline workers need PPE to safely do their jobs, working  mothers need economic relief to do theirs.   That is what the American Rescue Plan President Biden signed into law  this month delivers. It expands the child tax credit, offering up to  $3,600 per child; it invests in our families, by increasing the value  of SNAP benefits and expanding childcare assistance; and it gives every  working American $1,400. The American Rescue Plan will help working  mothers weather this once-in-a-century public health and economic  crisis.   After a year of COVID lockdowns and losses, America is finally  beginning to feel a sense of hope that the end of this pandemic is  coming, and looking at the headlines, it is hard not to share that  optimism.   Under President Biden, we are vaccinating more than 2 million  Americans a day. As of last week, more people in the United States have  been fully vaccinated than our total number of coronavirus cases since  the beginning of the pandemic. By the beginning of summer, we should  have a large enough supply of vaccines to inoculate every adult in  America. This is one of the greatest scientific feats in modern  history.   A major reason we were able to develop COVID-19 vaccines at such  lightning-fast speed is because of the pioneering research conducted  over decades by a brilliant scientist, one of the unsung heroes of our  world. Her name is Katalin Kariko. Like many American heroes, she is an  immigrant. She began her research in a lab in Hungary, when it was  still under Communist rule. Back then, she believed that synthetic  messenger RNA could hold the key to treating some of the world's most  debilitating diseases.   She followed that dream across continents, immigrating to the United  States in the 1980s. But people--and, let's be honest, men--doubted her  at every turn. Her grants were rejected. She faced demotions. She was  even threatened with deportation. One of the few institutions that  supported Katalin's work was the National Institutes of Health. The  experts at NIH didn't just follow the science; they supported the  visionary behind the science. And that investment paid off. Her  research into messenger RNA eventually blazed a trail for the Moderna  and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, which are helping curb the spread of  COVID-19 at this very moment.   As we turn the corner of this pandemic, let us remember that it was  not a miracle that got us here. It was science. It was dedication. It  was the work of trailblazers like Katalin Kariko.   As I mentioned, Betty Friedan is one of the great women leaders to  come out of Illinois. In her seminal work, ``The Feminine Mystique,''  she asked: ``Who knows what women can be when they are finally free to  become themselves?''   As we celebrate women's history, let us also renew our commitment to  investing in women's futures. Who knows how many Katalin Karikos are  out there, ready to change the world?   For our own good, for the good of humankind, let's ensure every woman  has an opportunity to ``become themselves.''                            ____________________     Mr. President, as a Member of Congress, I have cast a  number of important votes over the years, votes on whether to send our  Nation's brave servicemembers to war or to impeach a President, but  perhaps the most important vote I have ever cast was 11 years ago this  week, in support of the Affordable Care Act.   Since the law's passage in 2010, the ACA has provided health  insurance to more than 23 million Americans, including nearly 1 million  Illinoisans. That is almost 1 out of every 20 people  [[Page S1761]]  living in my home State. Thanks to the ACA, they are now covered. That  measure was called the Affordable Care Act for a reason: It is  estimated to have saved every family in America about $4,000 in health  insurance premiums.   I don't think any of us could have predicted 11 years ago just how  important the protections it guaranteed to Americans would become. Then  came the coronavirus. In the year since the pandemic was declared, the  virus has claimed more than half a million American lives. That is more  than the number of American lives lost in World War I, World War II,  and the Vietnam war combined.   We grieve with every family who has suffered a loss, and we know  there are millions more Americans who have been affected by the virus.  Thirty million of our family members, friends, colleagues, and  neighbors have been diagnosed with COVID-19. That is 30 million  Americans who are now living with a preexisting condition. We have  heard stories about the so-called long-haulers, individuals who report  they are still having health problems months after their original  diagnosis. They are struggling with shortness of breath, trouble  sleeping, severe fatigue, and other symptoms that NIH Director Dr.  Francis Collins has deemed a ``significant public health concern.''   These Americans have enough to worry about as it is with their  recovery; could you imagine if they also had to worry about being able  qualify for health coverage? In a world without the ACA, they would  have. Before the ACA was the law of the land, people could be denied  health coverage or charged significantly higher premiums for having  diabetes or asthma--even acne.   Could you imagine if this pandemic hit before we passed that law? The  tens of millions of Americans who would have to wonder how they were  going to pay for their care, their children's care, in the middle of a  pandemic?   Thanks to the ACA, they are covered. It has been a lifeline for  millions of Americans, like Michelle Crifasi, one of my neighbors in  Springfield, IL. Recently, Michelle wrote to me about what the ACA has  meant for her and her family. For much of her life, Michelle was  burdened with an unknown illness, until she was finally diagnosed with  common variable immune deficiency in her mid-thirties. It is a rare  condition that limits the immune system's ability to fight infection.  The diagnosis was bittersweet. While she could finally begin to  understand and treat her condition, she later learned that she had  passed it down to her daughter. Her husband also developed it after  undergoing cancer treatment.   The good news is that Michelle and her family have health insurance  through her employer, and because of the Affordable Care Act, this  employer-based health plan can no longer deny Michelle health coverage  or charge her higher premiums because she has a preexisting condition.  Her insurer can no longer impose annual or lifetime caps on her care.  It can't cut her off right when she needs healthcare the most.  Michelle's daughter, Meredith, a junior at the University of Illinois- Springfield, is able to stay on her parents' plan until age 26. Because  of the ACA, Michelle's health plan must cover her family's prescription  drug costs.   Without insurance coverage, treating common variable immune  deficiency can cost patients more than $100,000 a year. Put simply,  these protections were not in place before the Affordable Care Act, and  Michelle and her family are alive today because of these protections.  This family's story is proof that the ACA is one of the greatest  legislative accomplishments in modern American history, and it is also  proof that there is a lot more we can do to protect people like her and  her family.   While Michelle is grateful for the ACA, she recently told me that ``I  feel there is more work to be done.'' And she is right, which is why we  fought, as part of the American Rescue Plan, to expand health insurance  subsidies and eligibility for plans covered under the ACA. These  provisions will ensure that no enrollee spends more than 8.5 percent of  their income on health insurance premiums. The typical 60-year-old  couple in Illinois could see their premiums reduced by $1,300.   The ARP also increases eligibility for premium subsidies to working- class American families earning more than 400 percent of the Federal  poverty level.   Outside of the ARP, the Biden-Harris administration has taken other  steps to bolster the ACA, like creating a special open enrollment  period and ensuring that the DOJ defends the law in the case before the  Supreme Court. All of this is welcome news, and I look forward to  working with the Biden-Harris administration to accomplish even more.  That is why we not only celebrate the historic passage of the ACA but  all of the lives it has saved as well.   After years of unrelenting, unjustified attacks on this critical  piece of legislation, we are finally in a position to build on it. I am  ready to work with the Biden-Harris administration to create a public  option, lower prescription drug prices, and address racial and ethnic  disparities in our healthcare system.
