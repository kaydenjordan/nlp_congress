 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include  any extraneous material on the subject of my special order.    Mr. Speaker, 10 months ago, I was pleased to welcome David  Pulphus, a very talented young constituent of mine from St. Louis, to  the U.S. Capitol complex, as we unveiled his painting entitled,  Untitled #1, which you see here tonight.   David's work was a unanimous first-place winner in the annual  Congressional Art Competition in Missouri's First Congressional  District. I have been pleased to sponsor this competition in St. Louis  for the last 16 years without interruption and incident.   For those of you who may not know, many other Members of Congress  conduct this contest in their districts as well. In fact, this painting  was one of more than 400 student entries from across the Nation that  were reviewed, accepted, and approved last June for public display in  the Cannon tunnel by the Architect of the Capitol. Members of Congress  do not select the artists. We do not approve or disapprove of any of  the artistic concepts, and we have no role in judging the competition.   We simply provide a public forum for the most talented young artists  in our districts to display their winning artwork in the U.S. Capitol  complex. Yet, without cause or reasonable process and after being  viewed repeatedly by Members of Congress, congressional staffers, and  thousands of visitors without incident or concern, my constituent's  winning entry was removed in an act of politically motivated,  unconstitutional, retroactive censorship.   That injustice was initiated by pressure from certain alternative- right bloggers and Mr. Eric Bolling, a host on FOX News channel, who  created a mean-spirited and factually inaccurate media campaign to  improve his ratings on the back of a young man, and to ultimately force  the painting to be removed by the Architect of the Capitol.   After repeated acts of petty theft by renegade Members of Congress  who removed the painting without any authorization and after a storm of  rightwing media pressure, the Speaker of the House forced the Architect  of the Capitol to trample on the rights of my constituent by ruling  that this painting, which he had already approved 10 months ago, was  retroactively disqualified.   This unwarranted, arbitrary, and unconstitutional act of censorship  will not stand. Now, let me be clear: I do not approve or disapprove of  this painting. I did not approve or disapprove the concept of the  artwork. I did not judge the competition, but the Architect of the  Capitol reviewed, approved, and accepted this student's artwork for  public display without incident, comment, or concern, just like every  other entry that is displayed in this public exhibition.   Only after the most hateful, intolerant, and reckless media campaign,  combined with enormous political pressure from the Speaker and other  Members, the Architect of the Capitol miraculously traveled back in  time to disqualify the very same painting that he had approved 10  months ago.   Perhaps we should advise the National Academy of Sciences of the  Architect of the Capitol's newfound ability to bend the space-time  continuum in order to retroactively respond to the most extreme voices  in the majority so that they could more easily suppress the rights of  my young constituent. It did great harm to an innocent young man who  tried to do the right thing.   Because of this outrageous act of censorship, David Pulphus has been  subjected to the most vile, racist, and hateful attacks on social media  and on talk radio. He has also been deprived of the honor of listing  his first place victory in the Congressional Art Competition on his  resume. He has even been attacked by the Speaker of the House who  called his award winning work ``disgusting.''   So on top of depriving David of his First Amendment rights, the  majority and the Architect of the Capitol have placed a terrible  personal burden on this bright, talented young man. David does not  deserve that. That is wrong. That is totally unacceptable, and the  Speaker and the Architect of the Capitol should be ashamed of  themselves.   This shameful decision also sent a chilling message to young  Americans. It told young Americans that their views are not valued.  Their voices are not respected. Their creativity and passions are not  welcome, and that is, sadly, here, in the people's House, their First  Amendment rights are no longer protected. That is a terrible precedent  to set for future generations who look to us to defend their freedoms.   So my friends, this is really not about a student art competition  anymore. It is about defending the Constitution. It is just pathetic  that some Republican Members and rightwing media types who constantly  refer to  [[Page H2881]]  themselves as constitutional conservatives don't think that that same  document protects the fundamental free speech rights of my young  constituent.   You can be certain that I will fight to defend this young man's right  to express himself because his artwork is true for him, and he is  entitled to that protection under the law.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Michigan, the ranking  member of the House Judiciary Committee.   At this time, I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms.  Adams), my friend, an art education Ph.D., a gallery owner and artist,  and member of the Congressional Arts Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina  for  [[Page H2883]]  her thoughts, her words, as well as her expertise in the field of art.  She is probably the only qualified art critic serving in Congress  today. So thank I thank her so much.    Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee  (Mr. Cohen), my friend, an attorney and former legal adviser to the  Memphis Police Department.    Mr. Speaker, let me also thank my friend from Tennessee who  happens to be a member of the House Judiciary Committee. As he stated,  we are working together on police reform legislation. I appreciate his  services.    Mr. Speaker, he is an art critic.   Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Raskin), my friend, a Constitutional scholar and professor.    Mr. Speaker, let me thank my friend from Maryland who, as  we heard, his 25 years of knowledge on the U.S. Constitution bodes well  for this entire body, and I appreciate his friendship and his support.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms.  Schakowsky), a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms.  Kaptur), my friend and dean of the Ohio delegation.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Ohio. I certainly  appreciate her support.   In closing, let me say that the student artist in question, my  constituent, David Pulphus, is a great young man. He is academically  gifted, artistically talented, and is now a freshman in college. He is  doing everything that we encourage young Americans to do to become  successful citizens.   His winning entry is a colorful, symbolic representation of the great  anger, pain, frustration, and deep deficit in trust for local law  enforcement that many young African Americans feel in their hearts. The  painting also reflects generations of struggle, sacrifice, abuse of  power, and tenuous relationships between minorities and a system of  justice that still provides equal justice for some, but not for all.                                time  1700    So the larger, much more fundamental question is: Why does this young  American feel that way, and what can we do as leaders of a  compassionate and just nation to finally remedy that?   I am so thankful for the remarkable public service of my exceptional  pro bono legal team who are guiding this case, including Dr. Laurence  Tribe of Harvard University School of Law, Dr. Erwin Chemerinsky of the  University of California, Irvine School of Law, and others. As a Member  of Congress who reveres the Constitution, I am confident that freedom  and justice will prevail.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
