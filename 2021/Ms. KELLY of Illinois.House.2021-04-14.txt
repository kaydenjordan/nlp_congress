 Mr. Speaker, the past year has been tough for  many of us but especially difficult for seniors. Many have lost friends  and loved ones from the COVID-19 pandemic.   Increased isolation and dependence on digital resources have put  extra burdens on millions of Americans.   From frantic calls of, ``Grandma, I am in the hospital sick with  COVID. Please wire money right away,'' to calls from supposed Good  Samaritans offering to run errands and then pocketing the money,  scammers are using the pandemic to take advantage of vulnerable  populations. They are preying on fear and uncertainty to steal money  and personal information or sell fraudulent services or products.   One of the best ways to prevent seniors from falling victim to scams  is to supply them with the information they need. That is why H.R. 446  requires the FTC to report on the number and type of scams that target  older adults. It also will have the Commission's web portal updated  with current information about such scams and coordination with media  outlets and law enforcement to disseminate scam information. Seniors  need to know what scams are happening in their areas so they can  protect themselves.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Balderson for joining me in  leading this legislation and Chairman Pallone for his support in  advancing legislation to protect our seniors.
