 Mr. President, today we mark the 18th anniversary of  the September 11th attacks. We remember the nearly-3,000 people who  lost their lives. We pray for all of the 9/11 victims and their  families. We honor our 9/11 heroes. They were the brightest lights that  day in the dark sky--our brave firefighters, police, service men and  women. So many Americans gave their lives to save lives that day, and  we pay tribute to them today.   Congress has passed new laws to care for 9/11 first responders. We  recently  [[Page S5436]]  made the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund permanent. This ensures that all  those who responded to the terror attacks and their families have peace  of mind and first-rate healthcare.
