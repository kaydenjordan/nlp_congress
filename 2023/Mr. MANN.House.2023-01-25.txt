 Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss my plans for  representing the Big First District in the 118th Congress.   As I have said on this House floor before, the Big First is the  geographic center and the pilot light of America because there, the  values that make America great are still alive and well: faith, family,  freedom, and personal responsibility. We are farmers, ranchers, feed  lot managers, businessowners, lenders, bankers, teachers, doctors,  nurses, and parents.   My job is to serve and advocate for the people of the Big First,  which is why I am excited and grateful to have been appointed to the  House Agriculture, House Transportation and Infrastructure, and House  Small Business Committees.   As a farm kid and a fifth-generation Kansan, I am honored to serve on  the House Agriculture Committee again in the 118th Congress.  Agriculture is the largest economic driver of the Big First. We rank  number one in beef, wheat, and sorghum production. When I meet with  farmers, ranchers, and agriculture producers, I hear about skyrocketing  inflation and record-high input costs, labor shortages, government  overreach, and the importance of reauthorizing the farm bill.   We need well-crafted farm and food policy in America to remain secure  as a Nation, and the reauthorization of the farm bill is an enormous  responsibility. My priorities for that legislation remain the same: to  protect and strengthen crop insurance, promote trade, and stop  regulatory overreach. I am committed to rolling up my sleeves and  working for the men and women who feed, fuel, and clothe the world.   I am also honored to serve on the House Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee. The Big First has 83,000 miles of road, seven  commercial airports, and more than 4,000 miles of railroad tracks. We  rely on this system to get to work, take our kids to school, and  deliver food, fuel, and fiber to the rest of the world.   The people of the Big First deserve a voice on the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee and I am proud to be their spokesperson. A  well-maintained, fiscally responsible infrastructure network supports  economic activity, strengthens the supply chain, and helps America to  remain a global power.   During this Congress, I will also serve on the House Small Business  Committee. The Big First is home to more than 200,000 small businesses  which employ 80 percent of all employees in the district.   Small businesses help drive the American economy and define the  American dream. They add brick and mortar to the values that make our  country unique, like freedom, self-determination, and the pursuit of  happiness.   As a child, I learned about the responsibility, drive, and  decisionmaking skills required to run a small business from watching my  parents operate our preconditioning feedlot and family farm. I will  continue to defend and support small businesses, their owners,  employees, and the American values that small businesses embody.   I am honored to serve on these committees, and we have a lot of work  to do. Over the next 2 years, we need to reauthorize the farm bill,  develop new trade agreements with countries that will benefit American  ag producers, and review the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act.  We need to reauthorize FAA and the Water Resources Development Act,  protect producers from a burdensome and overreaching definition of  waters of the United States, and ensure that our small and regional  airports have the support they need. We also need to maintain the  stepped-up basis, return money to small businesses from IRS watchdogs,  and ensure that small businesses have a fair shot at government  contracts.   I will be working on a wide variety of issues, but I am bringing the  same approach to all of them. A Russell native, Senator Bob Dole once  told me about the Kansas approach: honesty; hard work; respect for your  roots; service; simplicity; genuine, thoughtful care for people; and  just plain common sense.   I learned these Kansan conservative values as a kid in the Big First,  they inspire my work today on all my committees, and they will always  guide my steps here in Congress.   Ultimately, I believe that with prayer and hard work, our brightest  days are yet to come.  [[Page H287]]                                ____________________
