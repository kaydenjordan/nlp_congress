 Madam President, as Israel continues to root out the  Hamas terrorists who savaged innocent civilians on October 7, the  political left here in America appears to be engaged in a loud public  debate with itself over how, exactly, to differentiate indiscriminate  slaughter and lawful self-defense.   Last week, an especially radical House Democrat repeated to her  followers a call to eliminate the Jewish State ``from the river to the  sea.'' Then she attempted to explain away the undeniably genocidal  connotation of this longstanding anti-Israel slogan as ``peaceful  coexistence.''   Apparently, Jews can live in peace with Palestinians as long as they  vacate Israel.   Unfortunately, the shameful moral equivalence that has been creeping  across elite and influential corners of the left has now been embraced  by a former Commander in Chief. Just a few  [[Page S5348]]  days ago, President Obama used the same breath to express his horror at  both Hamas violence and a supposed Israeli ``occupation'' of Gaza. In  reality, the only force that has occupied Gaza since 2007 is Hamas, not  Israel.   The former President also said ``all of us are complicit to some  degree.'' That is simply false. Responsibility lies with the  terrorists.   So perhaps President Obama has forgotten the bloody campaign to  defeat ISIS over which he presided or the destruction of cities like  Mosul and Raqqa in pursuit of medieval Islamic tyrants who terrorized  innocent civilians.   I don't recall President Obama doubting the righteousness of American  efforts to support local partners in rooting out terrorists in Iraq and  Syria. Where is that moral clarity in the face of Hamas?   Unfortunately, that brings me to the growing number of many of our  Senate colleagues who have called for a ceasefire in today's terrorist  war. I would remind our colleagues that Israel had negotiated a  ceasefire with Hamas over the summer, and we all saw where that led on  October 7. Returning to any such arrangement right now would be amnesty  for these butchers--the butchers of innocent Israelis and Gazans alike.   Once again, let's remember who the aggressor is. Hamas is blocking  citizens from leaving Gaza City. Hamas has intentionally put its  weapons caches inside schools, hospitals, and mosques, and its firing  positions in the midst of civilian populations. Hamas has poured  countless billions of dollars in humanitarian assistance into its  terror tunnels.   These people are not freedom fighters. They do not want peaceful  coexistence. They are savages--savages--cut from the same cloth as ISIS  and al-Qaida. There is no room for moral equivalency. The distinction  between good and evil here is blindingly obvious.   Fortunately, some do recognize this. The Vice Chancellor of Germany,  a member of his country's Green Party, didn't have any trouble finding  the moral clarity this moment requires. In an address to the nation  last week, he said:         Hamas does not want reconciliation with Israel, but the       extermination of Israel. And this is why it is pivotal to       make it clear that Israel's right to exist must not be       relativized. Israel's security is our obligation.    American politicians who cannot bring themselves to acknowledge the  same should really be ashamed of themselves.   This weekend marked 44 years since Iranian revolutionaries overran  the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 66 Americans hostage. Today,  Americans are once again held hostage by forces aligned with Iranian  tyranny. Many more Israelis are held alongside them, and Israel  deserves the time and space and support it needs to bring these  terrorist captors to justice.   In the days immediately following October 7, I warned that President  Biden would be pressured to withhold this support, and that familiar  and morally bankrupt calls for ceasefire would threaten Israel's  ability to see its defensive operations through. And so here we are,  nearly a month later, watching the movement to grant Hamas amnesty  reach the highest levels of our government.   War is a bloody business. That is the reality Israel faces. We should  be careful before second-guessing their efforts to get innocent  Israelis--and Americans--home safely and to destroy Hamas's ability to  wage war.
