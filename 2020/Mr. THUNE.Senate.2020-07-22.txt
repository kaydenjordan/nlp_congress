 Mr. President, before I begin, I would like to take a  moment to honor Congressman John Lewis, who died on Friday. A leader of  the civil rights movement, he was one of the 13 original Freedom Riders  and an organizer of the 1963 March on Washington. He was a man of  conscience, conviction, and supreme courage.   ``When you see something that is not right, not fair, not just, you  have to speak up. You have to do something,'' he would say.   John Lewis did something. Confronted by the great sin of segregation,  John Lewis put himself front and center in the fight. He organized sit- ins. He led demonstrations. He marched for  [[Page S4386]]  freedom. And he paid for his convictions with his blood. A man who  espoused nonviolence, he suffered incredible brutality at the hands of  both police officers and civilian mobs. He was attacked and beaten an  untold number of times   During a march in Selma, AL--on a day that lives in infamy--a police  officer fractured John Lewis's skull, leaving him with a scar that he  carried to the end of his life. Yet John Lewis was unbowed. No matter  how many times he was attacked or what he suffered, he got up again and  rejoined the fight.   His death is a great loss, but John Lewis will live on in the annals  of American heroes. May we all have his courage in fighting for the  right.                                 Coronavirus    Mr. President, so far, Congress has provided $2.4 trillion to fight  the coronavirus. Over the past couple of months here in the Senate, we  have been closely tracking the implementation of this money and working  with the administration on disbursement.   In June alone, we held 30 hearings in the Senate on COVID-related  issues. All of this has helped us identify the priorities that need to  shape our next bill, which we are hoping to pass in the next couple of  weeks. Those priorities are kids, jobs, and healthcare.   First, kids: Getting kids back in school safely needs to be a  priority. Being able to attend school in person is important for  students' academic development and for their social and emotional well- being.   The American Academy of Pediatrics has stated: ``All policy  considerations for the coming school year should start with a goal of  having students physically present in school.''   Now, not every school may be able to fully reopen this fall, but we  need to make sure that those schools that can reopen have the resources  they need to reopen safely. That is why the legislation the Republicans  are drafting here in the Senate would provide more than $100 billion to  help schools ensure they have what they need to safely welcome students  back to class.   While our first priority in getting kids back to school is ensuring  their academic and social well-being, getting students back in school  is also important for families' economic health. There are a lot of  parents in this country who can't afford to have one parent stay home  to homeschool. We need to ensure that those parents have access to  schools and childcare wherever possible so that they can keep or return  to their jobs.   Enabling Americans to return to work is key to our economic recovery.  Currently, there are more than 17 million unemployed Americans. While  this is a significant improvement from where we were 2 months ago, that  number is still much too high, and we have to do everything we can to  get these Americans back on the job and receiving a regular paycheck.   That is why the legislation we are drafting will provide incentives  for businesses to hire and to retain workers. It will provide a  refundable tax credit for Main Street businesses for the protective  equipment and cleaning supplies that they need to keep their employees  and customers safe and to encourage Americans to return to their  businesses. It will provide another round of assistance to small  businesses, with a focus on those that have been hit the hardest by the  pandemic.   We also expect to issue another round of direct payments to hard- working Americans to help them get back on their feet and to stimulate  the economy.   The third bucket of our coronavirus response is, of course,  healthcare. We have to keep ensuring our healthcare professionals have  the resources needed to treat patients, develop new treatments, and to  find a vaccine to tame this virus once and for all.   The coronavirus legislation that we are drafting will address all  three of those priorities.   Our legislation will also include another important priority that  will protect jobs, schools, businesses, and healthcare workers, and  that is liability protections. No matter how many precautions schools  and businesses take, there is no way for them to completely eliminate  all risk of employees, students, or customers contracting the virus,  but an army of trial lawyers is waiting to levy lawsuits against even  the most careful schools and businesses.   There is absolutely no question that schools and businesses should be  liable for gross negligence or for intentional misconduct, but  businesses and schools that are taking every reasonable precaution to  protect employees and students and customers should not have to worry  about facing lawsuits for virus transmission that they could not have  prevented.   Healthcare workers giving their all on the frontlines to treat  coronavirus patients should not have to worry that their efforts will  be rewarded with lawsuits.   I would like to think that we can put a bipartisan bill together and  get it to the President's desk in the next couple of weeks. Republicans  are ready and willing to work with Democrats to get this done. We will  introduce our draft shortly and be ready to negotiate with Democrats to  arrive at a final bill, the same process that we followed with the  CARES Act, our largest coronavirus relief bill to date.   This will work only if Democrats are willing to come to the table and  negotiate a reasonable bill. My Democratic colleagues sometimes behave  as if government money is drawn from a magical pot of gold that will  never run out, but it is not. It is not.   Every dollar of the coronavirus funding we provided so far has been  borrowed money, and every dollar we appropriate in the phase 4 bill we  are drafting will likely be borrowed money as well.   It can be argued that it is money we need to borrow, but we need to  remember that it is borrowed money and that the bill for that money  will eventually come due. The more we drive up our debt, the greater  the threat to the health of our economy, not to mention to the economic  future of today's younger workers. We have an obligation to them to  limit our borrowing to what is absolutely necessary to fight the virus.   The Democratic leader has come down to the floor the past couple of  days and suggested that the Heroes Act--a $3 trillion coronavirus bill  the House passed is--``a good product to start with'' when it comes to  a phase 4 coronavirus relief bill.   That is ludicrous. The bill the Democratic leader is promoting--the  bill he thinks is a good starting point for coronavirus legislation--is  a bill that mentions cannabis--cannabis more often than it mentions the  word ``jobs.''   Let me just repeat that. The bill the Democratic leader thinks is a  good starting point for coronavirus relief legislation mentions the  word ``cannabis'' more often than it mentions the word ``job.''   While the Democratic leader is certainly welcome to disagree with me,  I don't think diversity studies in the cannabis industry have a major  role to play in defeating this virus or getting Americans back to work,  nor does federalizing election law--another priority the Democrats  included in their bill.   Despite its $3 trillion pricetag, the bill the Democratic leader is  endorsing fails to meet one of the most basic requirements of any  coronavirus relief bill, and that is providing a meaningful plan for  getting Americans back to work. It is disappointing to hear the  Democratic leader promoting such an unserious piece of legislation at a  time that we should be devoting all of our efforts to getting a  bipartisan bill to the President.   I hope my other Democratic colleagues in the Senate are ready to look  beyond partisan wish lists and focus on negotiating a relief package  that addresses the real priorities we are facing: helping kids and  parents, getting Americans back to work, and providing the healthcare  resources needed to fight this virus.   Republicans are ready to come to the table, and I urge Democrats to  join us.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 4275         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
