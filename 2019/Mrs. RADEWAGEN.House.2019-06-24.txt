 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2109, introduced by  Representative Rice of New York.   Mr. Speaker, to improve employment opportunities for veterans and  business opportunities for the companies that employ them, H.R. 2109  would authorize the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, to consider the  number of veterans who would be employed by a potential contractor and  give the company that employs certain veterans credit for doing so  during the contract approval process.   The bill would also allow VA to debar any contractor who willfully  and intentionally misrepresents the number of veterans they employ.   Mr. Speaker, thanks to President Trump and Republican pro-growth  policies, the veteran unemployment rate is at a near historic low of  2.7 percent.   I firmly believe that we should encourage businesses to provide job  opportunities to veterans as well as provide VA with the authority to  consider veteran hires when making contracting decisions. This  legislation emphasizes that.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Rice for her work on this bill,  which has my full support. I urge all my colleagues to support H.R.  2109.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2196. This bill, which  is introduced by an outstanding new member of our committee,  Representative Barr of Kentucky, would clarify the eligibility for the  Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship program.   This program, enacted as part of the Forever GI Bill, authorizes  extra GI bill funding to help veterans complete their undergraduate  degrees in a STEM field.                                time  1515    Mr. Speaker, we all know about the need to fill vacancies for high- paying jobs in the STEM field. The Smithsonian Science Education Center  projected that, in 2018, 2.4 million STEM jobs went unfilled. This  program is critical to ensure that veterans are the ones who fill these  vacancies. However, because of the way the law was drafted, most  students are prevented from using this new benefit due to a technical  glitch that excludes all but a few STEM programs.   With this program going live on August 1, just over a month from now,  I am grateful to Representative Barr for quickly stepping up to the  plate and offering this bill to fix the law's language. Hopefully, with  cooperation from our friends in the Senate, we can make this change  before August.   I encourage all Members to support H.R. 2196.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.  Barr).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
