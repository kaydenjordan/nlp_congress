 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the TRID  Improvement Act, bipartisan legislation introduced by the gentleman  from Arkansas (Mr. Hill).   I am a proud cosponsor of this legislation, which combines three  bipartisan proposals that will improve the home buying process, protect  intellectual property, and help emerging businesses thrive and create  jobs. By reforming confusing regulations that make it difficult for  prospective buyers or businesses to get title insurance, this  legislation will help get more families into homes and help local  businesses grow.   By protecting the intellectual property of investors, we are  improving the access to capital that is essential for growth and job  creation in communities on Long Island, where my district is located,  and all across our country.   And last but not least, by reforming the outdated definition of what  constitutes an emerging growth company, this legislation takes  important steps towards fostering innovation and ensuring that new  businesses are not discouraged from expansion and job creation.   The sum of these important bipartisan solutions are more innovation,  more hiring, and a more vibrant economy. I urge all of my colleagues to  vote for this important piece of legislation. I thank my colleague,  Congressman Hill, for his leadership with it, and Chairman Hensarling  and his great staff for all their efforts to get this bill to the  floor.
