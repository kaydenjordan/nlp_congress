 Mr. President, today, I want to honor CW3 Stephen R.  Dwyer, who lost his life during an MH-60 Blackhawk crash in the  Mediterranean Sea earlier this month.   Steve graduated in 2004 from Enterprise High School in Alabama. He  then followed in his parents' footsteps, both Army veterans, and  attended the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. He became a field  artillery commissioned officer, but his true passion was flying. So  Steve returned to Fort Rucker for flight school, becoming a helicopter  pilot. During his time in the military, Steve fulfilled multiple  missions around the world, including two deployments to the Middle  East.   He is remembered as an exceptional pilot, devoted husband, and loving  father. His supervisor at West Point Mark Ray said, ``Steve Dwyer was  an incredible man, son, brother, teammate, and friend. He was a  dedicated Special Operations warrior, who went above and beyond to  serve our nation in the most difficult missions at hand. He was born  into a family of servant leaders and died `For your freedom and mine'-- an act that our nation was created through and defended by today. He  will be truly missed by all that knew him. `Night Stalkers Don't Quit!'  ''   Steve leaves behind his wife Allie, three boys, parents, and  countless other family and friends. We are deeply grateful for his  heroic sacrifice to our country.                            ____________________
