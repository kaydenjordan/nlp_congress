 Madam President, it has been 150 years since  bighorn sheep have roamed the Tribal lands of the Fort Berthold  Reservation in northwestern North Dakota. At the end of January, the  sheep returned.   Their re-introduction to lands they had inhabited for centuries was a  long-held goal of many tribal leaders and state wildlife professionals.  Their dream was realized when the Mandan Hidatsa and Arikara Nation and  the North Dakota Game and Fish Department worked out a cooperative  agreement, which they signed last month.   Thirty bighorn sheep from the Rocky Boy Reservation in north central  Montana were brought to Fort Berthold and released near Mandaree and  Twin Buttes on reservation habitat known to be ideal for the sheep.  Their management and maintenance will be shared between the state and  tribe.   The rarest big game species in my state, bighorn sheep are found only  on steep terrain near the North Dakota Badlands. With these new sheep,  their total population in the state is now approximately 360.   Bighorn sheep are historically significant to the Mandan Hidatsa and  [[Page S987]]  Arikara Nation. Hunted with bow and arrows and used in traditional  ceremonies for years, they were recorded as being seen in what is  present-day North Dakota in scientific journals of the Lewis and Clark  Expedition of 1804-1806. Paintings by well-known artists like Karl  Bodmer depict tribal chiefs, including the prominent Mandan Chief Four  Bears, wearing their valued hides.   The return of the bighorn sheep to native habitat honors the past and  enriches the future of the residents of Fort Berthold. It is a  remarkable example of the profound impact a collaboration of like minds  can have on a mutual goal.   I have long admired the rugged beauty of the bighorn sheep and am  among many North Dakotans who appreciate their historical significance  in my state. I applaud all who had the vision to bring the bighorn  sheep back to the Fort Berthold Reservation and wish them every success  in ensuring they thrive in this new habitat.                            ____________________
