 Mr. Speaker, I thank my very respected friend from  Wisconsin today for yielding. We had our 5-minute speeches cut short,  so I appreciate the opportunity.   Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize Dean C. Mathisen for 20 years  of service to our Nation and Nebraska's Second District. Dean is  retiring from Federal service at the end of the 116th Congress in  January 2021.   Dean is a former U.S. Army officer and a combat veteran. He served as  a field artillery officer on Active Duty in the U.S. Army during the  Cold War, on its front lines in West Germany. He was next assigned as a  military police officer who deployed to the desert during the first  Gulf war. Dean also commanded a transportation company in the U.S. Army  Reserves.   In Nebraska's Second District, Dean served over 12 years as a senior  constituent liaison for the Honorable Lee Terry from 2002 to January  2015. During this tenure, he was instrumental in identifying the need  and communicating with the Department of Veterans Affairs about  bringing a national veterans cemetery to the district. Dean was a key  element in finding the resources to enable the first homeless veterans  housing project in Omaha to be completed as well.   Dean then crossed the Missouri River in Iowa in 2016 and continued  his Federal service in the office of the Honorable Joni Ernst. Here, he  continued to use his personal experience to aid him in understanding  the needs of our military servicemembers and veterans while solving  constituent issues.   In 2017, Dean became a member of my original Omaha district office  team as a senior constituent liaison. During this time, he saw the need  for and coordinated the efforts to establish a Federal veterans court  for the State of Nebraska. In the summer, Dean was promoted to deputy  district director.   In his free time, Dean is active in local animal rescue and animal- assisted therapy. He is known in our office to be an avid horseman,  hunter, and shooter. He is a member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars and  The American Legion and is known as a great Dane.   I want to offer Dean my sincere appreciation for his years of  dedicated service to our great Nation and to Nebraska's Second  Congressional District. His retirement is well earned. He should take  great pride in his accomplishments in both his military and civil  service careers for the citizens of the United States of America and  the constituents of the Second District of Nebraska.   Mr. Speaker, I wish Dean all the best in his future endeavors.          Hispanic Heritage Month: Honoring Kathy and Greg Gonzalez     I rise today, Mr. Speaker, to commemorate two wonderful  people during Hispanic Heritage Month by honoring a husband and wife  pair of wonderful police officers from my district in Omaha. They have  given lifetime contributions to law enforcement and have engaged in  community efforts for our hometown.   Gregory Michael Gonzalez and Katherine Lynn Belcastro-Gonzalez were  born in South Omaha in the early seventies to immigrant families.   One of six siblings, Greg grew up in a military environment as his  father was stationed at Offutt Air Force Base.   Kathy's mother fled from Lithuania to Nebraska after her grandfather  was taken as a prisoner of war. Kathy and her siblings were then raised  in the basement of a Lithuanian parish in South Omaha.   Kathy and Greg were high school sweethearts at Omaha South High and  went on to become married first-generation college graduates. Greg  obtained an athletic scholarship at the University of Nebraska at  Omaha, and Kathy attended the University of Nebraska at Lincoln while  simultaneously working three jobs. She graduated in 1993 and joined the  Omaha Police Department the following year. Greg began his career in  law enforcement in 1993 as the only Mexican American in the Douglas  County Sheriff's Office.   As assistant chief of the Omaha Police Department, Greg now helps  oversee the hiring of officers and works to reflect the diverse  community it serves, including Spanish-speaking officers. Additionally,  Greg is an adjunct police academy instructor and instructs criminal  justice courses at his alma mater.   As captain of Omaha's southeast precinct, Kathy oversees one of the  most culturally diverse areas in Omaha. In addition, her precinct also  manages large-scale events and cultural celebrations, including the  NCAA College World Series, events at TD Ameritrade Park, and Omaha's  Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium.  [[Page H4487]]    Athletics are another passion Kathy and Greg share, and they believe  competitiveness and teamwork are interpersonal skills that transfer  from sports to the rest of life.   The couple was instrumental in expanding the already successful  police-led sports program for at-risk and disadvantaged youth in Omaha  called the Police Athletics for Community Engagement, or PACE. This  program is led by police officers and volunteers and was founded in  2005 by Detective Tony Espejo, a 30-year member of the Omaha Police  Department and veteran of the United States Marine Corps. Currently,  retired OPD Captain Rich Gonzalez serves as PACE's executive director.   This September, Greg and Kathy celebrate their 21st wedding  anniversary joined by their three children, Izabella, Greg Jr., and  Alex. Overall, Kathy and Greg believe they would not be where they are  today without the support of parents and extended family.   With an extended list of combined accolades and awards locally and  nationally, Greg and Kathy Gonzalez exemplify the American Dream and  the quintessential rise to success from hardworking immigrant families.    Mr. Speaker, we salute Greg and Kathy. May the future reward them  with health and prosperity to continue to serve and protect our  communities.
