 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for  yielding me this time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the STOP School  Violence Act. I want to congratulate Sheriff Rutherford, the original  sponsor of the bill, for his dedicated work on this project, among  others.   In the immediate wake of last month's tragedy in Parkland, more than  15 students in my home district in eastern Kentucky were arrested.  Thankfully, our students and local law enforcement acted swiftly to  prevent a copycat event in our own schools. As our Nation battles this  epidemic of school violence, it is imperative that we utilize our  available resources to stop tragic events before they occur. But,  unfortunately, too many students and officials don't have the tools  they need to successfully act under similar situations.   This bill takes necessary and commonsense steps to prevent school  bullying, suicide, and violence, providing grant funding to States to  implement proven and evidence-based trainings that detect threats  before they come to fruition. In most cases of school suicides and  shootings, at least one other person knew of the plan and failed to  report it. So these appalling events are avoidable, but we must give  our schools the tools and resources they need, and this bill would do  just that.   Enhancing early detection, prevention, and coordination with law  enforcement will save lives. There may not be one single answer to  preventing all future violence in schools, but this effort is very much  a part of the solution.   Mr. Speaker, I was proud to join my colleagues in introducing this  bipartisan legislation, and I urge my colleagues to vote for it.
