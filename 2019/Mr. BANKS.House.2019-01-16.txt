 Madam Speaker, I rise today because I believe there is a  purpose and a God-given right to every life.   It has been nearly 46 years since the tragic Supreme Court decision  of Roe v. Wade, a decision that has denied the inalienable right to  life to over 61 million innocent children.   While we mourn the loss of millions of innocent lives, we reflect on  the work left to be done. We gather together this week for the March  for Life to celebrate the progress of the last 2 years. From the  continuation of President Trump's expanded Mexico City policy to the  landmark Protect Life Rule, the pro-life movement is making major  strides promoting a culture of life in America.   Friday, I will march alongside hundreds of thousands of Americans  from all corners of this country in honor of those who never had a  chance to march for themselves, but leading the march will be students  from Bishop Dwenger High School in my district in Fort Wayne, Indiana,  who will be joining us there that day. I can't wait to join them  tomorrow as they carry out this honor on The National Mall, and I ask  my colleagues to join me as we reaffirm the sacred nature of all life.                            ____________________
