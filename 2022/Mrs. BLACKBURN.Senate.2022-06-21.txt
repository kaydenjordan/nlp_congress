 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this week, we are celebrating the 50th  [[Page S3019]]  anniversary of title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. It says:         No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex,       be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of,       or be subjected to discrimination under any education program       or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.    For 50 years, those words have changed the lives of American women  and girls and their families for the better. As a mom, I was able to  watch my daughter excel on a more level playing field, and I look  forward to watching my granddaughter do the very same thing. Today,  more women than ever are competing for the awards and scholarships once  reserved for men. And wouldn't you know it--more women than men  graduate from college. In short, title IX means something to women and  girls in this country. It has opened countless doors of opportunity.   Today, I would like to invite all of my colleagues to join me in  supporting a simple resolution celebrating the promise of title IX. It  recognizes the 50th anniversary, it honors the work of women's rights  activists who led the fight for equal treatment among men and women in  education, and it encourages all women and girls in the United States  to continue to pursue academic and athletic accomplishments if they so  choose.   I thank my colleagues in advance for joining me as we celebrate the  women and girls in this country and all of their beautiful potential.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the Senate is back in session, and  still we have no indication from the White House or my Democratic  colleagues that they have a plan to lower inflation.   Tennesseans are frightened. You would be, too, if you consistently  found more month at the end of your paycheck than paycheck at the end  of your month. It is getting harder to stretch the pennies and nickels  and dimes, and talking points aren't going to fix this problem.   The White House keeps telling people that if they hang on just a  little bit longer, they are going to be all right, but that is not how  it works in the real world. In the real world, at a certain point, you  run out of rope to hang on to.   People are looking at this transition economy, and they are saying:  What are we transitioning to? It is not what they want for their  economic future. It is no longer a matter of just trying to make things  work; you just can't pay the bills anymore. The gas tank stays empty or  you go to bed hungry.   Now, it is clear that Joe Biden and the Democrats know that the  country has reached a tipping point, but rather than offering hope,  they have settled into blaming everyone from congressional Republicans  to foreign dictators for the problem. That is not what the American  people want to hear. They know who got us in trouble, and they know it  wasn't Vladimir Putin; it was Joe Biden and the Democrats.   It is the people--the Democrats who are controlling every branch of  government in this town. Yes, they have done it, and no amount of  scapegoating will change the fact that the American people have been  watching closely over the past year and a half, and they know things  have gone terribly wrong.   The Biden administration abandoned our recovery, spent trillions on a  reckless spending spree, and then panicked when all that spending  caused record-high inflation. No, it is not temporary. The country  doesn't need a pep talk; they need Joe Biden and the Democrats to  reverse course before we fall into a recession, if we haven't done so  already.   There are things the administration can do right now that will pull  us back from the brink.   It is time to take the taxpayer-funded credit card away. The American  people can't afford what the Democrats are selling, and they wouldn't  want it even if they could afford it. They know this is wasteful, out- of-control, reckless spending.   Next, the President must stop expanding the size and power of the  Federal Government. Stop hiring bureaucrats we don't need at salaries  we can't afford to write regulations that only exist to take more money  out of people's paychecks.   Democrats would also be wise to get the regulators we do have out of  the way--especially when it comes to the energy sector--restart the  Keystone XL Pipeline, and make America energy independent again. Go  back to drilling in Alaska, offshore, fracking. Return it all so that  we once again are energy independent.   Finally, there is something we can do right here in the Senate that  would keep future spending and inflation in check. I have introduced  legislation that would require a supermajority to pass a spending bill  during times of high inflation. It is good common sense, so we should  put it up for a vote.   It is time for each of us to go on the record and let the American  people know what our priorities are. They are tired of what they are  seeing coming out of Washington, DC. I am glad they are paying  attention. I am so pleased that Tennesseans are paying closer attention  now than ever before.   I do think that it is appropriate that President Biden, the White  House, the executive branch, and the Democrats who are in charge of  Capitol Hill go on the record and decide if they are going to stand  with that ``Build Back Broke'' agenda, stand with the radical left, or  are they going to stand for the prosperity and safety of the American  people? Tennesseans know what the right answer would be.   Whether I am in church, whether I am out at one of the grandkids'  sporting event, whether I am at the MoonPie Festival in Bell Buckle, I  hear it from everyone--this spending is out of control.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
