 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Georgia for his  great work in dealing with this very sad day in our country.   Madam Speaker, today, for the third time in our Nation's history, a  President will be impeached. This will be, however, the first time  impeachment has been entirely partisan and without merit. This charade  is not because President Trump is guilty of a high crime or misdemeanor  but because one political party doesn't like him or his policies of  America First.   Fact one: We have a divided government, and House Democrats are at  war with the executive branch.  [[Page H12171]]    Fact two: They have been planning for this day since President Trump  took office.   Fact three: They accused the President first and have spent months  looking for a crime.   Fact four: No evidence has been presented of an impeachable offense.   During one of the partisan hearings, a Member of this body asked: If  President Trump had evidence of his innocence, why didn't he bring it  forward?   The Democrats want Americans to believe that our President is guilty  until he proves himself innocent. This whole process is  unconstitutional.   Today, we have heard both sides, but we need to get the truth. The  truth is, the decision of who should be our President should be made by  the American people, not Speaker Pelosi, Adam Schiff, and House  Democrats.
