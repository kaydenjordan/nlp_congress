 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I rise today to  coanchor this CBC Special Order hour. Also, I want to acknowledge the  chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Mr. Cedric Richmond, from the  State of Louisiana, and other Members who are here to participate. For  the next 60 minutes, we have a chance to speak directly to the American  people on issues of great importance to the Congressional Black Caucus,  the constituents that we all represent in our various districts.   For this particular Special Order hour, I am going to open it up and  begin to talk about something that is very important and has been  widely discussed within the Congressional Black Caucus, and that is  civil rights and some of the things that we are worried about that are  going on within the Justice Department.   We have several important Members here to speak on these. Before I go  any further, I want to go ahead and recognize them. The first speaker  we have is from the State of South Carolina, representing that State's  Sixth Congressional District, and also our caucus' assistant leader.  That is Mr. Jim Clyburn.   I thank Representative Clyburn for joining and being a part of this  Special Order hour to talk about this subject matter that is very  important to so many members of the Black Caucus.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.  Clyburn).   (Mr. CLYBURN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from South Carolina  (Mr. Clyburn) very much for his timely and very serious comments. I  hope that all of the Members who are here on both sides of the aisle  realize the seriousness of the comments. There is nothing humorous  about them all, nothing to be smiling or laughing about. It is very  timely in light of the unfortunate incident that happened with our  colleague. I thank the gentleman very much for bringing that to light.   Mr. Speaker, I now yield to my fellow Texan from the 18th  Congressional District in Houston. I thank very much  [[Page H8067]]  Representative Sheila Jackson Lee for joining us this evening. We look  forward to the gentlewoman's words.    I thank my colleague from the 18th Congressional District  for her comments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne), my  friend and classmate who represents the 10th Congressional District.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from  Newark, New Jersey, for his comments, and also to talk about the fact  that I am glad that he mentioned Facebook, because one of the things  that really surprised me was the fact that some of those ads were  purchased in rubles, and no one seemed to notice that, seems absolutely  amazing to me. And we need to, again, just continue to have this  discussion and talk about these things, so I thank the gentleman very  much for his comments tonight.   I yield to my friend and colleague from the great State of Michigan,  representing the State's 14th Congressional District, Brenda Lawrence.  Again, I want to thank Brenda for participating. She participates often  in this hour, and I just really appreciate her comments. Her district  appreciates the comments, her State, and our country, and I appreciate  her joining us this evening.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Lawrence for her comments,  which are very timely in light of everything that is happening right  now.   Mr. Speaker, before I close out, the one thing that I would like to  make note of is that I think, with this COINTELPRO 2.0 that is going on  right now, we should take this very seriously. And I just want to  remind everybody that may be out here listening right now, we talk a  lot about extremist groups. We talk a lot about alt-right and KKK and  White supremacist groups, but one thing that we have to keep in mind is  that, in the 1960s, when Dr. Martin Luther King came to town, he was  not treated like he is now.   I hear so many people--conservatives, liberals, Democrats, and  Republicans--talk about how much they admire and respect Dr. King, and  rightfully so, because he earned the respect and the admiration that he  has now, posthumously, in this country. I don't think that anyone would  argue that. But if we could travel back in time to the 1960s, we will  find that he was not that welcomed.   And let's just put aside the White supremacists. Let's put aside the  alt-right. Let's put aside these hateful forces that, again, all of us  agree on are bad people. But remember, when Dr. King came to some of  these Southern towns in the 1960s, he was not welcomed. He was not  welcomed by people at the Lions Club, people at the Elks Club, people  at the First Baptist Church, people at the Methodist Church. People  thought that Dr. King was bad, that he was stirring up trouble, that he  was not ``keeping his place,'' and that he had come into these  communities to stir up a lot of trouble.   And because regular, everyday people--again, not the Klan, not the  White supremacists, just regular, everyday, tax-paying shopkeepers in  these little Southern towns--these conservative individuals who  represented all segments of our society thought that Dr. King was out  of place for doing what he was doing, because of that, the Nation  reacted. And one of those people who reacted against Dr. King, against  Malcolm X, and against other organizations like the Southern Christian  Leadership Conference, SNCC, which was the Student Nonviolent  Coordinating Committee, and many, many others, they ran the domestic  counterintelligence program that you have heard about tonight, this  COINTELPRO, and it became a weapon that was used to spy on individuals.   We heard mentioned earlier that our colleague, Barbara Lee, was one  of these people who was monitored. But this was happening to everyday  African Americans who were just out there trying to make sure that we  can vote and that our water fountains and our schools weren't  segregated. And these regular town folk--again, the ones that weren't  in the Klan, that were just good old folks that went to Sunday  [[Page H8072]]  school and went to church every Sunday--were trying to prevent this  from happening, and J. Edgar Hoover stepped in and decided that he was  going to discredit, disrupt, and neutralize these organizations, again,  that were just trying to make sure that African Americans were no  longer second-class citizens.   I think these groups and these organizations and these individuals  that I mentioned earlier within the Black community that were willing  to be part of that circle, I know that I would not be here serving had  it not been for that surveillance that they endured, and I know that I  would not be here today were it not for them putting their lives on the  line, quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, because of that.   So what I would just like to say is it is important that we monitor  everything that is coming out of the Justice Department in relation to  any announcements that they are going to make about investigating these  organizations that they disagree with politically because it is  dangerous, and we don't want to go back to those times. We don't want  to end up in a situation where the organization is doing any sort of  domestic spying on people who are practicing their First Amendment  rights of free speech.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire how much time is remaining on  the clock.    Mr. Speaker, let me also, again, talk about, very  briefly, some of the things that people are concerned about in regards  to civil liberties during the Cold War. That is when the FBI started  running a lot of these counterintelligence programs, and Dr. King was  always very high on the list. That is what people are concerned about.  Their concerns are concerns that are very warranted because of what  happened.   I know that people always say: Well, those things happened a long,  long time ago. But, in reality, there are people who serve with us in  this body who, sadly, remember those days. So it didn't happen that  long ago because they are still here, and they are still active, very  healthy members of society. They weren't Members of Congress back then,  but they are now, and they saw this up front. They saw this in a very  personal way, and that is important.   Also, one of the things that was mentioned earlier by Representative  Payne from Newark, New Jersey, was the fact about social media. Social  media has been very convenient. It has helped spawn new wealth in this  country. It has brought us together like never before, but it can also  tear us apart if we let it.   We have to be very serious when we have a foreign entity, a foreign  country that doesn't like America, that doesn't like our values, and  they have been very open and blatant in saying that you can't have a  multicultural society that exists. We need to take that threat very  seriously.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee) so  she can tell her story, and I thank her for joining us this evening.    I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 32 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Tuesday, October 24, 2017, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
