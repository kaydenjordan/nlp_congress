 Madam President, very briefly, here this afternoon,  beginning at 3:30, we will have a series of votes that include the  nomination of Katharine MacGregor to be the Deputy Secretary of the  Department of the Interior. I would like to provide my support for this  nomination.   I want to thank my colleagues on the Energy and Natural Resources  Committee for working with me to report then re-report Ms. MacGregor's  nomination, which moved out on a bipartisan basis.   I thank the majority leader for filing cloture on her nomination  before the recess so we could confirm her this week.   She has a lot of work to do at Interior, and we need her on the job.  She did very well at her confirmation hearing last year. She has  significant experience on the issues she will face as Deputy Secretary,  having worked here on Capitol Hill for 10 years, as the principal  deputy and Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management, as  well as the Department's Deputy Chief of Staff, and, most recently,  exercising the authority of the Deputy Secretary.   Ms. MacGregor's nomination has drawn the support of dozens of groups,  including some in my State: Alaska Federation of Natives, Arctic Slope  Regional Association, Doyon Limited, American Wind Energy Association,  Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation, Theodore Roosevelt Conservation  Partnership, National Cattlemen's Beef Association, Public Lands  Council, and many others.   I personally share those groups' confidence that Ms. MacGregor will  do a good job as Deputy Secretary. I think she is well qualified. She  has the right experience to succeed in this role. I think she will be a  fine asset for Secretary Bernhardt and the rest of the Interior team. I  would urge my colleagues to support her full confirmation.   I yield the floor.
