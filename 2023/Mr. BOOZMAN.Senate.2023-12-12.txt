 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the  achievements of Jeremy and Magen Allen who have been recognized as the  2023 Arkansas Farm Family of the Year. This award reflects the  dedication of the Allen family to farming and its contribution to the  top industry in Arkansas.   As owners of JA Farms, Jeremy and Magen care for a 300-head of cow- calf herd and run their own hay operation. In addition to their farm,  they oversee a diverse enterprise that includes JA Farms Feeds, a  custom livestock feed business, and JA Farms Trucking, which  facilitates transportation of their products. The Allen family's  presence in Hot Springs County has proven vital to the community. Just  one example of this was, when the sole Bismarck hardware store closed  last year, the Allen family was quick to action, further expanding  their enterprise to include JA Farms Feed & Mercantile, a retail  storefront, in order to incorporate supplies and necessities utilized  by farm families and others in the community. Since 1947, the Arkansas  Farm Bureau's Arkansas Farm Family of the Year Program recognizes  outstanding farm families throughout the State for their contributions  to the industry and their communities.   I am proud of the Allen family's embodiment of this mission. Jeremy  and Magen are driven and hard-working, and this recognition is the  fruit bore of that effort. As Arkansas Farm Family of the Year, JA  Farms will be competing with nine other State winners to vieuie for the  Sunbelt Age Expo Farmer of the Year Program in Moultrie, GA, where I  and their fellow Arkansans will be wishing them the best of luck.   Congratulations to Jeremy, Magen, and their children Lane, Brody,  Evelyn, and Eli for their outstanding accomplishments in agricuture. I  wish them continued success in the future of their operation.                            ____________________
