 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded    Madam President, I rise today to talk about legislation  that we are going to be considering in this month of December,  critically important legislation for the country. The name of this  legislative proposal, which as many people know has passed the House of  Representatives, is the Build Back Better Act, which will lower costs  for families in ways that I, certainly, have never seen in the time I  have been in the Senate. It will also cut taxes for families with  children, especially, but for other families as well.   I wanted to start today by talking about a Pennsylvanian because I  think  [[Page S8851]]  sometimes the only way that we can make sense of some of the policy  that we are talking about is to talk about it in terms of its impact on  individual Americans and in this case, my case, individual  Pennsylvanians.   This is about a mom and her son from a town in Southeastern  Pennsylvania, not far from the great city of Philadelphia, Downingtown,  PA. Victoria Farrell. There is Victoria and her son Cole. Her son Cole  was born with a mitochondrial disease. Cole faces health challenges  every single day of his life.   Now, because of her son's condition, Victoria receives help from  nurses day and night. Here is what Victoria said about the impact of  those nurses on her son Cole and their lives together. She said those  nurses are the ``keystone of our lives.'' Victoria also said that the  nurses have ``become family.'' That is what these nurses mean to these  families every day.   Now, in the case of Victoria and Cole and their family, home- and  community-based services allow Cole to remain an active part of his  community and to stay at home--to stay at home where he belongs,  certainly where Victoria, as any mom, would want him to stay. She is  able to have Cole at home instead of being at a place far from their  home. These services keep their family together and strengthen their  bonds, the bonds between a mother and her son and the bonds between and  among other family members.   At its core, Build Back Better is about helping families. But in a  particular way, Build Back Better is about caregiving and whether or  not we are going to meet our obligations to invest in caregiving in  ways that we have talked about a long time here in Washington but have  never done. For far too long, our Nation has viewed caregiving as a  personal problem for each family to solve on their own.   Caregiving is an economic issue. It is not just an issue for one  family to solve. It is an economic issue that affects all of us. And if  quality caregiving isn't provided to one family, we are all diminished  by that failure. And that is why Build Back Better provides such an  opportunity, such a bright opportunity to provide better caregiving.   Caregiving is an economic issue, and it is also a workforce issue.  This is one of the problems that stands in the way, a real impediment  to getting people back to work, especially in the grip of--and we hope  soon in the aftermath of--the pandemic. Caregiving is about getting  people back to work, and caregiving is about preparing the workforce of  the future.   We know that the pandemic, as horrible as it has been--all of the  death, all of the suffering, all of the suffering endured by families,  either suffering by way of death or disease or suffering by way of job  loss or loss of a small business--with all of that horror, a spotlight  was put on some problems that, frankly, a lot of people knew about  before, and we all may have pointed to or talked about, but the  spotlight finally was imposed upon so many challenges. The spotlight on  the Nation's caregiving crisis was one of the most pronounced  spotlights that we saw in the whole pandemic.   American workers, but women in particular, are leaving the workforce.  This is not out of choice. It is because they cannot find quality,  affordable childcare or they can't find quality care for an aging  parent or even the option of getting quality care for a parent, a loved  one, in a home- or a community-based setting. Many parents can't find  the care they need for a child with a disability. Many families don't  have the same opportunities that Victoria and other moms have benefited  from.   I am the first one to say that it was a great breakthrough when we  got the infrastructure legislation passed. I could rattle off all the  examples of how it would help Pennsylvania. I will just give you one.  That bill we know is separate from Build Back Better, but we are going  to be able to repair and replace a lot of bridges in our State. That is  a good thing. We are going to have a lot of money to do that. But for  some families, for some Pennsylvanians, that bridge to work won't  simply be a physical bridge that connects that person to their work-- where they have to physically get to work--for other people, their  bridge to work will be quality, affordable childcare. Too often because  of where we are in America today, it is not their bridge to work; it is  her bridge to work. Her bridge to work will literally be quality,  affordable childcare. The physical bridge won't be enough. She is going  to need--her family is going to need, for her to get back to work,  quality, affordable childcare. Too many families don't have that today.   Her bridge to work also might be making sure or having the peace of  mind to know that there is someone home with her mom providing quality  care in her mom's home or in another setting. Her bridge to work might  be care for a son or a daughter who has a disability or might have  multiple disabilities. That is the peace of mind that every mother  should have--every parent who is trying to get to work every day--the  peace of mind that we can provide by making the right investments. So  their bridge to work and her bridge to work is caregiving and so much  else.   We also know that we can, in the midst of debating legislation about  getting people back to work and lowering costs for families and,  frankly, cutting taxes for families raising children--we can also lift  up the workforce. The workforce is paid just $12 an hour doing work for  all these people we claim to care about.    Every politician that any one of us know, every leading policy  advocate will talk about how much we have to care for children, how  much we have to invest in better caregiving for seniors and people with  disabilities. But then there is no action or hasn't been action until  this legislation to lift up the pay of the people who are providing  that care. If we really care about those people, we will lift the pay  of those taking care of them. You have to ask yourself in America: Who  is taking care of the caregiver? We are not taking care of caregivers  if they are making 12 bucks an hour to do the most difficult, heroic,  and always essential work. We can do that as part of this legislation.   Let me go to some numbers because I think these are relevant. The  numbers that I am talking about are waiting lists. You have people on  waiting lists who are technically eligible for home- and community- based services, but they are waiting. They are not waiting days or  weeks or months; many of them are waiting years on a waiting list. The  latest number we saw--and I think this is a big understatement or  undercount, but I will just go with the latest number we have--820,000  Americans on a waiting list. Here is the map of the United States.  There are 820,000 older Americans and people with disabilities on  waiting lists. They are on waiting lists for that section of Medicaid,  Medicaid section 1915(c), home- and community-based services waivers.  They are waiting for a waiver from their State to have the benefit that  Medicaid would provide.   Now, if they were going to a nursing home, they wouldn't have to wait  for any waiver. They would be granted that opportunity to have care in  a nursing home. A lot of families choose that, and there is great care  in those settings. But we should have a similar policy in place--and we  don't, but we will, I hope, by the end of December--that doesn't have  that waiver, I will just say, impediment or that step that these  families are waiting for.   Here are some of the numbers across the country. You can see  Pennsylvania. There are about 1,600 on the waiting list. That is a big  number. Here are some bigger numbers. I have three for you, just three  States that tell a big part of the story: Florida, Louisiana, and  Texas. Florida's waiting list is 70,000 people. Seventy thousand  seniors and people with disabilities are waiting for services;  Louisiana, 65,000 people are waiting; Texas, 385,000 people. They make  up, obviously, the largest share of that 820,000-person waiting list.   So you have three States--just three States, those three--that  comprise two-thirds of the waiting list in the United States of  America. Those three States have something else in common. They are not  just three States with big waiting lists--Texas, Louisiana, and  Florida--but they are three States represented by Republican Senators,  six to be exact, two in each State, as we know. Republican Senators  represent these hundreds of thousands of Americans who are waiting for  care.  [[Page S8852]]    I hope, when it comes time for voting--because that is how you  demonstrate what you are for around here. It is great to give speeches,  but it is how you vote that indicates what you support. I hope that  when voting starts on Build Back Better, the Republican Senators from  Louisiana, Texas, and Florida will vote in support of this legislation.  The more important thing is they are voting to support those seniors  and people with disabilities in their States on waiting lists.   We have some work to do when it comes to persuading some of our  colleagues who today, we have no one on the record saying they are even  willing to consider this legislation. We will see. There is still some  time, still a couple of weeks for consideration.   I mention the home care workers making $12 an hour. These essential  workers that I spoke of earlier are mostly women of color doing this  back-breaking, heroic, essential work. They are long overdue for a  raise. We have some work to do to make sure that we bring that to the  attention of the American people.   I wanted to make one--tell one final story. Then we will move to some  of our colleagues who are joining us here today. This story is  particularly meaningful for me because I just happened to be with, in  this case, Brandon and Lynn, and the person on the left side of this  picture is the President of the United States. He just happened to be  in his hometown of Scranton, PA, where I still live. We were talking  about all of these issues under the broad heading of either  infrastructure or the Build Back Better legislation, all the benefits  that would come from passing these bills. At the time, there were  individuals who were lined up in this old train station in Scranton  greeting the President, in many cases, telling the President about  their own families, their own struggles, their own challenges and how  Build Back Better would help them.   At the very end of this long line, Brandon--right here sitting in a  wheelchair--came right next to the President, and then Lynn, his  caregiver, was right behind him. Brandon Kingsmore is his name and Lynn  Weidner is his caregiver. I met Brandon months earlier--we were all  doing Zoom calls, right--talking about issues in Zoom calls and other  ways of getting the message out.   But I knew that the President had not met Brandon, and I knew that he  had not met Lynn, and I knew that he had not heard their story, because  it is a story of two people. It is someone who is a caregiver and  someone who is the beneficiary of that caregiving, that heroic work.   So I knew that the event was about to end, and I knew that it would  be wonderful for the President to greet Brandon and say hello, but  sometimes at these things there is a greeting and an exchange of  conversation and then people have to move on.   So just before the end of our greetings of people coming through the  line, I leaned over to Brandon, because I knew his story, and I said,  ``Brandon, before we go''--we were literally ready to head out the  door--I said, ``Please tell the President what you told me about what  Lynn means to you, what her caregiving means to you.''   And that is what it says right there. He was talking about the  importance of the caregiving that Lynn provides to him, and I quoted  him on the poster right here:         I would not be able to live the life I have.    And then he broadened it to all caregivers later on in his discussion  with the President. He said: ``They''--meaning caregivers, ``They give  us a substantial life.'' ``A substantial life.''   I think Brandon's words, more than any long speech, reminds us of our  obligations. If we care about people with disabilities--truly care--if  we care about seniors, if we care about those workers, like Lynn and  tens of thousands of them across the country, we will pass this  legislation because we can help all three and even a lot of other  Americans. We can help seniors have opportunities to get care in their  home. We can help people with disabilities get the care they need,  either in their home or in a community setting, and we can help the  workers to lift them up, to invest in them because we claim to value  them by our statements year after year, decade after decade.   We have an opportunity with this legislation to give meaning and  integrity to what Brandon said to the President of the United States.   The President of the United States has met a lot of people in his  time as the U.S. Senator from Delaware, as Vice President, and now as  President.   All of us know when the words spoken by one person in a setting like  this has an impact on someone. And I knew Brandon's words had an impact  on President Biden that day, and those words should be ringing in our  ears, that these caregivers give someone like Brandon Kingsmore--in  this case, it is Lynn who gives him this--a substantial life, that is a  great American idea--that we are going to advance policy that is  consistent with the values we claim to hold as Americans, that we  really care about seniors, we really care about people with  disabilities, and we really care about those who are providing that  care.   So we will have more time a little later to cover some other topics,  but I wanted to--if the Senator from Maine is prepared to speak--    We will come back to him because we have some other  colleagues who are going to be here later.   I wanted to tell another story about another Pennsylvanian, Theo  Braddy.   Now, Theo is another person I met because we were talking about these  policies back home, and we had a lot of Zoom calls, and I hadn't heard  Theo's story until--I guess the first time was June 2020.   And one of the points we have tried to make in this whole debate  about quality, affordable childcare, care for seniors and people with  disabilities, a whole range of caregiving issues we are trying to  address and policies we are trying to advance, one of the refrains that  so many of the advocates who have been traveling the country and  knocking on doors and making the argument all across the country about  why caregiving is important, they have been saying over and over again  that care can't wait, that there should be an urgency to providing  better caregiving.   So ``care can't wait'' is a pretty good way of expressing it. And  when I think of Theo, I think of that phrase, ``care can't wait,''  because Theo has a story that a lot of families can identify with.   He is now a resident of south central Pennsylvania--Harrisburg, PA,  our State capital. And he came before our Aging Committee back in June,  and I heard his story then, and I have heard it more than once since  then.   Theo was injured in a football game in the late 1970s. Theo and I  happen to be the same age--I think almost exactly--and that is where  his story really began, with that football injury. And as he was  telling the story, I was thinking about myself. I was thinking: My  goodness.   He was talking about high school, and I thought: All these years he  has lived with that injury.   And this is what it means to him: He ultimately started talking about  what it meant to him years later when he was sitting on the third floor  of his apartment building. He said: ``Just looking out the window for  weeks at a time.'' ``Looking out the window.''   And there are a lot of Americans who have a disability who are doing  something very similar: looking out a window, hoping, praying maybe,  waiting for a better day when they are not limited to that room and  that one view of the world.   That is, for many of them, the full scope and full expanse of their  world because they are limited to that one place. A lot of them want to  get good care in their home or in the community where they can be close  to the people they love and still be the beneficiary of good care.   So Theo talked about looking out that window for weeks at a time.  Now, when he completed his physical rehabilitation, he was still not  able to feed himself or push his manual wheelchair. So even despite  some help, he still had a long way to go.   You know what changed his life?   Home- and community-based services.   Here is what Theo's life has been since receiving those home- and  community-based services: He was able to obtain both his undergraduate  and graduate degree. He has been a professor. He has been an advocate.  He has, in essence, run businesses. He is, because he received those  services, leading a full life.  [[Page S8853]]    He is one of our best advocates for this policy because he doesn't  just talk about it in a personal way, he can talk about the mechanics  of the policy. He can talk about the challenges that are in the way of  so many people with disabilities.   So Theo has been able to, as he said, because of these services,  ``live a full life.''   Sounds a lot like what Brandon said about, because of the care that  Lynn provides to Brandon, he is able to lead--and so many others are  able to lead--a life that is a ``substantial life.''   So these stories highlight why caregiving is an investment in that  great American idea. A simple idea, but significant in the context of  what we are talking about: the idea that we are going to have policy  that is consistent with the values we claim to hold.   No one would say to us we have the--we have a value in America of  advancing the cause of freedom--freedom here at home and freedom around  the world. That is what America has stood for all these generations. No  one would say that you only have to express that; you don't need a  policy to advance it in furtherance of that goal of promoting freedom.   Same is true here. If we say we care about those Americans, we care  about Brandon, we will help Brandon and Lynn providing this care.   We will care and advance policy that will benefit Theo. Thankfully,  Theo has already received those kinds of benefits.   We will advance polices that will help mothers like Victoria have the  peace of mind to know that her son Cole is going to get the care that  he needs in the setting that she prefers and that anyone would prefer,  that they have that choice.   I am going to turn to our colleagues in a moment.   I talked earlier about that bridge to work--her bridge to work, the  bridge of quality, affordable childcare; her bridge to work being care  for her mom and care for a son or a daughter who has a disability, or  other bridges to work that allow her to get to work.   Well, this bill, fortunately, has so much in it that will lift up  families in addition to caregiving, that in so many ways this bill can  be a bridge to the future for families, can be a bridge to the future  for workers.   Once again, I mean, we can't simply talk around here about having the  best workforce in the world. We can't simply talk around here about  outcompeting China or any country. We have to advance policy in  furtherance of that goal, that value.   And that is one of the reasons why this bill is a bridge to the  future. It keeps our promise--the promise we claim to make--or we do  make and claim to uphold for families, for seniors, for people with  disabilities--really, just for families across the country.   So I think, in a very real sense, this legislation will advance the  cause of justice--the justice that comes with knowing that you can lead  a full life. You can have a substantial life because you are an  American, and we have expressed these common values and we have passed  legislation and moved policy in furtherance consistent with and paying  allegiance to those values.   So I want to thank our Democratic colleagues who are working on this  bill with us as we just begin the debate over the next couple of weeks.   And I will turn first to the Senator from New York, who has been a  great fighter for families all the years that she has been in the  Senate. I know that because I remember when she got to the Senate. I  was only here about 1 year--2 years, I guess, when Senator Gillibrand  came to the Senate. And I want to thank her for her leadership and her  strong voice for families and for caregiving.    I want to thank my colleague from New York, both for her  remarks about paid leave and the compelling case that she made. Just as  we were talking about earlier, paid leave is not only a care issue, it  is an economic and workforce issue. I want to thank her for her  advocacy and the fight she has waged. And, of course, I thank her for  the wonderful comments about the majority leader's dad, who just passed  away.   I will turn to my colleague from Maine next.   Senator King has been fighting battles on behalf of the people of  Maine for a lot of years now, but I am particularly grateful for his  most recent advocacy for home- and community-based services. He was one  of a small group of Senators and staff that came together week after  week after week on Zoom calls to talk strategy and to advance the  policy. And I am grateful for Senator King's leadership and advocacy on  home- and community-based services, as well as on so many other issues.    Madam President, I thank my colleague from Maine.   I want to turn now to the chairman of the Finance Committee, the  Senator from Oregon. Senator Wyden has been with us every step of the  way in Build Back Better but, in my case, in working on home- and  community-based services. This would not be possible without his  leadership.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to add 5 more minutes to our  time.    Madam President, I want to thank the Senator from Oregon.   The chairman of the Finance Committee had to work, obviously, not  simply on the better care and better jobs provisions to the home- and  community-based services provisions but so many others as well and also  to work on the financing of the bill, so a big job to undertake.   I want to thank him for his continuing leadership and thank all my  colleagues today for making the case for Build Back Better and in this  case, one of the component parts, but mostly our discussion was about  home- and community-based services. But there is so much more to talk  about. We don't have time tonight to get to all of it.   I think what you heard from our colleagues--from Senator King, from  Senator Gillibrand, from Senator Wyden, and I know the Presiding  Officer shares these concerns and has made these issues a priority--we  heard it right from the mouths of Americans, whether they live in  Oregon or Maine or New York or Pennsylvania, wherever they live, and, I  will remind our colleagues, all those folks on the waiting list in  those three States I mentioned--Florida, Texas, and Louisiana, where  two-thirds of the waiting list is, just three States.   When you hear Brandon talk about a substantial life that Lynn's  caregiving  [[Page S8857]]  provides him; when you hear Theo Braddy talk about the life that he has  because of home- and community-based services; when you heard Senator  King talk about the savings--you want to pay $90,000 or $26,000 in  terms of what taxpayers will pay over time in the case of 1 year's  care, $90,000 versus $26,000. Twenty-six thousand is what they pay for  home care.   So when you hear from individual Americans what these services mean;  when you hear about the arguments we are making on cost and that this  is an investment--this is an investment in America in furtherance of  those values that we claim to hold. Senator King spoke so eloquently  about life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That says it all.  That is what Brandon Kingsmore was talking about, that Lynn, his  caregiver, allows him to have a shot at life and liberty and the  pursuit of happiness.   So we have a lot of work to do between here and there, between our  advocacy and our work on a bill and passage, but we are going to get  there because this kind of care can't wait any longer. The American  people have been waiting for this for all the years that Senator Wyden  has made the case when he was a slightly younger man, making the case  with the Gray Panthers all across the State of Oregon. People have been  waiting for a long time. It is about time we deliver.   Let's pass Build Back Better, not only because of home- and  community-based services but for other reasons as well, which we will  get to in the days ahead.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
