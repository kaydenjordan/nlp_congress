 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in solidarity with students,  parents, and teachers seeking a brighter academic future. From a  student's earliest days of learning the ABC's, recognizing shapes and  colors, to the moment they walk across the gymnasium floor to receive a  high school diploma, their school days have been filled with learning  and exploring, reading, writing, and math. Or they should be.   This, however, is not the experience of many of our K-12 students,  especially not today. For the last 2 years, students, parents,  teachers, and school administrators have been struggling with the  global pandemic. COVID-19 has upended routines, hindered learning,  shuttered schools, and angered families. These are real challenges  requiring active listening and creative solutions. We need parental  involvement. We need tutorial advice. We need school board engagement.   Parents are concerned with their children's education, health,  safety, and well-being. Parents are concerned with what their children  are learning, with what is being taught in the school system. Parents  want to know that when they send their daughter or son to school, their  children will be safe from bullies and predators. Recently, unfiltered  frustrations have boiled over at local school board meetings.   Mr. Speaker, while I do not and will not condone violence, I was  stunned to hear that part of the Federal response to rising parental  concern with educational practices and pending school policies was to  unleash Federal enforcement on vocal moms and dads. This is deeply  disturbing.   One particular incident was cited as a catalyst for government's  heavy-handedness. At the beginning of the summer, pictures of a dad  tackled to the ground and arrested during a Loudoun County school board  meeting surfaced. But what is the story behind the headline?   This dad was protesting a school policy that would allow biological  males access to girls' private facilities. Why? Because his 15-year-old  daughter was raped in the girls' bathroom at her school. The situation  was expertly covered up and ignored by the very people responsible for  protecting his daughter: the school.   School officials eventually called the police, not to report a  serious crime against a young girl, but to restrain a distraught father  when he discovered the school was attempting to sweep the assault under  the rug.   One such horrific rape should be sufficient for every school district  to review who has access to girls' safe spaces. Instead, this half-told  story was crafted into a political narrative alleging examples akin to  domestic terrorism.   Just a few months after this incident, a national school association  letter demanded that the Federal Government respond to unrest, name- calling, and protests at school board meetings across the U.S. The  arrest of this distressed father whose daughter had been raped was one  of the examples cited in the correspondence to the President as a need  for Federal intervention.   Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Justice validated the  concerns raised, not by the father or parent seeking input into their  child's education, but to the dubious claims raised by the national  association.   Instead of adhering to the constitutional charge to oversee Federal  issues, it disturbs me that the power of the Federal Government is  being wielded to bludgeon everyday parents into silence. This must end.   Whether parents voice concerns about a lack of safe spaces for their  girls, the type of curriculum that is taught at every grade level, or  mask mandates, parents deserve to be heard, and every American has a  constitutional right to voice these concerns to the government without  being treated like a criminal.   It is time we start listening to parents. They are the best arbiters  of their child's education, and they deserve respect, not contempt.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, on Wednesday, October 20, 2021, I was  unable to vote on Roll Call No. 320.
