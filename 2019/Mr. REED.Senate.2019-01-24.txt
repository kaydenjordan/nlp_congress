 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today I rise to continue my series of  speeches on Russian hybrid warfare.   I have done a series of speeches on the Russian hybrid warfare  threat. It poses a great challenge to our national security. Russian  hybrid warfare occurs below the level of direct military conflict, yet  it is no less a threat to the national security and integrity of our  democracy and society.   One tactic that Russia deploys as part of their hybrid warfare  arsenal, and the one I would like to focus on today, is information  warfare.   Russian information warfare includes the deployment of false or  misleading narratives against the targeted civilian population or  government, often through deceptive means, in order to intensify social  tensions, undermine trust in government institutions, and sow fear and  confusion, which advances their strategic objectives.   The Defense Intelligence Agency highlights in their Russia military  power report in 2017: ``The weaponization of information is a key  aspect of Russia's strategy . . . Moscow views information and  psychological warfare as a measure to neutralize adversary actions in  peace and to prevent escalation to crisis or war.''   Russia developed its playbook over time, enhancing both the technical  and psychological aspects of these information operations in  capability, sophistication, and boldness. Lessons learned from previous  information warfare campaigns culminated in the attacks the Kremlin  unleashed against the United States during the 2016 Presidential  election.   The 2016 information warfare campaign, according to our intelligence  community, ``demonstrated a significant escalation in directness, level  of activity, and scope of effort compared to previous operations.''   Let's be clear. Russian interference in the 2016 election was an  attack on the Nation. It was just not a type of attack that has been  commonly recognized as warfare. As former Director of National  Intelligence Jim Clapper stated recently, ``[I]t's hard to convey to  people how massive an assault this was.''   While Russian hybrid attacks were detected by our intelligence  community and our National Security Agencies in a runup to the 2016  election, the seriousness of the threat was not absorbed across the  government, including Congress. There are a variety of reasons for  this, including political paralysis and a collective unwillingness to  believe that these attacks could compromise our political and social  institutions.   Two years on, we still have only scratched the surface in our  understanding of about the nature of Russian information warfare  attacks. Gaps in our knowledge include the extent to which these  attacks have been perpetrated at Putin's direction, by Russian military  intelligence units, known as the GRU, and through Kremlin-linked troll  organizations. Yet we have no time to waste. Information warfare  attacks continue against us, our allies, and our partners to this day,  and they continue to pose a threat to our national security.   Former CIA Acting Director and Deputy Director Mike Morell  characterized the attacks of the Russians against our elections as  ``the political equivalent of 9-11.''  [[Page S568]]    In the aftermath of the tragic September 11 attacks of 2001, we  established a nonpartisan commission to understand what happened and  why. One of the 9/11 Commission's conclusions was that the U.S.  Government showed a failure of imagination by not anticipating and  preventing the 2001 attacks by the terrorists.   We have had no similar wholesale reckoning in the aftermath of the  attacks from 2016. Some elements of our government and society have  taken steps to focus attention on this pressing problem. However, these  efforts have not been sufficiently comprehensive, and the nature of the  threats has not been fully communicated to the American public.   As senior vice president for the Center of European Analysis, Edward  Lucas assessed in a recent New York Times documentary on Russian  disinformation, we ``are still playing catch up from a long way behind.  We are looking in the rear view mirror, getting less bad at working out  what Russia just did to us. We are still not looking through the  windshield to find out what's happening now and what's going to be  happening next.''   We must recover from our collective failure of imagination. We must  rethink and refocus our strategy for countering these threats and  implement necessary institutional policy and societal changes to  support that strategy. Importantly, we must develop a playbook of our  own to fight back.   While the West has been slow to recognize the extent of the threat,  these types of attacks are not new. Historically, informational warfare  has long been a part of the Soviet and Russian arsenal.   As security scholar Keir Giles noted in ``The Handbook of Russian  Information Warfare,'' ``For all their innovative use of social media  and the internet, current Russian methods have deep roots in long- standing Soviet practice.''   During Soviet times, information warfare tactics were part of a  broader collection of operations that were referred to as active  measures.   The State Department described active measures in a 1981 report as  including ``control of the press in foreign countries; outright and  partial forgery of documents; use of rumors, insinuation, altered facts  and lies; use of international and local front organizations;  clandestine operation of radio stations; and exploitation of a nation's  academic, political, and media figures as collaborators to influence  policies of the nation.''   Active measures were run by the KGB, which at its height employed  approximately 15,000 officers devoted to these tactics. The same State  Department report described the strategic rationale for such  operations, stating: ``Moscow seeks to disrupt relations between  states, discredit opponents of the USSR, and undermine foreign leaders,  institutions and values.''   The tactics of contemporary Russian information warfare mirrors  Soviet-era active measures but have gained vastly greater potency in  the digital age.   The irony is, these are the tactics the Soviets employed, but they  have been supercharged because in a digital age, you can reach more  people, you can be more effective. Under Putin, Russia has  institutionalized informational warfare with a 21st century twist that  capitalizes on the interconnectedness of our global society in the  speed and reach of today's informational age through cyber space.    This has important advantages for Moscow. For example, the Soviet-era  KGB agents worked for years to get an information warfare campaign to  ``go viral'' and be picked up in multiple news outlets. Today, GRU- and  Kremlin-linked troll organizations spread propaganda and disinformation  campaigns across social media platforms with ease--virtually  instantaneously.   These information warfare operations are not simply opportunistic  meddling by Russia. Russia's purpose is to further its strategic  interests. Putin seeks to advance several strategic objectives,  including preserving his grip on power and enhancing his ability to  operate unconstrained domestically or in Russia's perceived sphere of  influence near and abroad.   Putin further seeks for Russia to be seen as an equal to the United  States on the world stage and regain the great power status it lost at  the end of the Cold War. Putin knows that for now, Russia cannot  effectively compete with the United States in conventionally military  ways and win. Instead, Putin seeks to use tools from his hybrid warfare  arsenal, including information warfare to divide the United States from  our allies and partners in the West and weaken our institutions and  open society from within. By weakening our democracy, Putin can make  Russia look more powerful in comparison.   It is not surprising that Putin, who spent most of his Soviet career  in the KGB and its successor, the FSB, has deployed these techniques  during his rule. Putin mourned the downfall of the Soviet Union,  lamenting in 2005 that the breakup of the Soviet Union was, in his  words, ``the greatest geopolitical tragedy of the 20th century.''   When he assumed power, Putin revitalized a number of methods of  hybrid warfare from the Soviet system, including information warfare.  Over time, Putin came to see Russia's nearly continuous campaign of  information confrontation with the West as both a justified and  defensive response to perceived U.S.-led international activism,  regardless of our intentions. Keir Giles confirms this idea, assessing  that Russia interpreted the color revolutions in former Soviet states  and the Arab Spring as resulting from information operations by the  United States and the West. Those operations were seen as posing a  serious and growing threat to Putin's rule.   The Kremlin's development of its information warfare capabilities  reflects those perceptions and Putin's concern with preservation of his  regime. Putin moved from earlier ad hoc information warfare campaigns,  such as the operations against Estonia in 2007 and in Georgia in 2008,  to the systematic application of these tools.   Most experts point to the Russian's public reaction to Putin's return  to the Presidency for a third term in 2012 as the turning point that  led to development of Russian information warfare as we experience it  today.   It began with the announcement in September 2011 that Putin--then  acting as Prime Minister--and Medvedev--then serving as President-- would switch roles. This revelation, coupled with the rigged  parliamentary elections in late 2011, created an unexpected backlash  from the Russian people. Massive demonstrations ensued, with thousands  of people taking to the streets. To Putin, the grievances of the  protests appeared personal as they chanted ``Putin is a thief'' and  ``Russia without Putin.''   The year of 2011 is particularly relevant for revolutions and the  overthrow of dictatorships. The year 2011 gave rise to the Arab Spring,  in which dissidents relied heavily on Facebook and Twitter--American  inventions--to organize their protests and cast-off authoritarian  governance in places across the Middle East. Again, Putin conceived  U.S. actions in places such as Egypt and Libya as proof that the United  States actively cultivated regime change. Protests in Russia began to  resemble the protests of the Arab Spring, including the similar use of  Facebook and Twitter. Putin viewed these activities as a threat to his  hold on power.   Around that time, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton raised  concerns about the Kremlin's electoral conduct. She urged that the  ``Russian people, like people everywhere, deserve the right to have  their voices heard and their votes counted.'' In response, Putin  accused the United States of interfering in the Russian elections and  blamed Secretary Clinton for the massive protests taking place in  Russia, alleging that Secretary Clinton gave the, in his words,  ``signal to some actors in our country to rise up.'' He further  bemoaned what he called ``foreign money'' being used to influence  Russian politics and warned: ``We need to safeguard ourselves from this  influence in our internal affairs.''   After his inauguration for a third term, Putin promoted a close ally  and tasked him with getting control over the Russian's people use of  the internet. Putin and his cronies also put political pressure on the  creators of prominent websites. Those who were not willing to  cooperate, such as the owner of the Russian version of Facebook, were  pushed out so that the chosen oligarchs could become majority  shareholders and then begin to control content.  [[Page S569]]    About the same time, the Russian Parliament passed legislation  helping the Kremlin monitor and criminalize unfavorable cyber  activities. In concert with the new online restrictions, the Kremlin  began paying bloggers to slip in pro-Russian material amongst other  benign posts, which was the beginning of government-directed troll  operations.   In late 2013, a leading Russian newspaper reported that the tools put  in place to co-opt new forms of media were ``recognized as so effective  that [the Kremlin] insiders send these weapons outside--to the  Americans and European audiences.'' This may mark the beginning of  Putin's move to institutionalize a more sustained and permanent state  of information confrontation with the West.   Russia also used these external operations to further develop its  toolkit for information warfare. Central to these efforts included what  many experts agreed was the development of a hybrid warfare doctrine,  as articulated by the chief of the general staff of a Russian Armed  Forces general, Valery Gerasimov, in 2013.   Gerasimov argued that asymmetric approaches to dealing with conflict,  including the use of ``political, economic informational, humanitarian,  and other nonmilitary measures,'' have grown and in many instances have  ``exceeded the power of force and weapons in their effectiveness.'' He  further discussed how hybrid warfare tactics, including what he termed  ``informational actions,'' can nullify the enemy's advantage and reduce  its fighting potential. One of his conclusions was ``that it is  necessary to perfect activities in the information space,'' including  the defense of our own objectives.   About the same time, in August 2013, RT, which is a Russian  television station, reported on Russian plans to create a new branch of  the military that would ``include monitoring and processing external  information as well as fighting cyber threats.''   In the article, Putin acknowledged that information attacks are  already being applied to solve problems of a military and political  nature and that their striking force may be higher than those of  conventional weapons.   Based on RT's reporting and observations of the GRU's activities, it  is clear that Russia has created ``information warfare troops'' with no  parallel in the United States. These GRU units combine the arts of  technical cyber operations with psychological manipulation. Malcolm  Nance, a former U.S. naval intelligence officer, characterized the GRU  as ``the armed forces of Russia and the intelligence apparatus that  does reconnaissance, surveillance, and . . . strategic cyber  operations.''   Russian security services expert Mark Galeotti explained:         [H]istorically, the GRU has been Russia's main agency for       operating in uncontrolled spaces, which mean civil wars and       the like. In some ways, the internet is today's uncontrolled       space.    In hindsight, we can trace Russia's development and conduct of its  information warfare campaign against perceived foreign threats from its  neighbors and the West. These campaigns generally progressed along  three major lines of effort, all of which benefited from advances in  technology from the Soviet days.   First, the campaigns involved overt propaganda and disinformation,  much of it carried out on Russian state-owned media, such as RT and  Sputnik.   The second line of effort involved covert cyber attacks, including  hacking and weaponizing stolen information.   The third line of effort in the Russian information campaigns  involved weaponizing the internet, particularly social media networks,  to amplify messages to a vastly greater audience and promote themes  that advanced Russia's strategic interests.   While Russia's technical and psychological capabilities grew over  time, the outlines of the Russian information warfare playbook were  evident during Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2014 and during the  United Kingdom's Brexit debate the following year, but we largely did  not understand the extent of these operations and the threat to our  national security and that of our allies and partners. Our collective  failure to understand the pattern of Russian information warfare  emboldened Putin. The Kremlin's tactics and techniques were further  refined and deployed in the Russian information campaign against the  U.S. Presidential election in 2016.   Starting in 2014 and 2015, Putin turned his information arsenal first  on the near abroad, deploying information warfare operations against  Ukraine during the conflict over Crimea and eastern Ukraine. Russia  used Ukraine as a testing laboratory for experimenting with new tactics  of information warfare through cyber space and social media.   The impetus for Russian intervention in the Ukraine arose in response  to domestic unrest which caused the Russian-backed Ukrainian President  to flee the country. Events tipped off when Ukrainian President Viktor  Yanukovych signaled he was no longer willing to continue efforts to  integrate Ukraine with the West, which had broad public support.  Instead, he accepted a Kremlin offer of a $15 billion bailout for  Ukraine and a deal on gas imports.   Protests broke out, which grew into what was known as the Maidan  revolution. The numbers and strength of the protests alarmed the  Kremlin. Putin wanted to ensure Ukraine stayed in Russia's sphere of  influence. He deployed hybrid warfare, including a full-scale  information warfare campaign, to force the Ukrainian people back in  line. The goal of the information warfare campaign was to convince the  people of Ukraine that they were in imminent danger from fascists and  Nazis who were taking over the country and committing atrocities on  their fellow citizens.   The Kremlin deployed all three lines of effort that I laid out for  their information warfare campaign against Ukraine--a barrage of overt  propaganda and disinformation; cyber attacks, including weaponizing  stolen information; and the manipulation of the internet and social  media platforms. These efforts sowed fear and magnified mistrust toward  the Ukrainian Government, which the Kremlin was able to exploit for the  seizure of Crimea and to achieve other Russian strategic interests.   The Russian campaign deployed a significant volume of propaganda and  disinformation against Ukraine to magnify a climate of fear and  distrust amongst the Ukrainian people. Examples include photos doctored  to look like scenes of carnage from Ukraine, fake stories of dead  children caught in the crossfire, supposed attacks on Jewish Ukrainians  who were forced to flee the country, and, allegedly, a 3-year-old who  was crucified by Ukrainian soldiers. The messages also portrayed the  Russians as the Ukrainian people's saviors and that Russia had to  intervene to help restore order.   The second line of effort--covert military operations in cyber  space--was also deployed as a Russian campaign against Ukraine. At the  time, attacks against Ukraine were described as coming from  CyberBerkut, which the U.K. Government's National Cyber Security Centre  has recently announced ``is almost certainly'' the same branch of the  GRU that infiltrated the Democratic National Committee. The GRU forces  responsible for these ``hack-and-weaponize'' information operations  were later named by their unit numbers in Special Counsel Mueller's  July 2018 indictment and have been given many names, including  CyberBerkut, Fancy Bear, and Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) 28.   In the spring of 2014, as Ukraine held its Presidential election,  CyberBerkut penetrated Ukraine's Central Election Commission, directly  altering the nationwide Presidential vote tallies in favor of Russia's  preferred candidate. The Ukrainian officials caught the change before  the results were announced, although it was broadcast on Russian news  that the Russian-backed candidate had won, sowing doubt on the validity  of the election and magnifying distrust in the Ukrainian Government.   Seeing as how they couldn't change voting tallies and fully get away  with it, Russia's tactics evolved to try to change people's minds about  whom to vote for or make the public so distrustful of the system that  they wouldn't vote at all. These same units began to steal private  information through cyber intrusions on Ukrainian Government and  political officials and weaponize it by posting it on the internet. As  the Defense Intelligence Agency noted in the ``Russia Military  [[Page S570]]  Power'' report from 2017, the intent of publicizing the stolen  information was ``to demoralize, embarrass and create distrust of  elected officials.''   A third line of effort by the Russian campaign focused on leveraging  cyber space to reinforce and amplify their messaging, which was carried  out by the GRU and Kremlin-linked troll organizations. While these  efforts were often unsophisticated, this may have been the first time  that organizations embarked on wide-scale social media campaigns to  amplify information warfare beyond Russia's borders.   The Washington Post reported, based on internal Russian military  documents, that the GRU fabricated numerous accounts on social media  after Ukrainian President Yanukovych fled in 2014. These accounts on  Facebook and the Russian version of Facebook, known as VK, posed as  ordinary Ukrainians who were against the Kiev protests. They preyed on  people's emotions, magnifying fear and distrust.   One example of a message posted by the GRU from a fraudulent social  media account was ``brigades of Westerners are now on their way to rob  and kill us. . . . Morals have been replaced by thirst for blood and  hatred toward anything Russian.'' The same GRU unit was also  responsible for the creation of the fictitious persona ``Ivan  Galitsin,'' who placed pro-Kremlin comments on English language  websites.   The intercepted Russian military documents also detailed how the GRU  created four fraudulent groups on Facebook and its Russian equivalent  to support its campaign in Crimea and used paid Facebook ads to  increase traffic to their fraudulent sites.   Subsequent reporting by the Washington Post uncovered the specific  GRU unit--54777. The GRU unit responsible for this operation bragged to  their superiors that these 4 groups alone received at least 200,000  views.   All of these tactics would appear in later information warfare  campaigns.   This information warfare campaign against Ukraine also appears to be  one of the first uses of a complementary social media effort--deploying  Kremlin-linked trolls--against the population of a foreign country to  enhance and amplify the GRU operation.   A close Putin crony, Yevgeny Prigozhin, founded and funded the  operation--known as the Internet Research Agency and its related  companies--to amplify the Kremlin's messages across social media  platforms. According to a Russian press report in 2014, during the  Ukraine operations, the Internet Research Agency was employing about  250 people to engage in online discussions ``with a goal to undermine  the authority of Ukrainian politicians and post hate speech and fake  stories, thus shifting attention from the real events.'' Copying the  model that the Kremlin developed to manipulate its own citizens, these  fake Ukrainian personas would pretend to be regular, local Ukrainian  people and slip in politically charged messages.   BuzzFeed detailed one such campaign entitled ``Polite People'' which  ``promoted the invasion of Crimea with pictures of Russian troops  posing alongside girls, the elderly, and cats.'' The trolls used  innocuous pictures to gain a group of followers; then they were easily  able to pump out pro-Kremlin messages to readymade audiences.   Although the tactics were relatively simplistic--both for whom they  were trying to reach and the technical aspects of their campaign--the  Kremlin information warfare campaign appeared largely successful  against Ukraine and contributed to the Kremlin's seizure of Crimea.  Indeed, Gen. Philip Breedlove, then head of the U.S. European Command  and NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe, warned at the time that  Russia was ``waging the most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg in  the history of information warfare.''   Even as these information operations overwhelmed Ukraine, the  potential threat they posed to Western societies was largely  unrecognized, and calls for help in combatting these types of  campaigns--including manipulation of social media--went unanswered.   The Washington Post reported last October that high-level Ukrainian  officials, including President Poroschenko, personally appealed to  Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg in the spring of 2015. One of his deputies  stated that they told Facebook: ``I was explicitly saying that there  were troll factories, that their posts and reposts promoted posts and  news that are fake. . . . Have a look.'' Facebook officials failed to  take these pleas seriously and in 2015 declined President Poroschenko's  request to open a Facebook office in Kiev to address the problem. In a  foreshadowing of events in the United States, Facebook failed to  imagine the significant impact these campaigns could have on Ukrainian  politics and security. Our government, too, failed to realize the full  extent of the threat.   While we have been able to uncover a lot about Russian attacks on  Ukraine, we have not been able to piece together the full picture of  what Russia perpetrated against the United Kingdom in connection with  the spring 2016 referendum on whether the United Kingdom should leave  the EU, commonly known as Brexit.   UK members of Parliament and others investigating these attacks have  been able to piece together evidence that the Kremlin mounted an  information warfare campaign to encourage and amplify anti-EU sentiment  in the run up to voting day. However, because these investigations are  limited to their committees of jurisdiction and there is no equivalent  to the U.S. special counsel's investigation pulling the disparate  pieces of information together, we have yet to understand the full  picture of what the Russians perpetrated against the British people.   What we have learned so far indicates that the Kremlin appeared to  run a more sophisticated campaign against the British people than the  attacks it perpetrated against Ukraine. In this operation, the Kremlin  was pushing one side of the argument, as they were in Ukraine, but they  showcased increased psychological complexities in their attacks. This  campaign focused on targeting segments of the British population that  would likely be frightened by threats of increased immigration,  particularly from Muslim-majority countries. The Kremlin and Kremlin- linked actors also pushed messages that the EU was corrupt and had  little accountability to the people of the United Kingdom, which  magnified feelings of mistrust of the EU.   The first line of effort for this Kremlin information warfare  campaign and the one that the West was able to track and analyze was  propaganda and disinformation. The Kremlin unleashed a slew of overt  Russian propaganda in English, advanced on TV and the internet by  Kremlin-controlled media outlets. A United Kingdom parliamentary  inquiry on disinformation cites 261 articles on RT and Sputnik with a  heavy anti-EU bias in the 6 months prior to the referendum. These  outlets advanced a steady drumbeat of stories stressing the continued  dangers as long as the United Kingdom remained part of the EU's so- called ``open borders.'' This included disinformation intended to  magnify fear by alleging that British women would be subject to  increased attacks from dangerous Muslim immigrants.   It has yet to be determined whether the second line of effort--covert  GRU operations in cyber space--was deployed as part of the Russian  campaign promoting Brexit. It does not appear that hacking and  weaponizing stolen data was deployed in connection with Brexit.  However, as detailed in a separate parliamentary inquiry, on the night  of the Brexit referendum, there was a suspicious crash of the voter  registration website likely attributed to denial-of-service attacks.   The timing of this attack appears consistent with other GRU covert  cyber attacks, which aim to take key infrastructure or information  offline at crucial times to advance Kremlin objectives. This crude  information warfare tactic has been tied to GRU in previous operations,  particularly Eastern Europe. Further, the UK Government has been able  to tie the GRU to other cyber attacks, including attacks on a United  Kingdom television station and the United Kingdom foreign office. If  these Russian actors were culpable in this denial-of-service attack,  then it would fit with the Russian playbook.   The third line of effort, the use of cyber space to amplify and  reinforce messaging, featured prominently in the information warfare  campaign relating to Brexit. While we don't know what role, if any, the  GRU played in this line of effort, we have been able to identify  [[Page S571]]  a sustained campaign on social media against the British public by  Kremlin and Kremlin-linked actors. These attacks included the use of  trolls and automated bots amplifying pro-leave messages ahead of the  date of referendum. The New York Times reported that tweets from the  Russian accounts ``sought to inflame fears about Muslims and immigrants  to help drive the vote.'' Tweets surged in the last days of the  campaign, spiking from about 1,000 tweets a day to 45,000 tweets in the  48 hours prior to the polls closing. In the final days before the  referendum, less than 1 percent of Twitter users accounted for one- third of all the conversations surrounding the issue, showing that  these actions were artificially boosting the pro-leave messages to  increase viewership size.   Joint analysis from Swansea University and the University of  California, Berkeley, concluded that the attacks emanated from 150,000  Russian-based accounts and that their tweets were viewed hundreds of  millions of times.   It must be noted that Russian amplification efforts in connection  with Brexit also received a boost from local surrogates in the UK. One  pro-leave local surrogate was Nigel Farage, then-leader of the  rightwing populist UKIP Party. Whether unwittingly or not, Farage  echoed aspects of Russian propaganda, including lending his voice to  stories broadcast on Russian propaganda channel RT. Farage was also  often quoted in Russia media articles, including when he warned that  British women could be at risk of mass attacks of gangs of migrants due  to ``big cultural issues'' should Britain choose to remain in the EU,  again, echoing the message that Russian agents and authorities were  promoting.   Here, too, it seems we have just begun to scratch the surface of our  understanding about what the Kremlin was doing, including how they had  insight into whom to target with their information warfare campaign.  Member of Parliament Damian Collins, who is leading an investigation  into Russian disinformation connected to Brexit, fears that what we  know at this point about the extent of the Russian attack against the  British people ``may well be just the tip of the iceberg.''   We can't point with all certitude to whether the Kremlin's  information warfare campaign made a difference in the outcome of the  vote. However, we know that those who voted to leave the EU won by a  small margin. It was a stunning upset that no one expected, let alone  then-Prime Minister Cameron. He cited the outcome as the reason for his  resignation.   The Kremlin has also turned these weapons on the United States. The  most prominent example was the sustained, multipronged information  warfare campaign deployed against the American people, as I stated,  during the 2016 Presidential election. While the Kremlin's information  warfare campaign against Ukraine and Brexit supported and amplified one  side of an issue, for this operation Russia showed increased technical  and psychological advances by targeting multiple aspects of contentious  issues to advance the Kremlin's objectives. Grievances about race,  religion, immigration, social justice, and even U.S. institutions writ  large were woven into anti-Clinton, pro-Trump fabric. These efforts  were a toxic mix, trying to poison Clinton's candidacy, promote Trump's  favorability, taint the electoral process, and weaken democratic  institutions altogether.   Similar to the information warfare campaign against Brexit, we are  still trying to get a full picture of how Russia attacked us during the  2016 election and, particularly, the role that the GRU played. But what  is now clear is that the Kremlin's information warfare campaign  regarding the 2016 election was not neutral or even-handed in its  messaging on Clinton compared to that of President Trump. As affirmed  in the intelligence community's January 2017 assessment, in their  words: ``Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S.  presidential election, the consistent goals of which were to undermine  public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary  Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.''   They also assessed, in their words, that ``Putin and the Russian  Government developed a clear preference'' for President Trump.  Similarly, Special Counsel Mueller's February indictment against the  Kremlin-linked troll operation found that the Russians ``engaged in  operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information  about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz  and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and the candidate Donald  Trump.''   The clear anti-Clinton and pro-Trump themes in Russia's efforts  aligned with Russian strategic interests. As mentioned earlier, Putin  blamed Hillary Clinton for protests in Russia in December 2011.  Weakening Clinton as a candidate would reduce the perceived threat to  Putin's grip on power from a Clinton Presidency. President Trump, on  the other hand, offered Russia a freer hand in conducting its affairs.   Similar to Brexit, the Russian information warfare campaign against  the American people in 2016 demonstrated a high degree of  sophistication in targeting susceptible groups of Americans,  potentially including the use of data analytics. We are still learning  details of how the Russians were able to build an audience for its  information warfare attacks and whether they had any help from any  Americans. However, Justice Department indictments, including those  from the special counsel, and two reports commissioned by the Senate  Intelligence Committee analyzing data provided by social media  companies are providing a better picture of the information warfare  campaigns against us.   One of those reports, a joint study by Oxford University and the  social media analytics firm Graphika, assessed that the Kremlin-linked  troll organization was able to segment users into different groups  based on ``race, ethnicity, and identity.'' Once they categorized  people in such a manner, they tailored ads to entice users to engage  with their fraudulent accounts and pages. This process engineered  messages to manipulate and polarize receptive audiences. The other  study commissioned by the Senate Intelligence Committee, a  collaboration between the social media research firm New Knowledge,  Columbia University, and Canfield Research, confirms this idea,  detailing how specific ethnic and Russian groups were targeted. Their  analysis concluded that these operations were directed overwhelmingly  at African Americans. As the Washington Post technology reporter Craig  Timberg explained, social media companies created this technology and,  in the process, have ``atomized'' us into different categories and put  us into a ``thousand different buckets.'' The Russians co-opted this  American technology, just as they have exploited other aspects of our  open society and democratic system, and weaponized it against us.   Similar to campaigns in the past, this information warfare operation  followed the three established lines of effort as detailed in the  intelligence community's January 2017 assessment. The Kremlin's  campaign ``followed a longstanding Russian messaging strategy that  blends covert intelligence operations--such as cyber activity--with  overt efforts by Russian Government agencies, state-funded media,  third-party intermediaries and paid social media users or trolls.''   The first line of effort involved overt propaganda and disinformation  focusing on a number of themes that advanced Russia's strategic  interest. Having tested their methodology in previous campaigns,  including in Ukraine and Brexit, the Russians had an arsenal of tried- and-tested methods of influence they deployed in the U.S. Presidential  election to maximize fear and distrust.   Propaganda and disinformation to stoke these negative emotions were  pumped out by Kremlin-funded channels RT and Sputnik. They sought to  flood an unsuspecting American public with stories portraying Secretary  Clinton as untrustworthy and dangerous, thus amplifying negative  feelings toward her. Articles painted Clinton as a warmonger who would  lead the United States into future conflicts or alleged that she was of  ill health and hiding her condition from the public. Additional reports  were aimed at bolstering the perceptions that she was not trustworthy  and accused her of nefarious dealings detailed in the emails she  deleted as a coverup of her so-called ``crimes.''  [[Page S572]]    A third group of accounts alleged that Clinton used her high-ranking  position as Secretary of State to enrich her family foundation with  foreign donations by engaging in quid quo pro schemes. In contrast,  Kremlin-funded media pushed positive stories about President Trump,  promoting him as a pragmatist who understood that the United States  needed to stop interfering in the internal affairs of other countries.   An additional widely used theme, which sought to maximize feelings of  distrust and ran through much of what Kremlin media broadcast, revolved  around corruption in the United States, American hypocrisy, and that  our elections were rigged and fraudulent. Painting the American  political system as unfair, biased, and tainted served Putin's  strategic interests, allowing the Kremlin to counter pro-democracy  forces within Russia by asserting a moral equivalence between a  ``flawed'' American democratic system and his autocratic rule of  Russia.   The second line of effort in the Kremlin's information warfare  playbook, covert Russian operations in cyber space, repeated tactics  used against Ukraine but this time with greater sophistication. In  particular, the Kremlin and Kremlin-linked actors engaged in hacking  and weaponizing the release of stolen data. From what our intelligence  community, the Department of Justice, and FBI have compiled, it appears  that the GRU undertook the largest share of this aspect of the  information warfare campaign, with complementary efforts undertaken by  the FSB. The special counsel's indictment from July 2018 detailed how  the GRU ``intentionally conspired . . . to gain unauthorized access  into the computers of U.S. persons and entities involved in the 2016  election, steal documents from those computers and stage releases of  the stolen documents to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential  election.''   As we now know, two of the main targets of this operation were the  DNC and Clinton campaign chairman, John Podesta. Press reports indicate  that approximately 50,000 emails and documents were stolen.   Once in possession of these stolen documents, the GRU repeated its  playbook from the earlier campaigns. It sought to weaponize the hacked  information by releasing it in a manner and at key times when it could  cause the most damage, while concealing Russia's role in the process.  As the Mueller indictment against the GRU describes, ``They did so  using fictitious online personas, including `DCLeaks' and `Guccifer  2.0.'''   The Mueller indictment from last July further detailed the GRU's use  of fake persona, Guccifer 2.0, which the GRU falsely claimed was a  Romanian hacker. Guccifer 2.0 released stolen documents and was active  in promoting so-called ``exclusives'' of stolen information as a way to  launder it to third parties, including journalists from traditional  media outlets.   The GRU's covert efforts also took advantage of a willing amplifier,  WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks had an established reputation for spilling State  secrets, including those of the U.S. Government and military. WikiLeaks  also offered a ready-made audience and had an understanding of how to  time releases for political impact. Indeed, according to the Mueller  indictment, the GRU, posing as Guccifer 2.0 ``discussed the release of  the stolen documents and the timing of those releases'' with WikiLeaks  ``to heighten their impact on the 2016 presidential election.''   WikiLeaks released the stolen documents during the Democratic  National Convention to cause conflict between Clinton and Sanders  supporters at a time when many Americans were very likely to be paying  attention. WikiLeaks also released documents in the last few weeks of  the election, again, when the Nation was very likely to be following  campaigns. The first release of stolen emails from the Clinton campaign  chairman, John Podesta, coincided with a warning from the Department of  Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence  in October 2016 about Russian attacks against our election. It also  occurred on the same day as the release of the Trump ``Access  Hollywood'' tape. These efforts, too, suggest a high level of  sophistication that hadn't been seen in earlier Russian influence  campaigns.   The third component of the Russian information warfare campaign,  message amplification and reinforcement through social media, was  deployed in parallel with the other lines of effort to achieve an  unprecedented impact. While we don't know the full extent of the GRU's  involvement, the Mueller indictment revealed that an entire military  intelligence unit--74455--was active in this line of effort. In his  July 2018 indictment, the special counsel explained that unit No. 74455  assisted in the promotion of the released stolen material ``and the  publication of anti-Clinton contact on social media accounts operated  by the GRU.''    That includes the site DCLeaks, which was, in fact, established by  the GRU. It went live in early June 2016, posing as a site run by  American hacktivists, promising to ``expose the truth'' about U.S.  politicians. The GRU even created a DCLeaks Facebook page, authored by  the fictitious U.S. woman Alice Donovan, which sought to drive traffic  to its site. The July indictment further details how the GRU used  additional fake accounts posing as Americans named Jason Scott and  Richard Gingrey to promote the DCLeaks site. Before it was shut down in  March of 2017, the DCLeaks site was viewed over a million times.   The GRU also used social media to magnify fears about Hillary  Clinton. The July indictment from the special counsel revealed that the  GRU was the true operator behind the fraudulent Twitter account  @BaltimoreIsWhr [Baltimore is War], which encouraged U.S. audiences to ``[j]oin our  flash mob'' opposing Clinton and to share images with the hashtag  ``Blacks Against Hillary.''   In addition to the GRU's weaponizing social media against the United  States, there was a complementary effort from the Kremlin-linked troll  organization, the Internet Research Agency. By the 2016 U.S.  Presidential election, the deployment of the troll organization  appeared to be a standard part of the Kremlin's playbook. The October  2018 indictment of the Internet Research Agency's accountant in the  Eastern District of Virginia provides additional confirmation of the  troll organization's role in the information campaign. The indictment  confirms the existence of the Agency's operation known as Project  Lakhta--since at least May of 2014--and notes that this project  targeted Ukraine, Europe, and the United States with a stated goal in  the United States to ``spread distrust toward candidates for political  office and the political system in general.'' Social media researchers,  including P.W. Singer, have also noted how some of the same trolls were  repurposed for different operations. The accounts that pretended to be  Ukrainian then posed as British citizens and then as Americans as the  focus of attacks shifted over time.   Against the United States, the troll operation capitalized on issues  of importance to groups inside American society to magnify fear and  distrust in ways that aligned with the Kremlin strategic interest of  hurting Clinton and helping President Trump. As the special counsel's  February indictment detailed, ``These groups and pages, which addressed  divisive U.S. political and social issues, falsely claimed to be  controlled by U.S. activists when, in fact, they were controlled by  [Kremlin-linked trolls].'' The indictment further asserted this was the  manner in which the troll organization reached ``significant numbers of  Americans for the purpose of influencing the Presidential election of  2016.''   The report prepared for the Senate Intelligence Committee by New  Knowledge, Columbia, and Canfield Research that analyzed certain data  from social media companies identifies a number of tactics employed by  the Internet Research Agency in its assault on the 2016 election. These  include building brands across platforms, including Twitter, Facebook,  YouTube, and Instagram; deploying or repurposing popular memes to  spread propaganda; reinforcing key themes by resharing the same story  across multiple accounts; impersonating local media on Twitter and  Instagram to win the trust of Americans in their local news; and  amplifying conspiratorial narratives among both left- and right-leaning  audiences.  [[Page S573]]    As I mentioned, the report found that one of the troll organization's  concerted lines of attack was against African Americans. These efforts,  however, went beyond just trying to sow discord and reinforce fears  about Clinton. Campaigns against African-American groups were pushed  across Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube with the goal of  suppressing voter turnout ``through malicious misdirection, candidate  support redirection and turnout depression.''   Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a scholar who studies political campaigns,  examined polling data throughout the campaign and documented similar  tactics at disenfranchisement in her recent book, including fake ads  that encouraged minority viewers to text or tweet their support for  Clinton rather than to vote at the polls or to rally support for other  candidates in the race. These efforts may have been particularly  effective in peeling off voters who would have been likely to vote for  her candidacy. They also may have influenced undecided voters at a key  time. Polls in the final month of the campaign showed a marked drop in  the number of Americans saying they intended to vote for Secretary  Clinton.   The reports prepared for the Senate Intelligence Committee  highlighted that Twitter was an important component of the attacks  Kremlin-linked troll organizations deployed against the American  people. The nearly 4,000 inauthentic Russian Twitter accounts, like  their Facebook counterparts, promoted messages related to divisive  social issues, such as gun control, race relations, and immigration.  The troll organization also deployed bots, or automated accounts, to  amplify messages and drive traffic to specific Facebook pages, Kremlin  propaganda sites, or other targeted websites. The Kremlin-linked troll  operation went into overdrive on election day with strategic messaging  that mimicked the spike in activity on Twitter during the Brexit  referendum. According to the Daily Beast, Kremlin-linked trolls began a  ``final push'' and used ``a combination of high-profile accounts with  large and influential followings and scores of lurking personas  established years earlier with stolen photos and fabricated  backgrounds'' to send ``carefully metered tweets and retweets voicing  praise for Trump and contempt for his opponent from the early morning  until the last polls closed in the United States.''   As the recent studies commissioned by the Senate Intelligence  Committee illuminate, the information warfare campaign against the  American people was an extensive, widespread, coordinated effort across  many social media platforms, both big and small. The increased  sophistication of the troll organization's techniques on social media  provided a relatively low-cost but highly effective method of  influencing the American public. For example, these trolls spent only  $100,000 on 3,000 ads on Facebook. While this may seem like a small  amount compared to the millions of dollars spent on the Presidential  campaign, the impact and reach of these Kremlin ads, once amplified  through these Russian operations, was extensive.   While Facebook estimates that approximately 126 million Americans saw  Kremlin-linked messages, Jonathan Albright, the research director for  Columbia University's Tow Center for Digital Journalism, extrapolated  that they could have been shared hundreds of millions and, perhaps,  many billions of times. Kathleen Hall Jamieson concluded that the  widespread reach of the troll organization's disinformation ``increases  the likelihood'' that the Russian activities changed the outcome of the  election. A study from the Ohio State University on propaganda and  disinformation affirmed Hall Jamieson's assessment and concluded  Russian information warfare attacks ``most likely did have substantial  impact on the voting decisions of a strategically important set of  voters--those who voted for Barack Obama in 2012. Indeed, given the  very narrow margins of victory by Donald Trump in key battleground  states, this impact may have been sufficient to deprive Hillary Clinton  of a victory in the Electoral College.'' That is their conclusion.    As with the Brexit campaign, the Russian information warfare campaign  during the 2016 election was aided by others who, either wittingly or  unwittingly, helped to advance Russia's strategic objectives. Among  these were major American news outlets, which covered much of what was  in the WikiLeaks disclosures. They treated it as legitimate news  without reminding viewers of how the information was obtained or that  it was being pushed by a foreign adversary. Thomas Rid, a professor of  security studies at King's College, testified to the Senate  Intelligence Committee in March of 2017 that the journalists functioned  as ``unwitting agents . . . who aggressively covered the political  leaks while neglecting or ignoring their provenance'' or, as Kathleen  Hall Jamieson concludes, the American media ``inadvertently helped [the  Russians] achieve their goals.''   Further, as in the Brexit campaign, a number of local surrogates  appeared to echo the Kremlin messages. This included associates of the  Trump campaign and even the President himself. He boasted of his love  of WikiLeaks at least 124 times in the last month of the election alone  and even tweeted a link to access the stolen disclosures from  WikiLeaks. According to the Washington Post, at least five close Trump  associates, albeit perhaps unknowingly, retweeted messages from  Kremlin-linked troll accounts, including the account @Ten--GOP, a  Russian fake handle that impersonated the Tennessee Republican Party.   The President and his campaign also used talking points that were  similar to Russian propaganda and disinformation, including disparaging  Secretary Clinton's health and accusing her repeatedly of being  ``crooked.'' The President encouraged Russia, in many respects, to  continue these activities. From what we know from the July indictment  from the special counsel, the night that Trump called on the Russians  to hack her emails, the GRU did, in fact, attack the server that housed  Clinton's personal accounts. As journalist and legal analyst Jeffrey  Toobin characterized it, ``All of these separate [Russian] efforts are  completely aligned with Donald Trump's interests, often word for  word.''   Some have argued that despite this extensive and sophisticated  Russian influence campaign, there was no effect on the outcome of the  election because no vote tallies were changed. While we may never know  definitively what the actual impact of the Kremlin's operation was, it  is hard to believe that the Kremlin would mount a sustained, multiyear  information warfare campaign against our democratic institutions if it  had no reason to expect that it would have an impact. To the contrary,  based on its experience in Ukraine, Brexit, and elsewhere, the Kremlin  had every reason to believe that it could successfully influence the  outcome of the 2016 election with minimal risk of being discovered or  suffering retaliation.   As I have laid out, Russia is engaged in a sustained information  warfare campaign against the United States, our allies, and partners.  This Russian interference can't be dismissed as a one-off operation. As  Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told the Aspen Forum last July,  the Russian effort to influence the 2016 Presidential election is  ``just one tree in a growing forest. Russian intelligence officers did  not stumble onto the idea of hacking American computers and posting  misleading messages because they had a free afternoon. It is what they  do every day.'' Our intelligence community assessed in January 2017  that the campaign against us represented a ``new normal'' in Russian  influence efforts in which ``Moscow will apply lessons learned from its  campaign aimed at the U.S. presidential election to future influence  efforts in the U.S. and worldwide.''   Russian information warfare operations have a real and ongoing impact  on our national security. Russia has not paused its information warfare  operations since the 2016 election, and, in fact, the level of Russian  operations has increased since then. As John Kelly, the founder of  Graphika, a social media intelligence firm, who testified to the Senate  Intelligence Committee in August and who collaborated on one of the  reports for the Senate Intelligence Committee I discussed earlier,  stated: ``After election day, the Russian government stepped on the gas  . . . confirming again that the assault  [[Page S574]]  on our democratic process is much bigger than the attack on a single  election.'' This idea was confirmed by data in both his report and the  other report commissioned by the Senate Intelligence Committee on the  Kremlin-linked troll organization.   The report done by New Knowledge, Columbia University, and Canfield  research noted that the Kremlin-linked troll organization went after  those who are investigating Russian information warfare and other  malign influence activities in the United States, including attempts to  label Russian interference in the election as ``nonsense'' and casting  former FBI Director James Comey and Special Counsel Mueller as corrupt.   We don't have to look too far for other examples of Russia's ongoing  campaign against the American people and our allies and partners.  Kremlin-linked troll operations flooded Twitter with messages that were  intended to sow division and disinformation in the wake of numerous  controversies, including the tragic shootings in Las Vegas and  Parkland, FL, and during the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings. Last  September, we learned from an indictment in the Western District of  Pennsylvania that GRU officers, including some agents who were  previously indicted by Special Counsel Mueller, attempted information  attacks against prominent world organizations, including those who were  investigating Russian malign influence activities.   It is now clear that Russian information operations also targeted the  2018 midterm elections. The October indictment from the Eastern  District of Virginia details an ongoing and advanced operation to  influence the American electorate up through 2018. As the indictment  states, this campaign ``has a strategic goal, which continues to this  day, to sow division and discord in the U.S. political system.'' The  indictment also details how Russian troll operations are using U.S.- based virtual private networks, or VPNs, paid for with Bitcoin through  multiple bank accounts, to disguise the origin of Russian messaging on  social media.   The sophistication of these operations continues to increase. The  Internet Research Agency has a dedicated ``search engine optimization''  department that is devoted to manipulating social media search  algorithms to advance the goals of Russian troll operations. The troll  organization spent millions of dollars annually in 2017 and 2018 and is  still buying ads on Facebook and Instagram. These operations continue  to cover a broad range of divisive issues, and as the indictment  details, the organization's employees are instructed on strategies and  guidance for targeting particular audiences with carefully tailored  messages. Despite efforts by Facebook and Twitter to eliminate  inauthentic accounts, there are still thousands of active social media  and email accounts appearing to be U.S. persons when they are, in fact,  Kremlin-linked trolls that are acting as part of an information warfare  campaign.   Last February, in testimony before the Armed Services Cyber  Subcommittee, Russia expert Heather Conley warned that Russian  information warfare campaigns in 2018 and 2020 will adapt and ``look  more American, and [it] will look less Russian.'' The New Knowledge,  Columbia University, and Canfield research study notes that we need to  be on the lookout for increasingly sophisticated operations, including  ``increased human-exploitation tradecraft and narrative laundering.''   The technology already exists to create ``deepfakes,'' false videos  of real people saying or doing things that are damaging. Advances in  artificial intelligence are enabling rapid, automated responses on  social media that mimic authentic accounts.   We are still gathering data about information warfare attacks,  including the 2018 midterms. Between the indictments I referenced and  the additional Kremlin-directed troll operations discovered by Facebook  in conjunction with our Intelligence Committee, the FBI, and DHS, we  seem to be getting better at responding to the types of attacks  perpetrated against United States in 2016, but that is no indicator  that we have become better at anticipating future attacks.   The Director of the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity  and Infrastructure Security Agency warned last November that ``the  [2018] midterm is . . . just the warm-up or the exhibition game. . . .  The big game . . . for the adversaries is probably 2020.''   I want to thank my colleague for being generous and patient with my  presentation, but I do want to make, I think, an important and  concluding point that ties in directly with what is going on right now.                              Government Funding    Mr. President, we have been talking about this shutdown. After I  described the activities that have transpired over the last 5 to 10  years, we should be aware that they are continuing, and the  consequences of this shutdown are more than theoretical.   We are missing some of our most critical tools for countering Russian  information warfare for protecting systems that are vital to our  democracy. As Andrew Grotto, a former cyber security adviser for  Presidents Trump and Obama stated, ``Defending Federal networks is  already an act of triage . . . furloughs make a hard job even harder.''   While I applaud DHS for reorganizing into the new Cybersecurity and  Infrastructure Security Agency, they have since had to furlough 43  percent of their employees. That is over 1,500 workers who right now  are unable to continue key missions and protect us from attack.   The FBI is also affected by the shutdown in critical functions  related to countering Russian hybrid and information warfare.   A recent FBI Agent's Association report highlighted how efforts to  investigate and prosecute cyber criminals have been impacted. That  includes a lack of resources to pay for wiretaps and subpoenas. One  anonymous FBI agent quoted in the report remarked: ``These delays slow  down our work to combat criminal activity on the [internet] and protect  the American people.''   All the while, Russia continues to attack us with information  warfare. They were not closed for business. With this unnecessary  government shutdown, we are fighting blindfolded with one hand tied  behind our backs.   I am confident in the ability of our government and our society to  come together. I am confident that with the American vision and  ingenuity, working across the aisle and across the Atlantic, these are  challenges that we can meet and conquer, but we must remember that this  is not a Democratic or Republican problem.   This is an attack against the Nation by a foreign power. This is a  problem of our national security. We have no time to waste. If we are  looking for another reason why we should open this government  immediately, it is to continue our protection against the attacks by  foreign entities.   With that, let me particularly thank the Senator from Florida for his  patience and thank the Presiding Officer for his patience as well.   I yield the floor.
