 In Iran, a dangerous regime is harming its people,  stripping them of their rights, and spreading lies to cover it up.   The world must know where we stand.   The Biden administration is leading the way, and I strongly support  their newly announced sanctions on some of the world's worst human  rights abusers.   These offenders are top-ranking officials in the Islamic  Revolutionary Guard Corps, the regime's right hand in repression.  Sanctions also target the IRGC's business enterprise, which has been  funding the regime's brutality for decades.   The U.S.' leadership was mimicked by the United Kingdom and European  Union. I applaud this unified response from our allies. It is a clear  rejection of Iran's violence and a demand for the Iranian people to be  heard.   The struggles continue, and we must all remember that ``Woman, Life,  Freedom'' is not just a chant. It is a call to action.                           Clean School Bus Program     Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak up for California's  children, our communities, and our environment.   The vast majority of American schoolbuses run on diesel, a major  source of pollution that contributes to the climate crisis. As a  result, bus emissions worsen our air quality with significant harm  around schools, in residential areas, and within the passenger cabin.  This is a serious problem for our environment and our children's  health.   The bipartisan infrastructure law that I supported invests in a  solution. The Clean School Bus program funds $5 billion for the  purchase of electric schoolbuses, improving the air for our kids and  our communities.   Electric buses also improve discipline, reduce noise pollution, and  give schools budget certainty. They can save school districts up to 80  percent on the cost of fuel, maintenance, and repairs.   However, the Clean School Bus program unfairly targets California.  Even though our State has nearly 13 percent of schoolchildren and the  second lowest busing rate in the country, ahead only of Mississippi,  the law unfairly imposes a 10 percent State cap on the funds.   Even worse, to date, California has only gotten 7.33 percent of the  Clean School Bus program funds. Our State leads the Nation in  transitioning to electric vehicles and reducing emissions. We need our  Federal Government to be a partner in these efforts. California wants  to invest in clean buses to take children to school to learn and to  grow, but we cannot do it alone.   If America is to be the global leader in transitioning to a clean  energy economy, we need to give every State, including California,  their fair share of financial support.   The $69.5 million already invested in the Clean School Bus program in  California provides some necessary help, but it is not nearly enough to  support our densely populated working-class communities, some of which  have the worst air quality in the Nation.   I have seen firsthand the tremendous interest in the Clean School Bus  program when my office hosted grant workshops with school districts and  Tribal communities to share information about these Federal resources  for acquiring low- and zero-emission schoolbuses. To meet this moment,  we need a coordinated effort from Federal, State, and local entities to  make the change.   California needs a leader who will fight to remove unfair roadblocks,  such  [[Page H348]]  as arbitrary State caps that limit investment in clean technology. I  will continue to push for a level playing field for California that  invests our Federal tax dollars where the need is greatest and where  they can do the most good.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, replenishing the Strategic Petroleum  Reserve is in our national security interest, but handing out 10  percent of our federally protected lands is not the answer.   Big Oil sits on more than 9,000 unused permits for drilling on public  lands. That is 9.9 million acres; 7.5 million football fields; more  land than Maryland and Delaware combined.   Congress should find the political courage to hold the fossil fuel  industry accountable. As long as Big Oil holds on to thousands of  unused permits, it shouldn't get a single acre more of our land.   We can strengthen our energy independence without another sweetheart  deal for the fossil fuel industry, which also receives billions in  subsidies, and without selling out the hunters, fishers, and hikers who  rely on public lands and contribute 1.9 percent of our GDP.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 21.    Mr. Chair, I rise to offer amendment No. 45.    Taxpayers should not be a piggy bank for Big Oil to line  its pockets. As a taxpayer advocate, I am introducing an amendment to  protect our money from Big Oil's greed.   Under current law, oil and gas companies get a tax break when they  tap into their reserves as part of doing business. This amounts to  about a $2 to $3 billion handout each year.  [[Page H414]]    Now, as we look to spend taxpayer dollars to replenish the Strategic  Petroleum Reserve, corporations are poised to double dip, to profit off  the American people.   Without a change in policy, polluters get tax dollars once in the  form of a government contract and again in the form of a special tax  break. As a champion for capitalism, I strongly oppose this corporate  abuse.   When the Federal Government negotiates a contract with oil companies  to buy their product with tax dollars, they do it at a fair price. That  is capitalism.   But to turn around and then give them a tax break, that is  corruption, bought and paid for by the fossil fuel industry, which  spends $100 million each year on lobbying.   As a consumer protection attorney, I have never met any American-- Democrat, Republican, Independent--who likes to be cheated.   Consumers should get what we pay for. Big Oil should not get to  double charge taxpayers for the same oil.   Many of my Republican colleagues talk about safeguarding capitalism.  They stress the importance of protecting tax dollars.   A handout to Big Oil is antithetical to these goals. Big Oil  shouldn't get a bonus helping of tax dollars after they have received  government contracts.   I urge all my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to stand up for  our capitalist principles, to protect taxpayers, and to adopt this  amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
