 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1843) to amend title 31, United States Code, to prohibit the  Internal Revenue Service from carrying out seizures relating to a  structuring transaction unless the property to be seized derived from  an illegal source or the funds were structured for the purpose of  concealing the violation of another criminal law or regulation, to  require notice and a post-seizure hearing for such seizures, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows                                 H.R. 1843         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Clyde-Hirsch-Sowers RESPECT       Act'' or the ``Restraining Excessive Seizure of Property       through the Exploitation of Civil Asset Forfeiture Tools       Act''.       SEC. 2. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE SEIZURE REQUIREMENTS WITH                     RESPECT TO STRUCTURING TRANSACTIONS.         Section 5317(c)(2) of title 31, United States Code, is       amended--        (1) by striking ``Any property'' and inserting the       following:        ``(A) In general.--Any property''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following:        ``(B) Internal revenue service seizure requirements with       respect to structuring transactions.--        ``(i) Property derived from an illegal source.--Property       may only be seized by the Internal Revenue Service pursuant       to subparagraph (A) by reason of a claimed violation of       section 5324 if the property to be seized was derived from an       illegal source or the funds were structured for the purpose       of concealing the violation of a criminal law or regulation       other than section 5324.        ``(ii) Notice.--Not later than 30 days after property is       seized by the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to       subparagraph (A), the Internal Revenue Service shall--         ``(I) make a good faith effort to find all persons with an       ownership interest in such property; and        ``(II) provide each such person with a notice of the       seizure and of the person's rights under clause (iv).         ``(iii) Extension of notice under certain circumstances.--      The Internal Revenue Service may apply to a court of       competent jurisdiction for one 30-day extension of the notice       requirement under clause (ii) if the Internal Revenue Service       can establish probable cause of an imminent threat to       national security or personal safety necessitating such       extension.        ``(iv) Post-seizure hearing.--If a person with a property       interest in property seized pursuant to subparagraph (A) by       the Internal Revenue Service requests a hearing by a court of       competent jurisdiction within 30 days after the date on which       notice is provided under subclause (ii), such property shall       be returned unless the court holds an adversarial hearing and       finds within 30 days of such request (or such longer period       as the court may provide, but only on request of an       interested party) that there is probable cause to believe       that there is a violation of section 5324 involving such       property and probable cause to believe that the property to       be seized was derived from an illegal source or the funds       were structured for the purpose of concealing the violation       of a criminal law or regulation other than section 5324.''.       SEC. 3. EXCLUSION OF INTEREST RECEIVED IN ACTION TO RECOVER                     PROPERTY SEIZED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE                     BASED ON STRUCTURING TRANSACTION.

(c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section       shall apply to interest received on or after the date of the       enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material for H.R. 1843, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, if a person deposits $10,000 or more into a financial  institution, that institution must submit a currency transaction report  to the Treasury Department. Avoiding this reporting requirement by  purposefully staying below the $10,000 limit is a Federal crime known  as structuring.   Structuring was made illegal in 1986 to prevent large-scale criminal  enterprises, terrorists, and money launderers from hiding their  illegally earned money from authorities by consistently depositing just  shy of that  [[Page H6635]]  $10,000 limit. This makes complete sense.   When structuring is believed to have occurred, the Internal Revenue  Service can use its civil asset forfeiture authority to seize funds and  force the owner of the funds to prove that they were obtained legally.  Let me tell you, I am not laying awake at night, and neither are my  colleagues here, worrying about terrorists and mobsters not being able  to get access to their money. So far, so good. The law makes sense.   But now let me tell you about somebody who had their money seized by  the IRS. Andrew Clyde served three combat tours in Iraq, and then he  came home and opened a store in Georgia.   Mr. Clyde had an insurance policy that only covered up to $10,000 in  off-premise losses. So, like any reasonable person, Mr. Clyde never  brought more than $10,000 in cash with him when he made his nightly  deposits. The IRS seized $950,000 from him.   Now, just marinate in that for a minute, Mr. Speaker. Imagine trying  to run your business, and one day the Federal Government comes in and  takes away all of your money. You don't know why, but it is just gone.  You would assume that the IRS would then talk to Mr. Clyde, hear his  rationale, and say: Well, it is my mistake. You are clearly not a  mobster or a terrorist. Thank you for your service. Here is your life  savings back.   But that is not what happened. Instead, the IRS threatened him with  criminal structuring charges until he agreed to settle with the agency,  and gave them $50,000, after he had spent nearly $100,000 in legal  fees.   Andrew Clyde lost $150,000 simply because he wanted to make sure that  his cash deposits were low enough to be insured.   We are here today to make sure this never happens again. The RESPECT  Act makes commonsense changes to civil asset forfeiture practices.  First and foremost, the IRS would have to show probable cause that the  funds they are seizing were derived from or connected to an illegal  source.   Additionally, it would provide protections for taxpayers whose money  was taken, requiring a hearing within 30 days of the money being  seized. These commonsense steps prevent the Federal Government from  acting with impunity and harassing the very citizens that they are  supposed to protect.   I want to thank a number of individuals for their work on this  legislation. I would like to thank John Lewis, the ranking member of  the Oversight Subcommittee. I want to thank my lead sponsor, Joe  Crowley, the lead Democrat on this legislation. I want to thank Mr.  Neal for his leadership, and I want to thank Chairman Brady.   We have been at this for a long time. We first started investigating  this issue at an Oversight Subcommittee hearing in February of 2015,  and we made some progress. IRS Commissioner Koskinen apologized to the  victims of this practice on behalf of his agency. In fact, a year  later, he changed the IRS procedures to restrict the use of civil asset  forfeiture cases in which the money was earned illegally, a commonsense  decision that we will codify with this legislation.   I am also heartened to say that in March of this year, the IRS  finished its process of reviewing all 454 contested cases that occurred  before the rule change. The agency either returned or recommended that  the Department of Justice return approximately 80 percent of those  funds. The IRS returned over $6 million to honest Americans who were  victims of this government overreach.   While the IRS returned over $6 million, they have also recommended  that the Department of Justice return a whopping $16 million.  Unfortunately, the Department of Justice still has a long way to go in  tackling the backlog of undecided cases. We will be addressing this  issue with an amendment in the upcoming appropriations bill.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, Americans deserve a government that they can  trust. I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this  legislation to prevent future victims of abusive civil asset forfeiture  practices, and fight for those who have been affected.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time,    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Collins).    Mr. Speaker, we have no remaining speakers on this side,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I think Mr. Crowley and Mr. Neal hit the  nail on the head, as did Mr. Collins.   Let me just sort of sum up then. This is a story about a citizen, a  citizen who is scandalized by the Federal Government that is there to  protect the citizen, and the citizen said: Do you know what? This  doesn't seem right to me. You don't get to do this.    You can imagine what it was like for these people who got caught up  in this and were told by IRS agents and Department of Justice lawyers  the nature of that intimidation and how heavy-handed and aggressive  that is. Yet these people said: No, no, no. That is not right. That is  not the way this country is supposed to work.   So they brought it to people's attention, and, Mr. Speaker, people on  both sides of the aisle were scandalized by what they heard about this  and were troubled by it and said: We can do something about it.   So as a result of this, you have got something that is moving  through. Look, it is a tumultuous time in our public life, and there  are many deep divisions within this House and across the country about  all kinds of issues. But do you know what? Nobody is here defending the  status quo of how these people were treated.   So the institution worked. The institution heard what was going on,  and now people have come together on both sides of the aisle to move  forward on this basis.   I want to echo Mr. Neal's admonition to the Department of Justice. It  is not good enough for the Department of Justice to go into a passive- aggressive mode and to say: Well, we are just going to wait these  people out.   That is not good enough. We need to make sure that the Department of  Justice is acting forthrightly, is reviewing these cases, and is moving  them with dispatch.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, Mr. Crowley, Mr. Lewis, Mr. Neal,  and Chairman Brady. I urge passage of the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Rush) be removed as a cosponsor of H.R. 1697, as his  name was added in error.
