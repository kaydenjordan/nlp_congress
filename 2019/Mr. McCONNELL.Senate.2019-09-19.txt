 Madam President, I want to thank the senior Senator  from Iowa for his observations this morning. That is exactly where we  find ourselves with what happened on the Senate floor yesterday  afternoon.                            ____________________     Madam President, Senate Democrats blocked this year's  funding for our national defense. They voted it down. We can't move the  legislation forward.   Democrats blocked the funding our commanders need to keep pace with  Russia and China. Democrats blocked money for the tools and training  that our men and women in uniform badly need while our adversaries  continually pour money into new weapons and technology. The Democrats  even voted against a pay raise--a pay raise--for our servicemembers.  All but two Democrats voted to filibuster all of this and kept the  Senate from even considering the legislation.   Never mind that before we adjourned in August the Democrats in the  House and Senate all agreed to a carefully negotiated framework to keep  our appropriations process on track. In fact, the Speaker of the House  and the Democratic leader in the Senate publicly agreed to the exact  dollar figure for the Defense bill they just voted down yesterday. They  publicly agreed to the number in the Defense bill they just voted down  yesterday.   We all agreed in the caps agreement that poison pills, new policy  riders, or any changes to Presidential transfer authorities were off  the table--off the table--unless both sides were on board.   So the appropriations process, including at the committee level with  Chairman Shelby and Ranking Member Leahy, appeared to be going pretty  smoothly, but, as we have seen a number of other times in the recent  past, the Democratic leadership seemed to have a change of heart.   Perhaps it sunk in that actually meeting President Trump and  Republicans halfway, as divided government obviously requires, might  have earned some criticism from the far left. But whatever the reason,  our Democratic friends turned on a dime, reneged on the bipartisan  agreement, and began demanding exactly the kinds of poison pills and  partisan policy changes that we all promised not to do.   That is how we get to a spectacle like what happened yesterday. That  is how we get to a place where 42 Senate Democrats vote to filibuster  defense funding and obstruct a pay raise for our servicemembers, for  all the world to see, because Democratic leadership decided they saw  more of a political upside in picking new fights with the President  than in keeping their word and investing in our men and women in  uniform.   In fact, I understand that just yesterday, our Democratic leaders  were offered even more money for the Labor-HHS bill, but they declined  it. So it is not about the money. It is not about compromising and  getting to yes. It is about not wanting to take yes for an answer.  [[Page S5584]]    I have great respect for our Democratic friends, but I think this  episode has to go down as a new high-water mark for the policy  consequences of what some people call ``Trump derangement syndrome.''   We are at a point where 42 Senate Democrats would decline to fund the  U.S. Armed Forces essentially just to spite the occupant of the White  House. If you ask me, that is one heck of a price to pay to put on a  show for ``the resistance.''   But yesterday's vote is now a matter of record. It is in the past. I  really am hopeful that we can get back on track with the kind of  appropriations process my Democratic colleagues have already pledged  they would support. They had already pledged to support it.   When the good work that takes place in committees is allowed to  proceed without this top-down partisan maneuvering, it tends to yield  pretty good results. I think we were all pleased with the bipartisan  funding bill that Chairman Shelby and Senator Leahy produced together  last year. I understand this morning's appropriations markup is  expected to be bipartisan as well.   For example, I am proud the Financial Services and General Government  bill would include a bipartisan amendment providing another $250  million for the administration and security of elections, to help  States improve their defenses and shore up their voting systems.   I am proud to have helped develop this amendment and to cosponsor it  in committee. That would bring our total allocation for election  security to more than $600 million since fiscal 2008.   It is a crucial issue. The Trump administration has made enormous  strides to help States secure their elections without giving Washington  new power to push the States around. That is how we continue the  progress we saw in 2018, and that is exactly what we are doing.   This is exactly the kind of positive outcome that is possible when we  stop posturing for the press and let Chairman Shelby and Senator Leahy  conduct a bipartisan committee process.   As time grows shorter before the end of September, I hope the  critical defense funding that Democrats blocked yesterday will soon  earn the same kind of productive treatment, because I don't think the  American people will have much patience with the notion that Democrats'  first responsibility is irritating the White House and funding the  Department of Defense coming second.   I hope we can reboot this process and move forward for the sake of  our Senate process, for the sake of stable funding for our government,  and for the sake of our Nation's security.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
