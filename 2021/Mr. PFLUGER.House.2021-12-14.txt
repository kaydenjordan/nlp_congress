 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to defeat the previous  question. I love this righteous discussion about law and order. It has  been nearly 1 year of one-party rule for this country, and I speak for  my constituents--I rise as a Texan--and countless others across the  Nation who have whiplash from being tossed from one crisis to another  crisis to yet another crisis caused by the policies, the misguided  policies of this administration.   We are not changing the subject here. We are actually staying focused  on the issues that matter to most Americans, the complete breakdown of  respect for law enforcement and the rule of law. Since we are talking  about the rule of law, the breakdown of the rule of law has crime  running rampant. We have heard about fentanyl; we have heard about the  rising crime in communities like mine because of the open border that  we have.                                time  1245    You know who doesn't show up for court orders? 99.9 percent of the  illegal immigrants who are served those papers, they are the ones who  don't show up, since we are talking about the rule of law.   We have Americans, as a matter of fact, that are still stranded  behind enemy lines after President Biden's Afghanistan catastrophe.  Communist China is enjoying their free pass after unleashing COVID-19  on the world and committing literal genocide on Uyghur Muslims in  China. Millions of Americans are at risk of losing their jobs if they  don't comply with the tyrannical mask mandate, a crippling national  debt, an impending energy crisis, and an all-out humanitarian disaster  on our border; those are the issues that we are not changing the  subject on, we are actually focusing on.   But today, instead of addressing these crises, Democrats have  recycled their old tricks and are wasting time trying to punish, yet  again, President Trump.   You can only beat the same dead horse so many times.   Republicans are here to work, and it is long past time that action is  taken to quell these crises. We are urging our Democratic colleagues to  look at the crisis at hand. When is the last time that one of my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle visited the border and can  speak with any sort of authority that we don't have a crisis?   We need to stop illegal immigration. We need to finish the wall. We  have got to secure this border.
