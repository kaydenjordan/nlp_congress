 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the urgent need to  implement Medicaid expansion in North Carolina. In March, our State  became the 40th to pass legislation to expand Medicaid after over a  decade of political gridlock.   Nevertheless, Republicans in the general assembly are needlessly  delaying implementation because they continue to bicker with each other  over the State budget, jeopardizing healthcare for over 600,000 North  Carolinians. Every day that Republicans wait to expand Medicaid is  another day that a mother with cancer or a grandfather with diabetes  cannot access the care they need, care that saves lives.   More than a decade ago, I fought for Medicaid expansion in the  general assembly. More than a decade ago, vulnerable North Carolinians  desperate for affordable healthcare began waiting for their leaders to  do the right thing.   Mr. Speaker, our people have been waiting a decade too long. The  people of our State deserve action now--not next month and not next  year--to ensure that they can access the healthcare they desperately  need.                            ____________________
