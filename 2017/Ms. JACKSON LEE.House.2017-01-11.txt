 Mr. Speaker, on Wednesday, January 11, 2017, I was  unavoidably detained attending to representation duties and was not  present for rollcall Votes 32 through 34. Had I been present, I would  have voted as follows: On rollcall 32, I would have voted ``no.'' On  rollcall 33, I would have voted ``no.'' On rollcall 34, I would have  voted ``aye.''                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I thank the distinguished chairman and  the distinguished ranking member for convening us. It reenforces my  commitment to the importance of the House Judiciary Committee for  important, innovative, and groundbreaking, in some instances, work that  we have done.   In this instance, I find fault because this legislation does not meet  that criteria. Just a few days ago, we read the  [[Page H332]]  Constitution, and some might make the argument that H.R. 5 fits very  comfortably into the Bill of Rights, Amendment V and Amendment XIV.  Both frame themselves around the question of due process. I make the  argument that this legislation is sorely lacking.   I want to take up, first of all, a point made by my colleague, a  member of the Rules Committee. This legislation, to my recalling, has  been circulated for many years. It seems that I have been in the House  when a bill like H.R. 5 has passed over and over again.   This bill appeared in the 114th Congress. Many Members left since  that time. New Members are here. New Members, Republicans and  Democrats, will be added to the House Judiciary Committee and to the  Senate Judiciary Committee. None of them will have had the opportunity  for regular order, to be able to ensure hearings and to be able to  engage in input with amendments that I would agree or disagree with,  but to have a vigorous debate in our Judiciary Committee as well as in  the Senate. It did not happen. We are now on the floor of the House. So  that is one fracture of what we are doing, one Achilles' heel to this  legislation.   In the last 24 hours, I heard a news account of a little boy who  swallowed magnets that were produced by a particular company. It went  through the process. It was designated dangerous; and then,  unfortunately, that dangerous status was pulled back, and the company  is excited about producing those magnets again.   The little boy who swallowed the magnets, I think, was about 2 years  old. A happy little boy, of course, that is how children are. He had  major intestinal surgery, and most of his intestines were removed. He  is now 6 years old, and he must now be fed intravenously.                                time  1445    His devastation is our failure. That is what we are facing with H.R.  5.   I don't know if my colleagues agree, as boring as the Administrative  Procedure Act was in law school, I liked the course. I had a great  professor who made me understand the life of the APA and its value.  This legislation attempts to rewrite the Administrative Procedure Act  to the detriment of the American people.   Consider this, hardworking agencies should have oversight; that is  what our committees are all about. They should have oversight. They  will now have to jump through hoops of 70 new criteria. I didn't say  10; I didn't say a quarter of 100, 25; I didn't say a half of 100, 50;  but 70 when issuing rules, including alternatives to any rule proposal,  the scope of the problems the rule meant to address, and potential cost  and benefits of the proposal and alternative.   I want to see small businesses thrive. Part of that includes a  reasonable healthcare package like ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act,  for its employees, a reasonable new structure dealing with taxation  that helps small businesses and does not give a mountain of benefit to  major corporations.   Maybe we should address the needs of small businesses in that manner,  or, as my minority constituents tell me, access to credit which is  generally denied to women, Hispanics, in some instances, and certainly  African Americans. That may help our small businesses get them back on  their feet. But that is not what H.R. 5 does. It stifles the work of  our agencies of which we have attributed to them, the Small Business  Administration, Health and Human Services, the Federal Trade  Commission, the FCC, and, in some instances, the Department of Justice  articulating regulations dealing with funding of juvenile issues.    I thank the gentleman.   These are agencies that are depended upon to give regular order.  Oversight is important, but I would make the argument that stifling,  denying, demolishing, or destroying is not order.   Now, I had an amendment that I think is crucial. It is to provide an  exception under this bill for regulations that help prevent cyber  attacks on election processes or institutions. Mr. Chairman, not only  have we found with much profoundness that a foreign entity, in this  instance Russia, maybe it might be Iran, maybe it might be some other  country, intruded into the democratic process of elections. I am glad  Senator Graham said this is not Republicans or Democrats. This is about  the integrity of the election system. And why we were hesitant to make  this amendment in order, because there is no stopping of the peaceful  transfer of government. The American people see to that process. Thank  God for our love of democracy. We are able to express our opposition in  many different ways.   But there is no doubt there was not only intrusion, there was skewing  from one candidate versus another. There are prints--this is public  knowledge--that have been able to be tracked to suggest who, what, and  what country, and how far up the chain to Mr. Putin that it went to.   So my amendment, I think, was constructive. Why would we be reluctant  to debate it? Why would we be reluctant to acknowledge the intelligence  report assessing Russian activities and intentions in the recent U.S.  elections? And why would we be reluctant to find out who was involved?   H.R. 5 is not doing what it is supposed to do. It is, in fact,  undermining the Constitution and eliminating the protections for a  little boy who now lives his life completely different because maybe we  didn't intervene in the regulatory manner of oversight over that  product that we should have, and maybe now we have given them a pass so  that other children might suffer the same consequences. I ask my  colleagues to vote against the underlying bill and send it back for us  to do the work of the people in regular order.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 5,  the ``Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017,'' which is a radical  measure that could make it impossible to promulgate safety regulations  to protect the public.   I oppose this legislation because it would effectively shut down the  entire U.S. regulatory system, amending in one fell swoop every bedrock  existing regulatory statute.   My opposition to H.R. 5 is amplified by the Rules Committee's  decision to decline to make in order the Jackson Lee Amendment, ``to  provide an exception for regulations that help prevent cyberattacks on  election processes or institutions.''   Apparently, House Republicans are still reluctant to debate the  subject--undisputed by our Intelligence community--of Russian  cyberattacks on American cyber networks and infrastructure.   Key Judgments in the Intelligence Community Assessment's declassified  version of a highly classified report entitled, ``Assessing Russian  Activities and Intentions in Recent U.S. Elections,'' have confirmed  that 2016 witnessed the first American presidential election that was  the subject of cyberattacks.   These and other subversive activities have been confirmed to have  been perpetrated by entities allied with the Government of Russia and  were undertaken for the express purpose of influencing the presidential  contest to secure the election of its preferred candidate, Donald  Trump, who made history by becoming the first presidential candidate to  invite a hostile foreign power to launch cyberattacks against his  political opponent.   All three agencies, CIA, FBI and NSA, agree with this judgment.   The so-called Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA), in addition if to  this rule, demonstrates the deceptive design of the majority to make it  harder to establish regulations to protect the public by tilting the  entire regulatory system significantly toward special interests.   The bill allows Federal courts without expertise on technical issues  to substitute their judgment for those of the expert federal agencies.   These agencies are staffed with career subject matter experts that  are deeply knowledgeable of the background, context, and history of  agency actions and policy rationale.   For this reason, courts have long deferred to agency experts who are  in the best position to carry out the statutes.   The RAA would end this well-established practice and allow far less  experienced judges to second guess expert opinion--essentially  sanctioning judicial activism.   The Jackson Lee Amendment, however, would have attuned this dangerous  legislation to provide an exception for regulation upon which Americans  so greatly rely on their government to help prevent cyberattacks on our  highly coveted and esteemed election processes and institutions.   The bill promoted by the majority, calling for accountability from  our Administrative Agencies--fails to answer in accountability to the  threat posed by foreign and domestic invaders on our national cyber  networks.   As the new Congress commences in the People's House, obstructionist  Republicans are circumventing the very procedures by which elected  officials answer the cries of outrage and dismay of desperately  concerned constituents.   To the obstructionist majority perpetuating this restrictive rule,  let me stand firm in the American convictions laid bare by the Jackson  Lee Amendment--the system of Checks and Balances established by the  Separation of Powers clause of the Constitution will not be thwarted.   The spirit of the H.R. 5 is clearly designed to stop all regulation  dead in its tracks--no matter the threat to cyber networks, national  security, economy, or the very health and safety of the American  people.   We know that Russia's cyber activities were intended to influence the  election, erode faith in U.S. democratic institutions, sow doubt about  the integrity of our electoral process, and undermine confidence in the  institutions of the U.S. government. These actions are unacceptable and  will not be tolerated.   The mission of the Intelligence Community is to seek to reduce the  uncertainty surrounding foreign activities, capabilities, or leaders'  intentions.   On these issues of great importance to U.S. national security, the  goal of intelligence analysis is to provide assessments to decision  makers that are intellectually rigorous, objective, timely, and useful,  and that adhere to tradecraft standards.   Applying these standards helps ensure that the Intelligence Community  provides U.S. policymakers, warfighters, and operators with the best  and most accurate insight, warning, and context, as well as potential  opportunities to advance U.S. national security.   This objective is difficult to achieve when seeking to understand  complex issues on which foreign actors go to extraordinary lengths to  hide or obfuscate their activities.   My amendment would have improved H.R. 5 by exempting only those  regulations critical to making cyber networks invulnerable to attack  from foreign and domestic agencies and individuals.   Specifically, the amendment that the Rules Committee disallowed for  presentation on a vote here on the floor today would have provided the  American people an exemption to allow for the prevention of tampering,  alteration, or misappropriation of information by agents of foreign  countries with the purpose or effect of interfering with or undermining  election processes or institutions.  [[Page H335]]    In particular, restrictions put forth in H.R. 5 could result in  further delay to agencies attempting to take action to help network  defenders better identify new tactics or techniques that a malicious  actor might deploy or detect and disrupt an ongoing intrusion, in  addition to protecting data that enables cybersecurity firms and other  network defenders to identify certain malware that the Russian  intelligence services use.   The Regulatory Accountability Act provides no accountability to the  American public.   Instead, it allows polluting industries and special interests to game  the system and escape accountability for any harm they inflict.   It makes it incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to secure new  public protections and arms industry with numerous tools to avoid their  legal obligations.   The increasing use of cyber-enabled means to undermine democratic  processes at home and abroad, as exemplified by Russia's recent  activities, has made clear that a tool explicitly targeting attempts to  interfere with elections is also warranted.   We cannot afford to let global terroristic threats, in the form of  cyber activities, erode faith in U.S. democratic institutions, sow  doubt about the integrity of our electoral process, influence  elections, or undermine confidence in the institutions of the U.S.  government.   My amendment would have offered protections guarding the integrity of  our cyber networks, while at the same time allowing the bill to achieve  the proponents' major purposes.   For these reasons and more, I oppose this bill.    Mr. Chairman, I applaud Mr. Johnson, the ranking  member of the subcommittee for his leadership on these issues, and the  ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Conyers, for his persistent  leadership, having gone over this bill any number of times. Let me  mention that Mr. Johnson's amendment is vital because it deals with  vulnerable workforce individuals, individuals with disabilities,  limited English proficiency, and other requirements. And I would beg to  differ with my good friend from Pennsylvania, 70 different elements of  criteria that you will put these regulations through, you are simply  trying to implode those who advocate for the rights of workers, unions,  and others. Therefore, I would question the viability of trying to  obstruct, helping these vulnerable workers. This is a very good  amendment.   Let me be very clear. Since 2010, U.S. businesses have added 15.6  million jobs. From 2014 to 2015, real median household income grew by  5.2 percent. We know that, as Jason Furman, chairman of the Council of  Economic Advisers notes, demographic changes in labor force  participation, primarily driven by a large increase in retirement by  baby boomers that began in 2008, has consistently weighed on employment  growth. It is quite different from when President Reagan was in. The  labor force participation rate is low because of these variables.                                time  1645    These regulations are not going to improve that participation. The  Obama recovery has been slower because, under Reagan, we realized the  baby boomers were in their prime. Now the baby boomers are retiring.   We need to provide opportunities for younger workers, minority  workers, workers with disabilities; and this, H.R. 5, with all of these  hoops that the regulation has to go through that are protecting or  empowering workers or increasing the opportunities for workers is  certainly going to thwart that growth.   You cannot deny that this administration has seen growth with  200,000-plus jobs per month over a series of  [[Page H358]]  years. I would argue that Mr. Johnson's amendment is a strong  amendment. It promotes job growth, and it gives opportunities to many  who are vulnerable in the workforce.   I ask my colleagues to support the Johnson amendment.   Mr. Chair, my Republican colleagues have made several statements  concerning economic activity that invite fact checks:   First, they argue that the labor force participation rate is  historically low, but as we all know, the labor force participation is  affected by both long term trends and short term policies. As Jason  Furman, the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, notes,  ``demograpic changes in labor force participation--primarily driven by  a large increase in retirement by baby boomers that began in 2008--have  consistently weighed on employment growth.''   Second, they argue that the Obama recovery has been slower than the  economic recovery under the Reagan Administration. But this argument is  laughable. President Reagan's recovery benefited from the fact that  many baby boomers were in the prime working years while President  Obama's recovery has taken place in front of the backdrop of an aging  U.S. population. More importantly, the economic lows of the Reagan  Administration are not comparable to the mortgage-foreclosure crisis,  which resulted in higher unemployment than any other period since the  Great Depression.   Finally, despite many bald assertions, my Republican colleagues have  not satisfactorily explained how H.R. 5 will create a single job or  responded to President Obama's unimpeachable jobs record. In fact,  despite, strong economic headwinds and years of Republican  obstructionism during the majority of his presidency, the U.S. economy  is 11.5 percent larger than its peak before the 2008 economic crisis as  of the third quarter of 2016.   Since early 2010, U.S. businesses have added 15.6 million jobs.   From 2014 to 2015, real median household income grew by 5.2 percent,  the fastest annual growth on record, and the United States saw its  largest one-year drop in the poverty rate since the 1960s.   In closing, there is little evidence supporting my Republican  colleagues' claims and if there is any doubt that the H.R. 5 will  undermine workforce participation, my colleagues should support my  amendment.    Will the gentleman yield?    I thank the gentleman for his kindness.   Would the gentleman not count automation and technology as one of the  elements and, as well, the idea of the retiring of baby boomers as part  of the issue of growth? And can we not work together to question those  particular elements so that we can collectively and collaboratively  promote job growth?    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
