 Mr. President, in my typically classy fashion, I dropped  the microphone before I began to speak.   I was glad to yield to my friend from New Jersey when he told me the  reason why because I have three daughters at home, and if one of them-- if I were fortunate enough to have one of them here in Washington, I  would want to be having dinner with her, too, instead of being here,  but I am here tonight for them and for families just like the other  Senators have talked about.   My family has an interesting immigration history that people are  surprised by sometimes when I talk about it. My mom and her parents  were Polish Jews when World War II broke out. Miraculously, they  survived the Holocaust. They and one other member of the family  survived, and they actually lived for 2 years behind the Iron Curtain,  in Eastern Europe. They were finally able to get to Sweden where they  lived for 1 year, and they came to Mexico--of all places, Mexico City-- where they lived for 1 year. Then they finally made it to America, a  country they believed was the only place on the planet where they could  rebuild their shattered lives, and that is what they did. They  contributed mightily to this country. They contributed mightily to me,  to my brother, and to my sister.   When I hear the stories that I hear from my colleagues tonight, what  it makes me realize is that my family's story is not unique, but it is  what makes America unique because you can't tell my family's story in  almost any other country but this country.   I had the chance, when I was first in this job, to go to Fort Carson  in Colorado to a naturalization ceremony there. There were 30 people  from every corner of the globe in our uniform because they were  fighting for America, but they weren't yet citizens. They took the oath  to that flag, and I used to carry around the list of the countries they  came from because out of 30, only 2 came from the same country. Twenty  eight came from places all over the Earth, and I sat there thinking to  myself how lucky we are to live in a place where that could be true. It  is not true in any other country on the planet.    I want my children to grow up in the country I grew up in--a country  that is a nation of immigrants committed to the rule of law. That is  why I was grateful to have the chance to be part of the Gang of 8 that  negotiated the comprehensive immigration bill. I was sorry when that  didn't ever get a vote in the House, because I think it would have  passed had it been voted on in the House. That bill, which contained  $40 billion for border security, would be well on its way to  implementation today, and I think our political debate as a country  would be very different than the political debate we have been having  now, which would be good for our country and remind us of the values  that we share. Unfortunately, we are not in that position today, and we  are left with a problem, trying to deal with the fact that the  Executive order that President Obama wrote for the DACA population has  been set aside by this President, who then said: Congress needs to  figure out what to do about it. That is why we are here tonight.   We have had a negotiation now for more than 4 months with what has  evolved into the Gang of 6, and I am very pleased that in that effort  we were joined by the Presiding Officer, who is my colleague from  Colorado. We are the only State that has two Senators on this Gang of  6--one is a Democrat,  [[Page S263]]  and one is a Republican. I thank my colleague for his courage and for  his leadership at a moment when there are a lot of reasons why this  isn't a comfortable place to occupy. But I think it says something  about Colorado that at a moment when we have all this craziness going  on in Washington and at a moment when the country can't see any sign of  a bipartisan pulse here, when our approval ratings hover somewhere  between 9 and 15 percent, there is a reason there is a Democrat and  there is a Republican from Colorado who actually tried to solve a  problem on the floor of this Senate with our colleagues, and that is  because Colorado is an excellent place to live and an excellent place  to be from.   The citizens of Colorado have watched the train wreck over the last  10 years in this Congress from a State that is one-third Democratic,  one-third Republican, and one-third Independent. They have to work  together to get anything done. Nobody gets their way all the time in  the State of Colorado, and they expect this place to work like that as  well, and it doesn't work like that enough.   So I want to thank again my colleague from Colorado. I want to thank  Senator Durbin, who is here, Senator Menendez, and I also want to say  to Senator Flake and Senator Graham: Thank you for your courage. When  you put together a compromise like this, which I think is a good  compromise--it is not the bill I would have written if it were my  decision. I would have had a 5-year path for the Dreamers, not a 12- year path or a 10-year path in some cases. I would have had a 5-year  path. If I were writing this bill, I wouldn't have insisted that  Dreamers not be able to sponsor their parents. The hour is late. It is  actually not that late. We should be working, but I understand why the  Republicans who negotiated this in good faith needed those concessions.  I understand it.   I am not thrilled with the President's idea that we need to build a  wall to secure the southern border. I do believe strongly that we do  need to secure our southern border, just as I know the Republicans that  have been in this negotiation believe, as I believe, that there should  be a pathway for citizenship for a population of people in our country  who know no other country but the United States of America, any more  than my own children know any other country besides the United States  of America.   There isn't, unfortunately, anybody else to do this work except for  the 100 Members in the Senate and our friends in the House of  Representatives. So our tendency has been to just avoid it and to put  it off, and we don't have that luxury anymore because they are no  longer protected. Every day in my State there is another family broken  up because of the deportation that is going on, and I don't think there  is virtually anybody who is a Member of this body who believes the  answer for the Dreamers is that they should be deported or that  families should be split up. We may have disagreements about how to get  there, but that is what the last 4 months of negotiation have been  meant to sort out--to find a middle spot where we could land and where  we would get not every vote in the Senate but more than 60 votes in the  Senate and where we would get a bill passed in the House of  Representatives. I think we found it, and one of the things we have  done is to meet the four requirements that the President said he wanted  when he had us over to the White House: One was DACA. That is the  modified Dream Act. One was border security. We have got $2.7 billion  of border security in this bill. One was ending what he calls chain  migration, which for the DACA population we do by saying that no parent  can be sponsored by any child. And he said that he wanted to get rid of  the diversity lottery, which we do. He may not love every part of it. I  don't expect anybody to, but I do think this is the way we can move  this forward, and I think we should move it forward.   Bob Menendez talked about the fierce urgency that now we treat the  lives that are affected by the decisions we make or, in most cases, the  decisions we don't make as collateral damage that somehow we shouldn't  concern ourselves with. I don't think we should go home until we  address this. I don't think we should leave Washington until we address  this.   Actually, I will say that I agree with something Senator Graham said.  Because of these crazy continuing resolutions--let me just say, in case  there is the unlikely event that there is anybody actually watching  this on television right now, that a continuing resolution is no  different than a temporary budget, and that is all it is--now we have  gotten to the place where we were running the government on continuing  resolutions for the last 10 years or so. We have passed 30 continuing  resolutions. We didn't get our work done at the end of the year for  some reason. So now we are going to do the work we should have done at  the end of the year with a continuing resolution. They are now talking  about another 2-week continuing resolution. Every time you hear the  words ``continuing resolution'' you should think of it as a temporary  budget. That is what it is. It might be hard to understand it because  not a single school district in our State or a single municipality in  our State and not a single State among the 50 States would ever run  their affairs this way, but for the last 10 years, that is the way we  have run the government in a game of chicken, of fiscal cliffs,  government shutdowns, and continuing resolutions. So we are now  enacting laws that reflect the priorities of whoever was in the Senate  10 years ago, because that is the last time we actually had a real  appropriations process around here and a real budgeting process around  here. So Senator Graham is right when he said what he said about the  defense of this country. Because of continuing resolutions, we have  aircraft that are grounded for lack of parts because the budgets make  it impossible for them to plan, and that means that we can't train  folks to fly those aircraft, to defend us if we have to do something on  the Korean Peninsula or something else.    On the other hand, on the domestic side of things, since 1980 we have  cut domestic discretionary spending in this country by 35 percent as a  percentage of our GDP. The Presiding Officer knows as well as I do that  if you were in rural Colorado 10 years ago, you didn't hear much about  opioids, but now when you have a townhall meeting in rural Colorado or  when you live there, as the Presiding Officer does, you know that  people actually have less access to treatment today than they did 10  years ago, and I think that is a consequence of our inability to budget  properly around here and the inability to deal responsibly with our  fiscal matters. It is like we have a perpetual head cold around here  that robs us of our ambition to actually do anything or energy to  actually do anything, and I am afraid that has infected this discussion  about DACA as well.   So I want to close by saying that this is the moment when we need to  do this. There is not going to be another alternative that can be  supported by 60 Senators here, potentially by the President, and by the  Dreamers. We are not going to succeed at passing a piece of legislation  if the Dreamers feel like we are doing something to their parents that  we would never accept for our own families. That is their bottom line.   I have been amazed by the young people who I have met over the years  and most recently in this debate, who are saying to me: Don't sacrifice  my parents for me. I would rather deal with the uncertainty of my  position than to know that a trade was made that I can't live with for  the rest of my life. That is at the heart of this compromise here, and  I think it is entirely consistent with our traditions and values as  Americans--entirely consistent with that.   So my hope is that all of us hear the voices of these Dreamers, who  are contributing at their universities and in our workplaces all over  the country, just like our own sons and daughters, and that we actually  do something around here for once that is not predictable and that the  American people will cheer for, just as the people in Colorado are  glad. It is not every single one, but by and large, the people in  Colorado are glad that the Presiding Officer and I are working on this.  The only way that is going to happen is if we find a way to come  together over the next couple of days and do something, other than what  people say we are fated to do, which is have another interruption in  the activities of our government over a political disagreement when the  parties are actually  [[Page S264]]  much closer than they have been for a long time. We have a good  compromise. We have a good piece of legislation. We have a piece of  legislation that if it were put on the floor could get 60 votes.   I want to close by again thanking my colleagues. There is a lot  around this place that I feel embarrassed about, but I think that if  the American people could have seen the negotiation that went on for 4  months, they would have been proud of what they saw because they would  have seen Republicans and Democrats coming together not to have one  more political fight but to actually solve a real challenge that is  facing our country and to do it in a way that is consistent with our  traditions as Americans.   So I hope in the next couple of days we have the chance to pass this  bill. I thank my Republican colleagues who signed onto the bill today  for giving us the momentum we need to move into the next day or two,  and I look forward to succeeding around here for once.   Once again, I want to thank my colleague from Colorado, the Presiding  Officer, for his partnership on this legislation. I think it has meant  a great deal to the people he and I represent, and I, as a Coloradan  and as a constituent of his, want to thank him for the position that he  has taken.   With that, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
