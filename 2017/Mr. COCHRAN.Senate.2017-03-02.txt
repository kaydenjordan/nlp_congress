 Mr. President, let me thank the distinguished majority  leader for his generous remarks about my service in the Senate, as has  been reflected by the last long number of years. It is heartwarming,  and it also reminds me of how important our collective efforts are for  the future of our country, our economy, peace in our time, and in  helping ensure that we make our time here a positive influence over the  opportunities that are available for our citizens to enjoy life, safe  and secure, with good leaders and commonsense leaders. That is what our  leader is.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
