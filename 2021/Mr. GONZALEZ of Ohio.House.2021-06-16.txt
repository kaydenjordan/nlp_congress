 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the  [[Page H2828]]  life of Brycen Gray, a talented and bright young man who was sadly  taken away from us this past April.   A native of Strongsville, in my district, Brycen was a student- athlete at St. Edward High School. Dubbed a comedian by his friends and  family, he had the power to bring a smile and joy to everyone he  encountered.   Unfortunately, we lost Brycen in April. Following a battle with  COVID-19, Brycen began to exhibit symptoms associated with COVID  psychosis. Though he fought to the bitter end, he tragically passed  after taking his own life.   Mr. Speaker, when I hear these stories and when I talk to the family,  it is impossible not to get emotional. We lost a gifted, talented young  man. And the hurt and pain that is inflicted upon those left behind is  something no one should ever have to endure.   This is a moment where we should turn grief into action and actively  find solutions. To start, we should work with the scientific community  to gain a better understanding of the mental health implications of  COVID-19 on Americans and other root causes of suicide, in particular  amongst young Americans. This will help us look for further warning  signs and make sure that young Americans get the help that they need.   We must not let Brycen's memory be forgotten. I pray for his parents,  Shawn and Tara, and his two brothers, Ricky and Patrick, and the rest  of the Gray family that has had to battle this horrible loss.                            ____________________
