 BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, sadly, voter  turnout in the United States ranks as one of the lowest among developed  democratic countries.   We know that low voter turnout results in frustration, apathy, and a  democracy that is not truly representative of the public.   Fortunately, Mr. Speaker, there is one relatively easy way that we  can address this and improve voter turnout, and that is to switch to  weekend voting. Weekend voting is a proven method that increases  accessibility, engagement, and turnout.   The reason why we vote on Tuesday in the United States is because of  a law that has existed ever since 1845. It was because we didn't want  to vote on the Sabbath; it took a day to travel to the county seat; and  people needed to get back home in time for market day on Wednesday.  Clearly, society has changed a great deal in the last 173 years.   That is why I introduced the Louise Slaughter Weekend Voting Act to  officially change election day to the first weekend after the first  Friday in November. Weekend voting makes sense, and our representative  democracy should demand it.                            ____________________
