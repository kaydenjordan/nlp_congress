 Mr. Speaker, it is with great sadness that I speak  today about the passing of the great Kansan and former Member of the  United States Congress, my friend, Mr. Richard Dale Nichols.   Dick was born in southeast Kansas and honorably served his country in  World War II as a member of the United States Navy. Upon returning to  Kansas, he attended Kansas State University and was a fellow Beta Theta  Pi fraternity brother.   After graduation, Dick entered the banking industry and, ultimately,  settled down in McPherson, Kansas, where he served as president and  then as chairman of the board for Home State Bank & Trust.   In 1990, Dick was elected to the United States Congress, representing  the Fifth Congressional District of Kansas. Two years later, following  the census, Dick's district was eliminated, and he returned to life as  a businessman, but he never gave up his passion and love for our  country.   Dick served as president of the Kansas Bankers Association, was  active in the local Chamber of Commerce, and was a fellow Rotarian. He  was a proud husband, father, and grandfather, and his outgoing,  optimistic personality gained him new friends wherever he traveled.   I had the opportunity to get to know Dick and will always be grateful  for the time and energy he spent helping me find my way to Washington,  D.C. When I was back in McPherson, I always enjoyed chatting with him  about Kansas State athletics, fellow Beta fraternity brothers, and  Republican politics.   Our thoughts and prayers are with Dick's wife, Linda, and the entire  Nichols family as they mourn the loss of a great Kansan and a great  man. He will certainly be missed.       Restoring Integrity of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program     Mr. Speaker, I stand in support of Secretary Sonny  Perdue and the Department of Agriculture's proposed rule to restore the  integrity of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and  implement the program as a safety net, not a way of life.   In 2019, too many able-bodied men and women remain on the sidelines  of our workforce. Recent data published by the U.S. Federal Reserve in  February indicate a historically robust economy yet sluggish labor  force participation rates, indicating a continued reluctance by some to  engage in the workplace.                                time  1015    According to data from USDA, we have more families accepting SNAP  dollars today than we did at the height of the financial crisis of  2008.   Despite major economic gains and today's record low unemployment; too  many States are allowing people to opt out of work, leaving employers  to spend valuable resources searching for men and women to fill our  many vacant jobs.   By requiring able-bodied adults without minor dependents who are  seeking SNAP benefits to work at least 20 hours a week while  participating in training or educational programs, we are ensuring  these men and women are no longer disengaged from the labor market, but  finding a way back to the workforce and long-term self-sufficiency.   This Nation's economy is as strong as it has been in my professional  lifetime. We must continue to encourage individuals to become self- sufficient and find new employment opportunities.   For too long, too many States have bypassed the rules and allowed  able-bodied adults to neglect valuable job training and educational  opportunities.   Employers across the country have good-paying jobs that can help  individuals move out of poverty and regain their independence and  integrity.   It is time we restore SNAP to its intended purpose, help men and  women move back into the workforce, and take a major step in closing  the workforce participation gap.                          Closing the Digital Divide     Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss the progress made over  the past two years to close the digital divide.   Access to a reliable internet connection remains a significant  challenge in rural America and across my district. Society is becoming  more and more reliant on broadband, whether for access to educational  resources, telemedicine, or precision agriculture technology.   At the end of 2016, more than 26 million Americans did not have  access to high speed internet. However, in a recent draft report  circulated by Chairman Pai, that number dropped to just over 19 million  at the end of 2017, with many of these new connections being in rural  America. According to that report, fiber was deployed to another almost  6 million homes by the end of 2018, which is the largest number ever  recorded.   Reducing regulatory burdens for deployment has helped to incentivize  investment. Our local providers are working hard to leverage Federal  programs, private dollars, and savings from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  to further deploy broadband infrastructure to rural communities, better  connecting our farmers, small businesses, and families. Companies like  Rockhouse Motion, a digital media company in Geneseo, Kansas, or Rollin  J Boutique in Phillipsburg, Kansas, both in my district, are able to  thrive thanks to that internet connection.   Mr. Speaker, I applaud our efforts at the FCC, the USDA, and Congress  to make broadband access in rural America both affordable and reliable.  I also encourage my colleagues to continue working to ensure that  Americans have access to an internet connection no matter where they  live.                            ____________________
