 Mr. Speaker, no one on that side of the aisle cares more  about the lives lost than the people on this side of the aisle. We are  as heartbroken as anyone is. We are trying to find a balance between  the thing that we have all agreed and swore an oath to uphold and  defend, the rights granted by God enshrined in our Constitution and  weigh that--and weigh that--with keeping our community safe.   Ladies and gentlemen, our society has a sickness. That is for sure.  The laws passed in this House to restrict people from their  constitutional, God-given rights that criminals disobey is not going to  change that. It is not going to change that.   We can do something great here today. We could. We could do something  great in this body, Mr. Speaker, but we are not going to.   We are going to infringe on the rights of the law-abiding who want to  defend themselves for the sake of the criminals who refuse to follow  the law.
