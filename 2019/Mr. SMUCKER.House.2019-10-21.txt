 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and thank an  educator from my district who recently received a Presidential Award  for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching from the National  Science Foundation.   Mr. Speaker, Elizabeth Brown of Brogue in southern York County was a  chemistry, physics, and forensic science teacher at North Harford High  School in Maryland. As a teacher, Beth started a Women in Science  luncheon to support young women interested in careers in science.   Beth currently has left teaching but is working to help other  science, technology, engineering, and math, or  [[Page H8285]]  STEM, teachers by writing Next Generation Science Standards curriculum.   Mr. Speaker, I am incredibly thankful for the passion that Beth  shared with her students, instilling in them an appetite for learning  that they will carry for the rest of their lives.   Congratulations to Ms. Brown on receiving the Presidential award.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Elizabeth Brown for her hard work, and I thank  all the teachers across southern York and Lancaster Counties who do  great work educating our students every day.                            ____________________
