Sec. 3. (a) At any time through the legislative day of       Thursday, December 8, 2022, the Speaker may entertain motions       offered by the Majority Leader or a designee that the House       suspend the rules as though under clause 1 of rule XV with       respect to multiple measures described in subsection (b), and       the Chair shall put the question on any such motion without       debate or intervening motion.        (b) A measure referred to in subsection (a) includes any       measure that was the object of a motion to suspend the rules       on the legislative day of December 5, 2022, December 6, 2022,       December 7, 2022, or December 8, 2022, in the form as so       offered, on which the yeas and nays were ordered and further       proceedings postponed pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX.

Sec. 4.  Notwithstanding clause 8 of rule XX, further       proceedings on a vote by the yeas and nays on the question of       adoption of a motion that the House suspend the rules offered       on the legislative day of December 5, 2022 may be postponed       through the legislative day of December 8, 2022.        Sec. 5.  The requirement of clause 6(a) of rule XIII for a       two-thirds vote to consider a report from the Committee on       Rules on the same day it is presented to the House is waived       with respect to any resolution reported through the remainder       of the One Hundred Seventeenth Congress.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs.  Fischbach), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Rules Committee met and reported a rule,  House Resolution 1508, providing for consideration of two measures:  H.R. 3648 and H.R. 7946.   The rule provides for consideration of both H.R. 3648 and H.R. 7946  under structured rules with 1 hour of debate each equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  the Judiciary, self-executes a manager's amendment from Chairman Nadler  for H.R. 3648, makes in order one amendment for each bill, and provides  one motion to recommit for each measure.   The rule provides the majority leader or his designee the ability  this week to en bloc requested roll call votes on suspensions. The rule  also provides that roll call votes on suspension bills considered on  December 5 may be postponed through December 8. Lastly, the rule  provides same-day authority for any rule reported through the remainder  of the 117th Congress.   Mr. Speaker, today we will consider two bills to reform our  immigration system. Our current laws that govern employment-based and  family-sponsored immigration visas desperately need updates. Estimates  suggest that more than 880,000 people are in the green card backlog  because of how broken our system is.   H.R. 3648, the Equal Access to Green Cards for Legal Employment, or  EAGLE, Act of 2022 begins to address the extensive green card backlog.   The legislation eliminates per-country caps on employment-based visas  and raises per-country caps for family-based visas to 15 percent.   The other bill up for consideration today is H.R. 7946, the Veteran  Service Recognition Act. It improves naturalization for noncitizens who  served in our country's military. It seems straightforward to me. If  you have risked your life to protect and defend this country, you and  your family deserve every opportunity to become U.S. citizens, if  desired.   Now, while these two bills offer important reforms to our immigration  system, I still personally believe there are also other urgent  immigration issues that need to be addressed before the 117th Congress  adjourns.   We need residency for Dreamers, these young people who have known no  other home but the United States.   We must provide secure, stable immigration for agricultural workers  who ensure food reaches our tables.   We should recapture existing visas that have gone unused so we can  really make a sizable dent in reducing immigration backlogs.   And we need to regularize the status of long-term TPS holders who  have been here for decades and are important members of our local  communities.   Republicans always talk about issues within our immigration system,  but so far none have come to the table with any meaningful, realistic,  or productive solutions that would help fix it. They can't get to  ``yes'' on anything. They demonize immigrants. They scapegoat  immigrants, and rather than fix the challenges of our system, they use  immigration as a wedge issue.   Democrats, on the other hand, want comprehensive immigration reform.  We are ready, willing, and able to work with anyone who seriously wants  to get something done. It is time for our colleagues across the aisle  to join us in this effort.   These bills today are just the start, and my hope is that we are able  to make more progress on this front before the end of the year.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this rule, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  0915     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me just say that here is the problem: We just heard from my  colleague from Minnesota that Republicans are more interested in  gimmicky amendments and sound bites as a way to try to get people to do  nothing. I mean, they are the party of ``no'' when it comes to  immigration.   My colleague says somehow that the Democrats are blocking attempts to  ban people associated with communist or totalitarian parties, that  somehow we want to admit them into this country. Well, here is the  reality, and this is the fact, and people can check this: Current law  says individuals associated with a communist or totalitarian party are  already inadmissible under section 212(a)(3)(d) of the Immigration and  Nationality Act. That is the current law.   At some point maybe my friends on the other side will want to help  fix the immigration system, rather than just demagogue the issue over  and over and over again.   This is an issue, by the way, that is important to our economic well- being. Our business community wants these bills passed in part because  they are having a tough time trying to fill current jobs.   So we can demagogue the issue, and if that is what you want to do,  fine; or you can actually legislate and get something done.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, on traffickers and gun smugglers,  and you name it, those things are already illegal, but whatever. It is  not worth getting into it.   Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers on my side, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Let me remind all my colleagues that the Veteran Service Recognition  Act is actually supported by the American Legion, one of our leading  veterans' organizations in this country, but I guess that is not enough  for some of my Republican colleagues again saying ``no'' to everything.   Mr. Speaker, the EAGLE Act and the Veteran Service Recognition Act  provide necessary reforms that will improve our immigration system. I  know so much more can be done--as I said before, we need to do more-- but these two bills are small steps that we can take now to help clear  backlogs and ensure that those who not only have played by the rules,  but have sacrificed in the service of our Nation can become citizens.  They are important policies that should become law.   I read today that some of my friends on the other side of the aisle  are urging their next leader--I don't know who it will be--to use the  debt ceiling not only to cut Social Security and Medicare and a whole  bunch of other programs that are vital, including nutrition programs,  but they want to use it as leverage to go after immigrants to mess up  our immigration system even more. What a rotten way to legislate, to  use the debt ceiling as an excuse to try to derail government.   We already know what the Republicans are capable of doing. The last  time they were in charge of the House and the Senate and the White  House, they shut the government down and they left. That is their idea  of responsible governing.   Well, we shouldn't be using the debt ceiling as leverage. We should  actually be paying our bills that we have accumulated. If you don't  like the spending--I didn't like Donald Trump's tax cut that benefited  mostly wealthy people in this country; I nonetheless voted to increase  the debt ceiling because we had accumulated all of that debt because of  that terrible tax cut geared to the rich. It is the responsible thing  to do. It really is kind of disturbing to hear some of the priorities  of my Republican friends.   As I said before, their policy on immigration has been consistent.  Demagogue, demagogue, demagogue. Fix nothing. They blame immigrants for  everything. It is raining out today; they will blame immigrants. Having  a fight with their spouse; well, it must be the fault of immigrants.  Having a bad day; let's blame immigrants. That is their MO. That is  what they have done,  [[Page H8762]]  and it really is offensive. It betrays the highest values of this  country.   The two bills before us are modest. There is much more we need to do.  As I said, we need to help the Dreamers. We need to fix the issue for  our TPS holders. We owe that to them.   Mr. Speaker, let me close by saying that we are going to spend the  next few weeks legislating and delivering for the American people, and  I urge some of my colleagues to join with us in getting things done, or  they can simply do what they usually do and complain and complain and  demagogue and demagogue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and on the previous  question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.   The previous question was ordered.
