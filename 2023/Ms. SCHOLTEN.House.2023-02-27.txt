 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on the House floor to bring  attention to the horrific conditions of migrant child labor happening  right here in the United States of America and to urge my colleagues to  stand with me and bring solutions to this appalling state of affairs. I  represent west Michigan where many of these migrant children reside.   As an attorney who has spent my entire career fighting to make our  immigration laws more just, more fair, more humane, and as a mother, I  will not stand by as this tragedy continues. These are my constituents,  these are my kids, and I will protect them with everything I have.   This weekend, The New York Times published a stunning expose shining  a light on the scores of migrant children currently working on our  farms, our factories, and at some of the most dangerous sites in our  country. These children, some as young as 12, are working marathon  shifts, often with dangerous machinery to package our foods, sew our  clothes, and build our homes. The industries that employ them turn a  blind eye to these children's suffering, and often seek out and  willingly participate in this despicable practice.   In case I did not make myself clear, Mr. Speaker, these are children.   Stories of kids dropping out of school, collapsing from exhaustion,  and even losing limbs to machinery are the things that one might expect  to find in a Charles Dickens or Upton Sinclair novel, but not an  account of everyday life in America in 2023; surely not here, in the  land of the free, where child labor protections have been on the books  for nearly a century; not in the country that holds itself up as the  paragon of democracy, guaranteeing life, liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness for all.   And yet right here, Mr. Speaker, we are exploiting minors from other  countries, children in an already vulnerable situation, to do dangerous  work for low pay that often results in life-changing injuries. Those  allowing these practices to continue should be ashamed of themselves.   The company at the center of this article, Hearthside Foods, which  packages the breakfast cereals and snacks many of us have in our  cupboards right now, proudly proclaims that 25 percent of their  employees have been with the company for over a decade. I wonder if  they have similar statistics they could share with us about how many of  their employees were even alive a decade ago.   Many of us in this room are parents. I have two young children of my  own, the same age as some of these kids in these stories. My heart  aches for these children. As a mother myself, rest assured, I am  approaching this problem with the urgency and ferocity that it  deserves. I wouldn't walk away from my own children in these factories,  and I sure as hell am not going to walk away from someone else's  children.   As soon as I read this story, I immediately picked up the phone and  started demanding answers and action. I called the White House, HHS,  and DOL. This is a multilevel, multisystem failure that created the  shadows where these children can be exploited, and we need a  multilevel, multisystem approach to fix it.   I have called on the administration to create an interagency task  force to ensure--ensure that this kind of child exploitation cannot  happen in the United States. We, as a Congress, must also act. That  means, first and foremost, holding the companies accountable with every  tool at our disposable. It also means conducting oversight of the  agencies responsible for enforcing these laws and ensuring they have  the resources to protect the kids. What could possibly be a higher  priority?   At the heart of this matter, though, is that we need long-term  solutions. We need comprehensive immigration reform that addresses the  root cause of this problem. I know most of my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle would agree that reform is long overdue.   We need reform that addresses the border security, provides  sufficient pathways for individuals to come to the United States of  America, and addresses the root cause of migration.  [[Page H880]]    A safe and effective immigration system is essential for the United  States to lead in a 21st century economy. It is a critical national  security component, essential for protecting human rights, and  fundamental to our identity as a land of prosperity and opportunity.   I have worked on all aspects of immigration from enforcement to  advocacy and across party lines. I believe we can have an immigration  system that keeps our country safe and honors human dignity because I  have done it. I have worked on it, and I know I have colleagues in both  parties who agree with me. I have already spoken with many of you who  have expressed the same ideas.   I know that my colleagues across the aisle care as deeply about  children as I do. I know that as they have stood with righteous  indignation to fight for the sanctity of life, I believe now they also  have the courage and moral fortitude to stand and protect children from  life-threatening harm and exploitive work.   Let's come together and get this done.                            ____________________
