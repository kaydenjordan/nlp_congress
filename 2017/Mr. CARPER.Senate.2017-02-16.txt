 Mr. President and colleagues, if I could have your  attention, please. Five minutes please. Two years ago, the Center for  Media and Democracy filed a petition under Oklahoma FOIA law called the  Oklahoma Open Records Act. For 2 years, the appeal of that petition was  blocked. Earlier this year, a lawsuit was brought to require the  release of thousands of emails from the AG's office in Oklahoma with  the fossil fuel industry, oil companies, coal companies, and the like.  Six hours from right now, an expedited hearing will take place in the  district court of Oklahoma.   Earlier this week, nine members of the Environment and Public Works  Committee wrote and asked the judge who is going to preside over that  hearing today to move forward expeditiously, and she is. We also wrote  and asked the majority leader to delay the vote on cloture for Scott  Pruitt until a week from Monday. He has declined.   Thomas Jefferson used to say: If the people know the truth, they will  not make a mistake. Colleagues, we need to know the truth. Speaking of  the truth, there is an old saying that says: People may not believe  what we say. They will believe what we do.   As a candidate, as nominee, and President-elect, Donald Trump has  made clear his job, his goal is to degrade and to destroy the  Environmental Protection Agency. Like a lot of things he says, we  asked: Did he mean it? With the nomination of Scott Pruitt to lead the  EPA, it is clear he did.   In Mr. Pruitt, Trump has found someone who, as AG of the State of  Oklahoma, shut down your environmental protection unit in that office.  He went on to raise millions of dollars for fossil fuel industries and  other sources used to sue the Environmental Protection Agency because  of their efforts to reduce methane emissions, their efforts to stop  cross-border pollution, their efforts to cut methane emissions, their  efforts to fight smog, haze, and ozone. Under Attorney General Pruitt's  stewardship in Oklahoma, child asthma is well above the national  average. Fish advisories in lakes in Oklahoma have more than doubled.  All 16 counties in Oklahoma that are evaluated by the American Lung  Association for clean air received an F last year--every one of them.  Earthquakes have risen over the last dozen years in Oklahoma, from one  or two per year to one or two per day. That is only the earthquakes  that exceed 3.0 on the Richter scale.   When we asked Scott Pruitt today to name one battle he had led to  reduce pollution in his State, he cited the issue involving the  Illinois River, which we later learned was actually much more the work  of his predecessor than it was his. When I asked him to name one  environmental rule and regulation that he supported, he declined to do  so. We are coming off of yet another hottest year on record. They are  experiencing monsoon-like rains in California this month after years of  drought. Temperatures in Alaska are so warm, we are not sure some years  that they are going to actually have the Iditarod dog race, sea levels  are rising from New England to Miami, there is a huge crack in the ice  in Antarctica, and Scott Pruitt raises questions about the validity of  the science around climate change. In last year's election, a lot of  people said: We want to take our country back. To what? The Cuyahoga  River which caught on fire; the L.A. smog that was so bad, when I ran  it hurt my lungs.   Some say: Is it possible to have clean air and clean water with a  strong environment? That is nonsense. We can have both. Since Richard  Nixon signed into law creating the EPA, guess what. GDP in this country  has grown by 200 percent or more. Since losing 5 million jobs in the  great recession, we added 16 million jobs, the unemployment rate is  down by half.   We still have work to do, my friends. There are communities in the  United States where water is unsafe to drink. There are millions of  kids and grandkids who have asthma. We have fish advisories that abound  from sea to shining sea. The sea level is rising up and down the east  coast. State Route 1 in my State, our major highway, was shut down  again last week, not because of a huge storm but just because of sea  level rise.   Let me close by saying that when our grandchildren ask us years from  now what we did about it, I want to tell them we did the right thing.  We did not back down. We stood our ground. We voted to face this  challenge to our people and to the planet, and to overcome those  challenges.  [[Page S1230]]    Please, join us in voting no on the motion to invoke cloture.   Thank you.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.   Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending  cloture motion, which the clerk will state.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:                               Cloture Motion         We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the       provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate,       do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the nomination       of Scott Pruitt, of Oklahoma, to be Administrator of the       Environmental Protection Agency.

On this vote, the yeas are 54, the nays are  46.   The motion is agreed to.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I just want to follow up on the comments  of my friend, the chairman from Wyoming, and I note that Scott Pruitt  has responded to more questions than anyone in EPA history since Gina  McCarthy, the past Administrator who responded to more than 1,400  questions, and she actually responded to them completely, not evasively  and not indirectly. She needed more time, given the volume of  questions, and more time was granted so she might more fully answer the  questions that were raised. I just wanted to add that if I could.   Mr. President, I come to the floor to share with you and with our  colleagues the reasons I oppose the nomination of Attorney General  Scott Pruitt to be the EPA Administrator. Over the last month, we have  had a number of President Trump's nominees come before the committee  and be debated on the Senate floor, as you know.   We have had multiple confirmation hearings in a single day, with  Members  [[Page S1234]]  running to and from hearings trying to learn more about nominees and  get important questions answered. So I understand if some of my  colleagues who have attended back-to-back hearings have not yet delved  into Scott Pruitt's record as deeply as we have on the Environment and  Public Works Committee, and that is why we are here today.   As ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I,  along with my colleagues on the committee, have scoured Mr. Pruitt's  record to the best of our ability with the somewhat limited information  the nominee has provided.   We sat through his nomination hearing, where we asked him fundamental  questions about his views on the role of the EPA and what he would do  to protect our environment and public health. We submitted additional  questions we had for the record and read through all of Mr. Pruitt's  responses. We have done our due diligence with the information we  received, and I want to share with my colleagues and all of those  watching exactly why, based on this review, I cannot support Mr.  Pruitt's nomination.   First, I think it is important to revisit just why the EPA is still  so critical. This Agency was created 46 years ago by a Republican  President named Richard Nixon with the support of a bipartisan  Congress. Their task was implementing our Nation's most important clean  air, clean water, and safe chemical laws. The EPA is required to use  sound science to protect both our environment and our public health,  and, by and large, the EPA has done it successfully--not perfectly but  successfully for decades while our economy has continued to grow. Many  people may not remember a time before the EPA, a time when States had  to work individually to protect citizens in the communities in which  they lived, a time before the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act were  signed into law, a time when businesses operating throughout the United  States were faced with a myriad of conflicting State and local laws  affecting our health and environment. The choking smog and soot of a  half century ago seems unfathomable now. Rivers on fire and deadly  toxic plumes sound like something almost for another world, impossible  in our United States of America.   Today we have the luxury of largely forgetting these frightening  circumstances, thanks to the efforts of the EPA and its employees, in  partnership with State and local governments and with countries and  companies and businesses across America. The EPA and its many partners  throughout the country have been so successful that it is easy for some  of us to forget why this Agency is so critical. Some may presume there  is not much more for this Agency to do. That could not be further from  the truth.   The environmental threats we face today are real. They don't respect  State boundaries. Over time, my State of Delaware has made great  strides in cleaning up our own air pollution, but our work only goes so  far.   In Delaware, like many States on the east coast, we sit at the end of  what is known as America's tailpipe. Ninety percent of the pollution in  Delaware comes from outside the First State, from plants hundreds of  miles away in places like Kentucky, Ohio, my native West Virginia,  Indiana, and throughout the Midwest.   As Governor of Delaware, even if I had eliminated every source of air  pollution within our State by stopping every combustion source and  ordering every motor vehicle off our roads, Delawareans would still  face deadly doses of air pollution. Should Delawareans be forced to  live with consequences of decisions made by polluters hundreds or even  thousands of miles away from us? I don't think so. I don't think so.  That is not the Golden Rule I know.   Fortunately, the EPA has recently implemented something called the  good neighbor rule to make sure all States do their fair share to clean  up our air. Every citizen in this country has a right to breathe clean  air, regardless of where they live, whether they live in a downwind or  an upwind State. That is why we have the EPA.   We have known for decades that most of the mercury in our fish comes  from air pollution that is emitted from the dirtiest coal plants and  then settles in our waterways. We know mercury is a powerful neurotoxin  that accumulates in our body over time, threatening the health of this  generation and generations to come. The EPA recently issued public  health protections to clean up the toxic air pollution from our  dirtiest coal plants, allowing families in Danville, where I grew up  alongside the Dan River, and thousands of other communities that can  once again eat fish from our rivers, lakes, and streams without concern  of mercury poisoning. That is why we have the EPA.   Too often, when States and local communities are pinched for cash,  they try to save money by shortchanging clean air and water  protections. Improvements to infrastructure are often ignored, corners  are cut, and solutions are adopted that may save dollars now but  inflict costly unnecessary damage later.   As we have seen most recently in the city of Flint, MI, these cuts  can have a terrible and even tragic impact on the health of the most  vulnerable in our society, especially on the youngest among us. Today,  the citizens of Flint still lack clean drinking water, and a new  generation in that city which has been exposed to high levels of lead  faces an uncertain future. That is why we have the EPA.   Many people don't know it, but Delaware is the lowest lying State in  our Nation. The highest point in the State of Delaware is a bridge.  Back home, the reality that our climate is changing is not up for  debate. Families and business owners face the stark realities of  climate change almost every single day. Tackling that challenge is not  just the right thing to do or what is best for Delaware's economy, it  is a matter of survival. Our little State alone cannot stem the flow of  greenhouse gases into our atmosphere that is largely causing our  climate to change, our seas to rise, and our coastlines to retreat.  Every State--every State--must do its fair share to safeguard our  climate and their neighbors. That is why we have the EPA.   Examples of the air and water pollution produced by one State and  fouling the air and water of others can still be found in too many  parts of America, like the runoff from Pennsylvania that degrades the  waters of the Chesapeake Bay or the haze exported from other States  that oftentimes shrouds the Smoky Mountains and degrades visibility at  the Grand Canyon. That is why we have the EPA.   Throughout my years in the Senate and as a member of the Environment  and Public Works Committee, I have had the opportunity to consider the  credentials of five different nominees to serve as EPA Administrator-- individuals put forth by both Democratic and Republican Presidents. I  have supported candidates in the past because they were able to clearly  demonstrate their commitment--candidates like former New Jersey  Republican Governor Christine Whitman and former Utah Governor Mike  Leavitt. I was proud to support them both, proud of their service, and  proud of their role as head of EPA. But I have supported candidates  like them because they clearly demonstrated their commitment to  advancing the mission of the EPA--the mission to protect human health  and to protect our environment. Never have I been forced to consider a  candidate to lead the EPA who has been so focused throughout his career  on crippling the Agency he now seeks to lead or so hostile to the basic  protections to keep Americans and our environment safe.   So, with that, I am going to close, and I will come back many times  in the hours to come as we continue the consideration of this  candidate's nomination.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kennedy). The Senator from West Virginia.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I would like to follow up on something our  friend from Mississippi was just saying. I want to make it clear that I  am not really interested in obstructing. I am not interested at all in  obstructing. What I am interested in is getting to the truth about this  nominee and others.   Two years ago, an organization called the Center for Media and  Democracy petitioned, under the Oklahoma open records law--it is a  FOIA-like law at the State level--they asked for access to thousands of  emails that were sent from or to the attorney general's office under  Scott Pruitt. That was 2 years ago. They have repeatedly renewed that  request over time, and it has not been granted.   Why might emails be germane? Well, they are germane because many of  the emails were with industries that have differences with the EPA and  in some cases are involved in lawsuits, a number of which were  sponsored by or joined in by Attorney General Pruitt.   Two years after the request to see those emails was submitted to the  attorney general's office, they had not seen one of them. A lawsuit was  filed earlier this month asking the court--I think it is called the  district court of Oklahoma, a State court--asking to see the emails and  asking that the court intervene so that the Center for Media and  Democracy would have access to the emails.   The Democrats on the Environment and Public Works Committee wrote to  the judge, and we shared our voice because we have been making the same  request of the attorney general's office--of the attorney general--as  part of the nominations process. He has declined to provide the emails  to the Congress, the Senate, and we have let the judge know that we  appreciate her attention to this matter and hope she might even  expedite it. Well, an expedited hearing is called for this afternoon on  the sharing of these emails that have been blocked, stonewalled, for 2  years.   What we did as Democrats on the Environment and Public Works  Committee is I met with the majority leader, and nine of us wrote to  the majority leader, and we said: With all due respect, we suggest to  give the judge time to make a decision, and if the judge says the  emails should be opened up, allow us to have until a week from this  coming Monday to look at the emails to see if there is anything  inappropriate or untoward that could be revealed.   That request to the majority leader--he was very nice about it, but  he basically said: We are not going to do that.   I renewed the request here yesterday on the floor, and he said: No,  we are not going to do that.   I am generally one who thinks it is very important for us to  communicate, collaborate, cooperate around here, as I think most of my  colleagues would attest, but in this case, I don't think we made an  unreasonable request of the nominee. And I think to block access to  these emails--even when petitioned under the Oklahoma FOIA law, backed  up by our support--for nothing to happen is just wrong. That is just  wrong.   So hopefully when the judge has this hearing later this afternoon-- actually, in 2 hours--we will find out a bit more as to whether the  AG's office is going to be asked to turn these emails over and make  them public with that information. I hope the answer will be yes. We  will see.   I asked Mr. Pruitt 52 questions on December 28 and asked they be  responded to by January 9. January 9 came and went, and we were told  maybe we would get the responses at the hearing we were going to have  on January 18. We had the hearing on January 18, and some of the  specific questions were answered, some not, but we submitted as a  committee some 1,000 additional questions for the record. That is a lot  of questions. I suggested to the committee chairman he give the nominee  a reasonable amount of time to respond to those questions. The  chairman, in the interest of moving things along, I think, gave the  nominee 2 days, which is, in my view, not nearly enough.   If we go back several years ago, the last EPA Administrator was a  woman named Gina McCarthy. She was asked a number of questions. She was  actually asked more questions, I think 1,400 questions, which is  several hundred more than Scott Pruitt but a lot of questions. She did  not have enough time to answer the questions, and a little extra time,  maybe a week or so, was granted. She answered the questions, as I  understand, fully, completely, and directly. I will read some of the  questions we asked of Scott Pruitt later today, later tonight, with  examples of the kind of answers he provided. Some were reasonably  complete, but too many were evasive, indirect, or just nonresponsive.  Maybe that is because the chairman only gave him a couple days to  respond. That is not the way we ought to be about the business.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue. The Senator from New Hampshire.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that of the  postcloture debate time under my control, that 50 minutes be yielded to  Senator Merkley.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The Senator from Hawaii.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Madam President, good morning to our pages and members of  our staff, some of whom have been up all night.   I just walked over here from my office in the Hart Building and,  along the way, I ran into the Capitol Police and others who are putting  in a long day and a long night. I, on behalf of all of us, want to  express my thanks to them.   I have said this on several occasions--that I take no joy in going  through a chapter like we are going through tonight.   I come from a State on the east coast where we get along pretty well.  Democrats and Republicans sort of like each other. They tend to be  mainstream, both on the Democratic side and on the Republican side. We  have something called the Delaware way, and it is sort of based on the  three C's--communicate, compromise, and collaborate. This is what we  do. We have done it for a long time, and it seems to work for us.  Hopefully, when we get through this chapter--when we get through the  nomination process--we will be able to get back to the three C's.   I have the privilege, as the Presiding Officer knows, that when I got  out of the Navy I moved to Delaware, and I had an opportunity to serve  in a couple of different roles--as the treasurer, as a Congressman, and  then as the Governor for 8 years. In my time as Governor, according to  laws and the constitution of Delaware, the Governor nominates people to  serve as cabinet members, as members of the judiciary, and on a lot of  boards and commissions.   During those 8 years that I was privileged to serve as Governor, the  legislature was split--the House was Republican, and the Senate was  Democrat. When it came time to nominate members of my cabinet, my  predecessor was Governor Mike Castle, as the Senator from Rhode Island  knows. He was a moderate Republican, and he had been our Governor, and  before that our Lieutenant Governor. He was a State legislator and a  very successful attorney. When I was elected Governor, he was elected  Congressman. So we literally traded places. He took my job in Congress,  in the House, and I took his job as Governor.   It was really a wonderful transition, where I tried to help him make  that transition to be successful in the House of Representatives, and  he tried very much to help me be successful as a new Governor.   I, actually, went to something called the New Governor's School,  hosted by Roy Romer, who was then the chairman of the National  Governors Association--a wonderful guy. We were in the New Governor's  School out in Colorado, the newly elected Governors of 1992--Democrats  and Republicans, including people like George W. Bush, Tom Ridge, and  the list goes on. If I had had more sleep, I could remember every one  of them. It was just wonderful. Mike Levin, who later became the head  of the EPA, was one of them.   We learned a lot at the New Governor's School about how to set up and  establish an administration, how to put together an administration.  Mike Castle, Delaware's Governor, was part of the faculty, if you will,  of current Governors who mentored us in the New Governor's School, and  it was a blessing in my life.   I asked Governor Castle, as we were going through that transition, to  sort of walk me through his own cabinet and to suggest who might want  to stay, who might be interested in staying on in a new  administration--in my administration--and who, maybe, who would not. It  ended up, when I nominated people to serve in my cabinet, that there  were several there who had actually served in his. We had mostly  Democrats. I am a Democrat. But there were some Republicans as well.  Below the cabinet level, we had division directors, and we kept almost  all--not all but almost all of the division directors we asked to stay,  too.   For 8 years as Governor of Delaware, I would nominate people to serve  in either cabinet positions or on the judiciary or at other posts; but,  for 8 years, we batted 1,000. The State executive committee was  terrific in approving people, confirming people to serve in these  roles. It was not like I just rushed things--here is who we are  nominating. Go pass them.   That is not the way they worked. I asked them for their ideas. We  solicited their ideas, not just for the cabinet but, also, for the  judiciary.   At the end of the day, it was my role to actually nominate people,  and it was their role to provide advice and consent, and they did--a  little bit before but, certainly, throughout the nominating process. It  worked pretty well. It worked pretty well for our State, and I am proud  of the 8 years that our administration worked with the legislature and  with nonprofit communities, the faith community, and the business  community with what we accomplished.   I was trained as a leader from the age of 12, and our Presiding  Officer was trained as a leader, probably, from about the same age. We  both served in the military. She is a retired lieutenant colonel, and I  am a retired Navy captain. But I was trained that leaders  [[Page S1343]]  are humble, not haughty. I was trained that leaders should have the  hearts of servants, as our job is to serve and not be served. I was  trained that we basically call on people not to do what we say but to  do what we do. I believe in leadership by example. I was taught that  leaders don't hold their fingers up to the wind and see which way the  wind is going, but that we should have the courage to stay out of step  when everyone else is marching to the wrong tune. I was trained that  leaders do not lead by dividing folks but by uniting people--by  building bridges, not walls. I was trained that leaders should be  purveyors of hope--that we should appeal to people's better angels. I  was trained that leaders ought to focus on doing what is right, not  what is easy or expedient, that we should embrace the Golden Rule-- really, embody the Golden Rule--by treating people the way we want to  be treated, that we should focus on excellence in everything we do and  surround ourselves with the best people we can find. When the team that  we lead does well, they get the credit, and when the team that we lead  does not do so well, the leader takes the blame. I was trained as a  leader with the idea that, when you know you are right, be sure you are  right. You just never give up. You never give up.   Those are the leadership skills that were infused into me by my  family and my faith. I was in the military for 23 years, plus 4 years  as a midshipman, and it helped make me who I am. Those are, really, the  leadership blocks that I bring to my job here.   We have had some great leaders in this body. We could use a  leadership like I have just described at the top of the food chain in  this country, in this administration. We could use that. I, thus far,  after about one month into this administration, I haven't seen that  kind of leadership that I had hoped for, that we had seen not that long  ago.   I want to commend everyone who has come to the floor in the last  almost 20 hours on our side--the Democratic side--and on the Republican  side to explain our points of view with respect to the nomination of  Scott Pruitt to be Administrator for the EPA in this country.   When Donald Trump was running for President, he said pretty  consistently that part of what he wanted to do as President was to  degrade and, essentially, destroy the Environmental Protection Agency.  He didn't just say it once or twice but again and again. When he won  the nomination, he said the same thing--that, if elected President,  part of his goal would be to degrade and, essentially, destroy the  Environmental Protection Agency. When he was elected President--a  couple of days after being elected--he repeated that pledge.   Sometimes people may not believe what we say, but they will believe  what we do. For me, the first clear indication that what he said with  respect to the Environmental Protection Agency was something that he  intended to do was the selection of a person to lead the Environmental  Protection Agency, and he chose the attorney general of Oklahoma Scott  Pruitt.   Scott was introduced at his confirmation hearing before the  Environment and Public Works Committee by the two Senators from  Oklahoma--James Lankford, with whom I serve on the Homeland Security  and Governmental Affairs Committee--he is a great member--and Jim  Inhofe, who is our senior Republican on the Environment and Public  Works Committee.   They have very high regard for Scott Pruitt. They have spoken here on  the floor with regard to him and to his service. When someone whose  service and friendship I value as much as I do--James Lankford and Jim  Inhofe--speak so highly of a friend and a colleague from their State,  it is not easy for me, and it is not easy for the rest of us to oppose  that nominee--their friend. But we have done that. We have done that  for weeks now, and we have done that now throughout this night.   I take no joy in doing this. Having said that, I take no joy in the  fact that the levels of the seas around my little State of Delaware are  rising, and we are the lowest lying State in America, and we see every  day the vestiges of sea level rise.   I take no joy when I catch the train in the morning to come down  here--I go back and forth every day--I take no joy in standing on the  platform at the Wilmington train station and in looking at a beautiful  riverfront, which we have worked on for 20 years so as to transform an  industrial wasteland into something that is lovely, beautiful, and  clean. Even now, with the fish that swim in the Christina River, we  cannot eat them. In fact, from most of the bodies of water in my State,  we cannot eat the fish, and that is because of the mercury that is  contained in them. It is not just in my State, and it is not just in  our neighbors' States--Maryland and New Jersey. It is in the States all  up and down the east coast.   We live in what is called the end of America's tailpipe. A lot of  emissions that are put up into the air come from coal-fired plants to  our west--from Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia, which is my  native State, and other States. They have, in many cases, really tall  smokestacks, and they put their pollution--their air emissions--up  through the smokestacks. They go up hundreds and hundreds of feet into  the air. The air carries them out of their States. It carries the  pollution out of their States, and where does it settle? It settles in  ours. In States from Virginia on up into Maine. We live at the end of  America's tailpipe.   I take no joy that, of the freshwater fish in our State and a lot of  other places on the east coast and, frankly, in other places around the  country, you cannot eat those fish anymore.   I want to take a few minutes and pivot from that as background to  what we are going to look at--some charts--in a minute. Before we do, I  want to talk about why we can't eat the fish in too many places around  this country. And the reason why is because we get, I would say about  40 percent of our electricity from coal. Today it is maybe down to  around 30, maybe 25 to 30 percent, and maybe 25 to 30 percent from  natural gas. We get maybe 20 percent from nuclear, and the rest is from  the renewable forms of energy, including wind and solar technology as  it has gotten better and better and better.    One of the reasons my colleagues, particularly on this side, have  great concerns about the nomination of Scott Pruitt has to do with  mercury. As I have shared with the Senate, a review of Mr. Pruitt's  record yields some troubling information about how he managed the unit  within his own office in Oklahoma charged with responding to  environmental matters. Upon taking office, Mr. Pruitt essentially  gutted his own Environmental Protection Unit within the attorney  general's office. It appears he abandoned his responsibilities to use  his office to protect the public health of Oklahomans and declined to  use his authority to hold polluters and bad actors accountable.   A review of Mr. Pruitt's record yields nothing that shows how he will  change this behavior if he is confirmed to be EPA Administrator. In  fact, the New York Times reported earlier this month, on February 5,  that Mr. Pruitt is drawing up plans to move forward on the President's  campaign promise to ``get rid of'' the EPA.   Just remember, the EPA does not just involve clean air and clean  water and the cleanup of hazardous waste sites. The implementation of  the Toxic Substances Control Act deals with hazardous materials and the  products we use every day. The Environmental Protection Agency is a  huge player in the public health of our country for not just adults  like us but for young people like these pages, like my children, our  grandchildren--all of us--our parents, grandparents. The EPA is in  large part responsible for our being a healthier nation.   I am a big believer in going after root causes for illness and  sickness, and if you have mercury in your fish, if you have bad stuff  in your air, it degrades your health, and that is a big problem. It is  a big problem for us in Delaware because we spend a whole lot of money.  Ninety percent of the air pollution in my State doesn't come from  Delaware. It isn't generated in Delaware. It is bad stuff. It is air  emissions that come from other States. They are able to burn coal, get  cheap electricity, and because they put stuff in the air in tall  smokestacks, they send it over to us. They end up with cheap  electricity, lower healthcare costs, and we end up with having to clean  up our emissions dramatically, more so than we otherwise would. It is  expensive. So we end  [[Page S1344]]  up with expensive electricity and also healthcare costs that are higher  than the places where the pollution is coming from. That is just not  right.   I said earlier that I get no joy from going through this nomination  battle for Mr. Pruitt with my friends on the other side, but believe me  I get no joy from the idea that we end up with expensive electricity in  my State and higher health costs because other people in other parts of  our country don't embrace the Golden Rule, to treat other people the  way you want to be treated.   Going back to the New York Times article on February 5 that indicated  that Mr. Pruitt is drawing up plans to move forward on the President's  campaign promise to get rid of the EPA, they had these landing teams in  the course of the transition to go through each of the agencies. The  person who apparently was leading the administration's landing team  into the EPA called for reducing the head count at EPA. They didn't say  we are going to have a hiring freeze at the EPA. They didn't say we are  going to have a 1- or 2- or 3-percent reduction. They didn't say we  were going to reduce it by 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 percent. They said we are  going to reduce the head count at the Environmental Protection Agency  by two-thirds.   I guess it is possible that whoever this person is that heads up the  landing team of the EPA, maybe they don't have pollution in their  State. Maybe the air is pristine, and they can get all the fish they  want from all the other rivers, lakes, and streams. They don't have to  worry about toxic waste sites or any of that stuff. I doubt it.   I think part of our job is to make sure the EPA can do their job  better, but the kind of draconian changes President Trump has talked  about--and when you look at the record of the fellow they nominated to  lead the EPA, you get the feeling that maybe they are not just talking.   There is an old saying that sometimes people may not believe what we  say, they believe what we do so let's just take a look to see what Mr.  Pruitt has done in his own State of Oklahoma. I would say there are two  sides to every story, and we are hearing two sides to every story. What  I am going to do here is just draw on his own words.   The New York Times story goes on to say that Mr. Pruitt ``has a  blueprint to repeal climate change rules, cut staffing levels, close  regional offices and permanently weaken the agency's regulatory  authority.''   It continues:         As much as anyone, Mr. Pruitt knows the legal intricacies       of environmental regulation--and deregulation. As Oklahoma's       attorney general over the last six years, he has led or taken       part in 14 lawsuits against the EPA.        His changes may not have the dramatic flair favored by Mr.       Trump, but they could weaken the agency's authority even long       after Mr. Trump has left office.    And how will he achieve this objective of weakening the Agency's  authority? First, by diminishing the scientific basis by which the  Agency makes decisions.   Mr. Pruitt does not seem to value or understand the science that is  at the core of this Agency's actions to protect public health or the  important role EPA plays ensuring all States are doing their fair share  so every American can breathe clean air and drink clean water.   One area where his propensity to disregard science is especially  evident is Mr. Pruitt's extreme views on mercury and other air toxic  pollution from electric powerplants.   Much of our country's ongoing efforts to clean up air pollution  hinges on every State playing by the rules and doing their fair share  to reduce air pollution because the pollution generated in one State  does not just stay in that State. The air carries it across State  borders. Streams and rivers carry it across State borders as well.   As I said earlier, in my home State of Delaware, we have made real  strides in cleaning up our own air pollution that we generate.  Unfortunately, the other States to the west of us have not made the  same kind of commitment.   As I said a few minutes ago, over 90 percent of Delaware's air  pollution comes from our neighboring States. The air pollution is not  only a danger to our hearts and lungs and brains, it also costs a lot  in doctor bills and hospital bills and in our quality of life.   Not all, but some of this pollution is toxic. It comes across our  borders. These toxins that are in the air get in the food we eat as  well as the air we breathe and build up in our bodies without our  knowledge. Those buildups can lead to cancer, mental impairment and, in  some cases, even to death.   Delawareans depend on the EPA to ensure that our neighbors do their  fair share so we can protect our citizens. It hasn't always moved as  quickly as we would have liked, but without the EPA, our State of  Delaware wouldn't have many other options at our disposal.   Mr. Pruitt, however, seems to have spent a good part of his career  fighting to dismantle the Federal Environmental Protection Agency. In  my State, our neighboring States, those of us who live especially at  the end of America's tailpipe depend on it for cleaner air and cleaner  water.   I have a poster here. Here is a fish, not one we would want to eat.  The poster says: ``Why isn't Scott Pruitt convinced?'' The scientists  and doctors tell us that mercury is a harmful toxin.   Mr. Pruitt has been a part of multiple lawsuits against the Federal  environmental protections--protections that are offered by EPA. Many of  these lawsuits again are against clean air protections. He has fought  against a rule to reduce mercury and other air-toxic pollution in this  country three separate times.   In 1990, Congress had enough scientific information to list mercury,  as well as 188 other air toxics, such as lead and arsenic, as hazardous  air pollutants in the Clean Air Act.   Lawmakers at the time, including me, serving in the House of  Representatives, thought this action would ensure our largest emitters  of mercury and air toxins would soon be required to clean up.  Unfortunately, it took 22 years for the EPA to issue the mercury and  air toxic rule, which reduced mercury and other air toxins from coal- fired powerplants, our largest source of mercury emissions in this  country.   The EPA modeled this rule after what was being done in the States and  required coal plants to install existing affordable technology that  could reduce mercury and toxic emissions by 90 percent. The reason the  EPA ended up having to go through all these processes over all these  years in issuing this regulation is because Congress did not act in  passing legislation, which we should have done. We could have, and we  tried--a bipartisan effort--Lamar Alexander, a wonderful Senator from  Tennessee, and myself, and others sought to get it done, and we were  unable to get it done legislatively. We were opposed by the utilities,  and in the end, the EPA said enough and we are going to issue this  rule.   But for a lawmaker who supported the Clean Air Act amendments of  1990, and as someone who represents a downwind State, this rule is a  long time in coming. You would not know this from the claims in these  lawsuits, but since 1990, medical professionals and scientists have  learned quite a bit about the environmental and health impacts of  mercury.   The mercury emitted into the air deposits into our water. It then  builds up in our lakes and rivers and streams and eventually makes its  way into our food supply, through fish and fowl that we eat.   Children are most at risk, as many of us know. Pregnant mothers who  eat the mercury-laden fish can transfer unhealthy doses to their unborn  children, impacting neurological development of their babies.   Prior to EPA's mercury rule, the Centers for Disease Control  estimated that 600,000 newborns were at risk a year from mercury  poisoning--600,000.   In 2012, Dr. Jerome Paulson, from the American Academy of Pediatrics,  testified before our EPW Committee, stating that ``there is no evidence  demonstrating a safe level of mercury exposure.''   Dr. Jerome Paulson, American Academy of Pediatrics, testified before  our committee in 2012. Again, he said: ``There is no evidence  demonstrating a safe level of mercury exposure.''   Our Nation's most reputable pediatric organization, dedicated to the  health and well-being of our children, has made clear that medical  research shows there is no safe level of mercury exposure for our  children--none.  [[Page S1345]]    Mr. Pruitt has come to his own conclusions about mercury.   The 2012 lawsuit that Mr. Pruitt joined with coal companies against  the mercury and air toxics rule stated--this is what the lawsuit said:  ``The record does not support EPA's findings that mercury, non-mercury  hazardous air pollutant metals, and acid gas hazardous air pollutants  pose public health hazards.''   I have to read that again. In the 2012 lawsuit in which Mr. Pruitt  joined with coal companies against the mercury and air toxics rule,  which was like 20 years in the making, finally adopted because Congress  refused to act, said these words: ``The record does not support EPA's  findings that mercury, non-mercury hazardous air pollutant metals, and  acid gas hazardous air pollutants pose public health hazards.''   This is not the first time Mr. Pruitt contradicted the medical and  scientific community on mercury and the threats it poses to public  health.   As I said, EPA took 22 years to get the coal plants to clean up the  mercury emissions. Every year that our country delayed the cleanup of  the emissions, more and more mercury settled and accumulated in our  rivers, streams, lakes, and fish.   I don't know how many lakes they have in Oklahoma, but I know that in  2010, there were fewer than 20 on which there were issued fish  consumption advisories because of mercury. I know last year that number  more than doubled.   Every State, including Oklahoma, has fish consumption advisories  because of mercury. As we see here, the number under Mr. Pruitt's watch  has seen the mercury-caused fish advisories to actually more than  double in the last 6 years.   In 2012, Dr. Charles Driscoll from Syracuse University--one of the  leading mercury scientists in the world--testified before our  committee. Dr. Driscoll told us that because of the long-term emissions  of mercury from coal plants, there are--his words--``hotspots and whole  regions, such as the Adirondacks, the Great Lakes region of the Midwest  and large portions of the Southeast, where the fish is contaminated  with mercury.''   He went on to say: ``There are more fish consumption advisories in  the U.S. for mercury than all contaminants combined.''   Instead of agreeing with leading scientists on this issue, Mr. Pruitt  has come to a different conclusion.   I think we have a poster that speaks to this.   Mr. Pruitt's 2012 lawsuit with the coal companies against EPA's  mercury protection stated:         The record does not support EPA's finding that mercury . .       . poses public health hazards. . . . Human exposure to       methylmercury resulting from coal fired EGUs is exceedingly       small.    Mr. Pruitt argued that, despite the fact that every State has at  least one mercury fish consumption advisory and despite there being 40  lakes in his own State of Oklahoma now that have mercury fish  advisories, we shouldn't worry about mercury pollution from our  country's largest source of emissions. That denial of facts makes no  sense. Luckily, the courts rejected Mr. Pruitt's arguments that the  mercury and air toxic rules should be vacated. Four years later, most  coal plants are meeting the new standards, and we are already seeing  the benefits.   Just a few weeks ago, some of my Environment and Public Works  colleagues and I heard from Dr. Lynn Goldman, a pediatrician and former  EPA Assistant Administrator for Toxic Substances, about this very issue  when she said: ``U.S. efforts to reduce mercury emissions, including  from power plants, are benefiting public health faster than could have  been predicted in 1990.''   Great news. Dr. Goldman's comments stand in stark contrast to the  ones made in Mr. Pruitt's latest mercury lawsuit, filed just 2 months  before his confirmation hearing. In this most recent lawsuit, Mr.  Pruitt argued that the benefits of cleaning powerplant mercury  emissions are ``too speculative'' and--again, his words--``not  supported by the scientific literature.'' Really? The lawsuit goes on  to conclude that it is not ``appropriate and necessary'' for the EPA to  regulate mercury and other air toxic emissions.   So Mr. Pruitt argued just 3 months ago that it is not appropriate or  necessary for the EPA to regulate the largest source of mercury  pollution--a pollutant that we know damages children's brains and could  impact up to 600,000 newborns every year. Just 3 months ago, Mr. Pruitt  listened to the industry instead of listening to our Nation's  pediatricians when determining what is good for our children's health.  Just 3 months ago, Mr. Pruitt sided with coal companies instead of our  leading scientists. Just 3 months ago, Mr. Pruitt argued that States  should be on their own when it comes to dealing with toxic pollution  that crosses State borders.   In Mr. Pruitt's confirmation hearing, I asked about these lawsuits  and his views on regulating mercury and air toxics from powerplants. He  was evasive and misleading, I believe, in his answers and claimed his  lawsuits were merely about process. Process.   Well, let's be perfectly clear. Mr. Pruitt's lawsuits are trying to  undermine a rule that protects the health of our children and our  grandchildren. His extreme views on mercury pollution clearly show Mr.  Pruitt believes that Americans have to make a choice between having a  strong economy and a safe, clean environment. I think this is a false  choice. We can have both, and indeed we must have both.   His extreme views on mercury pollution also show that Mr. Pruitt will  side with polluters over science and doctors--maybe not every time, but  way too often.   Americans deserve an EPA Administrator who believes in sound science  and who will listen to the medical experts when it comes to our health  and be able to strike a balance between a strong environment and a  strong economy. I don't believe Mr. Pruitt will be such an  Administrator, which is why I am asking my colleagues to join me in  voting against his confirmation.   I see we have been joined on the floor by the Senator from Indiana. I  am prepared to hit the pause button for a few minutes and welcome my  friend. I welcome him and thank him for his commitment, not just to the  people of Indiana but to our country and embracing the Golden Rule, the  idea that we have to look out for each other.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.    Madam President, I thank my friend for those kind and  generous remarks. I thank him for coming to Delaware. I have been  privileged to visit the Hoosier State any number of times. I have a  basketball in my office from Notre Dame, and I know our friend from  Indiana is a huge Notre Dame fan. Their basketball coach, Mike Brey, is  the former basketball coach of the University of Delaware. Just like  air pollution and water pollution can move across borders, so can head  coaches of great basketball teams.   Tomorrow night, God willing, I will be at the Bob Carpenter Center at  the University of Delaware to watch the University of Delaware's men's  basketball team play. Our new head coach is one of Mike Brey's  assistants who has come to our State to head us up. We look forward to  seeing how he and our Fightin' Blue Hens do.   I thank the Senator for sharing--a whole lot less air pollution-- after stealing our basketball coach, a very good replacement; I guess  not the player to be named later but the coach to be named later.    Madam President, one of the things I love about the  Senator from Indiana is he understands there is a Golden Rule. We are  one another's neighbors, and we need to treat others the way we want to  be treated. States need to treat other States the way they would want  to be treated.   He also understands a very valuable principle: that it is actually  possible to have cleaner air, cleaner water, and strengthen our  economy.   When I was an undergrad at Ohio State, a midshipman there, I remember  a time up north of us in Cleveland, OH, when the Cuyahoga River caught  on fire. The kind of smog we have now in parts of the country, running  in places in California, when I was stationed in California in the Navy  for a while--there are days when I ran that I knew I wasn't doing a  good thing for my lungs.   We have done a lot better than that. While we cleaned up rivers like  the Cuyahoga River and we cleaned up the air in a lot of places in the  country, we still have work to do. We have made those changes and those  improvements and developed technology that we have been able to sell  all over the world. That is a good thing.   I thank my friend for getting up at this hour of the day and joining  us here and for his leadership, not just in Indiana but here in the  Senate. It has been a joy. Thank you.   I want to go back to what I was talking about earlier--Scott Pruitt's  views. I think they are extreme, uninformed views on mercury  regulation. Mr. Pruitt's views on core clean air and clean water laws  and the somewhat misleading and oftentimes evasive answers he has given  to Members of this body, including myself, ought to be reason enough  for Members of this body to reject his nomination.   Two months prior to his confirmation hearing, Mr. Pruitt filed his  third major legal action against the EPA's mercury and air toxics rule.  This case is still pending before the courts.   For those who don't know the EPA's mercury and air toxics rule, it  requires our Nation's largest source of mercury pollution--coal-fired  plants--to reduce mercury in a wider range of air toxins.   The EPA issued this rule in 2012, and because of the low cost of  compliance, most utilities are already meeting the standards. We made  more progress at a faster time, at a lower cost than was actually  anticipated. The same thing is true with the elimination of acid rain  in New England. The deal that was worked out was a cap-and-trade  approach, but the idea was developed when George Herbert Walker Bush  was President. We ended up with better results for less money and  faster time than was anticipated. We can do this.   Mr. Pruitt filed his latest lawsuit alongside with one of the  Nation's largest coal companies, Murray Energy Corporation, arguing  that the benefits of cleaning up powerplant and mercury and air toxic  emissions are ``too speculative'' and not necessary.   Mr. Pruitt goes on to argue that there are only ``hypothetically  exposed persons'' from mercury and air toxic emissions from  powerplants. Imagine that--``hypothetically exposed persons.'' Again, I  would say: Really?   Finally, Mr. Pruitt argues: ``The EPA cannot properly conclude it is  appropriate and necessary to regulate hazardous air pollutants under  Section 112.''   His boiled-down arguments before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC  Circuit is basically this: If the EPA cannot quantify benefits in  dollars, then those benefits don't count. Never mind that we know the  real-world health threats to people this kind of air pollution poses.   The idea of looking at public health protection only through the lens  of dollars and cents is not a new one, but it can be a dangerous one.  The tools we have for projecting costs and putting a dollar value on  the health benefits are not gospel and are not the only way of  analyzing the economic impacts of reducing pollution on a community.  With toxic substances, such as lead, arsenic, and mercury, health  benefits are sometimes difficult to quantify.  [[Page S1347]]    Meanwhile, the EPA is chock-full of examples where benefits are  underestimated and costs overestimated once programs are implemented  and businesses find efficient ways of cutting pollution. In my part of  the country, we call that Yankee intuition.   Mr. Pruitt's argument ignores that it is difficult, if not  impossible, to quantify the loss of IQ, increased risk of cancer, or  other long-term health effects known to occur when exposed to mercury  and air toxic emissions.   In Mr. Pruitt's world, if we can't accurately translate loss of IQ  into dollars lost, the benefits of cleaning up mercury for other  children is ``too speculative'' for it to be ``necessary and  appropriate'' for EPA to act. As a father of three sons, I find this  way of thinking alarming.   I have a poster here with a message from a woman in Wilmington, DE.  Wilmington is in the northern part of the State, where our  congressional delegation and Governor and his family live.   This is from Sarah. I would ask Mr. Pruitt this: How much does it  cost to lose an organ like I have, to lose a parent or child from  cancer? How much do sick days and inhalers cost? Families are  struggling to make ends meet. Many of these costs are not in dollars  alone.   Thank you, Sarah.   Sarah is a mother and a registered nurse. She wrote to me earlier  this month to express her concerns regarding Mr. Pruitt's nomination.  In her letter, she explained to me that she was born in 1978, in  Western New York State. It is miles away from the Love Canal  neighborhood. It is the site of one of the most appalling environmental  disasters in American history.   For those who don't know or don't recall, Love Canal was a planned  community that eventually had to be evacuated after 22,000 barrels of  toxic waste were dumped into the nearby canal--22,000 barrels. Families  whose homes were contaminated with chemicals and toxic waste had to  leave. Many faced serious health challenges later in their lives. These  were the real threats we faced before we had the EPA or laws on the  books that held polluters accountable for dumping hazardous chemicals  in our waters.   Sarah's mother was pregnant with her while Love Canal was being  evacuated, just 7 miles away from their home. Fast forward a few  decades. When Sarah was 30, she found out that she had thyroid cancer.  Doctors told her that exposure to radiation, perhaps from the  radioactive hotspots near her hometown, is a proven risk factor for  thyroid cancer.   Sarah now has a daughter of her own who, unfortunately, suffers from  reactive airway disease that causes her trouble breathing, and symptoms  can last anywhere from a few minutes to hours at a time.   Sarah, in her letter, said to me:         Mr. Pruitt believes that the EPA places economic hardships       on businesses through unnecessary regulation. True economic       hardship is experienced by those who are often least       protected by environmental laws.    She went on to say:         I would ask Mr. Pruitt: How much does it ``cost'' to lose       an organ like I have? To lose a parent or child to cancer?       How much do sick days and inhalers cost families already       struggling to make ends meet? What is the life path of a       person who starts out with compromised lungs? Many of these       costs are not in dollars alone.    Sarah couldn't be more right. An EPA Administrator must be able to  understand the true human cost of rolling back or eliminating critical  environmental regulations.   Mr. Pruitt's persistent and extreme views--or at least extreme views  in my mind--on the mercury and air toxics rule are some of the reasons  I have grave concerns about his nomination to be EPA Administrator.   I can't help but wonder if Mr. Pruitt will continue to fight this  rule--not from outside the Agency, but from inside the Agency.   I wonder if Mr. Pruitt would uphold the clean air protection that has  bipartisan support or if he would kill the rule and take his extreme  views of cost-benefit analysis broader, to other issues such as  cleaning up lead in our water or addressing climate change.   That is why I asked him not once, not twice, but three times about  his views on the mercury and air toxics rule. I asked him directly  three times if EPA should move forward with the rule and if EPA should  be regulating mercury and air toxic emissions from powerplants. Each  time I asked, the more evasive and misleading the answers became.   In our three exchanges, I was very clear that I was asking about  EPA's regulations and the authority to address mercury emissions from  powerplants.   However, in Mr. Pruitt's answers, he was very careful to mention that  mercury pollution should be regulated under the Clean Air Act but never  said that mercury and other air toxic emissions from powerplants should  be or must be regulated.   Mercury, as it turns out, is emitted by many sources. Coal-fired  powerplants happen to be the largest emitter in this country. Under  section 112 of the Clean Air Act, Congress listed mercury as a  hazardous air pollutant and required the EPA to regulate all major  emissions sources.   It seems that Mr. Pruitt tried to avoid the questions I asked him  about controlling mercury and air toxic powerplant emissions. He,  instead, answered about regulating mercury more broadly.   While he was trying to evade the questions, what he did say was very  misleading to the committee.   In our second exchange, I mentioned his three lawsuits against the  mercury and air toxics rule. I asked Mr. Pruitt if he believed the EPA  should not move forward with this rule and, if there were no rule, how  would States clean up mercury?   Mr. Pruitt answered: ``I actually have not stated that I believe the  EPA should not move forward on regulating mercury or adopting  rulemaking in that regard.''   He went on to say: ``There is not a statement--or belief--that I have  that mercury is something that shouldn't be regulated under Section 112  as a Hazardous Air Pollutant.''   Well, anyone who supports the mercury and air toxics rule and heard  that might be very encouraged by these comments.   Sadly, Mr. Pruitt is on record many times stating that the EPA should  not move forward regulating mercury and air toxic powerplant emissions.   Here are a few quotes from the legal briefs that Mr. Pruitt filed in  his many lawsuits against this rule that directly contradict his  statements in our hearing.   In his first lawsuit against the mercury and air toxics rule, called  White Stallion v. EPA, Mr. Pruitt argued: ``Finally, the record does  not support EPA's findings that mercury, non-mercury Hazardous Air  Pollutant metals, and acid gas Hazardous Air Pollutants pose public  health hazards.''   In his most recent case with Murray Energy, he argues that, with  respect to powerplant mercury emissions, the ``EPA cannot properly  conclude that it is appropriate and necessary to regulate Hazardous Air  Pollutants under Section 112.''   These statements go well beyond questioning the ``process.'' Instead,  they suggest the EPA should not be regulating mercury and toxic air  emissions from powerplants.   This is not what even Trump voters voted for in November. They did  not go to the polls hoping that the new President would make their air  dirtier or their water more polluted.   This is another case of this nominee trying to mislead, or at least  obscure, the truth before Congress. It is a troublesome pattern that I  fear will only get worse if Mr. Pruitt is confirmed as EPA  Administrator.   With that, I reserve the remainder of my time.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, I want to continue to share with you and  my colleagues the reasons I am opposed to the nomination of Attorney  General Scott Pruitt to be the Administrator of the Environmental  Protection Agency.   What we do know about Mr. Pruitt's past record--and there is still a  good deal we don't know and are not able to learn in committee. We know  Mr. Pruitt abandoned his responsibilities to  [[Page S1348]]  protect Oklahomans from harmful pollution. Instead of holding polluters  and bad actors in the State accountable, Mr. Pruitt spent a lot of his  time as attorney general in Oklahoma suing the Environmental Protection  Agency.   These days, going after the EPA public health protection seems like a  popular thing to do. In fact, the EPA is often a target of nasty tweets  from our current President.   Without the burning rivers or thick smog and soot in the air, which  used to be all too common, some may presume that there is not much more  for the EPA to do to protect the public health of our country from  pollution. People may presume that our environmental protection  problems are behind us, and States can take care of themselves when it  comes to clean air and clean water, as Mr. Pruitt has suggested time  and again.   I am a recovering Governor, a former Governor for 8 years. I have  huge regard for what Governors can do, States can do. There is a lot we  can do, but not everything. That is not the idea--that States can  simply take care of themselves when it comes to clean air and water,  and there is no need for Federal oversight. It is just wrong. I think  it is untrue. The EPA continues to play a critical role in protecting  our health, especially for the most vulnerable, including the very  young and the elderly. The environmental threats we face today are real  and do not respect State borders.   One such threat is ozone, known to some as smog pollution. Five  times, Mr. Pruitt has sued the EPA over regulations to require new  ozone, smog protections. Several of these lawsuits are still pending  before the courts.   Mr. Pruitt's actions against ozone health protection are deeply  concerning to me, as I represent a State at the end of what many of us  on the east coast call America's tailpipe. Emissions come up from the  Midwest, largely, and blow from west to east and end up in our air and  in our water. Ninety percent of the smog and air pollution in Delaware  comes from outside of our State, partly from hundreds of miles away-- places like Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, and across the Midwest.   I said many times as Governor of Delaware that I could have  eliminated every source of pollution within my State--shut down the  factories, cleared every car off the road, stopped trains and transit  or boats. Delaware would still face the deadly doses of air pollution,  not from our own emissions, but from those blowing in our State from  hundreds of miles away.   We have a chart here to my left that we call the Ozone Report Card.  Ozone is smog pollution. It deals not with quality of air pollution in  Delaware, but it is a report card for Oklahoma. Cross-state ozone air  pollution continues to be a major problem for our State, but it also is  for many States across the country.   In Mr. Pruitt's own home State of Oklahoma, every county with an air  quality monitor--16 counties; they have more than 16 counties, but 16  have air quality monitors--has an unhealthy level of ozone pollution,  according to the American Lung Association. The American Lung  Association assigns grades in subjects, just as for our pages here in  school. My home State has A's and B's. The Oklahoma Lung Association  assigns a grade for ozone pollution. In these 16 counties, they  assigned a grade of F, not just in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 10--all 16.   For decades, we have known that air pollution is linked to serious  health problems like asthma attacks, strokes, heart attacks, and other  respiratory illnesses. Most recently, ozone has been linked to early  deaths.   We have another chart that refers to Oklahoma's asthma rate.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 6.3  million children in this country have been diagnosed with asthma--6.3  million children diagnosed with asthma. In Mr. Pruitt's home State of  Oklahoma, 1 in 10 children have asthma, which is higher than the  national average. That is 6.3 million children nationwide, and more  than 112,000 in Oklahoma who have to worry, during the high ozone days,  if they are going to have an asthma attack.   Recognizing the very real dangers of ozone pollution, Congress passed  the EPA to provide our country with the ozone air quality standards  based on the best science available, and they review that standard  every 5 years. After reviewing more than 1,000 medical and scientific  studies, the EPA concluded about 2 years ago, in 2015, that the 2008  ozone health standard was too weak and no longer adequately protected  public health.   The EPA's 2015 rule was purely a statement of fact to protect our  health. To protect the 6.3 million children with asthma, we need less  ozone pollution in our air. To protect 112,000 children with asthma in  Oklahoma, we need a stronger air quality standard.   Fortunately, many of today's biggest emitters of ozone pollution,  such as older coal plants, are already scheduled to be cleaned up. This  means the costs of compliance are not as high as they might have been  2, 4, or 6 years ago.   As attorney general, Mr. Pruitt had a choice between two paths. If he  had taken the first path, Mr. Pruitt could have worked with his  Department of Environmental Quality and the business community to  ensure ozone polluters in his own State cleaned up. He could have  worked with the EPA, not against it. By doing so, he would have  protected Oklahomans and citizens living in downwind States from ozone  pollution and helped economic growth and the State at the same time. It  is important to note that many attorneys general in this country  decided to take this path, including our own attorney general, Matt  Denn, in Delaware.   Instead, Mr. Pruitt took a second path, the one that led to suing the  Agency, the EPA, in an attempt to weaken protections. It is no surprise  that Mr. Pruitt chose to sue the EPA, based on his clear record.   I have a poster here with some of his own words. After all, it was  Mr. Pruitt who just last summer explicitly said it bothers him that  Congress and the EPA work together to ensure Americans have clean air  to breathe--or appears to say that. Specifically, here is what he said:         Legislation should not be ``we like clean air, so go make       clean air.'' That's something that bothers me, that then       Congress gives to EPA this general grant of authority.    That was at Hillsdale College in July of 2016. I would just ask, What  then does Mr. Pruitt think the role of EPA is? It is hardly some kind  of extreme overreach to keep deadly pollutants out of the air we  breathe. I think most people think that. Mr. Pruitt chose to sue the  EPA over the science used to justify in writing the regulations, citing  the polluters over the medical and scientific experts who have  published over 1,000 scientific studies that the EPA has reviewed.   Mr. Pruitt did not stop there. He also sued the EPA over protections  for downwind States. Delaware is one of them. Let me repeat that. Mr.  Pruitt not only sued the EPA over science used in the 2015 ozone rule,  but he also sued the EPA over the good neighbor rule to make sure all  States do their fair share to clean up the air. Without the good  neighbor rule, Delawareans, and all Americans living in downwind  States, will be forced to live with the consequences of decisions made  by polluters hundreds or thousands of miles from them. Mr. Pruitt took  the stance that every citizen in this country does not have the right  to breathe clean air. Mr. Pruitt took the stance that the lawyers and  polluters know better than scientists and medical experts when it comes  to ozone pollution and health.   The President is asking us in this body to confirm Mr. Pruitt as our  EPA Administrator. As Senators, we can also choose between two paths.  The first path is protecting public health and ensuring that those who  elected us have clean air to breathe. The second path is protecting  polluters. I will be taking the path that protects the health of my  constituents. I urge my colleagues to do the same for theirs.   In just a moment, I am going to pause. Before I do, I mention this  good neighbor rule. Some people call it the cross-border rule. The idea  behind it is that we ought to treat one another as neighbors.   Where does the good neighbor rule come from? It actually comes from  the Bible. And it comes not just from the Bible, it comes from almost  every major religion in the world--the idea that we ought to treat  other people the way we want to be treated. If you look at every major  religion in the world, it pretty much says that.   In the New Testament, some will recall, there is a passage where the  Pharisees were after this young Rabbi,  [[Page S1349]]  a couple thousand years ago, trying to put Him on the spot. They said:  You are so smart, young Rabbi, why don't You tell us what is the  greatest rule of law, the greatest commandment of all? He said: Not  one, there are two. He mentioned the first. Then He said: The second is  love thy neighbor as thyself.   One of the pharisees said to Him: Who is our neighbor? And He went on  to tell them the parable of the good Samaritan. A man traveling through  the country was attacked, left for dead in a ditch. Later in the day,  three people walked by, one from a part of the country where this guy  was sort of his neighbor. He walked on by. Next, a person of the cloth,  a rabbi, walked on by. He didn't stop. The third guy that came through  was from a place called Samaria. They are like at enmity, at odds with  one another. They are not friendly; they are at odds with one another.   He saw the fellow had been beaten and left for dead. He ministered to  him and put him on his animal and took him to an inn. For a day and a  night, he tried to help him get better. After the second day, the guy  from Samaria had to leave and had to go someplace else. He said to the  innkeeper: This fellow still isn't well enough to travel, but here is  some money to help pay for his care here for another day or two. When I  come back through, if you need more money or it costs more, I will even  up with you. He left, but he left the guy who had been beaten in a lot  better shape.   After telling His story, the young Rabbi turned to the pharisee and  he said: Who was the good neighbor?   Well, there was the one--the first fellow who came by who took pity  on the guy who had been beaten and left for dead and treated him the  way he would have wanted to be treated.   That is really the foundation of the good neighbor rule that the EPA  has promulgated. It is the foundation of the idea that pollution does  cross borders and because of that, we need to have--if we can't pass a  law, we need some kind of rule or regulation to ensure that everybody  is being a good neighbor because it is not fair that my State--that we  can pretty much close down my State's economy, transportation systems,  powerplants, and still have a problem with air quality. That is just  not fair.   I think next we are going to look at some editorial statements that  are in opposition to Mr. Pruitt. I know there are editorial statements  that support him. I don't have any of those today, not surprisingly.  But I do want to go through a couple from newspapers around the  country: New York Times, Bangor News up in Maine, L.A. Times, Denver  Post, Chicago Sun Times, Dallas Morning News.   I have received a number of letters from Delawareans about the  nomination of Mr. Pruitt to lead the EPA. For the record, as of I guess  last night, my office had received a total of seven letters, emails, or  faxes supporting Mr. Pruitt's nomination. I guess this is from all  sources, not just Delaware. But we have gotten seven letters supporting  Mr. Pruitt's nomination. I received 1,880 letters opposing his  nomination. That is pretty amazing. We don't get this kind of volume of  letters, emails, or faxes, but 1,880 opposed, 7 letters supporting.   But it is not just Delawareans who are worried about the idea of Mr.  Pruitt at the helm of EPA; over the past 3 months, editorial boards  across our country have expressed their own serious concerns about this  nominee as well.   I want to share a few of those with my colleagues and the world this  morning. Back in December, the New York Times wrote these words. I will  read them. This is from December, a couple of months ago:         Had Donald Trump spent an entire year scouring the country       for someone to weaken clean air and clean water laws and       repudiate America's leadership role in the global battle       against climate change, he could not have found a more       suitable candidate than Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma Attorney       General.    That is a pretty bold charge. The editorial describes Mr. Pruitt's  nomination--it goes on to say ``an aggressively bad choice''; ``a poke  in the eye to a long history of bipartisan cooperation on environmental  issues.''   Again, the EPA was not created in a law signed by a Democrat, it was  by a Republican.   The Times goes on to say ``bad choice''; ``a poke in the eye . . . to  a nation that has come to depend on an agency for healthy air and  drinkable water.''   And to the 195 countries that agreed in Paris last year to reduce  their emissions, climate-changing greenhouse gas, in the belief that  the United States should show the way, the Times concludes with these  words: ``Mr. Pruitt is the wrong person to lead an agency charged with  the custody of the nation's environment.''   The Senate cares about public good and needs to send his nomination  to the dustbin.   But I know that not everyone is a huge fan of the New York Times  these days, so let's move a little further north. Let's go up to Maine.  They have a paper up there called the Bangor Daily News. I have a  poster from them as well. Last month, the Bangor Daily News Editorial  Board wrote these words. Again, this is last month:         As attorney general of Oklahoma, Mr. Pruitt has been openly       hostile to the EPA's mission of protecting human health by       regulating dangerous pollutants, such as mercury and carbon       dioxide. Someone who has repeatedly tried to prevent the EPA       from doing its job surely should be disqualified from       overseeing the agency.    You know, we generally believe that Presidents have wide latitude in  choosing the members of their Cabinet. I think Governors should have  wide latitude. As a former Governor, I said to our Delaware  Legislature: I have been elected; give me the opportunity to put  together my own team and judge us on our performance.   However, some nominees of some Presidents are so--probably Democrats  and Republicans, but especially in this case, with this President--some  nominees are so unqualified or philosophically unfit that Senators  should use their constitutional powers to reject them. Scott Pruitt,  President Donald Trump's pick to head the EPA, is one of those  nominees.   I voted for more of the nominees of this President than against.  Several of them are quite good. I serve on a committee called Homeland  Security and Governmental Affairs. To succeed Secretary Jeh Johnson,  the President nominated retired Marine general John Francis Kelly, who  was a terrific soldier, marine, leader for our country, and will be a  great Secretary. I wish they were all of his caliber. I wish they were.   The Bangor paper went on to write:         Critics of the EPA tend to focus on rules and laws that the       agency is involved in writing that protect little-known       animals or landscapes, such as wetlands. But, the agency's       primary mission is to safeguard the health of Americans       through landmark laws such as Clean Water Act and Clean Air       Act.    Finally at the Bangor paper, they got to what is really at stake with  Scott Pruitt at the head of EPA when we have a President who has  repeatedly said he would like to get rid of the EPA in almost every  forum. This is what they said at the Bangor News:         We are under no illusions that Mr. Trump is suddenly going       to become a champion of environmental protection, even if       that is synonymous with protecting human life. But Pruitt is       so hostile to the EPA's core mission that putting him in       charge would move the United States dangerously backwards.    But it is not just the east coast editorial boards that are worried  about Scott Pruitt's nomination. Let's go to the west coast, the L.A.  Times in California, the State that has led the way in environmental  protection. The L.A. Times Editorial Board wrote--let's see if we have  a date. It is February 4, this month. This is what they wrote:         Yes, Trump won the election, and as president, he's       entitled to appoint people who reflect his political views.       But when the president's policies and appointees pose such a       fundamental threat to the nation, even a Senate controlled by       his fellow Republicans--whose first loyalty should be to the       people of the United States--must put the nation's best       interests ahead of party loyalty.    They continue at the L.A. Times and say:         Pruitt wouldn't run the agency as just another small-      government Republican interested in paring excessive       limitations on business. He actually disagrees with the       fundamental mission of the EPA. He has argued that the       federal government should play a lesser role in environmental       protection, and that primary control should be given to the       states.    That is wrongheaded. Putting West Virginia, my native State, in  charge of  [[Page S1350]]  its coal industry or Texas in charge of its oil industry would lead to  horrific environmental damage, not just there but in the neighboring  States downwind and downstream, according to the L.A. Times Editorial  Board.   The L.A. Times Editorial concludes by saying:         Putting Pruitt in charge of the EPA, however, poses an       irreversible risk to the planet, and the Senate needs to       ensure that doesn't happen.    It is not just the coastal editorial boards that have opposed Mr.  Pruitt. The Denver Post noted that--these are their words from 2 months  ago, December 8, 2016:         It looks like Trump truly does wish to dismantle the EPA.       His pick of Scott Pruitt to lead it strikes us as       unnecessarily reckless, and we urge the Senate to deny       confirmation and to demand a better way forward.    It is not on the poster, but the Denver paper went on to add: Does  the Nation really want a Big Oil mouthpiece running the agency that's  charged with the laudable task of keeping our air and water safe?   Let's head up to Chicago, where the Sun Times was editorializing in  the great State of Illinois. The Chicago Sun Times Editorial Board-- let's see what we have for a date. It looks like December 8, a couple  of months ago. This is what they said:         We are living in a time that calls for stepping up efforts       across the board to protect our environment for future       generations.        Unfortunately, President-elect Donald Trump has appointed       Scott Pruitt, an open foe of environmental initiatives, to       head the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. That       demonstrates a callous disregard for the health of our nation       and planet just as rapid technological advances hold out hope       for avoiding the worst effects of climate change.    It went on to say:         During his campaign, Trump said he would dismantle       President Barrack Obama's environmental policies and pull the       United States out of the 195-nation Paris accord to reduce       greenhouse gases and climate change. After the election,       Trump moderated his tone, saying he has an open mind about       climate change. His appointment of Pruitt, however, suggests       that if he's open to anything, it's strictly more pollution.    They concluded with these words:         At a time when serious scientists worry about cataclysmic       disasters threatened by climate change, we can't afford to       put our future in the hands of an apologist for the fossil       fuel industry. America needs an EPA chief who understands the       value of environmental successes we have achieved and the       critical importance of building on them.    But perhaps these aren't convincing enough. Travel with me down to  Texas because they have a problem even in Texas, in the Lone Star  State. One of the newspapers there, the Dallas Morning News, wrote just  last week:         Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, a veteran of a       years-long courthouse campaign to undermine the Environmental       Protection Agency, is the wrong choice to lead the agency       under President Donald Trump. It's hard to imagine a worse       choice.    They highlighted the long-term impact of putting Mr. Pruitt in charge  of the EPA. Here is what they said:         The post of EPA administrator is a critical one, and       nowhere is that more tangible than here in energy-rich Texas.    Again, this is the Dallas Morning News:         Many industry voices have already raised toasts to Pruitt's       nomination, concluding that his plans to eviscerate the EPA's       regulatory oversight of oil and gas companies, and other       polluters, will strengthen the state's economic fortunes.    The Morning News went on to write that the Senators from Texas must  ``look beyond the short-sighted calculus and vote in the long-term  interests of Texas. Put simply, Texas' economy will be stronger over  time if its environment is cleaner and if its people are healthier.''   This is just one of a handful of the editorial boards that have  raised serious and substantive objections to Mr. Pruitt's nomination,  and for very good reason. They don't just come from the Northeast or  from the east coast, they don't just come from the Southeast or the  Midwest; they come from the west coast and even Texas itself. We ought  to listen to them. We ought to listen to them. They are not all wrong.  In fact, I fear they are right.    With that, I see we have been joined on the floor by a young man from  Connecticut who came to share some of his own thoughts with us on these  important topics.   I just want to thank him for the good work he does in so many areas.  He and I have been partners together on trying to make sure the people  of this country have access to affordable healthcare, and we get better  results for less money, and I applaud him for those efforts, as he  knows probably better than I, to try to ensure that people are healthy.  It is not enough just to provide healthcare for them when they get  sick. We call that sick care. We try to make sure we are doing things  up front to prevent people from getting sick, to enable them to stay  healthy. A lot of that really leads right to the work of the  Environmental Protection Agency.   Leadership is so important in everything we do. It is the most  critical factor in everything. Leadership is the key to the success of  any organization, large or small, that I have ever been a part of or  observed. I don't care if it is a business, I don't care if it is a  church, I don't care if it is a school, I don't care if it is a  military unit, a sports team, or the U.S. Senate, leadership is key.  The EPA is key.   Show me enlightened, well-qualified leadership, and I will show you a  successful operation. We need to be real careful in making sure the EPA  has the kind of leadership that will lead them and our Nation well into  the future.   With that, I yield the floor.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I lived in Palo Alto Park, that part of  the State. The Naval Air Station was there. It used to be called  Moffett Field. It is still there. I remember the hangars that we used  during the time we served on Active Duty.   I had the privilege of knowing a number of attorneys general from  California, and we are very pleased to be able to welcome Senator  Harris to our floor. Yesterday she gave her maiden address on the  Senate floor.   Thank you.   She is pretty good.   I would say that you are even better than I thought. That was  wonderful. Those were wonderful comments. I know our Presiding Offerer  is also the chairman of our committee and probably is not enjoying your  comments as much as I am, but I thought you were evenhanded and fair in  sharing that.   The Presiding Officer is a pretty good friend of mine, and I don't  know if he is a big baseball fan. I am. I love sports. I am a huge  Detroit Tigers fan. You are a Giants fan. The leadership in baseball is  critically important. It is important to have good infielders, good  outfielders, good pitchers, catchers, and so forth. What is really  important is to have great leadership and great leadership in terms of  the coaching staff. Leadership is always the most important ingredient  in every organization I have ever been a part of.   The Tigers just lost their owner, Mike Ilitch. He was a legendary  figure in Detroit in baseball. He passed away earlier this week at the  tender age of 86. It is a big loss for Motown and, frankly, for  baseball.   In terms of leadership, we wouldn't want to hire somebody to coach a  baseball team who was a football coach or someone who is great with a  basketball team. I don't doubt that Scott Pruitt a skillful lawyer. I  met his family. I like him. I think he is arguably a good dad and a  good husband. But it is a little bit like asking a pacifist to lead  something like the Department of Defense--may be a skillful person but  maybe just not the right person to do a particular job.   I thought you outlined that very well. I wanted to say welcome to the  big leagues. We are going to learn a lot from you.   I yield back.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.    Madam President, my friend from Kansas is here. A lot of  people around the country think there is probably not much we agree on.  I want to say that I agree with just about everything the Senator from  Kansas just said. And the fact that 95 percent of the world's markets  are outside of our borders--if we lose sight of that, forget about the  value of exports; we make a huge mistake.   I was a supporter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I believe the  Senator from Kansas was, as well. Some people are saying: Well, we need  to forget all about that, and what we need to do is renegotiate NAFTA.   In the context of negotiating the transpacific trade agreement, we  negotiated NAFTA. I hope you won't throw out that baby with the bath  water as we go forward.   I commend the Senator for his remarks and say how much I enjoyed  working with him on many issues. I hope to work with him again.   Madam President, I mentioned earlier today before the Presiding  Officer took the chair that I received a lot of letters, emails, phone  calls, and faxes from Delawareans who are concerned about the  nomination of Mr. Pruitt to lead the EPA. As of today, my office has  received a total of 7 letters supporting Mr. Pruitt's nomination and we  have received 1,880 letters opposing his nomination--remarkable  numbers. Please compare this number to the 278 letters my office  received opposing the nomination of Congressman Tom Price to lead the  Department of Health and Human Services. That is pretty amazing. The  Republican nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services,  278 letters against; Mr. Pruitt, 1,880 letters and emails against.  Delawareans are clearly paying attention, and they are clearly  concerned by the idea of Mr. Pruitt being charged with safeguarding our  environment and our health.   I want to take a moment to read a letter sent to me--I have gotten a  lot of letters--a letter sent to me last week from a woman named  Danielle D., a new mother and small business owner who lives in  Wilmington with her infant son. Danielle wrote to me because her  concerns go beyond politics and to the core values of giving our  children the best lives possible. Danielle writes:         Dear Senator Carper, I am reaching out to you today as both       a new mother and a small business owner urging you to oppose       Scott Pruitt's nomination as Administrator of the U.S.       Environmental Protection Agency.        As a business owner, I support a number of President       Trump's cabinet nominations and many of his pro-business       policies. But there are very few policy decisions that touch       every facet of our lives like environmental policies do. Our       environment affects our health, our economy and our everyday       lives. The decisions we now make will affect Americans for       generations to come.    She goes on to say:         My son is 5 months old. Like any parent, I can only hope I       am able to advance my son's life by leaps and bounds, as my       parents did for me.        However, I am extremely concerned that, should Mr. Pruitt       be chosen as the next Administrator of the EPA, the decisions       we make today will make it nearly impossible for me to leave       my son a better environment than the one I brought him into.        In short, we need an EPA Administrator who will work to       prove America is the best when it comes to environmental       policy. Mr. Pruitt is not that person.    I share this letter today so that our colleagues know that my  constituents and, indeed, Americans across the country do care deeply  about the person who will lead the EPA, although they may support other  nominees of President Trump. Those who have contacted us want to know  that the individual leading the EPA is on their side and that the first  question that person will ask is, How will this affect the environment  and how will this affect the health of the least of these, like  Danielle's 5-month-old son?   Clearly, thousands upon thousands are afraid or fearful that Scott  Pruitt doesn't care to ask those questions and that he will not be an  advocate for the American people whom the EPA is charged with  protecting. I share their concerns.   I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.    Mr. President, a few minutes ago, we stopped everything  right here. Stopped. And the Chaplain of the U.S. Senate came in, Barry  Black, retired Navy Admiral, and gave a prayer.   We have a Bible study group that meets every Thursday. We met  yesterday in Jim Inhofe's hideaway. Every time we meet, almost without  exception, Chaplain Black reminds us, Democrats and Republicans--those  of us who need the most help--he reminds us that of all the times the  Scripture is invoked, we should ask for wisdom.   Well, I ask for wisdom every night for myself, my colleagues in the  Senate, over in the House, the President, the Vice President, their  spouses, every night, that we have the opportunity to gain some wisdom.   When Scott Pruitt was nominated to be the Administrator for EPA, I  sent him a letter December 28, asking 52 questions, asking for  responses by January 10. They didn't come by January 10. We had a  hearing January 18. I got some answers, not all. One thing I also asked  for, also asked for by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, was access to what  the folks had been asking for from the Center for Media and Democracy  for 2 years; that is, access to thousands of emails in the AG's office,  and their back and forth with the fossil fuel industry, oil, natural  gas, coal, a variety of others. We would like to have access to those  emails.   When Mr. Pruitt went before our committee for his hearing on January  18, he was asked the question: Do you promise to provide information  reasonably requested by committees here in the United States Senate and  the Congress, including in electronic form? He said, yes, but he didn't  do it. In fact, for 2 years, the AG's office fought off efforts to try  to gain access to that information, electronic media. It took a judge  calling an emergency meeting yesterday in Oklahoma to say to the  attorney general's office: You have to turn this information over.  Normally, you know how long a 4-year request takes in Oklahoma to get  results like this? We are talking maybe 2 months. This was over 2  years.   Finally, we are going to get access to those emails. There may be a  reason why they were so reluctant to share those emails with us. We are  going to find out starting next Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, when we  get them. If we don't vote to support Senator Merkley's proposal, to  put off the vote until the Monday after we come back from recess, we  will not have the opportunity to take advantage of what the judge--I  don't know if it is by Divine intervention, but this judge has given us  the opportunity to gain wisdom, to make a smarter decision, to make a  better informed decision. If we vote up or down on Mr. Pruitt's  nomination today, we pass up a great opportunity to get a fuller  picture.   Now, my Republican friends will say: He sat through the longest  hearing of any EPA Administrator in the history of our country. He has  answered 1,000 questions.   Let me just say that Gina McCarthy answered more when she was the  last EPA Administrator. She answered more--quite a few more, actually.  She took a little extra time to actually answer the questions.  [[Page S1389]]    So many of the responses we got to the thousands of questions for the  record asked of this nominee--the answers were evasive, they were  incomplete, and sometimes they were just totally nonresponsive. You can  say he answered all the questions, but how well? How thoroughly? How  responsively? Not so good. Not so good.   Friends, I want to put up here on the board--I have a board here.  Let's look at the third one.   Mr. President, how much time do I have?   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five and a half minutes.    We have heard from a lot of folks, different views on  what we ought to be doing. One of them was from a fellow whose name is  Kyle Meyaard-Schaap. Who is Mr. Schaap? Good question. Mr. Schaap is  the leader or one of the spokespersons from a group--if I can find it  here; here we go--spokesperson for Young Evangelicals for Climate  Action.   He wrote us about Mr. Pruitt's nomination. Here is what he had to  say:         If Scott Pruitt embraces his own self-described pro-life       stance, he should fight to protect vulnerable lives from       birth to natural death--the lives of children born and       unborn, the elderly, people of color--from environmental       pollution. He should work tirelessly to ensure that everyone       has clean water and air. He should strengthen, not       eviscerate, an agency equipped to honor God's mandate to       steward and care for the creation.    Mr. Meyaard-Schaap goes on to say:         As Oklahoma attorney general, however, [Mr. Pruitt] has       done just the opposite. He has had the chance to protect       people from pollution and the harms of climate change.       Instead, he has brought multiple lawsuits against the EPA to       overturn measures that would safeguard clean water and air.       He had the chance to defend policies that cut the power plant       pollution that fuels climate change and pollutes our air.       Instead, he cast doubt on climate change and downplayed the       moral imperative to safeguard our climate and environment. He       had a chance to assist EPA in its mission to protect public       health. Instead, he questioned its mission entirely and       sought to defend industry from regulation.    We all have an obligation to protect the health of our children,  families, and the world in which we live. For me, this is not only my  responsibility as a parent and official elected to serve the people of  Delaware, it is a moral calling.   I sat for 8 years as a member of the National Governors Association.  For 7 years, this lady sat right next to me. She was the Governor of  New Jersey. She went on to become the Administrator of the EPA--the  very position to which Scott Pruitt has been nominated. She is not a  Democrat. She is not a progressive. She is not a knee-jerk liberal. She  is a Republican. She was not only the Governor of her State for 7  years, but she was the head of EPA for a number of years under George  W. Bush. Here is what she basically said about Scott Pruitt, her words,  not mine. She said: ``[I] can't recall ever having seen an appointment  of someone who was so disdainful of the agency and the science behind  what the agency does.'' That bears repeating. ``[I] can't recall ever  having seen an appointment of someone who is so disdainful of the  agency and the science behind what the agency does.'' Those are  powerful words.   Just as I think that the idea of waiting another week or so to get  the wisdom that those thousands of emails might contain--we don't have  to wait for the wisdom from this woman who has walked in these shoes,  serving her State as Governor and serving this country as the leader of  the Agency that protects our public health for all of us. My hope is  that our colleagues will not ignore this wisdom.   Lastly, I will say this: Come next Thursday, Friday, we are going to  start getting the information from these emails. We will find out if  there is fire where there is smoke or not. If there is nothing there,  then there is nothing there, but if there is something there, I just  want to say to my Republican friends, if you are ready to vote for this  nominee without this complete information that we could have here to be  put to use in a positive way within 10 days from now, you pass up a big  opportunity.   We are in a sense, by voting on this nomination without this  information, flying blind. I am an old naval flight officer, 23 years  as a naval flight officer, retired Navy captain. In Southeast Asia, you  flew into monsoons and really bad weather sometimes. We never wanted to  fly blind. We always wanted to have a good weather forecast. We want to  avoid the places we ought to avoid. We wanted to fly at altitudes that  were safe. We wanted to use our radars to be able to find the pockets  to go through to be safe. We never wanted to fly blind.   If we basically, before we close up shop, vote for this nominee with  incomplete information, we are flying blind. It wasn't a very smart  thing to do in naval aviation, and it would not be a smart thing for us  to do here.   This is not a warning; this is just friendly advice from one  colleague to another: It is worth waiting an extra week to get this  information rather than voting today without it. Again, the words of  our Chaplain Barry Black always invoking us to ask for wisdom--I have  asked for it. The wisdom that I would impart to all of us today: Hit  the pause button. Get the information next week. Make our decision  then.   I yield back my time. Thanks so much.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.   The Senator from Wyoming.    Mr. President, I said repeatedly on this floor that I  take no joy in discord and disagreement. I am not one who is interested  in obstruction. I come from a little State like Senator Coons, where we  get along pretty well. We believe in the three Cs--communicate,  collaborate, compromise.   But you know what else gives me no joy? I get no joy from rising sea  levels from New England to Miami that threatens our way of life. It  threatens our way of life. I get no joy from fish advisories that keep  us from eating fish in every State in this country. I get no joy being  one of the States at the end of America's tailpipe, where we get all  this pollution from other States and end up with higher costs and worse  healthcare. I get no joy from the millions of kids who go to school  this week with their inhalers because they have asthma. I get no joy  from people who appear before us as nominees, take 1,000 questions for  the Record, and give us answers that in too many cases are evasive,  indirect, or incomplete. I get no joy from nominees who appear before  us who pledge to provide information requested by us responsibly,  including electronic media, and never give it to us, who fight for 2  years to make sure we never get it. I get no joy from those  circumstances.   Thomas Jefferson used to say: If the people know the truth, they will  not make a mistake. We are prepared to vote here with incomplete  information, without the kind of wisdom we could have and vote with if  we would wait 10 days--10 days. That is what it would cost. Is that a  long time? Ask Gina McCarthy. She waited 132 days to get a vote. If you  think 1,000 questions are too many to answer, ask Gina McCarthy. She  answered a lot more. Finally, the Republicans got their answers, and we  got our vote. She won and, I think, did an admirable job.    We need the truth. We are seeking the truth. I have no interest in  obstruction. I want the truth.   Vote no.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  [[Page S1400]]  congressional fellows in the office of Senator Tom Udall be granted  floor privileges for the remainder of the 115th Congress. Their names  are Emma Locatelli, Sean MacDougall, and Angela Tapia.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________
