 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5773) to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to  require Medicare prescription drug plans to establish drug management  programs for at-risk beneficiaries, require electronic prior  authorization for covered part D drugs, and to provide for other  program integrity measures under parts C and D of the Medicare program,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5773         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Preventing Addiction for       Susceptible Seniors Act of 2018'' or the ``PASS Act of       2018''.       SEC. 2. ELECTRONIC PRIOR AUTHORIZATION FOR COVERED PART D                     DRUGS.         (a) Inclusion in Electronic Prescription Program.--Section       1860D-4(e)(2) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-      104(e)(2)) is amended by adding at the end the following new       subparagraph:        ``(E) Electronic prior authorization.--        ``(i) In general.--Not later than January 1, 2021, the       program shall provide for the secure electronic transmission       of--         ``(I) a prior authorization request from the prescribing       health care professional for coverage of a covered part D       drug for a part D eligible individual enrolled in a part D       plan (as defined in section 1860D-23(a)(5)) to the PDP       sponsor or Medicare Advantage organization offering such       plan; and        ``(II) a response, in accordance with this subparagraph,       from such PDP sponsor or Medicare Advantage organization,       respectively, to such professional.         ``(ii) Electronic transmission.--         ``(I) Exclusions.--For purposes of this subparagraph, a       facsimile, a proprietary payer portal that does not meet       standards specified by the Secretary, or an electronic form       shall not be treated as an electronic transmission described       in clause (i).        ``(II) Standards.--In order to be treated, for purposes of       this subparagraph, as an electronic transmission described in       clause (i), such transmission shall comply with technical       standards adopted by the Secretary in consultation with the       National Council for Prescription Drug Programs, other       standard setting organizations determined appropriate by the       Secretary, and stakeholders including PDP sponsors, Medicare       Advantage organizations, health care professionals, and       health information technology software vendors.        ``(III) Application.--Notwithstanding any other provision       of law, for purposes of this subparagraph, the Secretary may       require the use of such standards adopted under subclause       (II) in lieu of any other applicable standards for an       electronic transmission described in clause (i) for a covered       part D drug for a part D eligible individual.''.         (b) Sense of Congress Regarding Electronic Prior       Authorization.--It is the sense of the Congress that--        (1) there should be increased use of electronic prior       authorizations for coverage of covered part D drugs for part       D eligible individuals enrolled in prescription drug plans       under part D of title XVIII of the Social Security Act and       MA-PD plans under part C of such title to reduce access       delays by resolving coverage issues before prescriptions for       such drugs are transmitted; and        (2) greater priority should be placed on increasing the       adoption of use of such electronic prior authorizations among       prescribers of such drugs, pharmacies, PDP sponsors, and       Medicare Advantage organizations.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 5773, currently under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I stand in strong support of H.R. 5773, a bipartisan  bill centered on curbing opioid overuse by increasing program integrity  efforts and increasing resources for beneficiaries to help ensure that  they are properly adhering to their prescribed pain medications.   My home State of Illinois is experiencing a notable increase in  opioid-related overdose deaths. According to the Illinois Department of  Public Health, there has been a 44.3 percent increase in drug overdoses  from 2013 to 2016. This staggering statistic is not limited to my  district alone. This crisis has affected all of our districts, and for  some, the four walls of our own homes.   For this reason, Congress is taking action today to continue our work  to deliver solutions to the opioid epidemic that is plaguing far too  many American families.   H.R. 5773, which I have introduced with my colleagues Representatives  Knight, Sewell, and Sinema, packages several previously introduced  bills.   Specifically, H.R. 5773 includes policies under my bill H.R. 5716,  the Commit to Opioid Medical Prescriber Accountability and Safety for  Seniors Act, otherwise known as the COMPASS Act, introduced with  Representative Larson, that ensures prescribers are notified of their  opioid prescribing patterns to help educate them on proper prescribing.   Second, the bill includes H.R. 4841, the Standardizing Electronic  Prior Authorization for Safe Prescribing Act, led by Representatives  Schweikert and Mike Thompson, to standardize electronic prior  authorization to reduce physician burden and ensure medically necessary  access to drugs, like opioids, that have dangerous side effects and  high risk of abuse.   And third, this bill contains policies from H.R. 5715, the  Strengthening Partnerships to Prevent Opioid Abuse Act, led by  Representatives Renacci and Sewell that will establish a portal to  better facilitate communication between plan sponsors and the Medicare  program to prevent opioid overuse and overprescribing.   And finally, the bill contains policies from H.R. 5684, the  Protecting Seniors from Opioid Abuse Act, championed by my colleagues  Mr. Kelly of Pennsylvania and Mr. Thompson of California, which expands  Medication Therapy Management services to those who are at risk of  opioid overuse.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to working with my colleagues to  advance policies like all the bills we have today that will further  prevent opioid overuse and overprescribing, and I reserve the balance  of my time.

Greg Walden,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Walden: I write to you regarding several       opioid bills the Committee on Ways and Means ordered       favorably reported to address the opioid epidemic. The       following bills were also referred to the Committee on Energy       and Commerce.        I ask that the Committee on Energy and Commerce waive       formal consideration of the following bills so that they may       proceed expeditiously to the House Floor:        H.R. 5774, Combatting Opioid Abuse for Care in Hospitals       (COACH) Act;        H.R. 5775, Providing Reliable Options for Patients and       Educations Resources (PROPER) Act;        H.R. 5776, Medicare and Opioid Safe Treatment (MOST) Act;        H.R. 5773, Preventing Addiction for Susceptible Seniors       (PASS) Act;        H.R. 5676, Stop Excessive Narcotics in our Retirement       (SENIOR) Communities Protection Act; and        H.R. 5723, Expanding Oversight of Opioid Prescribing and       Payment Act.        I acknowledge that by waiving formal consideration of the       bills, the Committee on Energy and Commerce is in no way       waiving its jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in       those provisions of the bills that fall within your Rule X       jurisdiction. I would support your effort to seek appointment       of an appropriate number of conferees on any House-Senate       conference involving this legislation.        I will include a copy of our letters in the Congressional       Record during consideration of this legislation on the House       floor.            Sincerely,                                                       Kevin Brady,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                       Washington, DC, June 8, 2018.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Brady: Thank you for your letter regarding       the following bills, which were also referred to the       Committee on Energy and Commerce:        H.R. 5774, Combatting Opioid Abuse for Care in Hospitals       (COACH) Act;        H.R. 5775, Providing Reliable Options for Patients and       Educations Resources (PROPER) Act;        H.R. 5776, Medicare and Opioid Safe Treatment (MOST) Act;        H.R. 5773, Preventing Addiction for Susceptible Seniors       (PASS) Act;        H.R. 5676, Stop Excessive Narcotics in our Retirement       (SENIOR) Communities Protection Act; and        H.R. 5723, Expanding Oversight of Opioid Prescribing and       Payment Act.        I wanted to notify you that the Committee will forgo action       on these bills so that they may proceed expeditiously to the       House floor.        I appreciate your acknowledgment that by forgoing formal       consideration of these bills, the Committee on Energy and       Commerce is in no way waiving its jurisdiction over the       subject matter contained in those provisions of the bills       that fall within its Rule X jurisdiction. I also appreciate       your offer to support the Committee's request for the       appointment of conferees in the event of a House-Senate       conference involving this legislation.        Thank you for your assistance on this matter.            Sincerely,                                                       Greg Walden,                                                          Chairman.     Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I have spent a lot of time, as I know we all have,  listening to my own constituency, the west and northwest suburbs of  Chicago. I have listened to physicians, police chiefs, educators,  caregivers, and others, and I have heard a common theme, and the common  theme is: We need legislation that encourages the use of alternative  treatments, that increases provider education and assists with  detection of those who are at risk. The Preventing Addiction for  Susceptible Seniors, PASS Act, will help do this.   I would like to thank my colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee  for working together in a bipartisan effort by recognizing this crisis  and coming together in offering this solution. I would also like to  thank our colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee for their  commitment to working on this, particularly my counterpart who chairs  the Health Subcommittee, Dr. Burgess, and Chairman Walden as well.   This bill was brought through the committee process in a bipartisan  fashion, and now, on the floor, I strongly urge my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to vote in favor of H.R. 5773, the PASS Act, to  prevent overuse and overprescribing in the Medicare program.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5676) to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to  authorize the suspension of payments by Medicare prescription drug  plans and MA-PD plans pending investigations of credible allegations of  fraud by pharmacies, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5676         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Stop Excessive Narcotics in       our Retirement Communities Protection Act of 2018'' or the       ``SENIOR Communities Protection Act of 2018''.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 5676, currently under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I stand today in strong support of H.R. 5676, a  bipartisan bill centered on protecting Medicare beneficiaries from  abusive opioid prescribing, while ensuring appropriate access to  medically necessary medications. This bill strikes a balance, which we  need.   H.R. 5676, introduced by our colleagues--Mr. MacArthur, Mr.  Blumenauer, Mr. Schweikert, Mr. Collins, Ms. Kuster, and Mr. Tonko-- extends an existing authority in the Medicare fee-for-service program  to Medicare Advantage and prescription drug plans.   According to a recent report released by the Department of Health and  Human Services' Office of Inspector General, one-third of Medicare part  D beneficiaries received an opioid prescription in 2016, costing the  program $4.1 billion and representing as many as 79.4 million  prescriptions. The report found that as many as half a million part D  beneficiaries received high amounts of opioids, with almost 70,000  receiving extreme amounts of opioids, many of them as a result of  doctor shopping.   For years, the Medicare fee-for-service program has been able to  suspend payments to a provider or a supplier pending an investigation  of a credible allegation of fraud against the provider or supplier.  Extending this authority to the Medicare Advantage and prescription  drug plans will help bridge the gap in the care of beneficiaries and  halt the fraudulent activity that contributes to the opioid crisis.   I would like to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle on the  Ways and Means Committee for their commitment to working cooperatively  on this, and also our colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee,  particularly Congressman Burgess, who chairs the Health Subcommittee,  and also Chairman Walden. They played a role in laying the groundwork  for policies like this that crack down on abusers.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to continuing to work on this issue on  both sides of the aisle and with the administration on policies that  will further strengthen the integrity of the Medicare program.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Ways and Means,                                       Washington, DC, June 8, 2018.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Walden: I write to you regarding several       opioid bills the Committee on Ways and Means ordered       favorably reported to address the opioid epidemic. The       following bills were also referred to the Committee on Energy       and Commerce.        I ask that the Committee on Energy and Commerce waive       formal consideration of the following bills so that they may       proceed expeditiously to the House Floor:        H.R. 5774, Combatting Opioid Abuse for Care in Hospitals       (COACH) Act;        H.R. 5775, Providing Reliable Options for Patients and       Educations Resources (PROPER) Act;        H.R. 5776, Medicare and Opioid Safe Treatment (MOST) Act;        H.R. 5773, Preventing Addition for Susceptible Seniors       (PASS) Act;        H.R. 5676, Stop Excessive Narcotics in our Retirement       (SENIOR) Communities Protection Act; and        H.R. 5723, Expanding Oversight of Opioid Prescribing and       Payment Act.        I acknowledge that by waiving formal consideration of the       bills, the Committee on Energy and Commerce is in no way       waiving its jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in       those provisions of the bills that fall within your Rule X       jurisdiction. I would support your effort to seek appointment       of an appropriate number of conferees on any House-Senate       conference involving this legislation.        I will include a copy of our letters in the Congressional       Record during consideration of this legislation on the House       floor.            Sincerely,                                                       Kevin Brady,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                       Washington, DC, June 8, 2018.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Brady: Thank you for your letter regarding       the following bills, which were also referred to the       Committee on Energy and Commerce:        H.R. 5774, Combatting Opioid Abuse for Care in Hospitals       (COACH) Act;        H.R. 5775, Providing Reliable Options for Patients and       Educations Resources (PROPER) Act;        H.R. 5776, Medicare and Opioid Safe Treatment (MOST) Act;        H.R. 5773, Preventing Addition for Susceptible Seniors       (PASS) Act;        H.R. 5676, Stop Excessive Narcotics in our Retirement       (SENIOR) Communities Protection Act; and        H.R. 5723, Expanding Oversight of Opioid Prescribing and       Payment Act.        I wanted to notify you that the Committee will forgo action       on these bills so that they may proceed expeditiously to the       House floor.        I appreciate your acknowledgment that by forgoing formal       consideration of these bills, the Committee on Energy and       Commerce is in no way waiving its jurisdiction over the       subject matter contained in those provisions of the bills       that fall within its Rule X jurisdiction. I also appreciate       your offer to support the Committee's request for the       appointment of conferees in the event of a House-Senate       conference involving this legislation.        Thank you for your assistance on this matter.            Sincerely,                                                       Greg Walden,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to go into a little bit more detail and  focus on how it is that we are here today and why there is an urgency  to this.   The gentlewoman just mentioned some staggering statistics: 9,000  pills per individual over a decade in a particular town. It tells you  that the system has gotten entirely out of balance.   There are a lot of explanations and there are not a lot of clean  hands:   We know that there have been government policies that have driven, in  part, the opioid crisis by evaluating providers on whether or not pain  satisfaction has been completed on the patient side of things;   We know that in some cases there have been healthcare providers that  have not gone into the detail of getting to the root of a problem;   We know that we, as a culture, put extraordinary pressure on  healthcare providers when we tell them we want them to help us get out  of pain; and when we do that, sometimes, Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, we  put ourselves at risk, and we know that pharma has a lot to answer for.   All of those things we know are true, and I think what is encouraging  to me is this idea of people coming together on both sides and  recognizing we don't have to live this way anymore. We don't have to  have a system that drives people in this direction.   Let me just go back to this inspector general report from the  Department of Health and Human Services that says that 79 million  prescriptions involving opioids were prescribed in 2016 alone. That is  a staggering number.   And I think that, if we are diligent, if we are forward thinking, and  if we continue to work together, both sides of the aisle coming  together, Mr. Speaker, I think that, in 10 years, our country will be  having a different conversation on opioids. It may take that long, but  I think, in 10 years' time, if we do the work, if we are committed to  this, we can look back and we can say: That was a time when the United  States came together around a public health crisis; that was a time  when people had a general understanding that they needed to get over  the normal approaches on things; and that was a time that people came  together with holistic approaches.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. MacArthur)    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from New Jersey.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, in a nutshell, I think the gentlewoman from  California put it well. What she was arguing was this bill strikes a  balance,  [[Page H5264]]  which it does. It is designed to focus our time, our attention, and our  energies on making sure that the bad actors are weeded out, that the  abuse is stopped, and that we can bring balance to the system.   The Stop Excessive Narcotics in Our Retirement Communities Protection  Act, or SENIOR Communities Protection Act, is another step in this  direction to protect our Nation's seniors. This bill was brought to the  floor through a bipartisan committee process, and I urge its passage.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5723) to require the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission to  report on opioid payment, adverse incentives, and data under the  Medicare program, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5723         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Expanding Oversight of       Opioid Prescribing and Payment Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. MEDICARE PAYMENT ADVISORY COMMISSION REPORT ON OPIOID                     PAYMENT, ADVERSE INCENTIVES, AND DATA UNDER THE                     MEDICARE PROGRAM.         Not later than March 15, 2019, the Medicare Payment       Advisory Commission shall submit to Congress a report on,       with respect to the Medicare program under title XVIII of the       Social Security Act, the following:        (1) A description of how the Medicare program pays for pain       management treatments (both opioid and non-opioid pain       management alternatives) in both inpatient and outpatient       hospital settings.        (2) The identification of incentives under the hospital       inpatient prospective payment system under section 1886 of       the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww) and incentives       under the hospital outpatient prospective payment system       under section 1833(t) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1395l(t)) for       prescribing opioids and incentives under each such system for       prescribing non-opioid treatments, and recommendations as the       Commission deems appropriate for addressing any of such       incentives that are adverse incentives.        (3) A description of how opioid use is tracked and       monitored through Medicare claims data and other mechanisms       and the identification of any areas in which further data and       methods are needed for improving data and understanding of       opioid use.       SEC. 3. NO ADDITIONAL FUNDS AUTHORIZED.         No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to       carry out the requirements of this Act. Such requirements       shall be carried out using amounts otherwise authorized to be       appropriated.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 5723, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5723, the Expanding  Oversight of Opioid Prescribing and Payment Act of 2018, sponsored by  my colleague, Representative Tenney, along with Representatives  McKinley and DelBene. H.R. 5723 is the result of work by Members and  staff on both sides of the aisle, and I am pleased to have taken part  in these important efforts to address the opioid epidemic.   This legislation responds to a crucial recommendation from the  Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the opioid crisis by  directing the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, or MedPAC, to  investigate financial incentives for prescribing opioids. These  incentives may discourage providers from prescribing evidence-based  nonopioid treatments for pain management that can reduce patients'  exposure to opioids and slow the epidemic.   The report will take a close look at these financial incentives,  while also examining the use of data to track and monitor opioid use to  more fully understand opioid utilization patterns in Medicare so that  we may cultivate better solutions to combat the epidemic itself. MedPAC  may also make recommendations to address perverse incentives in  Medicare's payment systems that may encourage opioid overprescribing.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to vote in favor of  H.R. 5723, the Expanding Oversight of Opioid Prescribing and Payment  Act of 2018.   Opioids took the lives of 42,000 Americans in 2016, and the issue  affects countless families in Illinois and in my congressional  district, and I know that is true all across the country. This  legislation brings us one step closer to providing our communities and  families with the tools necessary to combat the epidemic.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Ways and Means,                                       Washington, DC, June 8, 2018.      Hon.

Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Brady: Thank you for your letter regarding       the following bills, which were also referred to the       Committee on Energy and Commerce:        H.R. 5774, Combatting Opioid Abuse for Care in Hospitals       (COACH) Act;        H.R. 5775, Providing Reliable Options for Patients and       Educations Resources (PROPER) Act;        H.R. 5776, Medicare and Opioid Safe Treatment (MOST) Act;        H.R. 5773, Preventing Addition for Susceptible Seniors       (PASS) Act;        H.R. 5676, Stop Excessive Narcotics in our Retirement       (SENIOR) Communities Protection Act; and        H.R. 5723, Expanding Oversight of Opioid Prescribing and       Payment Act.

I also appreciate       your offer to support the Committee's request for the       appointment of conferees in the event of a  [[Page H5265]]       House-Senate conference involving this legislation.        Thank you for your assistance on this matter.            Sincerely,                                                       Greg Walden,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Ms. Tenney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I think Ms. Tenney's argument a minute ago is smart, it  is good policy, it is thoughtful, it is measured, and it is the  direction we should go.   In other words, if there are incentives that are misaligned, let's  understand those and let's absorb them and let's change them. It should  not be that there is a financial incentive to offer an opioid or for an  opioid to get into a system as opposed to a nonopioid alternative. So,  for sure, we need to study this. We need to have a clear understanding.   I would like to thank the Members on both sides of the aisle for the  work they did, as well as Chairman Brady for his leadership in moving  this through the Ways and Means Committee.   It is such an important time. With 115 deaths from opioid overdoses  every day, everyone knows that time is not our friend. There is an  urgency to this. We have to have a clear understanding of what is going  on. It is imperative that we identify current practices that prevent  the use of nonopioid treatments for pain management and that we reduce  financial incentives that have unintentionally led to  overprescriptions.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
