 Mr. Speaker, I rise to strongly condemn the March 4  chemical attacks conducted by the Kremlin in Salisbury, England,  against former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal and his  daughter Yulia. Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey, the first on the scene,  has also been hospitalized.   Mr. Speaker, Vladimir Putin continues to display a pattern of  interfering with and undermining the democratic processes and  institutions in contravention of the rules-based international order.  We have seen that in Russia's frequent disruptive cyber operations and  now chemical warfare.   How far will they push things?   Mr. Speaker, that is why I, along with Representatives Meeks, Wilson,  Cole, Holding, and Sires, introduced a resolution this afternoon  condemning this attack, calling for accountability for this and all  chemical and biological attacks and standing in firm partnership with  our friends and allies in the United Kingdom.   Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in cosponsoring this  important statement of solidarity in condemnation and also in praying  for the health of Sergei, Yulia, and Nick.                            ____________________
