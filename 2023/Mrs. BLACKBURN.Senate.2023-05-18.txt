 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today I rise to oppose the nomination  of Nancy Abudu as President Biden's nominee for appointment as a U.S.  circuit judge for the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals.   Now, in a government as divided as ours is at this time, we expect to  have some controversial nominees that come before us at the Judiciary  Committee. We expect debate; we do expect disagreement; but what we  should never expect or tolerate is a nominee who has proven herself  completely unfit for the role she is asking.   Ms. Abudu has shown us that there is no such thing as a good-faith  debate. She views disagreements over policy as evidence of bigotry. She  describes herself as a radical legal activist and has compared her  fellow Americans to Jim Crow-era racists and endorsed political  violence against conservatives.   She has stated that policing is--and I am going to quote her here-- the true threat to our collective safety. Hear me out on this. She has  said that policing is--and I quote her--the true threat to our  collective safety. She has embraced lawless sanctuary city policies and  compared our criminal justice system to the horrors of slavery. These  are her statements and her positions.   I would be doing a disservice to our Federal, State, and local law  enforcement officers if I didn't point out the rank hypocrisy of my  Democratic colleagues' attempt to force this nominee through during  National Police Week.   Now, as I said, she feels like policing is a threat to our collective  safety, but my Democratic colleagues, during this National Police Week,  are choosing to push her forward.   She used the significant power of her position within the Southern  Poverty Law Center to weaponize charges of hate against her political  opponents, all the while covering up blatant discrimination within her  organization.   Indeed, the Southern Poverty Law Center, every year, issues their  ``hate'' list. This should give everyone pause, but perhaps the most  egregious example of Ms. Abudu's hostility toward the rule of law  involves this very Chamber, those of us of each party who sit in this  Chamber.   In 2021, she engaged in a vicious mudslinging campaign in an attempt  to manipulate the U.S. Senate into abandoning the filibuster and  endorsing a radical overhaul of our Federal elections. Her campaign was  so full of misrepresentations--and we will just call them falsehoods-- that even some of the most progressive Members of her party balked at  what she was doing. This is the conduct that the Biden administration  is seeking to reward.   Justice is to be evenhanded; equal justice for all; one system of  justice, not two tiers of justice. We must not tolerate what is  happening here, and we must not approve this nominee.   We had a great discussion in the Judiciary Committee about people who  are unfit for the bench, unfit for public service, and the need to make  certain that people are fit for this service. Ms. Abudu, by her  actions, has proven herself to be unethical, unscrupulous, and  completely untethered from any acceptable philosophy of law.   To approve this nominee would be to rubberstamp a nominee who terms  herself a ``radical leftist activist.'' It would rubberstamp a radical  agenda. It would rubberstamp an activist judge. We don't want that on  our courts, and this is something the American people have rejected  repeatedly.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following articles be  printed in the Record following the conclusion of my remarks.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  Nancy Abudu, Another Concession to the Far Left and to One of Its Most                         Disreputable Organizations                       (By Carrie Campbell Severino)         President Biden's judicial gifts to dark-money groups do       not end with Ketanji Brown Jackson or other far-left nominees       he picked for lower courts. Eleventh Circuit nominee Nancy       Abudu made her career in the dark-money realm since 2005,       when she joined the American Civil Liberties Union. She       worked for several years for the group's Voting Rights       Project, leaving just as another future Biden nominee--Dale       Ho--became its director. From there, Abudu assumed the post       of legal director of the ACLU of Florida.        In 2019, after over a decade with the ACLU, Abudu joined       the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), a once admirable       group that in recent years has been mired in scandal and       recognized as a racket that betrays its stated principles--      not least by vilifying those it disagrees with as ``hate       groups.'' A number of liberals have acknowledged this, with       Nathan J. Robinson, founder of the left-wing Current Affairs,       calling the group's signature ``Hate Map'' an ``outright       fraud.''        Abudu is the group's director for strategic litigation. A       wide-ranging coalition of over 50 organizations and       individuals protested her nomination in a letter to Senate       Judiciary Committee Chairman Richard Durbin and Ranking       Member Chuck Grassley. They stated bluntly: ``Ms. Abudu works       for a disreputable organization that has no business being a       feeder for positions to any judicial office--not even of a       traffic court--let alone the second highest court system in       the United States. She is a political activist not a jurist       and is unfit to serve at the federal appellate level.''        The Family Research Council (FRC) circulated the letter.       They have good reason to have sounded the alarm. They know       the real danger of being labeled a ``hate group'' by the       SPLC. As their letter to Durbin and Grassley explains:        These destructive accusations have done real harm to many       people. In the first conviction under the post-9/11 District       of Columbia terrorism statute, the convicted terrorist was       shown to have been motivated by the SPLC's ``hate group''       designation and related identifying information.        In that case, SPLC materials facilitated a troubled young       man's delusional, and thankfully unsuccessful, plan to commit       mass murder. Using the SPLC ``hate map,'' this native of       northern Virginia targeted the Family Research Council (FRC)       and two other nearby groups in August 2012 for having beliefs       supporting traditional marriage. Fortunately, no one was       killed, although he did shoot and critically wound FRC's       unarmed building manager who subdued him while wounded.  [[Page S1730]]         To make matters worse, the SPLC's leadership--Abudu       included--apparently haven't learned their lesson. ``[O]ver       the past decade the SPLC has targeted an increasing number of       policy groups with whom it has policy disagreements. Any       group that disagrees with the SPLC about positions it       advocates is deemed to be evil and worthy of destruction,''       laments the coalition letter.        In addition to its inflammatory designations, the SPLC has       amassed a war chest to fund its left-wing activism totaling       $570 million as of October 2020. Its holdings are, to put it       mildly, highly unusual for an American non-profit company.       Among investments listed in its 2020 financial statements are       $162 million in non-U.S. equity funds, $23 million in       ``arbitrage funds,'' $89 million in private equity funds, and       $7 million in long-short funds. The coalition letter       observed, ``The SPLC looks more like a hedge fund than a       public interest legal and political activist group.''        Amy Sterling Casil, the CEO of the consulting firm Pacific       Human Capital, remarked regarding its transfer of millions of       dollars to foreign bank accounts that ``I've never known a       US-based nonprofit dealing in human rights or social services       to have any foreign bank accounts.'' She added, ``I know of       no legitimate reason for any US-based nonprofit to put money       in overseas, unregulated bank accounts'' and called the       SPLC's practice ``unethical.'' The watchdog group       CharityWatch gave the SPLC a grade of ``F.''        In addition to Abudu's shady professional associations, she       consistently has taken far-left positions in litigation.       Perhaps the most prominent were cases Abudu argued while at       the ACLU's Voting Rights Center, for example, making       unsuccessful challenges to felon voting provisions in       Mississippi, Arizona, and Tennessee. As legal director of the       ACLU of Florida, Abudu unsuccessfully challenged the state's       requirement that a felon's voting rights could be restored       only after all fines, fees, and restitution imposed as part       of the felon's sentence had been paid. The Eleventh Circuit,       sitting en banc, found no evidence to support Abudu's claim       of intentional racial discrimination. Undeterred, Abudu       joined several other groups to submit Florida's law to the       United Nations Committee on Human Rights for review of human       rights violations.        Since joining the SPLC, Abudu has maintained her ties with       the ACLU of Florida and continued her losing track record in       court with an unsuccessful Eighth Amendment claim against       Florida's Department of Corrections for not fully       accommodating a transgender inmate's ``social-transitioning''       requests.        The Biden administration and congressional Democrats       continue to make scurrilous allegations of suppression of       voting rights in Republican-led states, cherry-picking them       over Democrat-led states with more stringent election rules       and brazenly trying to weaponize the courts to do their       partisan bidding. And Biden's Department of Justice has       specifically targeted Georgia, where Abudu would sit if       confirmed, alleging the state's recent election law violated       the Voting Rights Act and engaged in racial discrimination.       If you believe a Judge Abudu would fairly evaluate Georgia's       voting integrity laws according to the rule of law rather       than her own agenda, I have a bridge to sell you.                                   ____                          [From AMAC, Feb. 15, 2023]                           Biden's Radical Judges                           (By Robert B. Charles)         Watch the flank! Sometimes an assault on vital interests       and values does not come head-on, but from an angle, on the       flank. We just saw the Chinese slip a balloon across the       continent, figurative knife between the ribs. Domestically,       the judiciary is a flank--but it matters. Biden and Democrat       Senate are loading the federal judiciary with leftists, and       it matters.        In the first year of his White House, Biden got the largest       number of Article III federal judges confirmed of any       president since Ronald Reagan. The difference is that many of       Biden's nominees aspire to concentration of federal power.        Broadly speaking, they tend to tip against traditional       understandings and caselaw tied to unfettered speech, free       exercise of religion, gun ownership, traditional       understandings of family, parental prerogatives, due process,       equal protection, and the 4th, 5th, and 6th amendments.        His recent nominees are often openly pro-abortion, no       apologies for opposing Dobbs, happy to be activists--as they       think that is what courts are for, correcting errors of the       Founders, Congress, strict constructionists, textualists, and       those who dare to think words have meaning.        While Trump got 234 federal judges appointed, that was       playing catchup after Obama's 329 judicial confirmations.       Now, continuing the leftist attack on our judiciary, Biden       has pressed increasingly radical judges--and one radical       justice--to the federal bench.        When a Supreme Court nominee considers is controversial to       publicly define a women, simply declines to do so, something       is wildly wrong with the process. Imagine Justices Sandra Day       O'Connor (appointed by Reagan) or Ruth Bader Ginsburg       (appointed by Clinton) not knowing what a women is.        Indeed, I think one can say--for very different reasons,       but with a basic understanding of and respect for biology--      O'Connor, Ginsburg, Reagan and Clinton ALL knew the       difference between men and women.        Now comes the latest rash of leftist nominees. After Biden       nominated 98 Article III judges in his first two years, 51       still awaiting confirmation, his left-lurching party now       controls the Senate, which is in charge of judicial       confirmations.        Beyond this, we face 10 vacancies on federal circuit       courts--a bench that manages all federal appeals short of the       Supreme Court, plus 75 US district court vacancies. An added       27 federal judicial vacancies will arise before end of       Biden's term (four appeals, 23 district).        The part that causes a shiver is not these numbers, but the       under- and un-qualified nature of those being nominated to       important judgeships. As one observer noted, this seems to be       Biden's means for ``paying back the left-wing dark money       groups who spent over a billion dollars to help elect him.''       He will get the Democrat-controlled Senate to sweep a raft of       leftists onto the courts.        Can he really do that? Yes and no. On the one hand, another       collection of unabashed leftists is about to be swept into       available openings, likely soon confirmed by the Democrat       Senate, most with a rich history of working with and for       leftist causes.        These include nominees proud to have worked on left-leaning       cases that pushed pro-abortion, antigun, anti-free speech,       and anti-conservative causes and cases. They include those       who championed radical positions advanced by Planned       Parenthood, gun control groups, and those working to punish       free speech and worship.        Last week two dozen nominees got through the Senate       Judiciary Committee, headed for floor votes. Among those to       watch are judges like Julie Rikelman, who was the       ``litigation director'' for the ``Center for Reproductive       Rights,'' headed for the First Circuit Court of Appeals. She       literally litigated against Dobbs, and lost.        Another to watch is Nancy Abudu, who was a litigation       director for the Southern Poverty Law Center--after time with       the ACLU. She is destined for the 11th Cir. Court of Appeals.        Even the typically quieter Republican National Lawyers       Association spoke against her which wrote that, ``Her views       goes beyond ... even progressive activists, and we see no       reason to believe that she will be an impartial judge on the       hot button' issue of election law.''        A reality check will lower the blood pressure a bit, as       these judges will not--in one fell swoop--tip the balance of       these circuits, but the idea that judges who are unable to be       impartial on such a basic issue as ``election law'' are being       nominated--and confirmed--is worrisome.        In the end, the core question is--what can be done, in an       age of polarized, often strangely off-the-mark thinking--to       protect the federal bench from becoming, over time,       radicalized?        The answer is a few important things. First, level-headed       Senators can put holds on some of these nominees, tabling       them for a time, if not indefinitely. This will also send a       signal. For votes needed to tip the Senate balance, possibly       on fossil fuels, law enforcement, support for Ukraine, and       illegal immigration limitation--the point can be made to       centrists like Joe Manchin: Radicals must be kept off the       federal bench.        In the event that radical appointees violate ethical norms       on the bench, impeachments can be initiated, driving home the       point that political activism is disallowed for federal       judges.        Additionally, hard-hitting hearings of nominees should be       the norm, with radical, non-judicial behaviors, statements,       and past actions forcing Senate Democrats to tough decisions.       While accountability is hard, the effort is worthy--and even       some Democrats may balk.        Last, all Americans need to think harder about the flanks.       As the Communist Chinese continue testing our national       security, the radical left tests our commitment to individual       liberty. Good judges are ``judicial'' in temperament, not       activist, not partisan, not political. Watch the flank!     I yield the floor.    Mr. President, this National Police Week, along with  my colleague Senator Hagerty, I would like to honor the unbelievably  courageous officers of the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department.   On March 27, a depraved individual attacked the Covenant School in  Nashville, TN, and took the lives of 9-year-old Evelyn Dieckhaus, 9- year-old Hallie Scruggs, 9-year-old William Kinney, substitute teacher  Cynthia Peak, custodian Mike Hill, and Dr. Katherine Koonce. Just  minutes after receiving the emergency call, a group of dedicated  officers arrived on the scene and immediately rushed toward the danger.  Their unflinching courage and decisive action under fire allowed them  to eliminate the threat against this gentle community just minutes  after it began and saved countless lives.   Violence against children and their caretakers is an act of  unspeakable evil that strikes at the heart of our purpose as parents,  grandparents, neighbors, brothers and sisters in Christ, and community  protectors. But even in the face of such tremendous loss, Nashvillians  find comfort in the knowledge that uncommonly brave men and women have  dedicated their lives to protecting us from harm. On behalf of all  Tennesseans, I thank Officer Rex Engelbert, Detective Mike  [[Page S1739]]  Collazo, Detective Zachary Plese, Detective Ryan Cagle, and Detective  Sergeant Jeffery Mathes for their incredible bravery on behalf of the  students and teachers at The Covenant School. They showed true  professionalism, courage, and selflessness--which is the very  definition of heroism. I also recognize and honor Chief John Drake for  his steady presence and clarity of mind on that terrible day.   During times of overwhelming fear and uncertainty, the people of the  Volunteer State look to their leaders not only for swift action but for  comfort and reassurance. The brave men and women in blue who put their  lives on the line every day to protect our communities deserve all the  admiration, gratitude, and support we can offer, and I am so honored to  represent them here in the U.S. Senate.
