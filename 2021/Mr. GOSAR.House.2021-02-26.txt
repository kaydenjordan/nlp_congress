 Mr. Speaker, my amendment would require us to know what we  are doing before we take the overwhelming radical step of withdrawing  more than a million acres of federal lands from mineral development.   It may come as a shock but even today we know little about the  geologic mineral makeup of our lands. Minerals that were very important  in the past like gold and silver are not always the key to our future  technologies.   Today, we are finding a whole new suite of minerals that are  critically important to our future, while rare earths and lithium are  the stars, important minerals like cobalt, manganese and copper are  quickly becoming equally both important and challenging to find and  produce.   However, this bill in front of us has no recognition of the  importance of the breadth of minerals that may be included in the areas  covered by this legislation. Which is why my amendment is so important  today.   This amendment will require the Secretary of the Interior to conduct  a full mineral resource survey of the withdrawal areas prior to  enacting this withdrawal. This is important because of the national  security impacts of this proposed withdrawal that seeks to permanently  ban oil, natural gas, geothermal, uranium and other critical minerals  and rare earths on over a million acres of land in Arizona,   I will continue to make the case that the importance of the uranium  alone is key for keeping these lands open, however I believe that  without this amendment this bill will have a negative impact on our  national security as it aims to permanently prohibit mining of rare  earths and critical minerals on a massive, massive swath of land.   Earlier I mentioned the importance of lithium and there is no  question that lithium is critically important to our technology and  energy future. However, we don't often know where all the lithium  resources are in the United States. For example, in September of last  year, the USGS funded an earth MRI program in Arizona to study the  lithium resources of the Big Sandy Valley in Arizona. I include in the  Record the press release from USGS.   This study will help us to define and understand the lithium  resources in this region. Yet it is important for us to reflect on the  fact that we didn't know about these resources until recently, had we  closed off this area, like this bill proposes to do to more than one  million acres of Arizona, we may have never known. Yet because we have  the ability to examine this area, which is not subject to a withdrawal,  we are going to study and hopefully find rich resources we can produce  to secure our nation's future.   Before I close Mr. Speaker, let me stress, the underlying bill  represents one of the largest legislative land grabs ever considered by  Congress. This effort to permanently lock away the highest grade and  largest deposit of uranium in the country will further increase our  reliance on foreign adversaries like Russia, China, Kazakhstan and  Uzbekistan.   Instead of rushing headlong into the endeavor of permanently making  this million acre area off limits, we should know what the true impacts  of this legislation will be on the long-term national security of our  country.   This amendment would not kill this legislation, instead it would  ensure that the proposed withdrawal can only go ahead once we clearly  access the region, clearly understand the picture of what we are  withdrawing and what other resources may be impacted by this action.   I say to my colleagues, lets slow down this process so we know what  we are doing, what we are impacting and the real impacts of making such  a large and bountiful parcel of land off limits could have on our  mineral security.   I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.           Earth MRI Funds Critical Minerals Projects in Arizona                              [Sept. 28, 2020]   A total of $133,016 will fund new research and preserve important data                       across the Grand Canyon State         Flagstaff, Ariz.--The U.S. Geological Survey and the       Association of American State Geologists are pleased to       announce $133,016 in funding for critical minerals projects       in Arizona. These funds are for the fiscal year 2020 under       the USGS Mineral Resources Program's Earth Mapping Resources       Initiative, or Earth MRI.        The funds include grants to the Arizona Geological Survey       for geologic mapping and geochemical analyses for an area of       the Big Sandy Valley with a focus on lithium and to preserve       and publicly available information on critical mineral       resources.        ``These new projects in Arizona represent the next step in       our ambitious effort to improve our knowledge of the geologic       framework in the United States and to identify areas that may       have the potential to contain undiscovered critical mineral       resources,'' said Jim Reilly, director of the USGS. ``The       identification and prioritization of prospective areas were       done through our strong partnership with the state geological       surveys in a series of workshops in Fall 2019.''        ``This program will revitalize and update the science and       geologic research and data compilation that is needed in many       states for the United States to identify new geologic       associations,'' said John Yellich, director of the Michigan       Geological Survey and president of AASG.        ``The Earth MRI effort is an outgrowth of the strong       partnership between the AASG members and the USGS,'' said       Warren Day, Earth MRI lead scientist for the USGS. ``The USGS       is grateful for the scientific input and support from the       state geological surveys, resulting in a robust body of       information useful for many applications beyond mineral       resources.''        The geologic mapping efforts, which are managed through the       National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program, will refine       our scientific understanding of the geologic framework of       areas of interest. In addition to helping identify mineral       potential, these maps also support decisions about use of       land, water, energy and minerals and help to mitigate the       impact of geologic hazards on communities.        In 2017, President Trump issued Executive Order 13817, a       Federal Strategy to Ensure Secure and Reliable Supplies of       Critical Minerals. This executive order called on agencies       across the federal government to develop a strategy to reduce       the nation's susceptibility to critical mineral supply       disruptions.        In May of 2018, DOI released a list of 35 minerals deemed       critical to the U.S. economy and security, based on a       methodology by the USGS. This list forms the foundation of       the full federal strategy.    Mr. Speaker, my amendment is very simple, it only asks  Congress to do one thing, respect the will of the local people in the  management of our lands.   This amendment would remove from the bill the lands included in my  Congressional district from the massive mineral withdrawal included in  the bill. My local constituents and counties support this amendment and  I encourage my colleagues to respect our wishes. Under general leave, I  include in the Record a letter from Mohave County opposing this  legislation.   Mohave County Arizona, which is the primary area which this amendment  would help protect, is currently facing nearly 10 percent unemployment  and has a per capita income of less than thirty-five thousand dollars a  year. These economic conditions should be proof enough that we need to  be promoting economic development in these regions, not simply closing  off an important path to economic security for the people of Mohave  County.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle will argue that these  lands belong to all the American people, which is true, but we must  respect the local concerns.   When I highlight that offshore oil drilling in California would  reduce our dependence on foreign oil, stop us from subsidizing Russia  and Saudi Arabia, my colleagues from California scream out ``respect  our wishes, we don't want drilling''.   So I call on them here today, join me in supporting my constituents  who are crying out for the chance, just the chance to keep the  potential of high paying jobs open and support this amendment.   It may come as a shock but even today we know little about the  geologic mineral makeup of our lands. Minerals that were very important  in the past like gold and silver are not always the key to our future  technologies.   Today, we are finding a whole new suite of minerals that are  critically important to our future, while rare earths and lithium are  the stars, important minerals like cobalt, manganese and copper are  quickly becoming equally both important and challenging to find and  produce.   This area in Mohave County has tremendous potential and keeping that  potential open and available to the people of the county is critical to  ensuring a rich economic future.  [[Page H757]]    This amendment only removes the area within my district, it will  allow other members to do with their regions as they will.   This amendment would not kill this legislation, instead it would  ensure that the people I represent in Arizona have their wishes  respected and the land managed in a manner consistent with the will of  the local communities.   I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.                                                      Mohave County                                            Board of Supervisors,                                                  February 24, 2021.      Hon. Paul Gosar,      U.S. Congress,      Washington, DC.        Congressman Gosar: The Mohave County Board of Supervisors       is writing to offer our support for your amendment to H.R.       803--Colorado Wilderness Act of 2021. As you know, the       passage of this legislation will have a grave effect on       Mohave County, Arizona, and our neighboring counties in Utah.       Uranium mining in the past has been the forefront of our       economic growth in Mohave County and if allowed to continue       will bring in nearly $29 billion to our local economy over a       42 year period. The passage of H.R. 803 would make permanent       a July 2012 moratorium on uranium mining in our area. The       language of your amendment would help alleviate the permanent       economic loss we would sustain under the passage of H.R. 803.       We strongly support the passing of this amendment as       presented in the Rules Committee and the House or       Representatives. Without this amendment, the financial       stability of our economy in Mohave County would drastically       suffer.        In 2012, the Secretary of the Interior imposed a 20 year       ban on over 1 million acres of land in the Arizona Strip Area       for the purpose of Uranium mining. This ban included both       public lands and National Forest System lands. This ban took       away much needed growth and jobs from our area. Secretary       Salazar at the time issued this withdrawal without complying       with the law requiring coordination with local governments.       The Federal Land Policy Management Act, USC Section 171       requires that the Secretary and his designees ``coordinate''       with local government as to development and implementation of       any plan or management action. Coordination is defined in the       Act as requiring prior notice of proposed plans and actions       to the local government officials (``prior'' meaning prior to       public announcements, and early enough to provide       ``meaningful'' participation by the local officials in the       ``development'' of the plan or action.). The congressional       mandate of coordination also requires the Secretary to use       all practicable means to reach consistency between the       federal plan/management action and local policy, plan or law.       All of which Secretary Salazar did not do.        Making this ban permanent based on misinformation will have       lasting effects on Mohave County. We respect and take a       responsibility for protecting the Grand Canyon, but saying       that the Grand Canyon will suffer because of mining is       inaccurate. Secretary Salazar's reasoning behind the       withdrawal was out of concern that it could damage the       region's drinking water and the park's water quality. Bureau       of Land Management officials contradicted those claims by       explaining that their Arizona Strip field office had no       evidence of contamination of water, and had no evidence of       problems with the safe operation of the uranium mines in       operation on the lands.        Uranium mining is important and useful for many reasons.       The lands in the ``Strip'' contain the nation's high grade       uranium deposits and enough uranium to provide power       generation for the state of California for over 20 years.       Uranium is useful in many ways. It is used by our military       for national security and defense. Uranium metal is very       dense and heavy. When it is depleted (DU), uranium is used by       the military as shielding to protect Army tanks, and also in       parts of bullets and missiles. The military also uses       enriched uranium to power nuclear propelled Navy ships and       submarines, and in nuclear weapons. A permanent withdrawal of       uranium mining from the ``Strip'' harms the American people       by removing between 326-375 million lbs (the equivalent       electricity generating capacity for the entire state of       California's 40 million people for 22.4 years) of uranium.        From a national security standpoint, domestic utilities now       import 90 percent of the uranium used to operate America's       104 nuclear reactors. Thirty years ago, these reactors used       U.S. mined uranium for 100 percent of electricity production,       The nation cannot be pro-nuclear and anti-nuclear fuel. In       sum, these deposits represent the last available use of our       public lands for economic growth in our region.        The opponents of uranium mining have chosen to ignore the       fact that mining with environmentally sound reclamation was       conducted from the early 1980s until the price of uranium       collapsed in 1993. No mining at all occurred from 1993 until       2010, and the Denison mine which is now operating, is       following and often exceeding all environmental and safety       laws.        Arizona needs to go back to the roots that led to Arizona       being developed, and that is mining. The strict federal and       state environmental laws already on the books will protect       the public from environmental damage to the Grand Canyon       watershed. The mining of uranium however does not affect       ground water nor destroy the natural resources of the land.       It does not require open pit mining. Upon completion of       mining one Breccia Pipe (4 years) the land is placed back       into its native state.        We want to thank you for putting forward this amendment.       Nuclear energy can be the future of clean energy. We have the       resources in this Country to ensure that happens and we have       the technology and means to ensure mining that energy is both       environmentally safe and protects our natural resources. We       stand in support of the amendment.            Sincerely,                                                 Buster Johnson,                                             Chairman, Mohave County                                              Board of Supervisors.
