 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for that  great introduction.   Mr. Speaker, China is attempting to weaken our country in any way  possible. The interference and aggression coming from the Chinese  Communist Party pose a significant threat to our families, businesses,  and country. The CCP's track record of abusing our financial system is  jeopardizing our national and economic security.   H.R. 1156, the China Financial Threat Mitigation Act, requires the  Department of the Treasury to report on the risks coming from the  Chinese financial sector, along with recommendations on strengthening  international cooperation to monitor and mitigate these risks.   Our top priority should always be to protect our Western values and  promote the greatest country in the world and the interests of the  United States.   My bill is a critical step in holding the CCP accountable for their  continued abuse of the financial sector.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this important  piece of legislation. In God We Trust.  [[Page H2472]]
