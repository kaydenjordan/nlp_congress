 Mr. Speaker, next week, we will kick  off the holiday season with Thanksgiving and reflect on all that we are  thankful for in our lives. It also marks the start of the very busy  holiday shopping season.   In an effort to support local shops that make our communities strong,  Small Business Saturday takes place on the Saturday after Thanksgiving  to encourage people to shop small and bring more holiday shopping to  small businesses. On this day, we celebrate and support small  businesses and all that they do for our local communities.   There are more than 30 million small businesses in the United States  that have created 8.4 million jobs in the last two decades.   Mr. Speaker, small, locally owned businesses employ our neighbors and  contribute to the fabric of our local communities.   The Shop Small movement truly is about supporting our mom-and-pop  shops. Whether it is a cup of coffee from a local spot or a unique gift  for a loved one, everyone has an opportunity to join in and support  independent business owners on Small Business Saturday.                            ____________________
