 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise to speak about Bennet-Hoeven  amendment 2548.   Our amendment would formally establish the Joint Chiefs Program at  USDA. I know a lot of people haven't heard of this initiative, but it  is really, really important.   As I have said on this floor before, in Western States like Colorado  and North Dakota, our forests and our grasslands are as important to  our economy as the Lincoln Tunnel or the Brooklyn Bridge are to New  York, but they haven't received nearly enough investment over the  years. The result is that we have people on the ground across the West  who are working with incredibly constrained resources. But, despite  their best effort, there is a lot of important work to maintain the  health of our forests and grasslands that they are unable to do. The  consequences of this have been terrible in the West.   In Colorado, we had the three largest wildfires in our history last  year. The fires were still burning when the snow fell, for the first  time. That has never happened in anyone's memory.   As we consider this infrastructure bill tonight, one of the major  east-west corridors in America is closed because of mudslides that  poured down the burn scar from the wildfires last year. Now I-70 may be  closed for weeks.   We need to deal with this on the front end, and that is why the Joint  Chiefs Program matters. At USDA, the Forest Service works mostly on  public lands, while the Natural Resources Conservation Service supports  efforts on private lands. Joint Chiefs allows them to work in a  collaborative way.   I thank Senator Hoeven for his support, and I hope we will vote for  this on voice vote.
