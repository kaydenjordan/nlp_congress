 Madam President, when Jane Harman left Congress in 2011  to head the Woodrow Wilson Center for International Scholars, she  described herself as dedicated to the belief that the political center  is where most Americans are and where the best policy answers are  found. As this great leader and my dear friend steps down from the  Wilson Center, I take this opportunity to thank her for unswerving  devotion to that principle.   Our friendship was forged in the challenging days after the terrorist  attacks of September 11, 2001. Reaching across the aisle, we worked  closely together as leaders of the Homeland Security committees in the  House and Senate. From the landmark intelligence reform legislation we  crafted, to addressing protections for our Nation's cargo ports and  other critical infrastructure, to improving emergency preparedness in  communities throughout America, Jane was always an informed, effective,  and committed partner.   I will never forget how, when Jane testified at a Senate Homeland  Security Committee hearing on maritime security in 2006, she called me  her ``Security Sister.'' It is a title that fills my heart with pride  and affection.   Jane's untiring work to protect our Nation defines her public  service. Elected nine times by the people of California's 36th  Congressional District, she served on all major security committees-- Homeland Security, Intelligence, and Armed Services. She served as  ranking member of the Intelligence Committee's Working Group on  Terrorism and Homeland Security and chaired the Homeland Security  Subcommittee on Intelligence, Information Sharing, and Terrorism Risk  Assessment.   After Jane left Congress, she served as a member of the Director of  National Intelligence's Senior Advisory Group. She currently serves on  the Executive Committee of the Trilateral Commission and the Advisory  Board of the Munich Security Conference. She also cochairs the Homeland  Security Experts Group and is a member of the Presidential Debates  Commission and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.   Jane has been recognized as a national expert at the nexus of  security and public policy issues with the Defense Department Medal for  Distinguished Service, the CIA Agency Seal Medal and Director's Award,  and the Director of National Intelligence Distinguished Public Service  Medal. The University of Southern California's Presidential Medallion,  its highest award, is a fitting tribute to her outstanding service to  her State and to our Nation.   Jane is the first woman to lead the Wilson Center. Chartered by  Congress in 1968, the center is the Nation's key nonpartisan policy  forum for tackling global issues through independent research and open  dialogue. Under her leadership, the center advanced its mission to  generate actionable ideas for policies that affect our security and our  relations with the world.   No tribute to Jane would be complete without mention of her late  husband, Sidney. Driven by a shared ideal of public service, they  accomplished so much in politics, business, philanthropy, and the arts.   I thank Jane Harman--my colleague, my friend, my ``sister''--for all  that she has done for our country. I wish her all the best in her  future endeavors                            ____________________
