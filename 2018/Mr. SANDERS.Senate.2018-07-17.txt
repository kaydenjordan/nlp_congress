 Mr. President, at the Helsinki summit yesterday,  President Trump embarrassed our country, undermined American values,  and openly sided with Russia's authoritarian leader Vladimir Putin  against the U.S. intelligence community's unanimous assessment that  Russia interfered in our 2016 Presidential election. John McCain is  right when he says it was ``one of the most disgraceful performances by  an American president in memory. The damage inflicted by President  Trump's naivete, egotism, false equivalence, and sympathy for autocrats  is difficult to calculate. But it is clear that the summit in Helsinki  was a tragic mistake.''   That is not Bernie Sanders. That is former Republican Presidential  candidate Senator John McCain of Arizona.   Today, after a strong international backlash, Trump, in a bizarre  statement, claimed he misspoke and of course blamed the media for  reporting what he said. Even now he could not help but suggest that the  electoral interference ``could be other people also,'' not just Russia.   Today, we face an unprecedented situation of a President who, for  whatever reason, refuses to acknowledge an attack on American  democracy. Either he really doesn't understand what has happened or he  is under Russian influence because of compromising information they may  have on him or because he is ultimately more sympathetic to Russia's  authoritarian-oligarchic form of society than he is to American  democracy. Whatever the reason, Congress must act, and must act now, to  demand that the President of the United States represent the interests  of the American people and not Russia.   Let us be clear. Russia has been meddling not only in U.S. elections  but in the elections of other democracies--the United Kingdom, France,  Germany, to name just a few. Russia's goal is to advance its own  interests by weakening the transatlantic alliance of democracies that  arose after World War II, while also inflaming internal divisions in  each of these countries.   We should also be clear that this interference is directed from the  very highest levels of the Russian Government. Last week, Special  Counsel Robert Mueller announced a set of indictments of 12 members of  Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU. There can be no doubt  that given the nature of the Russian Government, Vladimir Putin was  directly involved in this effort, but our concern is not only what has  already happened, it is what could happen in the future.   Last week, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, a former  Republican Senator, raised the alarm on growing cyber attack threats  against the United States in a range of areas, including Federal,  State, and local government agencies, the military, business, and  academia, saying the situation is at a ``critical point.'' He said:         [Russia is the] most aggressive foreign actor, no question.       And they continue their efforts to undermine our democracy.    Coats compared the warning signs to those the United States faced  ahead of the September 11th terrorist attacks. This is a clear and  present threat to our democratic system and those of our allies.  Ultimately, of course, we want a  [[Page S5007]]  peaceful relationship with Russia. We do not want a return to the Cold  War, and we surely do not seek conflict, but at the same time, we must  be very clear that we oppose what Putin is doing, both in terms of his  foreign policy and his domestic policy.   On foreign policy, we will not accept Russian meddling in the  elections of democratic countries, stoking political tensions by  promoting hatred and suspicion of immigrants and minorities and trying  to undermine longstanding alliances between democratic allies.   In 2014, in violation of international law, Russia invaded  neighboring Ukraine and annexed the Crimea region. Russia has  assassinated political opponents abroad, most recently through the use  of poison in Salisbury, England, on a former spy and his daughter, a  chemical attack that endangered the lives of many civilians. The  British Government concluded that this atrocious attack was likely  carried out by Russia's military intelligence service.   Domestically, Putin has undermined democracy in Russia, crushing free  speech, jailing political opponents, harassing and assassinating  journalists who criticize him, and increasing persecution of ethnic and  religious minorities and the LGBT community. President Trump had an  opportunity to speak out on all of these issues, to confront Putin  about these destabilizing and inhumane policies, but he chose not to.  If the President of the United States is not going to do it, Congress  must.   The Congress must make it clear that we accept the assessment of our  intelligence community with regard to Russia's election meddling in our  country and in other democracies. The Congress must move aggressively  to protect our election systems from interference by Russia or any  foreign power and work closely with our democratic partners around the  world to do the same. The Congress must demand that the sanctions  against Russia that were passed last year be fully implemented. The  Congress must make it clear that we will not accept any interference  with the ongoing investigation of Special Counsel Mueller, such as the  offer of preemptive pardons or the firing of Deputy Attorney General  Rod Rosenstein, and that the President must cooperate with this  investigation.   Finally, the Congress must make it clear to President Trump that his  job is to protect the values that millions of Americans struggled for  and died to defend--the values of democracy, justice, and equality.   Tweets, comments, and press conferences are fine, but we need more  from Republican Senators now. It is time for the Senate to rein in the  President's dangerous behavior. If their leadership will not allow  votes on dealing with this extraordinarily important matter, then my  Republican colleagues must join with Democrats to make it happen, or  all of their words are worthless.   I yield the floor.
