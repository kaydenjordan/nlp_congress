 Mr. Speaker, last year marked the 75th anniversary of  India's independence. The growing importance of the relationship  between India and the United States cannot be overstated.   Our shared commitment to democracy and economic freedom serves to  build peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region and challenge an  increasingly aggressive China.   Robust cultural, educational, and professional programs play a key  role in strengthening our partnership in science, technology,  education, medicine, cybersecurity, civil nuclear energy, and so much  more.   Americans of Indian descent are an important part of the fabric of  American life, including friends like Mike Shaw, who immigrated decades  ago with less than $100 in his pocket. Today, Mike is a very successful  entrepreneur who has created a strong business and thousands of jobs.   This is a relationship to be celebrated as we welcome India's Prime  Minister to Washington, D.C., next week.                            ____________________
