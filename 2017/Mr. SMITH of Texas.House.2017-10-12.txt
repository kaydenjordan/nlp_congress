 Mr. Speaker, a recent Washington Post/ABC News  poll professed to find that a majority of Americans supported amnesty  for illegal immigrants. That is not hard to do, given how the survey  was conducted.   The polsters asked to speak only with the youngest adult at home;  over-sampled Democrats by at least 4 percent; used the word  ``undocumented'' rather than ``illegal;'' questioned illegal  immigrants, at least 3 percent of the population; and conditioned  amnesty on requirements that can't be met.   Other than that, I am sure it was an accurate poll.   Beware of polls done by liberal media organizations that have an  agenda of their own. The American people may not be getting the facts.  They deserve better.                            ____________________
