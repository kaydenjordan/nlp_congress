 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this rule and the  underlying bill. The Make America Secure Appropriations Act is all  about protecting the American people and securing our homeland.   Unfortunately, years of underfunding have severely hurt our military.  With this bill, we can make real progress towards rebuilding the  military and adding more troops, sailors, airmen, and marines to the  force.   Building on our pledge to boost the Navy to a 355-ship fleet, the  bill funds 11 new ships. Included in this are three littoral combat  ships, of which the Independence class vessel is built by a fantastic  workforce in southwest Alabama.   Having state-of-the-art facilities and resources is vital to the  success of our military. To help repair dilapidated and aging military  infrastructure, the bill provides a 25 percent increase in military  construction funding.   Supporting our servicemembers and their families is also a high  priority of this bill, as it provides for the largest military pay  raise in 8 years.   That is not all it does. It also provides for our Nation's veterans,  the very people who devoted their lives to protecting our country and  the values we hold so dear. This bill provides the highest level of  funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs in our Nation's history.  This will help cut down on the claims backlog and move forward with a  new electronic medical health records system.   I am also pleased that this bill will allow us to begin increasing  our Nation's border security in an effort to keep bad actors out of our  country. The American people sent a strong message last November that  they wanted a wall securing our southern border. This bill will begin  this process by providing over $1.5 billion requested by President  Trump for physical barrier construction along the southern border.   Mr. Speaker, over this last weekend a lot of people in America went  to see a movie called ``Dunkirk'' about the evacuation of over 300,000  British and French troops back over to England. Prime Minister Winston  Churchill had only been in office a couple of weeks at that point in  time, but he had predicted for years before that in speeches before the  House of Commons that that day was coming, and they took his speeches  and they put them together in a book called, ``While England Slept.''  With this bill, we are sending a strong message to the world that  America is not asleep.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me just remind my colleagues here that we are debating the rule,  and this is about process.   The gentleman from Oklahoma earlier talked about waivers and that the  Lee AUMF language would be subject to a point of order. Well, the  language that my Republican friends replaced the Lee amendment with is  protected by a waiver of all points of order because it was also  legislating on an appropriations bill. As I pointed out last night in  the Rules Committee, you made in order amendment No. 19 by Mr.  Griffith, which violates section 306 of the Congressional Budget Act,  and you provided a waiver for that.   My Republican friends routinely grant waivers in bills that come  before the Rules Committee. The problem is that the waivers are only  granted for your amendments and never for our amendments, and that is  just not fair and that is not right.   So if your policy is going to be we are going to grant no waivers,  then it ought to apply not just to Democrats; it ought to apply to  Republicans, too. But there is this double standard here, and voices  that you disagree with always seem to end up being cut off.   So, Mr. Speaker, I just point that out because this process and the  reason why so many of us are angry about this process is it is so  blatantly unfair.   The gentleman from Alabama talked about how we all want to commit to  upholding the national security of this Nation. I agree with him, but I  would say we are not doing our jobs if this floor is not a place where  we can have a free-flowing debate, where Members can offer different  ideas and be able to have a vote on them. I would just say, with all  due respect to my Republican colleagues, you do not have a monopoly on  all good ideas.                                time  1300    You know, we have a couple of good ideas, too, and maybe some of your  Members agree with that as well.   The other thing we are going to object to is, again, the way my  Republican friends self-execute controversial measures like this border  wall at $1.6 billion, basically denying an up-or-down vote. Maybe it is  to protect your Members in swing districts; I have no idea. Maybe you  don't think you have the votes to do it. But if you don't have the  votes to do it, it ought not to be in this bill. That is just, to me, a  sound way to approach legislating. All the normal rules seem to be  thrown out the window here.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms.  [[Page H6317]]  McCollum), the distinguished ranking member of the Appropriations  Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong opposition to the Make  America Secure Appropriations Act, 2018.   Mr. Speaker, we are in a constrained fiscal environment, and we need  to make smart choices about the future of our country. I am  disappointed to see that many of the choices that the Republican  leaders have made in this bill are completely out of balance with the  needs of the American people.   Republicans have chosen to exclude eight of the appropriations bills  from this legislation: funding for roads and bridges to drive on,  quality healthcare for our family, protecting our clean air and our  drinking water, and the education of future generations. These critical  investments that all Americans depend upon are left by the wayside with  no path forward.   Republicans have chosen to put forward a bill that exceeds the  defense caps by $72 billion. With no budget agreement in sight, this  bill would trigger sequestration cuts that our military leaders have  warned us would have catastrophic consequences for our men and women in  uniform.   Republicans have also once again declined to make commonsense cuts to  defense spending by denying the Pentagon's request for a new BRAC  round. Make no mistake: this will waste billions of dollars over the  next decade.   At a time when countries like China are emphasizing research and  investments in clean energy, Republicans have chosen to eliminate  funding for ARPA-E, doing great harm--great harm--to America's global  competitiveness in advanced research energy.   Mr. Speaker, these choices are simply unacceptable to my constituents  and to the American people, and I urge my Republican colleagues to work  with Democrats to put forward appropriate funding bills that will  advance the appropriations bills for all of America and to make America  the strong country it should be.
