Mr. President, I rise today to speak in strong support of  the bipartisan Budget Act which will hopefully pass later today.   This bill, as the name implies, is the result of rigorous,  bipartisan, and bicameral negotiations. I am pleased to have played a  part in this endeavor, and I am gratified to note that in addition to  keeping the government open and providing much needed resources for our  troops, the bill before us addresses a number of longstanding  priorities of the Senate Finance Committee, including many that I have  personally been working toward for years now. Indeed, this legislation,  once passed and signed into law, will be the combination of years of  work put in by members of the Finance Committee on both sides of the  aisle.   I want to take some time to say a few words about some of the  bipartisan victories that will be achieved through this legislation. I  should warn my colleagues that this will take a few minutes because  there are quite a few provisions to discuss.   For starters, let's talk about healthcare. Among the more prominent  victories in this bill is an extension of the Children's Health  Insurance Program for an additional 4 years. As we all know, last month  Congress passed a historic 6-year CHIP extension, which was eventually  signed into law. The bill before us would add another 4 years on top of  that 6-year provision, providing a total extension of 10 years--10  years. That is remarkable. I have a long history with the CHIP program.  I was the original author of the program, and I have always been an  outspoken champion of it.   We have had some back-and-forth here in the Senate about CHIP in  recent months, and some of it has gotten pretty fierce. However, today  the Senate will pass legislation--bipartisan legislation--to provide  unprecedented security and certainty for the families who depend on  CHIP and the State governments that need more predictability to map out  their own expenditures.   I am sure my friend, former Senator Kennedy, is up there watching. I  am very happy he came on this bill in the early stages and helped to  put it through.   In addition to the CHIP extension, the budget bill includes a  bipartisan Finance Committee bill entitled the ``Creating High-Quality  Results and Outcomes Necessary to Improve Chronic Care Act of 2017''--a  fairly long title. Senator Wyden, the Finance Committee's ranking  member, and I have been working for years on this legislation, which,  once enacted, will improve health outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries  living with chronic conditions. It will also help bring down Medicare  costs and streamline care coordination services.   We have been working with our colleagues, stakeholders, and advocates  for quite some time. We moved the bill through the committee last year,  and the Senate actually passed it once already without a single vote in  opposition. This legislation will finally get the CHRONIC Care Act to  the President's desk.   I thank Senator Wyden for the time and effort he has put into this  action. I also thank our other colleagues on the Finance Committee,  particularly Senators Isakson and Warner, who joined us on a working  group to develop this important legislation and move it forward. This  bill, as promised, will relieve a great deal of suffering for Medicare  beneficiaries and will do so in a fiscally responsible manner.   The budget bill also contains a package of bipartisan provisions that  have come to be known as Medicare and health extenders. These  provisions are high priorities for a number of our Members throughout  the Senate, and I am very pleased we were able to include them in the  final package of the spending bill.   While these are all important, I would like to highlight that there  are a few provisions we were able to permanently resolve and not just  extend. One such provision will repeal a flawed limit on the amount  Medicare would pay for outpatient physical and other therapy that  threatened access for some of the most vulnerable patients. I worked  with other Members in both Chambers to find a lasting solution to this  decades-old problem, again demonstrating that Congress can tackle hard  problems and not just kick the can down the road.   In addition to the Medicare extenders, the bipartisan funding bill  also includes some key reforms to the underlying Medicare Programs.  These include expanding access to in-home treatments for patients with  Medicare Part B and improved means-testing for the premiums paid by  high-income earners under Medicare Parts B and D, all of which will  help improve the overall fiscal outlook for Medicare.   Furthermore, the bill repeals the Independent Payment Advisory Board  that was created under the so-called Affordable Care Act. This, too, is  a step that has garnered bipartisan support, as it should, showing that  many Democrats have joined Republicans in recognizing just how ill- advised the creation of this panel really was.  [[Page S800]]    The bill addresses a number of other healthcare priorities as well,  including continued funding for various public health programs, some  delays for burdensome Medicaid reductions that have been on the  horizon, and it provides relief to Puerto Rico's healthcare challenges  faced after the hurricane devastation by increasing Medicaid funding.   I would also like to say, in any big package, there are a lot of  policies in here that give me concern. Some of the offsets,  particularly related to Medicare Part D that my Democratic colleagues  insisted be in this package, are very troubling to me, and I look  forward to working with my colleagues to address this moving forward.   In addition to these healthcare priorities, the funding bill extends  a number of important tax provisions in order to help families,  individuals, and small businesses throughout the country. We made  progress on producing and passing tax extenders legislation with the  passage of the PATH Act in 2015. Still, many more important items  remain to be handled, and we have worked to address Member priorities  to extend certain provisions. The provisions included in the spending  bill all expire at the end of 2016. This legislation will extend them  through this year.   Finally, the bill takes some major steps forward in the area of human  services, which is also under the jurisdiction of the Finance  Committee.   In addition to continuing funding for important child and family  services programs, the bill includes the Family First Prevention  Services Act, another bill originally introduced by Senator Wyden and  myself to strengthen families and reduce inappropriate foster care  placements. This legislation will help keep more children safely with  their families instead of placing them in foster care. Under this bill,  States will be able to fund effective services that have been shown to  prevent children from entering foster care. It will also encourage  States to place children with foster families instead of in group  homes, and it will reduce the bureaucracy faced by relatives who seek  to take in children rather than have them end up in foster care.   Also included in the spending bill is the Social Impact Partnership  Act, a bill I introduced along with Senator Bennet, which will support  innovative public-private partnerships to address critical social and  public health challenges. As a result of this bill, States will  identify key social challenges they want to address, state the results  they hope to achieve, and the Federal Government will pay for a  rigorous, independent evaluation to verify that they achieved the  outcome.   As you can see, we have been very busy in the Finance Committee for  the past few years. Obviously, we have seen success in some of the more  high-profile items, like tax reform late last year, as well as long- term highway funding and renewing trade promotion authority in 2015,  but our work has gone far beyond these efforts. Thankfully, with  passage of this spending bill, many more of the committee's efforts-- virtually all of them bipartisan--will come to fruition.   I thank the Senate leaders from both parties who have worked with us  to include all of these important provisions. I thank my colleagues on  the Finance Committee--both Republicans and Democrats--who have put in  so much time over the years on all of these efforts and congratulate  them all for the success we look forward to seeing this week.   Of course, we do still have to pass the bill. Therefore, I urge all  of my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, to vote in favor of this  bipartisan legislation.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.    Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of Jon  Huntsman, Sr., a committed public servant, a visionary entrepreneur,  and perhaps the greatest philanthropist Utah has ever known. Jon passed  away peacefully last Friday afternoon with his friends and family  gathered by his bedside. Elaine and I will miss him dearly, as will  thousands in Utah and across the Nation.   From humble beginnings, Jon rose to the highest echelons of industry  and power. But along life's journey, he never lost sight of what  matters most. Indeed, no matter what success Jon experienced, no matter  what wealth he attained or honors he achieved, he always maintained an  everyman ethos that endeared him to friends and business associates  alike.   Jon's hallmark humility was born of a childhood spent in poverty.  Growing up in modest circumstances, Jon resolved to escape the  financial hardships of his youth and find success as a businessman. In  time, he made a tremendous fortune as the chairman and CEO of the  Huntsman group of companies, which includes Huntsman Chemical Corp.  Rather than sit on his wealth, Jon gave liberally to all, donating more  than $1 billion over the course of his lifetime to build and sustain  hundreds of charities, the most prominent of which was the Huntsman  Cancer Institute--a premiere research facility dedicated to eradicating  cancer in all its forms. With a donation of $450 million, Jon and his  wife, Karen, founded the institute in 1995. Today, it remains among the  most respected medical research facilities in the world. For Jon, the  battle against cancer was personal; he himself was a four-time cancer  survivor, and his own mother passed away from the disease. With the  sheer amount of resources he has devoted to cancer research, Jon has  done more than perhaps anyone alive to help us find a cure.   Of course, fighting cancer was not Jon's only cause. He also donated  hundreds of millions of dollars to strengthen schools, feed the hungry,  and protect women and children from abuse. For Jon, material success  was never an end in itself but a means to enrich the lives of others.  Richly was he given, and richly did he give to all who stood in need.  He was magnanimous to the very end and will long be remembered for his  selflessness towards his fellow man.   Jon was also actively involved in public life, serving as an  Associate Administrator of the Department of  [[Page S839]]  Health, Education, and Welfare, and later as a White House Staff  Secretary. In all things, he embodied the concept of a life well-lived.  Outside of his professional pursuits, Jon had a robust and meaningful  personal life. He married his high school sweetheart, Karen, not long  after graduating from the Wharton School of Business, and together they  raised nine children. The Huntsman family has grown immensely over the  years, and today includes 56 grandchildren and 26 great-grandchildren.  Jon was also an active member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints and served diligently in leadership positions as a regional  representative, stake president, and president of the Washington, D.C.  South Mission.   On a personal note, I feel a great love for Jon and the entire  Huntsman family. More than an accomplished businessman and  philanthropist, he was a trusted confidante and a dear friend whom I  will miss greatly. With his passing, Utah has lost a lion. This week,  my prayers are with the Huntsman family.                            ____________________
