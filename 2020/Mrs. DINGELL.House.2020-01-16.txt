 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.J.  Res. 76 and in strong opposition to the Department of Education's  change to the borrower defense rule.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to stand in defense of  defrauded students nationwide from getting relief that they are  entitled to. This significant step ensures that we hold the  institutions accountable for their actions by blocking this rule from  going into effect.   Allowing this rule to move forward is a dismantling of student  protections  [[Page H312]]  and would further exacerbate the student loan crisis in our country,  which is a major crisis for our young people.   We should not be protecting fraudulent institutions that prey on  students. We should be working to prevent fraud in education in the  first place.   It is vital that defrauded students have a process that is fair and  easy to understand, and this new guidance makes it substantially more  difficult for these students to receive the relief that they  desperately need. Denying debt relief to defrauded students is wrong.   Mr. Speaker, I urge every Member to support this bill.
