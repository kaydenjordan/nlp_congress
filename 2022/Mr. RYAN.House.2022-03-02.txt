 Mr. Speaker, I am frustrated. We have heard a lot this week  about cutting workers in on the deal and how we meet the challenges  that this Nation is facing.   Every piece of the game plan--whether it is helping take on China;  how do we bring jobs back to places like Ohio; how do we increase union  membership by making it easier to join a union; how do we bring down  costs; and how do we cut taxes for workers in the midst of all of this  inflation--every one of those bills has gone to the Senate and either  died or is on life support.   Here is one example of just how broken this is: Last year, we made  history  [[Page H1219]]  when we passed the Women's Health Protection Act--and not a moment too  soon as Roe v. Wade hangs in the balance and States like Ohio race to  pass new laws to ban abortion. This is a basic right, a matter of  settled law. But this week the Senate blocked the vote--blocked it--and  we didn't even get a vote.   It is time to get rid of the filibuster and make sure that the bills  we send here from the House actually get passed in the United States  Senate.                            ____________________
