 Madam Chair, I appreciate the bipartisan work here to  support our bases that need to be rebuilt.   I urge the support of this amendment to increase the Air Force O&M  budget in the Disaster Aid Package to a total of $670 million for  recovery of the military bases that sustained extensive damage by the  recent storms.   In March, my district in my home State of Nebraska experienced  devastating floods where lives were lost and the scale of the  destruction made it the worst natural disaster in our 152-year history  as a State.   The damage to Nebraska's infrastructure, agriculture, and local  economy is extensive and includes Offutt Air Force Base, one of the two  largest employers in our area.   At the height of the storm, one-third of the base was under water,  3,000 people were displaced from their work centers, and 1.2 million  square feet of mission space was lost. The flight line was inoperable,  with a third of the runway under water. Many structures incurred  significant damages, and critical systems were destroyed.    Our Nation owes a debt of gratitude to those men and women at Offutt  that worked relentlessly to save what they could. The mission impact  and cost to the taxpayers would have been worse without their heroic  efforts.   So I am very grateful for the bipartisan leadership here and the  teamwork by Representatives Cunningham, Fortenberry, Dunn, and so many  others to make this a reality.   You know, Offutt is one of the two primary intelligence surveillance  reconnaissance hubs in our country, and it is the home of StratComm, so  it is vital that we get this done.   Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and we need to  support this amendment.
