Madam President, last week, the Judiciary Committee held  its hearing on Judge Amy Coney Barrett's nomination, and it was easy to  see why Judge Barrett is held in such high regard by her colleagues,  students, and peers and why the American Bar Association gave her its  highest rating of ``well qualified.''   We knew long before the hearing that Judge Barrett possesses an  extraordinary intelligence and a comprehensive command of the law. But  over 3 days of testimony, Americans got to see her qualifications for  themselves, and they saw why she has been described as ``a jurist of  formidable intellect,'' a ``brilliant and conscientious lawyer,'' and  ``a staggering academic mind.'' Even the Democratic ranking member on  the committee, the senior Senator from California, couldn't hide the  fact that she was impressed.   Most importantly, however, Americans saw that Judge Barrett  understands the proper role of a judge in our system of government. As  Judge Barrett made clear, she understands that the job of a judge is to  interpret the law, not to make the law; to call balls and strikes, not  to rewrite the rules of the game; or, as Judge Barrett said to the  Democrat whip at the hearing last week: ``I apply the law. I follow the  law. You make policy.''   Judge Barrett has made it clear that when cases come before her on  the Supreme Court, she will consider the facts, the law, and the  Constitution, and nothing else--not her personal beliefs, not her  political opinions, just the law and the Constitution. That is the kind  of Justice that all of us--Democrat or Republican, liberal or  conservative--should want.   I could spend hours highlighting all the extraordinary tributes to  Judge Barrett that have poured in since her nomination, from lawyers  and scholars of every background and political persuasion, but I don't  want to tie up the Senate floor. So I will just mention one piece of  testimony that struck me in particular.   As I mentioned, the American Bar Association released its rating of  Judge Barrett last week, a rating that the Democratic leader, by the  way, has called the ``gold standard''--the ``gold standard''--by which  judicial candidates are judged. Well, the ABA gave Judge Barrett its  highest possible rating--``well qualified.'' And the chairman of the  American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary,  the ABA committee that issues these ratings, testified before the  Judiciary Committee during Judge Barrett's hearing. I would like to  read from the testimony that he submitted to the committee.         Lawyers and judges uniformly praised the nominee's       integrity. Most remarkably, in interviews with individuals in       the legal profession and the community who know Judge       Barrett, whether for a few years or decades, not one person       uttered a negative word about her character. Accordingly, the       Standing Committee was not required to consider any negative       criticisms of Judge Barrett.    His testimony went on:   [[Page S6308]]              All of the experienced, dedicated, and knowledgeable       sitting judges, legal scholars, and lawyers who have worked       with or against Judge Barrett had high praise for her       intellect and ability to communicate clearly and effectively.       . . . Given the breadth, diversity, and strength of the       positive feedback we received from judges and lawyers of all       political persuasions and from so many parts of the       profession, the Standing Committee would have been hard-      pressed to come to any conclusion other than that Judge       Barrett has demonstrated professional competence that is       exceptional.    We are fortunate to have a nominee like Judge Barrett, and I look  forward to confirming her to the Supreme Court in the very near future.
