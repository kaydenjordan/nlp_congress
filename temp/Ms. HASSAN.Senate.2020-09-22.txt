 Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank my  colleague from Hawaii for her remarks just now and for her commitment  to a more equal, more just United States of America.   I rise tonight to join my colleagues in mourning the loss of Justice  Ruth Bader Ginsburg.   Justice Ginsburg was a brilliant jurist and a persistent patriot. Her  belief in our country and her vision and imagination as a lawyer left  our Nation stronger and more just.   As a litigator, she fought and she won fights for women's equality.  And on the Court, she was a powerful voice for justice, whether in the  majority or in dissent.   Throughout her career and through the final days of her life, she was  a powerful voice calling for every American to be recognized equally  and to be treated with dignity, regardless of gender or personal  circumstances, and the progress and inclusion that she helped build  throughout her life is a testament to both her tenacity and her  unmatched legal mind. It is also an illustration of what is possible in  our country when we reaffirm and stay true to our values.   Justice Ginsburg's vision of what it means to be an American and what  it means to be free changed lives. She helped move our country toward a  more perfect union, and we have to continue her unfinished work.   Like many of my colleagues, I stopped by the Supreme Court over the  weekend. It was incredible to see the outpouring of sheer reverence and  to see the number of people who came on foot, on bicycle, in cars to  pay their respects.   I overheard one mom explain to her children: ``A lot of people loved  her.'' Then, a couple of seconds later, she added for the children:  ``And I want you to understand how important she was to our country.''   I hope we all take the time to think about the meaning of Justice  Ginsburg's life and what this loss means for our country. Honoring the  legacy of Ruth Bader Ginsburg means continuing to fight for the more  equal America that she fought for throughout her entire career.   Unfortunately, though, in a week in which America has reached a  terrible milestone of 200,000 COVID-19 deaths, the Senate majority  leader and Senate Republicans have made their priorities clear. Instead  of working with Democrats to pass the comprehensive COVID-19 relief  bill that the American people so badly need, my colleagues across the  aisle are focused on using all of the Senate's time before the election  to rush through the President's choice for a lifetime appointment to  the Supreme Court, and they are doing so in contradiction of the rules  that they themselves invented in 2016, despite the fact that this  election is not just imminent, it is already underway with voters  casting their ballots in States across the country.  [[Page S5758]]    Our society and our democracy rely on the idea that all sides of  political debates will play by the same rules. That means when any  faction loses, it does so knowing that it will have a fair chance in  the next round. When that understanding is disrupted, it destabilizes  our democracy, leaving people feeling disenfranchised. It is wrong, and  it produces chaos and confusion, and it demonstrates a dangerous trend.   My Republican colleagues are making clear that they do not think the  rules apply to them. It is worth taking a closer look at exactly why  they are violating the rules that they set for themselves and applied  to President Obama's nominee just 4 years ago and what the impact of  their backward priorities will be for the American people.   Right now, the Trump administration's lawsuit to repeal the entire  Affordable Care Act and its protections for people with preexisting  conditions is pending before the Supreme Court and, as you have heard  from my colleagues, scheduled to be argued after the election. Make no  mistake, rushing through this nomination is a last-ditch effort to  repeal the Affordable Care Act through the courts after failing to do  so legislatively for years. Even worse, the Republicans would undermine  healthcare in the midst of a devastating pandemic, just when it is  needed most.   Invalidating the ACA will also mean that those who survive COVID-19-- and, as a result, will have preexisting conditions for the rest of  their lives--will no longer be protected by the ACA when they seek  insurance coverage.   Taking away healthcare from millions of Americans is just one of the  many things at stake. Women's rights, voting rights, civil rights,  workers' rights, so much of what Justice Ginsburg stood for--they are  all at risk. Senate Republicans are not just intent on filling this  Supreme Court seat; they are intent on filling this seat with a person  who will strip away some, if not all, of these rights.   The stakes could not be higher, and the priorities of the American  people are clear. We should follow the rules that the Republicans  created in 2016. We should focus on COVID-19 relief. And we should not  confirm a nominee until after the next President is inaugurated.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg believed in an America where equality would win  out, where everyone played by the same rules in liberty and justice--in  fact, in liberty ensured by justice. It would be a good thing if all of  my colleagues who have the privilege of serving in this Chamber would  reflect on that to honor the giant we just lost.   God speed, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and God bless the United States of  America   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I am proud to recognize Kristina  Folcik of Tamworth as September's Granite Stater of the Month. As a  survivor of domestic violence, Kristina transformed her own healing  process into a way to support other survivors by hiking 100 miles  nonstop across some of New Hampshire's steepest peaks. She was the  first person to ever finish that portion of the Appalachian Trail in  one single trek.   Kristina is an endurance athlete who has held multiple Fastest Known  Times, which is a title given to individuals who have clocked the  fastest time on a particular route, including hiking trails. She even  raced professionally for a while, but stopped when her now-former  husband started becoming abusive after she would win a race.   For the last 2 years, Kristina worked with Starting Point, a  nonprofit organization in New Hampshire that helps survivors of  domestic and sexual violence, to successfully separate from her abusive  husband. In an effort to heal from this harrowing and traumatic  experience, Kristina decided to attempt a 100-mile, nonstop hike.   In the lead-up to announcing her decision to attempt this  extraordinary feat, Kristina revealed publicly on social media that she  had recently divorced from her abusive husband and that she was going  to complete this 100-mile trek and dedicate it to women who have been  in abusive relationships.   Much to her surprise, following her announcement, many women began to  share their stories of abuse with Kristina, and some even publicly  shared their experiences.  [[Page S5782]]    Kristina turned her hike into a fundraiser, asking people to donate  to the organization that had helped her leave her abusive marriage. It  was not until Kristina had successfully completed the hike 36 hours  later that she realized the fundraiser had raised more than $1,000 for  Starting Point.   Apart from breaking records, Kristina also owns Rockhopper Races LLC,  which hosts races in the White Mountains and raises money for  organizations that maintain and preserve New Hampshire's beautiful  natural resources.   Kristina not only achieved an incredible athletic feat, but also made  a difference in the lives of others by having the courage to speak out  about her past trauma. Kristina's strength is an inspiration and  reflects the kind of determination to build strength through outreach  and mutual support that the Granite State is known for. I am proud to  recognize her efforts.                            ____________________
