 Madam President, I thank Senator Brown for including me  on this reading. It is a tremendous honor. I will continue.         When I was suddenly catapulted into the leadership of the       bus protest in Montgomery, Alabama, a few years ago, I felt       we would be supported by the white church. I felt that the       white ministers, priests and rabbis of the South would be       among our strongest allies.        Instead, some have been outright opponents, refusing to       understand the freedom movement and misrepresenting its       leaders; all too many others have been more cautious than       courageous and have remained silent behind the anesthetizing       security of stained glass windows. In spite of my shattered       dreams, I came to Birmingham with the hope that the white       religious leadership of this community would see the justice       of our cause and, with deep moral concern, would serve as the       channel through which our just grievances could reach the       power structure. I had hoped that each of you would       understand. But again I have been disappointed.        I have heard numerous southern religious leaders admonish       their worshipers to comply with a desegregation decision       because it is the law, but I have longed to hear white       ministers declare: ``Follow this decree because integration       is morally right and because the Negro is your brother.'' In       the midst of blatant injustices inflicted upon the Negro, I       have watched white churchmen stand on the sideline and mouth       pious irrelevancies and sanctimonious trivialities. In the       midst of a mighty struggle to rid our nation of racial and       economic injustice, I have heard many ministers say: ``Those       are social issues, with which the gospel has no real       concern.'' And I have watched many churches commit themselves       to a completely other worldly religion which makes a strange,       un-Biblical distinction between body and soul, between the       sacred and the secular.        I have traveled the length and breadth of Alabama,       Mississippi and all the other southern states. On sweltering       summer days and crisp autumn mornings I have looked at the       South's beautiful churches with their lofty spires pointing       heavenward. I have beheld the impressive outlines of her       massive religious education buildings. Over and over I have       found myself asking: ``What kind of people worship here? Who       is their God? Where were their voices when the lips of       Governor Barnett dripped with words of interposition and       nullification? Where were they when Governor Wallace gave a       clarion call for defiance and hatred? Where were their voices       of support when bruised and weary Negro men and women decided       to rise from the dark dungeons of complacency to the bright       hills of creative protest?''        Yes, these questions are still in my mind. In deep       disappointment I have wept over the laxity of the church. But       be assured that my tears have been tears of love. There can       be no deep disappointment where there is not deep love. Yes,       I love the church. How could I do otherwise? I am in the       rather unique position of being the son, the grandson and the       great grandson of preachers. Yes, I see the church as the       body of Christ. But, oh! How we have blemished and scarred       that body through social neglect and through fear of being       nonconformists.        There was a time when the church was very powerful--in the       time when the early Christians rejoiced at being deemed       worthy to suffer for what they believed. In those days the       church was not merely a thermometer that recorded the ideas       and principles of popular opinion; it was a thermostat that       transformed the mores of society. Whenever the early       Christians entered a town, the people in power became       disturbed and immediately sought to convict the Christians       for being ``disturbers of the peace'' and ``outside       agitators.''        But the Christians pressed on, in the conviction that they       were ``a colony of Heaven,'' called to obey God rather than       Man. Small in number, they were big in commitment. They were       too God-intoxicated to be ``astronomically intimidated.'' By       their effort and example they brought an end to such ancient       evils as infanticide and gladiatorial contests. Things are       different now. So often the contemporary church is a weak,       ineffectual voice with an uncertain sound. So often it is an       arch defender of the status quo. Far from being disturbed by       the presence of the church, the power structure of the       average community is consoled by the church's silent--and       often even vocal--sanction of things as they are.        But the judgment of God is upon the church as never before.       If today's church does not recapture the sacrificial spirit       of the early church, it will lose its authenticity, forfeit       the loyalty of millions, and be dismissed as an irrelevant       social club with no meaning for the twentieth century. Every       day I meet young people whose disappointment with the church       has turned into outright disgust.        Perhaps I have once again been too optimistic. Is organized       religion too inextricably bound to the status quo to save our       nation and the world? Perhaps I must turn my faith to the       inner spiritual church, the church within the church, as the       true ekklesia and the hope of the world. But again I am       thankful to God that some noble souls from the ranks of       organized religion have broken loose from the paralyzing       chains of conformity and joined us as active partners in the       struggle for freedom. They have left their secure       congregations and walked the streets of Albany, Georgia, with       us. They have gone down the highways of the South on tortuous       rides for freedom.        Yes, they have gone to jail with us. Some have been       dismissed from their churches, have lost the support of their       bishops and fellow ministers. But they have acted in the       faith that right defeated is stronger than evil triumphant.       Their witness has been the spiritual salt that has preserved       the true meaning of the gospel in these troubled times.        They have carved a tunnel of hope through the dark mountain       of disappointment. I hope the church as a whole will meet the       challenge of this decisive hour. But even if the  [[Page S1921]]       church does not come to the aid of justice, I have no despair       about the future. I have no fear about the outcome of our       struggle in Birmingham, even if our motives at present are       misunderstood. We will reach the goal of freedom in       Birmingham and all over the nation, because the goal of       America is freedom.
