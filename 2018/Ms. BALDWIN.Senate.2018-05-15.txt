 Mr. President, I rise on behalf of the more than 25,000  workers and retirees in Wisconsin who have paid into the Central States  Pension Fund.   If Washington does not act, workers and retirees face massive cuts to  the pensions they have earned over decades of work. If Washington does  not act, small businesses will be on the hook for a pension liability  they cannot afford.   I have been proud to work side by side with Wisconsin workers and  retirees and with Senator Brown, who introduced the Butch Lewis Act,  and I have been proud to work with Senator Donnelly and others to  organize this afternoon's opportunity to share the stories of the hard- working people and retirees we represent.   The bill--the Butch Lewis Act--will put failing multiemployer pension  plans, including Central States, back on solid ground, and it does so  without cutting a single cent from the pension retirees have earned.   I have also introduced legislation to help shore up the government's  insurance plan for these pensions. Earlier this year, I shared the  stories of Wisconsin retirees who stand to lose more than 50 percent of  their pensions if Washington does not act. Since then, nothing has been  done. I am here once again to remind my colleagues that this is about a  promise that must be kept.   This is about a promise made to Gary, from Marshfield, WI. Gary told  me:         We recently got custody of our great grandson, and raising       an 8 year old is expensive, more expensive than when our kids       were young. If my pension gets cut, it would definitely       affect our family.    I relate to Gary's comments because I was raised by my grandparents.  I can't imagine raising a great-grandchild. So thank you for doing  that. Also, yes, it does cost money, and you need to have the stability  of keeping the promises that you were given when you enrolled in  Central States Pension.   This is about a promise made to Diane and her husband, from  Luxemburg, WI. Diane wrote to tell me:         If my husband loses his pension, we could lose our house.       My husband has been through polio, cancer, a knee       replacement--and he needs another. He worked hard all his       life lifting thousands of pounds every day in a grocery       warehouse. We paid into a pension expecting to have a       comfortable life in retirement--and now it's at risk of being       lost.    This is about a promise we made to Michael, from De Pere, WI, a  Vietnam veteran. For over 30 years, Michael was a driver at a local  construction business. His wife is a retired nurse. They both worked  long hours and are now at the age where finding a new job is not an  option. Michael told me:   [[Page S2668]]              With increasing costs of living and prescription drugs,       losing my pension would leave us in a state of devastation.    This is about a promise made to Randall. Randall is from Suamico, WI.  He is a retired truckdriver. Randall told me about long hours on the  road and leaving his wife at home to care for their children. In 2015  he received a letter from Central States Pension Fund informing him  that his pension would be cut in half.   I can't imagine receiving that sort of devastating news.   Randall is 68 years old, he is in poor health, and he would find it  impossible to find another job today. He said:         My wife and I both worked hard our entire lives. Our hard       work should have meant a secure retirement, and we are       worried sick about the possibility of losing my pension. It       is difficult to sleep at night.    If Washington does not act, we will be breaking a promise made to 1.5  million workers and retirees nationwide. Small businesses will make  hard decisions to lay off workers or close their doors. Washington  needs to act, and we need to do it now.   I yield the floor.
