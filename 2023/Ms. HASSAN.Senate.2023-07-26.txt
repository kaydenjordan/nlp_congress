 Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues and  share my deep concern and outrage regarding Senator Tuberville's  decision to block the promotions of hundreds of servicemembers. I want  to take a moment and share why I believe this action weakens our  national security, hurts our servicemembers who are in harm's way,  ignores the wishes of the American people, and betrays our country's  bipartisan commitment to our servicemembers.   By blocking the promotions of hundreds of servicemembers, the Senator  from Alabama is preventing our military from being properly staffed and  led. This diminishes our military's effectiveness and combat-readiness.   Senator Tuberville has told us that he is doing this not because he  has any concern with these officers' ability to command; instead,  Senator Tuberville tells us he is blocking these promotions simply to  advance a personal political agenda to take away reproductive freedom  from female servicemembers.   It is not only outrageous but bitterly ironic that, while the Senator  from Alabama trusts women in uniform to defend our country, while he  trusts them to keep all of us safe, while he trusts them to risk their  lives for our freedom, he does not trust them to make their own  healthcare decisions.   Senator Tuberville's decision to block these promotions not only  hurts female servicemembers, it makes America less safe.   What did Senator Tuberville even accomplish by what is truly a  reckless stunt? Can my colleague from Alabama explain how blocking  promotions for servicemembers strengthens our national security?   What kind of message do we send to our allies and our adversaries  that America's combat readiness can be undermined because of one  Senator's partisan stunt?   And can he tell us why the health, safety, and daily lives of  servicemembers are less important than his own personal and political  agenda?   Our brave men and women in uniform put their lives on the line in  order to protect our freedoms. We could not freely assemble here in  this Chamber without their dedication and sacrifice. There simply is no  U.S. Senate without the service of our Armed Forces. Our servicemembers  place their trust in us to ensure that they are properly supported,  including by being sufficiently staffed and led.   Let me be very, very clear: Senator Tuberville's actions mark nothing  less than an abdication and betrayal of that trust.   It is also clear that in pushing this personal partisan agenda, the  Senator from Alabama is deeply out of step with the majority of  Americans. He is not representing the American people. I know--as I  think all of us do--that Americans, regardless of their views or  political party, share a common love of country. We stand united in  support of our servicemembers because our servicemembers do not risk  their lives for  [[Page S3597]]  red States or blue; they fight for the freedom of all Americans, and  they deserve the support of all Americans.   Bipartisan support for servicemembers has exemplified our country at  our best. No issue, no matter how important, should stand in the way of  ensuring that our military has the support and leadership that it needs  to succeed.   I was reminded of this in April, when I was on a congressional  delegation trip and visiting the Northern Command out in Colorado  Springs. I met with one of the people who Senator Kelly talked about,  Rear Admiral Cheever. He hosted the visit, and he coordinated it. I had  a wonderful briefing from him and his leadership team about issues of  cyber security, about our quantum readiness.   As you heard Senator Kelly say, Rear Admiral Cheever has been  nominated to become a vice admiral and command the Naval Air Force of  the U.S. Pacific Fleet--even more responsibility. He is ready to do it.  The Senator from Alabama doesn't disagree that he is ready to do it.  But as we left that day, he told me that his promotion was in limbo  because of the hold that our colleague from Alabama has put on his  promotion.   We need him in that position. He and his family and his fellow  service men and women need him in that position and are waiting for the  Senator from Alabama.   It is fitting that we are discussing this issue on July 26, for it  was on July 26, 1947, that the National Security Act of 1947 was signed  into law. This law established the Defense Department, an institution  with officers whose promotions the Senator from Alabama is blocking  today. This law was passed with overwhelming support from leaders of  both parties.   In 1947, of course, the Senate was full of debates and even bitter  disagreements on all sorts of issues, just as it is today. But Senators  understood that while we can debate all day on any number of issues, we  owed it to our servicemembers and the American people to stand united  in our efforts to support our military and to keep Americans safe,  secure, and free.   In the same manner, our military works together despite their own  personal differences or political views. My father served in World War  II and survived the Battle of the Bulge. He told me that the members of  his unit came from all sorts of different backgrounds. They, no doubt,  held many different views, but on the battlefield, those differences  weren't important. What mattered was their common bond as Americans,  their common love of country, and their common commitment to freedom.   What my father's generation did and what our servicemembers do every  day is nothing less than extraordinary. Compared to their courage, the  political and dangerous game that Senator Tuberville is playing seems  very, very small.   No Senator, no matter their party, has the right to put their  personal and political agenda ahead of our national security and our  servicemembers' freedom and safety. I urge my Republican colleagues to  join me in opposing Senator Tuberville's efforts to undermine our  bipartisan commitment to our servicemembers and our national security  because, ultimately, this kind of reckless, partisan game does not  reflect who we are as Americans.   On distant battlefields and in faraway places, thousands of miles  from their homes, our brave men and women in uniform risk their lives  and confront great dangers so that all of us--including my colleague  from Alabama--can be safe, secure, and free. While my colleague stands  in the way of promotions, our servicemembers stand in the way of our  greatest foes.   We can't ever repay the debt that we owe those who served, but we owe  them nothing less than our full support, and that starts with ending  this reckless stunt, uniting as Americans, and advancing these overdue  promotions.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today it is my privilege to  recognize the 400th anniversary of the city of Portsmouth, NH. For four  centuries, Portsmouth has endured as one our country's oldest and most  vital cities, continuing to serve as a pillar for New Hampshire's  economy and culture--and for our country's national security.   From its founding in 1623, Portsmouth has served as one of New  England's most important trade ports, helping develop and sustain the  region's economy and, at one time, even served as New Hampshire's  capital. Portsmouth first started as Strawbery Banke, an early  settlement that evolved into a maritime hub and led Portsmouth to  become the iconic city that it is today. In the 400 years since 1623,  Portsmouth continues to be a wonderful place to live--and it is a  premier destination for trade and tourism, boasting some of the finest  breweries and seafood in the country. Portsmouth is in part why New  Hampshire attracts millions of tourists each year.   Portsmouth has also been instrumental in building and maintaining the  U.S. Navy, through the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, as well as providing  a key installation for the U.S. Air Force with the Pease Air Force  Base, which is now home to the finest Air National Guard in the  country. In New Hampshire, our motto is ``Live Free or Die,'' and  Granite Staters in Portsmouth have embodied that spirit since our  country's beginning. The Portsmouth Naval Shipyard built and launched  John Paul Jones and the USS Ranger in the American Revolutionary War-- one of the founding vessels of the U.S. Navy--and was a one-time home  to the famed USS Constitution. The shipbuilders and dockworkers in  Portsmouth have built and maintained vessels that served in conflicts  from the Revolutionary War through today, including playing a decisive  role in building our submarine fleet in World War II. Across distant  seas and faraway tides, ships built in Portsmouth--powered by  everything from winds to atoms--have helped ensure that Granite Staters  and all Americans can continue to live free.   The people of Portsmouth also know that inclusiveness is a virtue and  a key to our State and our country's strength. As we mark the 400th  anniversary of the city of Portsmouth, we also recognize that the  Wabanaki people have long called this region their home, thousands of  years before the establishment of Portsmouth. Over the  [[Page S3616]]  years, a diverse group of people and communities have all made  Portsmouth's culture richer and more vibrant. I am grateful for those  who are shining a light on all parts of Portsmouth's history,  especially the Black Heritage Trail of New Hampshire. The organization  has helped make more Granite Staters aware of the long and rich history  of New Hampshire's Black community, including in Portsmouth, and  deepened our appreciation of the diversity that has made Portsmouth-- and New Hampshire--stronger year after year.   While much of Portsmouth has changed over the last four centuries, it  still never fails to capture the hearts and imaginations of those who  visit. Anyone who has visited Portsmouth even once knows that it is not  an easy place to forget. Everyone who has walked Portsmouth's streets,  toured the Strawbery Banke Museum to explore our history, taken in a  live performance in Prescott Park or the Music Hall, tasted our fresh  seafood, or even simply looked out at the Piscataqua River and breathed  in the salty ocean air, knows that Portsmouth is a special place.   Portsmouth has endured for four centuries because, across  generations, people have believed in the city's promise, worked hard to  keep the community strong, and remained dedicated to the notion that  Portsmouth's best days are always ahead.   On behalf of Congress and all Granite Staters, I offer my  congratulations to the city of Portsmouth on this incredible milestone,  and encourage people from across our country to visit this great  American city.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am honored to recognize Lt.  Stephen Holmes of Candia as July's Granite Stater of the Month.  Stephen, a Marine Corps veteran and a firefighter, is working to  destigmatize mental health among first responders by visiting New  Hampshire fire departments and sharing his own experience dealing with  PTSD.   At age 17, Stephen enlisted in the Marine Corps infantry and went on  to serve three tours of duty in Iraq. On his return home 4 years later,  he wanted to continue helping others through public service and decided  to join the Exeter Fire Department. However, it soon became clear that  he was struggling with serious symptoms of anxiety, depression, and  anger, and he was diagnosed with PTSD at the Manchester VA.   Stephen took a leave of absence from the Exeter Fire Department due  to his mental health, and during this time, Stephen's wife gave him a  book on meditation, which turned out to be his saving grace. After  trying many other therapeutic techniques recommended by his doctors,  Stephen found that meditation worked best for him to help him feel at  peace.   Stephen did not stop there. After returning to the Exeter Fire  Department, he wanted to use the lessons he had learned to shed more  light on the issue of first responders' mental health. With the help of  other Fire and EMS professionals, Stephen began visiting one fire  station after another to share his mental health struggles and the  importance of seeking care. Already, many of his peers have started  receiving mental health treatment, Stephen's story having provided the  push that they needed and the validation that it is okay to need help.   Many first responders might believe that they cannot seek help, since  they are the ones that the rest of us rely on in a crisis. However,  first responders often need mental health care precisely because of how  high-pressure their jobs are and the suffering that they see, which is  why Stephen's work is all the more important--he is sharing his  firsthand experiences, breaking down stigma, and letting first  responders know that it is okay to seek the care that they need.   Stephen exemplifies the Granite State spirit of commitment to  community and person-to-person advocacy to bring about positive change.  I am deeply grateful, as I know his fellow first responders are, for  his bravery and compassion in sharing his personal experiences, and I  look forward to seeing how he continues to change people's  lives.                            ____________________
