 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Representative Hurd for his  work, which has been an ongoing continuing work on this issue and on  this particular program.   I rise in support of this bipartisan bill, which builds on the work  that Majority Leader McCarthy and I and others in this House have been  doing to modernize government technology and renew America's faith in  government.   In 2016, exit polls showed that dissatisfaction with the government  spanned the political spectrum. That is a shame because government is  supposed to be a force for improving people's lives, keeping our  country safe, and expanding opportunities for all Americans.   That is why I unveiled the House Democrats' Renewing Faith in  Government agenda last summer. We must present bold solutions to reform  our democracy and our government. Certainly, on both sides of the  equation, that is what the American people were saying in the last  election.   One of the goals of our agenda is modernizing government technology.  Most Americans understand the transformative power of technology--the  Majority Leader spoke of it in so many different aspects of our lives-- and how digitizing businesses makes them more efficient, transparent,  and accountable. We have seen it in the private sector. Every day,  millions of Americans shop on sites like Amazon or Etsy and catch a  ride using Uber or Lyft.   Government technology is in terrible shape, and bringing the latest  practices from Silicon Valley into government would make a huge  difference in serving our citizens and streamlining the way government  works for the American people.   Last year, I worked closely with the Obama administration and Tony  Scott to advance one of its top priorities in this area: creating a  technology modernization fund for the rapid upgrade of  [[Page H285]]  the most outdated, costly, and insecure technology systems across the  Federal Government. Mr. Hurd was involved deeply in that effort. The  result was the Modernizing Government Technology Act, which the House  passed overwhelmingly with the help of Chairman Chaffetz and Majority  Leader McCarthy.   Last month, Majority Leader McCarthy and I expressed our bipartisan  support for one of President Obama's most successful efforts at  bringing Silicon Valley talent into the Federal workforce: the U.S.  Digital Service and GSA's 18F program. In fact, I visited the 18F  program in San Francisco and was extraordinarily impressed with the  individuals who peopled that project and were giving of their time. I  guess we were paying them a little bit, but, relatively speaking, they  were giving their time.   Today's bill, the TALENT Act, would make permanent the precursor to  both these programs: the Presidential Innovation Fellows. This program  has a proven track record of bringing top talent from the innovation  economy into the Federal workforce where it is sorely needed.   I hope the next administration will continue all of these innovative  programs, which have begun to change the culture within our government.   I also hope that the talented individuals--many of whom, as I  referenced, left high-paying jobs in the private sector--will stay on  through the transition and continue to serve their country by improving  government technology.   President Obama made real progress in this area, including with the  launch of his Open Data Directive, his We the People petition platform,  and his Cyber National Action Plan. More could have been achieved if  Congress had agreed to his request to invest more in these areas. We  have seen a dramatic example of why cybersecurity investment is so  critically important for our country, not for Democrats, not for  Republicans, but for all Americans. This is an effort toward that end.   I hope we can work together in this new Congress to unleash the  transformative power of modern technology within government and help  renew America's faith in our government. That is critical if we are to  be successful as a Nation. I am sure it hopefully is what all of us  want to do on a bipartisan basis.   I thank Representative DeSaulnier for his efforts, and I thank  Representative Hurd for his leadership on this effort.   I am pleased to join with my counterpart, Majority Leader McCarthy,  in strong support of this legislation.                                time  1815
