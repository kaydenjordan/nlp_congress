 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize a very special  group from western Illinois, the Moline High School Boys Basketball  Team.   The Maroons recently made history, bringing home the school's first- ever State Championship win.   Under Head Coach Sean Taylor, the Maroons demonstrated intense  perseverance and skill, securing a 59-42 victory after an impressive  35-win season.   I know this group's hard work and determination are a source of pride  for the entire Moline community and for the State of Illinois, and it  is my honor to recognize them here on the floor of the House of  Representatives today.   This was their first State Championship, and I have no doubt it will  not be their last.   Go Maroons.                            ____________________
