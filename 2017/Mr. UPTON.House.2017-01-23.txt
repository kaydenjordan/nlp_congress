 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 511) to provide for consideration of the extension under the  Energy Policy and Conservation Act of nonapplication of No-Load Mode  energy efficiency standards to certain security  [[Page H567]]  or life safety alarms or surveillance systems, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 511         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Power And Security Systems       (PASS) Act''.       SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF NONAPPLICATION OF NO-LOAD MODE ENERGY                     EFFICIENCY STANDARD TO CERTAIN SECURITY OR LIFE                     SAFETY ALARM OR SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS.         (a) Section 325(u)(3)(D)(ii) of the Energy Policy and       Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6295(u)(3)(D)(ii)) is amended--        (1) by striking ``2015'' each place it appears and       inserting ``2021''; and        (2) by striking ``2017'' and inserting ``2023''.        (b) Section 325(u)(3)(E) of the Energy Policy and       Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6295(u)(3)(E)) is amended--        (1) in clause (ii), by striking ``July 1, 2017,'' and       inserting ``the effective date of the amendment under       subparagraph (D)(ii)''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following:        ``(iv) Treatment in rule.--In the rule under subparagraph       (D)(ii) and subsequent amendments the Secretary may treat       some or all external power supplies designed to be connected       to a security or life safety alarm or surveillance system as       a separate product class or may extend the nonapplication       under clause (ii).''.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Upton) and the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DeGette)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Michigan?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Michigan?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 511. I would note that  this is our colleague Mr. Welch's bill that moved through the regular  process through the Committee on Energy and Commerce last year. It  received extensive bipartisan support. I am again glad to move this  bill today.   External power supplies, EPS, are used with a wide variety of  devices, and we have learned from experience that the Federal energy  efficiency standards for them are not compatible with some of these  applications. In particular, we need an exemption from these rules for  security and life safety alarms and surveillance systems. This bill,  H.R. 511, the Power And Security Systems (PASS) Act, provides a  targeted exemption that allows these critical systems to stay on the  market.   Devices like home security alarms or fire detection systems need to  be on 24/7, but the 2007 energy law requiring energy efficiency  standards for external power supplies did not allow for this.  Subsequent legislation created an exemption for external power supplies  used with these always-on devices. This exemption will end on July 1 of  this year. This bill extends that exemption until 2023.   The result of the bill would be that these important security systems  will continue to be available, preserving the jobs of those who make  them and certainly the safety of those who use them. As with H.R. 518,  the other external power supply bill that we are addressing today,  these provisions enjoyed strong bipartisan and bicameral support when  they were added to last year's energy bill. They also passed under  suspension last year.   I urge my colleagues to once again vote ``yes'' on this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 511, the Power And Security Systems, or  PASS, Act. As Chairman Upton said, this bill will provide an important  technical exemption for certain security and life safety products from  energy efficiency standards set forth in the Energy Independence and  Security Act of 2007.   As Mr. Upton said, a provision in the law increased the energy  efficiency requirements for battery chargers and external power  supplies, something which this side of the aisle very strongly  supported. However, the provision also mistakenly included security and  life safety products and required that they be manufactured with a  standby mode despite being products that are inherently always on.   Without providing this correction, the security industry will need to  spend millions of dollars to comply with an energy standard that will  yield no energy savings and could cost jobs, which, of course, was  never the original intent of the law.   I am pleased that my colleagues Representatives Welch and Brooks have  reintroduced the bill, which the House passed last year but the Senate  failed to move before the end of the last Congress.   This is a commonsense and consensus fix to a simple problem. The  language was developed by both industry and efficiency advocates, with  technical assistance from the Department of Energy. It should come as  no surprise that this bill enjoys broad support from the security  industry and energy efficiency advocates. I urge all of my colleagues  to support it.   I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Vermont  (Mr. Welch).    Mr. Speaker, I just again urge my colleagues to support  this good bipartisan bill. I appreciate the kind words always by Mr.  Welch. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''   I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 511, the  ``Power and Security Systems Act of 2017, which will revise energy  conservation standards for devices operating in standby mode.   In the early 1970s, I recall, as many of my colleagues do, the impact  to our nation's economy when OPEC nations withheld oil from the United  States causing one of the greatest peace-time energy shortages in  United States history.   One of the remedial steps taken by the Carter Administration was the  promulgation of regulations that required large appliances and  equipment that used electricity to default to a power down mode when  not in use.   Today, we take for granted that machines power down when not in use,  but this one change in energy policy over the last 4o years has saved  taxpayers, which includes businesses and private homes, billions of  dollars in energy costs.  [[Page H568]]    This was only one policy solution that was used to reduce our  nation's dependence on foreign oil so that energy could go to vital  services like fuel for electricity generation, gasoline, heating fuels,  and diesel oil.   H.R. 511, the bill before us would extend energy conservation to  digital technology that can operate in standby mode.   Most digital device technology manufactures already provide sleep  mode on their devices to assist their users in conserving power on  cellphones, smartphones, MP3 players, e-book readers, as well as  desktop and laptop computers.   Today, 68 percent of U.S. adults own a smartphone, up from 35 percent  in 2011, and tablet computer ownership has edged up to 45 percent among  adults, according to newly released survey data from the Pew Research  Center.   Considering not just smartphones, but all types of mobile phones, Pew  notes that cellphones continue to top of the list.   Roughly nine-in-ten American adults or 92 percent own a mobile phone  of some kind.   Although these mobile devices are ubiquitous today, the share of  adults who own one has risen substantially since 2004.   Smartphone ownership is nearing the saturation point with some  groups: 1. 86 percent of those ages 18-29; 2. 83 percent of those ages  30-49; and 3. 87 percent of those living in households earning $75,000  and up annually own smartphones.   These facts highlight the importance of energy conservation for  mobile communication users.   The battery life for these devices is limited and without power they  are of no use to the user.   This bill will help users remain connected as long as possible  because the energy consumption on their cellphones and other digital  devices will be minimized when they are not in use.   Energy conservation will also assist consumers during times when  power outages may occur due to weather or other electricity disruption.   The longer power life for cellphones will benefit consumers by  reducing the amount of electricity needed to recharge their personal  devices.   This bill will also benefit businesses that often have many computers  that when in use can consume electricity if left on after business  hours--especially over weekends.   For these reasons, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R.  511.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 511.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 587) to amend the Federal Power Act to provide that any inaction  by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that allows a rate change  to go into effect shall be treated as an order by the Commission for  purposes of rehearing and court review.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 587         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Ratepayer       Accountability, Transparency, and Efficiency Standards Act''       or the ``Fair RATES Act''.       SEC. 2. AMENDMENT TO THE FEDERAL POWER ACT.         Subsection (d) of section 205 of the Federal Power Act (16       U.S.C. 824d(d)) is amended by adding at the end the       following: ``Any absence of action by the Commission that       allows a change to take effect under this section, including       the Commission allowing the sixty days' notice herein       provided to expire without Commission action, shall be       treated as an order issued by the Commission accepting such       change for purposes of section 313.''.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Upton) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Michigan?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Michigan?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as I complimented Mr. Welch, I want to thank Mr. Kennedy  for his leadership on this bill. I would note that we passed this bill  through regular order again in the last Congress, passed with  bipartisan support. It is appropriate that we bring it up early this  year. Again, this is another bipartisan bill. We must allow the public  to have administrative process relief in those cases where FERC does  not actually issue an order, and this legislation will do just that. I  urge passage of the bill.   The Federal Power Act sets forth processes to set rates for  electricity, including opportunities for the public to protest a rate  change filed with FERC. New rates take effect if FERC approves them or  if FERC fails to issue an order approving or denying the filed rate  within 60 days.   The failure to approve or deny a rate may result from agency delay  or, in some limited cases, from a vote that results in a deadlocked  Commission, for example, a 2-2 vote. In such cases, the rates become  effective by operation of law, even when these rates were not approved  by a majority of Commissioners.   The Federal Power Act, of course, provides administrative redress for  members of the public to protest Commission rate decisions. However, if  these rates become effective by operation of law, for example, that 2-2  deadlock, the administrative processes are not available to the public  because FERC did not actually issue an order for the public to protest.  The public literally gets shut out.   I don't want to speak for the gentleman from Massachusetts, but I  think some of his constituents recently experienced this firsthand. As  a result of that and of the hard work by Mr. Kennedy and of his staff  and certainly of the committee staff on both sides of the aisle, the  legislation was drafted. We considered it in committee during the 114th  Congress, where it passed on a voice vote. We have it on the floor  today.   I urge all Members to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter), a new member of the committee but an old hand in  Congress.                                time  1545     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would just like to reference the kind remarks by my friend, the  gentlewoman from Colorado. This is the start of the next Congress. We  are certainly looking forward to governing in a bipartisan way. That is  what our committee has done for hundreds of bills in the last number of  years. I look forward to that continued partnership. I know Chairman  Walden on the full committee looks forward to doing that as well.   This is just the first step, literally one of the first days,  obviously, in the new Trump administration, but we look forward to  working with the Senate to get this bill to the new administration and  get it signed into law, showing, again, the bipartisan support.   I want to compliment my friend, my colleague from Massachusetts (Mr.  Kennedy), for his good work on this. I urge my colleagues to vote  ``yes.''   I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 587, the  ``Fair Ratepayer Accountability, Transparency, and Efficiency Standards  Act'' (Fair RATES Act), which amends the Federal Power Act to permit  administrative and judicial review of any rate change filed by a public  utility that takes effect without the approval of the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission (FERC).   The need for this change became evident in the wake of a New England  Forward Capacity Market Auction in 2014, which occurred at a time when  FERC only had 4 Commissioners.   When the New England Forward Capacity Market Auction issue was  addressed by FERC, the Commissioners split evenly over the question of  whether the auction results were just and reasonable.   Since FERC did not disapprove the auction results, wholesale  electricity prices in New England increased dramatically; and   So, while rates went up, none of the affected parties could challenge  the decision or resulting rate increase, and, therefore, no rehearing  or judicial review was possible.   H.R. 587 provides those who want to challenge similar rulings or non- decisions by FERC the ability to challenge the decision  administratively or in the courts.   The bill ensures that stakeholders have recourse when a non-decision  by FERC has very real consequences for consumers, producers and others.   This bill would also improve the process by which FERC votes are  reconsidered.   I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 587.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 587.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 590) to foster civilian research and development of advanced  nuclear energy technologies and enhance the licensing and commercial  deployment of such technologies.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   H.R. 590         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Advanced Nuclear Technology       Development Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Nuclear energy generates approximately 20 percent of       the total electricity and approximately 60 percent of the       carbon-free electricity of the United States.        (2) Nuclear power plants operate consistently at a 90       percent capacity factor, and provide consumers and businesses       with reliable and affordable electricity.        (3) Nuclear power plants generate billions of dollars in       national economic activity through nationwide procurements       and provide thousands of Americans with high paying jobs       contributing substantially to the local economies in       communities where they operate.        (4) The United States commercial nuclear industry must       continue to lead the international civilian nuclear       marketplace, because it is one of our most powerful national       security tools, guaranteeing the safe, secure, and       exclusively peaceful use of nuclear energy.  [[Page H570]]         (5) Maintaining the Nation's nuclear fleet of commercial       light water reactors and expanding the use of new advanced       reactor designs would support continued production of       reliable baseload electricity and maintain United States       global leadership in nuclear power.        (6) Nuclear fusion technology also has the potential to       generate electricity with significantly increased safety       performance and no radioactive waste.        (7) The development of advanced reactor designs would       benefit from a performance-based, risk-informed, efficient,       and cost-effective regulatory framework with defined       milestones and the opportunity for applicants to demonstrate       progress through Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval.       SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Advanced nuclear reactor.--The term ``advanced nuclear       reactor'' means--        (A) a nuclear fission reactor with significant improvements       over the most recent generation of nuclear fission reactors,       which may include inherent safety features, lower waste       yields, greater fuel utilization, superior reliability,       resistance to proliferation, and increased thermal       efficiency; or        (B) a nuclear fusion reactor.        (2) Department.--The term ``Department'' means the       Department of Energy.        (3) Licensing.--The term ``licensing'' means NRC activities       related to reviewing applications for licenses, permits, and       design certifications, and requests for any other regulatory       approval for nuclear reactors within the responsibilities of       the NRC under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.        (4) National laboratory.--The term ``National Laboratory''       has the meaning given that term in section 2 of the Energy       Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 15801).        (5) NRC.--The term ``NRC'' means the Nuclear Regulatory       Commission.        (6) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of Energy.       SEC. 4. AGENCY COORDINATION.         The NRC and the Department shall enter into the a       memorandum of understanding regarding the following topics:        (1) Technical expertise.--Ensuring that the Department has       sufficient technical expertise to support the civilian       nuclear industry's timely research, development,       demonstration, and commercial application of safe, innovative       advanced reactor technology and the NRC has sufficient       technical expertise to support the evaluation of applications       for licenses, permits, and design certifications, and other       requests for regulatory approval for advanced reactors.        (2) Modeling and simulation.--The use of computers and       software codes to calculate the behavior and performance of       advanced reactors based on mathematical models of their       physical behavior.        (3) Facilities.--Ensuring that the Department maintains and       develops the facilities to enable the civilian nuclear       industry's timely research, development, demonstration, and       commercial application of safe, innovative reactor technology       and ensuring that the NRC has access to such facilities, as       needed.       SEC. 5. ADVANCED REACTOR REGULATORY FRAMEWORK.         (a) Plan Required.--Not later than 1 year after the date of       enactment of this Act, the NRC shall transmit to Congress a       plan for developing an efficient, risk-informed, technology-      neutral framework for advanced reactor licensing. The plan       shall evaluate the following subjects, consistent with the       NRC's role in protecting public health and safety and common       defense and security:        (1) The unique aspects of advanced reactor licensing and       any associated legal, regulatory, and policy issues the NRC       will need to address to develop a framework for licensing       advanced reactors.        (2) Options for licensing advanced reactors under existing       NRC regulations in title 10 of the Code of Federal       Regulations, a proposed new regulatory framework, or a       combination of these approaches.        (3) Options to expedite and streamline the licensing of       advanced reactors, including opportunities to minimize the       time from application submittal to final NRC licensing       decision and minimize the delays that may result from any       necessary amendments or supplements to applications.        (4) Options to expand the incorporation of consensus-based       codes and standards into the advanced reactor regulatory       framework to minimize time to completion and provide       flexibility in implementation.        (5) Options to make the advanced reactor licensing       framework more predictable. This evaluation should consider       opportunities to improve the process by which application       review milestones are established and maintained.        (6) Options to allow applicants to use phased review       processes under which the NRC issues approvals that do not       require the NRC to re-review previously approved information.       This evaluation shall consider the NRC's ability to review       and conditionally approve partial applications, early design       information, and submittals that contain design criteria and       processes to be used to develop information to support a       later phase of the design review.        (7) The extent to which NRC action or modification of       policy is needed to implement any part of the plan required       by this subsection.        (8) The role of licensing advanced reactors within NRC       long-term strategic resource planning, staffing, and funding       levels.        (9) Options to provide cost-sharing financial structures       for license applicants in a phased licensing process.        (b) Coordination and Stakeholder Input Required.--In       developing the plan required by subsection (a), the NRC shall       seek input from the Department, the nuclear industry, and       other public stakeholders.        (c) Cost and Schedule Estimate.--The plan required by       subsection (a) shall include proposed cost estimates,       budgets, and specific milestones for implementing the       advanced reactor regulatory framework by September 30, 2019.        (d) Design Certification Status.--In the NRC's first budget       request after the acceptance of any design certification       application for an advanced nuclear reactor, and annually       thereafter, the NRC shall provide the status of performance       metrics and milestone schedules. The budget request shall       include a plan to correct or recover from any milestone       schedule delays, including delays because of NRC's inability       to commit resources for its review of the design       certification applications.       SEC. 6. USER FEES AND ANNUAL CHARGES.         Section 6101(c)(2)(A) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation       Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 2214(c)(2)(A)) is amended--        (1) by striking ``and'' at the end of clause (iii);        (2) by striking the period at the end of clause (iv) and       inserting ``; and''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following:        ``(v) for fiscal years ending before October 1, 2020,       amounts appropriated to the Commission for activities related       to the development of regulatory infrastructure for advanced       nuclear reactor technologies.''.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Upton) and the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DeGette)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Michigan?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 590, the Advanced  Nuclear Technology Development Act of 2017.   This is a bipartisan bill. It passed in the last Congress as well. It  was cosponsored and led by Congressmen Latta and McNerney. And it will  help American innovators and entrepreneurs develop and license advanced  nuclear technologies. The U.S. will require reliable, baseload, and  affordable energy in decades to come, and nuclear power has to remain  an integral part of our electricity generation portfolio.   Unfortunately, an outdated and rigid regulatory regime will stifle  new nuclear technology development. This bill will help modernize the  regulatory framework for the 21st century to be adaptive, technology  inclusive, and certainly predictable.   Advanced nuclear technologies may provide breakthroughs in safety and  efficiency over the existing fleet of nuclear power plants. Absent the  proper regulatory framework, our nuclear scientists and industry will  look to other parts of the world to construct game-changing nuclear  technologies. So the U.S. has to remain a global leader to create and  maintain highly-paying and highly-skilled jobs right here at home.   This bill is a step towards ensuring that the NRC has the necessary  expertise and the resources to be able to review and license new  technologies and reactor designs, while appropriately collaborating  with the Department of Energy's nuclear energy research programs and  the private sector. With the Federal Government, national labs,  universities, and private industry all working together towards a  common goal, the future of nuclear industry energy is certainly bright.   In the last Congress, as I mentioned at the beginning, this  legislation passed unanimously out of the Energy and Commerce Committee  and passed the House by a voice vote. I am pleased to support this  legislation again, as part of our efforts to address burdensome regs  that stifle economic growth and new technologies. I urge all of my  colleagues to support it.   I reserve the balance of my time.   [[Page H571]]            House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space,             and Technology,                                  Washington, DC, January 23, 2017.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing concerning H.R. 590, the       ``Advanced Nuclear Technology Development Act of 2017,''       which was introduced on January 20, 2017.        H.R. 590 contains provisions within the Committee on       Science, Space, and Technology's Rule X jurisdiction. In       order to expedite this bill for floor consideration, the       Committee on Science, Space, and Technology will forego       action on the bill. This is being done on the basis of our       mutual understanding that doing so will in no way diminish or       alter the jurisdiction of the Committee on Science, Space,       and Technology with respect to the appointment of conferees,       or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject       matters contained in the bill or similar legislation.        I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming       this understanding, and would request that you include a copy       of this letter and your response in the Congressional Record       during the floor consideration of this bill. Thank you in       advance for your cooperation.            Sincerely,                                                       Lamar Smith,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                   Washington, DC, January 23, 2017.      Hon. Lamar Smith,      Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Smith: Thank you for your letter concerning       H.R. 590, Advanced Nuclear Technology Development Act of       2017.        As you noted, H.R. 590 contains provisions within the       Committee on Science, Space, and Technology's Rule X       jurisdiction. I appreciate your willingness to forego action       on the bill in order to expedite this bill for floor       consideration. I agree that doing so will in no way diminish       or alter the jurisdiction of the Committee on Science, Space,       and Technology with respect to the appointment of conferees,       or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject       matters contained in the bill or similar legislation.        I will place a copy of your letter and this response into       the Congressional Record during the Floor consideration of       this bill.            Sincerely,                                                       Greg Walden,                                                          Chairman.    Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 590, the Advanced  Nuclear Technology Development Act of 2017, introduced by  Representatives Latta and McNerney.   This bill would enhance coordination between the Nuclear Regulatory  Commission and the Department of Energy by requiring them to enter into  a memorandum of understanding on issues related to advanced nuclear  reactor technology.   This is a worthy goal, as the chairman said, and is a commonsense way  for the Federal Government to support the advanced nuclear power  industry. Advanced nuclear technologies have the potential to generate  power more safely and with less nuclear waste, which is why I believe  the Federal Government should be supporting advancements in nuclear  technology.   The bill also requires NRC to develop an advanced reactor regulatory  framework to evaluate options to expedite advanced reactor licensing  and to make it more predictable. NRC would have 1 year from the date of  enactment to submit this plan to Congress. In developing the plan, NRC  must also seek input from interested stakeholders, which I believe to  be a crucial part of this process.   Nuclear energy must play a continued role in our country's clean  energy future to enable us to reach our goals set forth in the Paris  climate agreement. I believe the Advanced Nuclear Technology  Development Act will enable the Federal Government to more efficiently  evaluate and support these promising nuclear technologies, which can  put us on a path towards greater reductions in carbon emissions.   I commend both Representatives Latta and McNerney for introducing  this important legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I don't believe we have any further speakers on this, so  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to again support this  legislating on a bipartisan basis, and I thank all of my colleagues for  speaking in support of it.   I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 590.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 518) to amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to exclude  power supply circuits, drivers, and devices designed to be connected  to, and power, light-emitting diodes or organic light-emitting diodes  providing illumination from energy conservation standards for external  power supplies, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 518         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Upton) and the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DeGette)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Michigan?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Michigan?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise certainly in support of H.R. 518.   Regulations are based on the state of technology at the time that  they are developed and may have the unintended consequences of  hindering new advances in products. Such has been the case with the  Department of Energy's efficiency standards for external power  suppliers, EPS. As the regs on the books now stand, it is not legally  possible to make certain types of light -emitting diode--LED--devices,  as well as some kinds of ceiling fans.   So this bill, H.R. 518, the EPS Improvement Act, provides a carefully  tailored solution to the problem. And I want to thank two Members,  Republican and Democrat, Mr. Guthrie and Ms. DeGette, for their good  work on behalf of both the manufacturers, as well as the users, of  these products.   The bill carves out an exception for these devices while giving DOE  the option of setting separate efficiency standards that are more  suited to them.   This bill has been thoroughly vetted--yes, it has. It was included in  last year's energy package. And although that bill didn't make it to  the finish line for unrelated reasons, language virtually identical to  that in H.R. 518 enjoyed very strong bipartisan and certain bicameral  support.                                time  1600    In addition, the bill passed the House on suspension last year as  well, but failed to make it on the Senate calendar.   For the sake of the manufacturing jobs that are associated with these  products as well as the consumers and small businesses that rely on  them, I would urge all of my colleagues to support and vote for H.R.  518.   I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today to urge the passage of H.R. 518, the EPS Improvement  Act.   Last session of Congress, I cosponsored this bill with our former  colleague Congresswoman Ellmers, and this year, Representatives  Guthrie, Matsui, and Dent are joining me in this effort to strengthen  the standards used to keep LED lighting safe and efficient.   By ensuring that our country's energy conservation standards are up  to date with the latest developments in high-tech lighting, we can  remove obstacles to innovation without sacrificing safety. And as we  heard from the chairman, if there has ever been a bill in Congress that  was vetted, it was this one.   We have been working on this bill for some years now, and, frankly,  what it is doing is it is truly addressing unintended consequences that  happened due to the Energy Policy Act of 2005. That act defined  external power supplies in a way that just simply did not anticipate  the rapid growth and use of LED and OLED light sources during the  decade that followed.   Now, these lights are really energy efficient. They are up to 80  percent more efficient than traditional lights like fluorescent and  incandescent lights, and 90 percent of the energy in LEDs is committed  to illumination, while only 5 percent is heat; so it is no wonder they  have become so popular in the last 10 years. Unfortunately, in the 2005  act, the standards did not allow for these types of lighting as their  use continues to constitute an ever-growing share of our energy  consumption.   What this bill does is it clarifies the definition of ``external  power supplies'' and it amends the conditions under which the Energy  Department can undertake a rulemaking process in the future. The bill  will facilitate the continued growth of LED lighting, and it will help  lower energy prices for businesses and households both in my home State  of Colorado and across America.   Clean energy truly is the future. It can be safe, efficient, and  affordable for all when it is properly regulated, and that is exactly  what this legislation does.   I urge everybody to support this act, and I hope that the Senate will  pass it this year. We are getting a good, early start.   Mr. Speaker, I have no one else to speak on this bill, so I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers on this side of  the aisle either.   I would urge my colleagues on both sides to again vote for this bill.  Let's hope that the Senate can get it on their plate and get it to the  President for him to sign into law.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R., 518.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.
