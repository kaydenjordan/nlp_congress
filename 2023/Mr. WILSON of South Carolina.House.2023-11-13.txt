 Last night, on ``Sunday Night in  America with Trey Gowdy'' on FOX News, Senator Tim Scott suspended his  Republican Presidential campaign.   In his decision, the Senator said, ``I love America more today than I  did on May 22. . . . I am suspending my campaign. I think the voters,  who are the most remarkable people on the planet, have been really  clear that they are telling me: Not now, Tim.''   He has served since 2011 as a Congressman and then followed as a  Senator since 2013. Growing up in North Charleston with his inspiring  mother, Frances, Tim Scott has two brothers: Ben, an Army Command  sergeant major, and Earl, an Air Force colonel.   On Friday, to celebrate Diwali, I met with Consul General Ramesh Babu  of India, where I recognized the three countries most attacked by  terrorists are India, America, and Israel, with Israel tomorrow being  appreciated with AIPAC a part of the rally fighting dictators, as is  Ukraine fighting war criminal Putin.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from Afghanistan's safe haven to America with Biden's open borders.                            ____________________
