 Madam Speaker, yes, this is an area  that I have worked on for some time, northern long-eared bats. I have  actually spent a lot of time in caves with a Pennsylvania bat biologist  who works for the Pennsylvania Game Commission, where we did bat  counts.   We looked at white-nose syndrome, which really has nothing to do with  humans. This is a fungus. I think it has been around now for at least  20 years. In 2013, we had this same debate. In October 2013, there was  an effort to try to list these northern long-eared bats as endangered.  It was an extended debate.   Quite frankly, under the Obama administration, just a few years  later, we were successful in keeping them from being listed as  endangered. They were listed as threatened because what we needed more  than anything else was research. We have provided that research now for  10 years, and there are good findings. We know that the temperature  within those dwellings where they hibernate, the colder the  temperature, the more that we can reduce how often they wake up. Quite  frankly, it is when they wake up, when their hibernation is interrupted  that weakens the bat, and they have more difficulties reproducing  because they just don't have the energy for it, I guess.   This is like, here we go again. The distinguished ranking member  mentioned Groundhog Day. I thank him for doing that. That is my  district, Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, Groundhog Day. Here we are again,  trying to relitigate through the Biden administration something that  doesn't line up with the science. The science has already been  established in the past.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this joint  resolution to nullify the final rule classifying the northern long- eared bat as an endangered species as inappropriate. We need to  continue to do the research. We need to allow the professionals to  continue the work that they are doing and making the advancements that  they are doing on how we can help with the environment to mitigate  that.   The U.S. bat population plays an extremely important role in  Pennsylvania's ecosystem and, quite frankly, America's number one  industry, which is agriculture. The existing classification of the  northern long-eared bats as a threatened species does not help the  bats. It does not help the bats. We need to strike a balance between  species conservation and economic activity.   Uplisting this species is shortsighted, and this top-down approach to  species conservation is inflexible and outdated. There is no question  this bat population has been in decline, but it is important to  understand why. Study after study, including by Penn State University,  which is in my district, has shown the decline is attributed to white- nose syndrome. This is a disease, a fungus that has no cure and is not  caused by human activity.   With this decision, the Biden administration is punishing small  businesses, farmers, foresters, energy producers, those who transmit  electricity because this would impact the ability to clear fallen  timber off of power lines. I mean, the impact is just extensive, to  cover the cost of something they have no control over.   This uplisting will delay everything from broadband expansion to  critical infrastructure repairs. Restrictions accompanying this  decision will have significant and detrimental economic impacts in my  district and others across the region. There is zero evidence that  listing this bat as endangered will stop the spread of this disease.                                time  1445    It is vital a decision of this magnitude be based on actual data and  real science, not political science, and include input from impacted  communities and landowners.   As we search for a cure, States should be able to take the lead on  local, voluntary conservation efforts that help affected populations.   I support this joint resolution which protects landowners from  unnecessary government regulation, and I urge all of my colleagues to  do so, as well.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize  National Intern Day. Today is dedicated to recognizing and celebrating  the future leaders of the world: interns.   National Intern Day has served as an opportunity for thousands of  employers to commemorate and thank their hardworking interns.   At this time I recognize and thank the interns who joined me this  summer, both in my personal office and on the Agriculture Committee.   Justin and Tessa served in my personal office and have been  instrumental in helping serve the people of Pennsylvania's 15th  Congressional District. Bailee, Callie, and Kylie help support myself  and the Agriculture Committee staff through dozens of hearings,  roundtables, and other committee events as we work toward crafting a  farm bill.   From conducting research to drafting speeches and statements to  guiding tours and responding to constituents, these interns were  fantastic additions to my team this summer.   Mr. Speaker, our interns today are truly the leaders of tomorrow, and  they deserve recognition for their outstanding work. I thank them again  for joining us this summer.                            ____________________
