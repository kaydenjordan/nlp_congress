 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support this bipartisan  resolution supporting the people of Ukraine.   As the chairman said, I was in Ukraine just a few weeks ago, in the  beautiful city of Kyiv. I met the very people who today, despite facing  a ruthless enemy, are waging an inspiring campaign to save their  democracy, including a young woman who told me she was going to get her  white wine and Kalashnikov and defend her country. And she is.   This resolution tells the world, and most importantly the Ukrainian  people, that the United States Congress stands with you. President  Biden has used every tool at his disposal to unite the world in  punishing Vladimir Putin for his unprovoked and unjustified war, and  Congress will act to provide more resources to that effort.   Because our work continues to further help Ukraine defend itself and  further isolate Russia. Putin has a choice: To pursue his long-term  strategic goals or to continue this unnecessary and illegal war on  Ukraine. He cannot do both.   We are united as a country and as a Congress in standing with the  people of Ukraine in their fight for their democracy. I urge all of my  colleagues to vote ``yes.''
