 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize  Geater Machining and Manufacturing of Independence, IA, as the Senate  Small Business of the Week.   Geater Machining and Manufacturing was founded by Duane Geater in  Independence, IA, in 1962. The company started with Duane, a single  employee, and Collins Aerospace as their first client. In 1964, the  company took on the name Geater Machining, Co. and started a  manufacturing division. The company moved to a new location in  Independence in 1965 before constructing their current 42,000-square- foot headquarters in 1976. In 1994, Duane retired and his son Scott  Geater took over as president. Under Scott's leadership, Geater  Machining and Manufacturing added 20,000 square feet to their current  location in 2023. Duane Geater passed away in 2012, leaving behind a  legacy of hard work, service, and manufacturing excellence.   Geater Machining and Manufacturing is an exemplary family business.  Three generations of the Geater family have worked at the company, and  their products have been instrumental in U.S. history. On May 2, 2011,  SEAL Team Six carried out Operation Neptune Spear and killed Osama Bin  Laden. The helicopters used to transport them on the mission were  equipped with radio equipment manufactured with Geater Machining and  Manufacturing parts.   Geater Machining and Manufacturing is actively involved in both the  Independence and Buchannan County communities and have been recognized  for their hard work. They are actively involved in student outreach,  including hosting tours of their facilities, classroom activities, and  apprenticeship programs for local students. They won the Heritage Award  for setting the industry standard by Rockwell Collins at their Annual  Supplier Conference in 2015. In 2016, they were awarded the President's  Award for top supplier by Rockwell Collins. In 2016, they were also  highlighted by Manufacturing Today for their contributions and history  in the manufacturing and machining industry. Due to their team's hard  work, Geater Machining and Manufacturing celebrated its 61st business  anniversary in 2023.   Geater Machining and Manufacturing's commitment to providing high- quality precision machining, sheet metal fabrication, and finishing  operations to customers throughout the United States while maintaining  their Independence roots is clear. I want to congratulate the Geater  family and the entire team at Geater Machining and Manufacturing for  their continued dedication to providing high quality parts to clients  across the country. I look forward to seeing their continued growth and  success in Iowa.                            ____________________
