 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of title XXXV add the following:       SEC. __. RECOURSE FOR NON-U.S. SEAMEN.         Section 57103 of title 46, United States Code, is amended       by adding at the end the following:        ``(g) Restriction.--(1) Notwithstanding section 30104, a       claim for damages or expenses relating to personal injury,       illness, or death of a seaman who is a citizen of a foreign       nation, arising during or from the engagement of the seaman       by or for a passenger vessel duly registered under the laws       of a foreign nation or a vessel identified as obsolete under       subsection (a) or acquired under chapter 563, may not be       brought under the laws of the United States if--        ``(A) such seaman was not a legal permanent resident of the       United States at the time the claim arose;        ``(B) the injury, illness, or death arose outside the       territorial waters of the United States; and        ``(C) the seaman or the seaman's personal representative       has or had a right to seek compensation for the injury,       illness, or death in, or under the laws of--        ``(i) the nation in which the vessel was registered at the       time the claim arose; or        ``(ii) the nation in which the seaman maintained       citizenship or residency at the time the claim arose.        ``(2) Compensation defined.--As used in paragraph (1), the       term `compensation' means--        ``(A) a statutory workers' compensation remedy that       complies with Standard A4.2 of Regulation 4.2 of the Maritime       Labour Convention, 2006; or        ``(B) in the absence of the remedy described in paragraph       (1), a legal remedy that complies with Standard A4.2 of       Regulation 4.2 of the Maritime Labour Convention, 2006, that       permits recovery for lost wages, pain and suffering, and       future medical expenses.''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 440, the gentleman  from California (Mr. Hunter) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.    Mr. Chairman, this important amendment would help  safeguard U.S. courts against crowding of court dockets by foreign  maritime crewmembers. It simply clarifies where the claim must be  brought when the case has no meaningful connection to the United  States.   Specifically, the amendment limits the ability of foreign crewmembers  working on foreign ships in foreign waters to sue in U.S. courts when a  remedy is available in their home countries or the country of the ship  on which they served. If no such remedy is available abroad, the  amendment would allow those crewmembers to file suit in the United  States, assuming they could meet the same burden needed to file any  other suit.   To be clear, again, this amendment in no way restricts a foreign  crewmember's access to judicial relief if they are injured or suffer  some other damage as a result of working on a foreign vessel. It simply  says that they need to seek relief in their home country or the home  country of the vessel on which they served before seeking relief in  U.S. courts.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wilson).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wilson).    Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 2\3/4\ minutes  remaining.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   This amendment limits the ability of foreign crewmembers working on  foreign ships in foreign waters to sue in U.S. courts when a remedy is  available in their home country or the country of the ship on which  they serve. That is it.   They can still sue. Trial lawyers around the world can rejoice  because these crewmembers can come back to their home countries and  they can sue and sue and sue. They just can't do it in the U.S. if it  didn't happen in U.S. waters. It is that simple.   Again, a foreign mariner operating on a foreign ship in foreign or  international waters should avail themselves of the courts in their  home country or the vessel's home country before using U.S. courts.  That is it.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
