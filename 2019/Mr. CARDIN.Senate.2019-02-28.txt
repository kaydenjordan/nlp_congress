 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the  service and achievements of Ms. Chris Correale, director of harbor  development for the Maryland Port Administration, upon her retirement.   Chris Correale is the ultimate example of a public servant whose  expertise and efforts while unknown to the majority of Maryland's  residents, have been critical to Maryland's economy and environment.   An expert in U.S. Army Corps of Engineers processes, Chris has spent  more than 25 years crafting and implementing innovative and  collaborative Federal and State beneficial reuse projects that kept the  Port of Baltimore's shipping channels open and improved the environment  in the Chesapeake Bay. From dredging, construction, beach  replenishment, habitat restoration, and permitting, Chris has been the  visionary behind the development of projects that have significantly  improved the infrastructure, environment, business climate, regional  partnerships, and economic development opportunities throughout the  State of Maryland.   At the Maryland Port Administration, Chris ensured the Port of  Baltimore's channels are in top condition for maritime traffic serving  the port. She oversaw the planning and policy of what to do with the  dredged material, she secured State and Federal funding for the port,  and she coordinated multi-agency management of the port's aids to  navigation systems.   Prior to joining the Maryland Port Administration, Chris had a  distinguished career as the chief of the operations division of the  U.S. Army Corps' Baltimore District. By overseeing the Baltimore  District's navigation program, Chris was instrumental in the  operations, maintenance, protection, and restoration of Maryland's  ports, military installations, levees, Federal channels, island  habitats, and reservoirs.   Chris's retirement is a loss for the State of Maryland. Her vision,  expertise, and extraordinary social skills have enabled her to  successfully navigate the Federal, State, and local forces to bring so  many critical projects to fruition. She has significantly improved the  infrastructure, environment, and business climate throughout the State  of Maryland, and she will be missed. Therefore, it is my honor to  recognize the contributions of Ms. Chris Correale to the State of  Maryland and thank her for her years of valuable service.                            ____________________
