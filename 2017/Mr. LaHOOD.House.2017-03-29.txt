 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Lamar Smith for yielding  time and for his leadership on this important issue.   Mr. Speaker, my district in central and west central Illinois is home  to some of the most fertile farmland in the entire world. My district  is the ninth largest congressional district in terms of corn and  soybean production. With that said, farming families across the 19  counties I represent are faced every day with burdensome rules and  regulations created by the EPA with little or no transparency into the  data that influenced those regulations in the first place.   These rules and regulations have and continue to cause real-world  consequences to the agriculture community. Moreover, these EPA  directives have far greater reach outside the realm of just farmers.   Manufacturing and trade industries in my district have also seen a  direct negative impact from these agency actions. They have continued  to hurt the ability of these industries to create jobs and economic  opportunities in central and west central Illinois.   As such, I am here today in support of the HONEST Act, which  encourages a more open and transparent Federal Government. It requires  data and studies used by Federal agencies in the rulemaking process to  be made publicly available to the American people and independent  scientists. The goal is to promote more accountability for Washington,  D.C., bureaucracies, such as the EPA.   The bottom line is costly Federal regulations should only be based  upon data that is comprised of sound science and that can withstand  scrutiny and review.   Simply put, the HONEST Act is a step in the right direction to  restore trust in the EPA and in Federal bureaucracies.
