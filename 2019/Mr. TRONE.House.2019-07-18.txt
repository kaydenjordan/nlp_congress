Mr. Speaker, I have a unique perspective on this issue. I  was a businessman. Before I ran for Congress, I founded a small  business with just a few employees. Now, I own a business with over  7,000 employees in 25 States.   At my company, we understand that if you take care of your team  members by paying them a living wage, they will take care of our  customers, and our business will do better because of it. Everyone  wins.   This isn't hypothetical for me. My business operates in many cities,  like Seattle, with a $15 minimum wage. When the laws changed, we didn't  cut jobs, and our business did not suffer. Quite the opposite.   When we raise the wage, we see 1.3 million Americans lifted out of  poverty, 600,000 of whom are children; we see families who can afford  their rent, healthcare, and other necessities; and we see a stronger  economy.   When we raise the wage, we see a win for business, a win for working  families, and a win for our economy.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Scott for his leadership on this  critically important issue, and I urge my colleagues to support this  bill.
