 Madam President, I rise to speak on healthcare, but I  ask unanimous consent that I be able to conclude my remarks prior to  going into executive session.    Madam President, I rise to speak against the  Republican effort and what it appears to be thus far to repeal the  Affordable Care Act and the process they are using to do it.   I just have to say, this is the least transparent process for a major  piece of legislation I have seen in my 24 years in the Senate. Former  Senate Historian Don Ritchie said that you have to look back before  World War I to find another example of such a secret, partisan process  for passing a major bill.   The Senate healthcare bill in fact is being written behind closed  doors. There is no draft for public review. No Democratic Senator has  seen the bill. Republican Senators all say they haven't seen the bill  either.   When Republican Senators are asked what is in the bill, unless they  are the 13 privileged ones, they say they have no idea. Everyone except  the 13 Republicans drafting this bill has been excluded, and these 13  Senators represent just 10 States out of our 50. Health experts and  health advocacy organizations have been shut out. No one representing  doctors, nurses, patients, children, the elderly, hospitals, community  clinics, or health plans is able to provide any feedback at all on how  the bill would affect people.   Over the weekend, the Los Angeles Times reported that a coalition of  more than 15 patient groups, including the American Heart Association,  the March of Dimes, and the American Lung Association, tried to get a  meeting with Senator McConnell or his staff and were told no. That is  unbelievable.   Think of it. Think of the American Heart Association, the March of  Dimes, the American Lung Association asking to meet with either the  leader or his staff, and somebody says no. Do my Republican colleagues  really believe that groups like the American Heart Association don't  deserve an opportunity to weigh in on a healthcare bill when our  healthcare system affects every single person in this country?  Healthcare is the last subject that should be addressed behind closed  doors, hidden from public view. Yet, apparently, Republicans intend to  bring the bill to the floor without a single hearing. Senator McConnell  wants to vote on a bill by next Thursday, I am told. That is 10 days  from now. Well, if there is not going to be a hearing, we shouldn't  vote. I think: no hearing, no vote.   It is important to point out the contrast between what is happening  now and our consideration of the Affordable Care Act, known as  ObamaCare. There were 100 hearings, meetings, roundtables, and  walkthroughs of the bill between the Senate Finance and the HELP  Committees. There were 25 consecutive days and 160 hours of debate on  the Senate floor. There were 300 HELP Committee amendments, including  more than 160 Republican amendments.   Was our process in 2009 and 2010 perfect? No, it wasn't, but it was  infinitely better than what is happening now. This process is such an  affront to our democratic system of government.   Senator Harris and I represent California. We are the sixth largest  economy in the world. We represent more than 40 million people. That is  more than 22 other States combined.   Fourteen million Californians are covered by the Medicaid Program,  the program the House bill says we are going to stop the funding for.  Fourteen million Californians are more people than the entire  population of 9 of the 10 States represented in the secret healthcare  negotiations. Four million Californians gained health coverage under  the Affordable Care Act--more people than the population of 4 of the 10  States represented in the secret negotiations. Despite the significant  effects that any healthcare bill would have on California, both of its  Senators have been shut out.  [[Page S3572]]    I want to work to improve the Affordable Care Act. I know there are  challenges we need to address, and I want to be part of the process,  but there is no opportunity to do so.   If the Senate bill is anything like the House bill, the effects would  be devastating to my State. If the Senate bill is like the House bill,  here is what it would do: It would take healthcare coverage away from  23 million working and middle-class families to finance a tax cut for  the richest 5 percent of Americans. This is indefensible. There is no  justification for giving millionaires a $50,000 tax break by taking  healthcare away from our most vulnerable citizens. I don't know of any  who are asking for it. It is some kind of blighted political agenda  that you could leave the elderly and the sick untended, and it  justifies a $50,000 tax break for a millionaire.    This would end Medicaid as we have known it for 50 years by cutting  $834 billion. It eliminates protections for people with preexisting  conditions. It defunds Planned Parenthood. It denies all Californians  and New Yorkers--all of them--tax credits, unless the States change  their laws requiring insurance companies to cover reproductive care,  including abortion services. It is almost a blackmail provision.   I am going to talk more about the potential changes to Medicaid,  known as Medi-Cal, because they are startling. Everyone needs to  understand that the changes Republicans have proposed--and we think are  proposing for the Senate bill--go much further than repealing the  expansion of the program, which was a big part of the Affordable Care  Act.   It has been reported in the media that Senate Republicans are looking  at changes to Medicaid that are similar to what is in the House bill.  There are rumors that the Senate bill would delay the drastic cuts by a  few years. But, regardless, when cuts to the program come, they will be  devastating.   Whom does Medicaid provide healthcare for? It is not the wealthy. It  is elderly people in nursing homes. It is pregnant women. It is  children. It is people with disabilities, and it is low-income adults  who typically work but don't get health insurance through their jobs.   Medicaid covers one in three Californians; that is 14 million people.  It covers one in two children. It covers three out of five residents in  nursing homes. It covers one in two people with disabilities.   Here is something the American people need to understand about  Medicaid: The majority of Medicaid dollars are spent on elderly people  and people with disabilities. They are the most in need, and they have  the most serious health issues.   Let me give you one story. A woman by the name of Kristen from  Sacramento wrote to us about her daughter Riley, who is autistic. Riley  is covered by Medi-Cal. It provides critical services that allow her to  lead a more normal childhood. Here is what the mother said:         When my daughter Riley was born we quickly learned that she       had difficulty with basic tasks like sleeping and eating.        She developed pneumonia multiple times and was continually       sick.        After turning three, she was diagnosed with autism. Riley       is now eight years old and is thriving thanks to Medicaid-      funded support programs like physical therapy, speech       therapy, and feeding therapy.        She is now verbal, learning to write, and reading above       grade level. She wouldn't be doing this well if it weren't       for Medicaid. I am counting on you to protect Medicaid.    Every community in California depends on Medicaid. Let me give you a  few examples.   Members of both political parties go to Los Angeles to raise money.  Forty percent of L.A. County is covered by Medicaid. Do you know how  many that is? It is not a half a million. It is not a million. It is  not a million and a half. It is not 2 or 3 million. It is 4 million  people who could lose Medicaid funding.   Twenty-eight percent of San Diego is covered by Medi-Cal; that is  more than 900,000 people. And 37 percent of Sacramento County is  covered by Medi-Cal; that is 560,000 people. Half of Fresno County is  covered by Medi-Cal; that is one-half million people.   I was in Fresno just a week ago. There is a wonderful children's  hospital. The director of that hospital came over to me and was  practically in tears. He said: We treat 300,000 children up and down  this area of the State, and if we lose our Medicaid, we cannot continue  to provide that treatment--if that takes place.   Fresno has 31 assisted living facilities for the sick, for the  elderly, and three out of five beds in that facility are Medicaid.  Twenty-seven percent of San Francisco County, my home county, is  covered by Medi-Cal; that is 230,000 people. What Republicans, we have  learned, may likely propose would end the Medicaid program as we have  known it for more than 50 years.   Under current law, the Federal Government pays a certain percentage  of all healthcare costs for Medi-Cal beneficiaries. We will likely see  a phase-out of the current structure of the program that would amount  to $834 billion, cut over 10 years, with 14 million people losing  Medicaid coverage nationwide.   They will be in your State, Madam President. They will be in every  State on the Republican side of the aisle, and I don't know how a  civilized society or a Senate of the United States could do that to  people.   The effects of this change could devastate access to healthcare for  our most vulnerable citizens and crush State budgets nationwide if they  try to replace those funds.   Bottom line, in my State, by 2027, California would need to find $24  billion to cover those who depend on Medicaid for their healthcare  today.   What is going to happen with preexisting conditions? We all know that  the ObamaCare legislation covers preexisting conditions, so if you have  breast cancer, you can get coverage. But you could be charged $28,000  more per year if the preexisting condition of breast cancer isn't  covered. It goes on and on like this. If you take away coverage for  preexisting conditions and you have, as we have, 52 million people  nationwide--including 6 million in California--who have preexisting  conditions today, that will be a huge problem for them.   Let me give you one case of a woman from Hesperia, CA. She wrote to  us about her 37-year-old son. He has battled Crohn's disease for 28  years. Lisa writes:         My son was without insurance for 10 years because of his       pre-existing condition.    That was before ObamaCare.         During this time the disease caused severe damage to his       small intestine. He was finally able to get insurance through       Covered California and received treatment.    That was after ObamaCare passed.         He had surgery to remove various blockages and scar tissue       and probably saved his life. I am so scared that his coverage       may be taken away.    How can we do that?   Sherry, from Sierra Madre, CA, wrote to me about her two sons. They  both have preexisting conditions. She says:         As a single mother of two young men just out of college,       each with pre-existing conditions, I fear they will not be       able to afford health care under the GOP plan.        One son has Lyme disease and requires infusions every three       weeks.        This is a huge expense that is currently manageable under       my health care plan and has been a life-saver for him as the       Lyme impacted his immune system.        Under TrumpCare this treatment would probably not be       financially available for him. That would be devastating for       him.    Let me tell you about something we have found out about. I look at my  phone calls, and we get a lot of calls. I know something is serious  when we get more than 100,000 calls, and we did on this subject. These  were largely people between the ages of 50 and 64, and they weren't in  the group market. They were in the individual market, which means you  go out to find your own insurance company and you pay the premium.   Under ObamaCare, there is a subsidy for these premiums if you earn  under 400 percent of poverty; 400 percent of poverty is about $47,000 a  year. If you earn under $47,000 a year, it is much easier to get  healthcare. If you are at $50,000 a year, you exceed the 400 percent of  poverty.   I am told by Covered California that the current premium in my city  for someone 50 to 64 would be $800 a month. That is 20 percent of  someone's income--20 percent of an annual income.   This is where the complaints are coming throughout the United States,  and this is where we can make an easy fix. A number of us have  submitted legislation to do just that. What it would do is take the  subsidy, and instead of going off the cliff at $47,000 a year--so  [[Page S3573]]  that at $50,000 your premium costs 20 percent of your income--we  changed it so that an individual would not pay more than 9.69 percent  of their income toward the premium.   This is one example of how we could improve current law and, I  believe, take away one of the biggest criticisms and fix it rather  easily.   Here is another problem. I wish to share a story from Monica of  Oceanside, CA. These are real cases. She was diagnosed with breast  cancer shortly after gaining coverage through California's individual  market. Her doctor told her she would have been dead, had she not been  covered by her new plan. She had cared for her father 10 years prior to  his death from Parkinson's disease. She didn't have access to employer- provided insurance and wasn't eligible for Medicaid at the time.   By the time the Affordable Care Act was implemented, she qualified  for a plan through Covered California. She wrote: ``Without the ACA, I  would not be alive to write this post.''   I wonder if that means anything to anyone on the Republican side of  the aisle. No one comes forward; no one says what they would need. This  is such a big issue. It affects every single one of us and every single  one of our constituents.   Let me correct something. They also say: Well, ObamaCare is dead; it  is imploding.   They say this to build support for repealing the law, but they are  wrong. In California, which has worked hard to implement the law  effectively, the marketplace to buy health coverage functions at a high  level.   There are 1.5 million people signed up through the website Covered  California. Enrollments have been stable, and there has been no uptick  in healthy people leaving the insurance market.   The general consensus among experts is that the Federal healthcare  market is not collapsing. Standard & Poor's said that ``2016 results  and the market enrollment so far in 2017 show that the ACA individual  market is not in a `death spiral.' '' So, please, stop saying that.    In closing, I would like to just say to my Republican colleagues:  Don't do this. Don't write a bill in secret. Don't take healthcare away  from millions of people to cut taxes for the rich. Don't undermine  protections for people with preexisting conditions. Don't allow  insurers to go back to the days of selling junk plans. Don't end  Medicaid. We have known it for so long. It is working. It is covering  poor and elderly all across this country.   Those of us on this side of the aisle want to make the Affordable  Care Act better. We want to work to improve our system. We stand ready  to work together on behalf of our constituents, but if our colleagues  continue down this path, we will fight this bill with all we have. The  stakes are too high not to.   Thank you. I yield the floor.                            ____________________
