 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my good friend from  Texas (Mr. Sessions), the chairman of the Committee on Rules, for  yielding me this time.   I am certainly in favor of the Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017,  which I think will provide necessary transparency in the regulatory  process by requiring agencies to post all public comments issued during  a proposed rulemaking, which sounds simple enough. I cosponsored this  legislation because I strongly believe, and I firmly believe, the  public comment process is critical to ensure Federal regulations are  drafted to protect the American people and not to punish them.   Unfortunately, far too often, agencies either ignore or fail to  incorporate the public's input and suggestions when proposing and  finalizing these important rules. Many regulatory actions impose  billions of dollars in compliance and other costs on industries, on  consumers, on small businesses, on farmers, and on families while  bureaucrats ignore the meaningful input, suggested improvements, and  the real concerns being voiced by the very people that will be most  affected by their actions.   Mr. Speaker, this measure requires more transparency and  accountability of Federal agency communications about proposed and  pending regulations. Agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency  have continually violated Federal laws and appropriations restrictions  that prohibit the use of Federal funds for lobbying, advocacy, and  propaganda efforts.   I know many are aware of the EPA's unlawful social media campaign  advocating for the waters of the United States rule, the WOTUS rule;  however, an even more egregious example recently occurred in my own  home State of Washington. The EPA-funded What's Upstream campaign used  grant awards to fund a website, radio ads, and billboards depicting  dead fish and polluted water, alleging that farmers and the agriculture  industry were responsible. The website helped visitors email their  State legislators to advocate for 100-foot stream buffer zones around  farms and other agricultural operations, despite prohibitions against  such advocacy.   As a lifelong farmer, I have got to tell you, Mr. Speaker, I was  insulted by the blatant lies this campaign had spread about farmers;  and as a Member of Congress, I am outraged that the EPA continues to  award grant funding to the entities responsible for this, I think,  despicable and deceitful antifarmer campaign. I believe Congress must  ensure Federal agencies follow the law to prevent future libelous  campaigns like What's Upstream from ever receiving another cent of  taxpayer dollars.    H.R. 1004 prohibits lobbying in support of proposed rules and  requires agencies to track the details of all public communications  about pending regulatory actions, while establishing clear standards  for prohibited activities. This will guarantee that both the public and  Congress understand how Federal agencies communicate with the public  about pending regulations, and these reasonable restrictions will  support transparency and accountability across the Federal Government.   Mr. Speaker, agencies should consider comments from the public and  incorporate reasonable changes so that proposed Federal regulations can  be revised and refined using that valuable public feedback before they  are finalized. However, too often, Federal bureaucrats simply go  through the motions and end up ignoring the public's input while they  happily flout Federal law and create campaigns designed to garner  support for their preferred proposals. Federal agencies must not treat  their proposed regulations as final. By doing so, they are ignoring the  voice and the will of the American people.   I urge my colleagues to support this important rule and the  underlying bill; then, together, we can return transparency, we can  return accountability, and we can return public input to the Federal  rulemaking process once and for all.                                time  1300
