 Madam Speaker, I rise today to applaud President  Biden and House Democrats' efforts to lower the cost of goods for  hardworking American families.   As we have seen, war criminal Putin has caused price hikes by way of  his cruel war on Ukraine. As a result, Americans are seeing rising  costs at the gas pump and the grocery stores and across the shelves of  stores.   While extreme MAGA Republicans have chosen to play the blame game,  President Biden and House Democrats have decided to take action.  Together, we are delivering results.   We have passed key bills like the Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act,  which will strengthen supply chains and produce cleaner and cheaper  gas. This will lead to lower prices.   You see, Democrats are laser focused on lowering costs for  hardworking families, not helping greedy billionaires and greedy  companies. Together, we will continue building a better America.                            ____________________
