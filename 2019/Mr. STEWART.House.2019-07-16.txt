 Mr. Chairman, as the designee of the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Burgess), I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment is very simple. It adds the  House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Senate Health, Education,  Labor, and Pensions Committee to the list of committees that will  receive a briefing from the Director of National Intelligence on  emerging infectious disease and pandemics.   The Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health has jurisdiction over  all public health and quarantine, as well as the Centers for Disease  Control.   Given the Energy and Commerce Committee's and the Senate Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee's jurisdiction over the  Assistant Secretary of Preparedness and Response, which plays an  integral role in our Nation's public health and security, it is  imperative that these committees be included in this briefing.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1930     Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman for supporting the  amendment. I urge adoption of the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time    Mr. Chair, again I rise as the designee of Mr. Burgess,  and I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, once again, my amendment is simple. It  directs the Secretary of Homeland Security, in collaboration with the  Director of National Intelligence, Chairman of the Federal  Communications Commission, and appropriate private entities, to  undertake an effort to remove or neutralize unauthorized international  mobile subscriber identity catchers, or cell-site simulators, installed  by foreign entities or that have an unknown attribution.   International mobile subscriber identities, IMSI, catchers, or cell- site simulators, are devices used for intercepting mobile traffic and  location data. They appear to be legitimate cell phone towers that  nearby phones may connect to. Once connected, phone locations can be  tracked.   Some advanced IMSI catchers can even read content, such as messages  and cell phone data. Much remains unknown about the proliferation of  these devices, particularly in the national capital region. However, we  do know that foreign actors have access to and have used these devices.   It is imperative that our intelligence community, with the relevant  agencies and private industry partners, undertake an effort to  neutralize unauthorized IMSI catchers.   Mr. Chair, I urge support of this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
