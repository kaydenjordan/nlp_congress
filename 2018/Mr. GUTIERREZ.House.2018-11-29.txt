 Mr. Speaker, when I was born, separate but equal was  the law of the land. Even in a northern city like Chicago, a young  Puerto Rican kid knew where he could and could not go, which beaches  and pools were open to him, and which were off-limits.   Segregation and discrimination by race, gender, religion, and sexual  orientation were deeply embedded in the customs and culture of our  society, and upheld by the State and Federal Government.   So as I prepare to leave office after 26 years representing the  people of the Fourth District of Illinois, I think it is important to  reflect on how far we have come and how far we still have to go before  this country lives up to its lofty ideals enshrined in our most sacred  documents and origin mythology.   That a Puerto Rican born in Chicago in 1953, 65 years ago, the son of  Spanish-speaking immigrants with little education who were driven by  poverty from the mountains of Puerto Rico, would be able to speak into  this microphone at all is perhaps a ringing endorsement for what this  Nation stands for.   But let us be clear: People sacrificed and died so that I could speak  here today. People I never met, like Medgar Evers, Emmett Till, and  countless others, died in the struggle against discrimination and  American apartheid, and opened the path for me to be here today.   The Voting Rights Act and other civil rights legislation passed in my  lifetime on this floor were soaked in the blood of martyrs, old and  young, who kept moving forward until everyone had the right to vote and  every vote was counted.   Even as the President and his party challenge the principles of the  Voting Rights Act today, I have always tried to honor those who have  given their lives to make America freer and stronger.   To be blunt, were it not for the sacrifice of Black Americans, Black  people in this country and their allies, who literally had their homes  and churches bombed fighting to make this country live up to its own  creed, I would not be here speaking to you today. That has always and  will always guide me.   When the Fourth District was created to give Latinos an opportunity  in Chicago to have a voice in Congress, I was the first to win that  seat. While the majority of my constituents then in 1992 were 65  percent Latino, on election day, the majority of voters were White.   In 26 years and 13 elections, that has changed. Today, voters on  election day in the majority Latino Fourth District, which I represent,  are, in fact, Latino.   Early on, I realized the constituent services in my district were not  restricted to veterans' benefits and Social Security, although we work  hard on those issues. In my district, helping people navigate the  complex and expensive process of citizenship was a top need and became  a top priority for my office.   We helped more than 55,000 people--let me underscore that, 55,000  immigrants--become citizens, sponsoring workshops, helping people  resolve issues, and setting a standard that I feel is unmatched by any  congressional office.   Just last month, I spoke with a woman who told me a remarkable story.  Her daughter had assembled all of her documents and was prepared to  apply for citizenship, and then she left the file on a Chicago subway  system train. A few days later, this woman told me, a knock came at her  door. Someone had found her daughter's folder, and they didn't give it  to the CTA's lost and found, but, rather, they made sure it got to my  office on Fullerton Avenue in Chicago.   My office and staff were so associated with citizenship and helping  the immigrant communities that this Good Samaritan felt there was only  one logical place to return the documents. Indeed, we worked with her  daughter to make sure all of her documents and fees were filed. Today,  she is a citizen of the United States of America.   When I walk through my district and talk with moms and dads, they  tell me how my office touched their lives.  [[Page H9694]]  Whether it was for citizenship or fighting someone's wrongful  deportation, my office has done more than just help constituents. We  have literally helped them preserve their families.   It is the legacy of helping families and individuals, and making this  country a more welcoming place for people, people a lot like my parents  from rural Puerto Rico, that is what I carry with me as I leave.   My work for America, her immigrants, and the character of our great  Nation is not done. It is simply switching to private life. We who  believe in freedom cannot rest. But to all of my colleagues, past and  present, thank you for walking with me on this journey these many  years.                            ____________________
