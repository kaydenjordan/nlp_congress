 Mr. Speaker, I remind the House that the House keeps the  District of Columbia from spending its own funds for low-income women  who want to end a pregnancy at even 1 week.   But today I rise for Christy Zink, a District of Columbia resident  who was a mother of one, soon-to-be mother of two. However, at 21  weeks, an MRI detected a fetal anomaly regarding her unborn son's  brain. A critical part of the brain of the fetus had simply not  developed. She decided to end the pregnancy at almost 22 weeks.   On behalf of Christy Zink, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on  H.R. 36. We must stop the bans.
