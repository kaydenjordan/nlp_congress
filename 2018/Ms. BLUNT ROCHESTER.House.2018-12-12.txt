 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, friend, and  ranking member, Collin Peterson, for his wisdom and steadfast  leadership through the farm bill reauthorization process, Chairman  Conaway, and to all of the staff, who worked tirelessly.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the 2018 farm bill and to  commend my colleagues on the farm bill conference committee for a truly  bipartisan and bicameral product. I stand confident that the bill will  move Delaware and our Nation forward.   It gives Delaware poultry growers the vital conservation resources  they need when they need them. It shores up an already strong crop  insurance program that protects our farmers against catastrophic loss.  It provides additional sustainable resources for 1890 land-grant  institutions, ensuring schools like Delaware State University continue  their crucially important research while preparing the next generation  in the ag economy.   And it also ensures nutrition benefits are maintained and protected  for our children, seniors, individuals with disabilities, and families  who rely on the social safety net to navigate difficult times.   All of these accomplishments were made possible by cooperation and  compromise, which drew me to the Agriculture Committee in the first  place.   We came together, we got something done, and that is what the  American people want to see. This is a farm bill we can all be proud  of, and I ask my colleagues to support it.
