 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk, No. 143.   The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:        Add at the end the following:       SEC. 3. NO EFFECT ON EXISTING LEASING RESTRICTIONS.         Nothing in this Act, or the amendments made by this Act,       shall affect any statutory or regulatory restrictions in       effect on the date of enactment of this Act (including any       withdrawal of Federal land) that may prohibit oil and gas       leasing within the area designated as the North Atlantic       Planning Area.     Mr. Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 21.   Increasing American energy supplies decreases our Nation's reliance  on our adversaries in the Middle East and Russia and is worthy of  bipartisan support.   H.R. 21 helps me keep a promise I made to Long Islanders that I would  fight to make America energy independent by seeking opportunities to  safely increase energy production.   I made another promise, too. I promised to protect Long Island's  waters, which are home to a vibrant ecosystem and are the foundation of  an already struggling fishing industry.   To keep that promise, I have introduced an amendment to H.R. 21. My  simple amendment, which is less than 100 words, states that H.R. 21  cannot affect or supersede any existing restrictions on oil and gas  leases offshore the northeast part of the United States, from the coast  of Maine to New Jersey.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues for their support of this commonsense,  pro-energy, pro-worker, pro-environment, and pro-fishing amendment.    I yield to the gentlewoman from Washington.  [[Page H367]]         Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
