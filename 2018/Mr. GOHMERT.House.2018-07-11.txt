 Mr. Speaker, there was an interesting story in Politico  this week titled: ``The Secret Story of How America Lost the Drug War  With the Taliban.'' It was written by Josh Meyer. It says: ``As  Afghanistan edged ever closer to becoming a narco-state five years ago,  a team of veteran U.S. officials in Kabul presented the Obama  administration with a detailed plan to use U.S. courts to prosecute the  Taliban commanders and allied drug lords who supplied more than 90  percent of the world's heroin . . .''.   Mr. Speaker, that is incredible. I have been hearing from DEA agents,  local police, deputies, so many law enforcement people, about how  incredibly abundant heroin is in America. How we had so many people  that would get hooked on opioids, and then they would ultimately find  heroin was cheaper and more plentiful. It destroyed a lot of lives, and  it continues to destroy lives in America.   To have this report come out that the Obama administration could have  done something in a timely manner to have saved tens of thousands, if  not hundreds of thousands of lives from being lost or being wasted in  this opioid epidemic of addiction, it is really staggering to think  that our United States Government, the Obama administration, with all  of its tools, had the chance to do something that would prevent the  massive personal destructions that we have witnessed, it runs over into  the unconscionable area.   This article says: ``The plan, according to its authors, was both a  way of halting the ruinous spread of narcotics around the world and a  new--and urgent--approach to confronting ongoing frustrations with the  Taliban, whose drug profits were financing the growing insurgency and  killing American troops. But the Obama administration's deputy chief of  mission in Kabul, citing political concerns, ordered the plan to be  shelved, according to a Politico investigation.''   Now, I have not always been the biggest Politico fan, but this is  extraordinary.   ``Now, its authors--Drug Enforcement Administration agents and  Justice Department legal advisers at the time--are expressing anger  over the decision, and hope that the Trump administration, which has  followed a path similar to former President Barack Obama's in  Afghanistan, will eventually adopt the plan as part of its evolving  strategy.   `` `This was the most effective and sustainable tool we had for  disrupting and dismantling Afghan drug trafficking organizations and  separating them from the Taliban,' said Michael Marsac, the main  architect of the plan as the DEA's regional director for Southwest Asia  at the time. `But it lies dormant, buried in an obscure file room, all  but forgotten.'   ``A senior Afghan security official, M. Ashraf Haidari, also  expressed anger at the Obama administration when told about how the  U.S. effort to indict Taliban narcotics kingpins was stopped dead in  its tracks 16 months after it began.   `` `It brought us almost to the breaking point, put our elections  into a time of crisis, and then our economy almost collapsed,' Haidari  said of the drug money funding the Taliban. `If that operation had  continued, we wouldn't have had this massive increase in production and  cultivation as we do now.' ''   This is a photograph showing scoring a poppy to extract raw opium in  April of 2004.   ``Afghan drug lords have pledged financial support to the Taliban in  exchange for protection of their vast swaths of poppy and cannabis  fields, drug processing labs, and storage facilities.  [[Page H6108]]    ``Poppy cultivation, heroin production, terrorist attacks and  territory controlled by the Taliban are now at or near record highs.  President Ashraf Ghani''--who I have met. He seems like a very decent  gentleman--``said recently that Afghanistan's military--and the  government itself--would be in danger of imminent collapse, perhaps  within days, if U.S. assistance stops.''   When we heard the Obama administration condemning the opioid  addiction epidemic, we didn't know that that administration had a  chance to end 90 percent of the heroin coming into this country.  Apparently, so much of that flows across our southern border.   And I realize that the leaders in the U.S. Senate and the leaders in  the United States House did not support the pillars of Donald Trump's  platform that got him elected President of the United States. Every  bill that we have brought out of the House or that has come out of the  Senate, even a couple of times there has been a little bit of money for  a border wall, it is not as serious as it should be that this Congress  should be doing something about the travesty on our southern border.   As long as it remains so open, the drug cartels will continue to make  tens, hundreds of billions of dollars. I read that just the drug money  across our southern border last year was around $80 billion, and I have  also understood that the projections are that the drug cartels may be  making more from human trafficking across our southern border than they  are even from their drug money. That money is being used to keep our  Mexico friend and neighbor oppressed and in bondage.   The best thing that we could do, if we really and truly cared about  the people of Mexico, about the people of Guadalajara, El Salvador, of  so many countries in Central America, and even South America, that are  caught up in human trafficking, drug trafficking, and sex trafficking  that is going on and coming across the U.S. border is stop it. We stop  the flow of the billions that are being spent, or made, by the drug  cartels, then they don't have the money for the corruption that resides  in so much of Mexico and south of Mexico.   That is what a good neighbor should do. That is what this House  should do. That is what the Senate should do. Tell our rich lobbyist  friends that we are going to save American lives, and we are going to  make Mexico one of the 10 top economies in the world by gutting their  corruption, because we are going to enforce a secure border to our  south, and they need to get ready and used to it. But we are going to  have to have leadership in both the House and the Senate that will step  up to the task.    Enough lives have been lost, enough girls have been subjected to sex  trafficking, enough lives have been wasted in drug addiction, enough  lives have been lost in trying to get here, evilly lured here by the  attraction of what might come. Fathers that would even provide birth  control to daughters, knowing they are likely to be raped on the way to  the United States. What kind of people are we that we would lure people  into that kind of situation? Well, we are doing it.   And I hear it over and over from those people that guard our border  and from the people that are not insane, they are not crazy, they are  not stupid, they are just ignorant about the role of ICE in America.  ICE does not protect our borders. That is the Border Patrol. We also  have that supplemented by others that are assisting the Border Patrol.   ICE is really the one that sometimes has been referred to by--that  part of Homeland Security, has been labeled by drug cartels, according  to people on the border, as the drug cartel's logistics. Because they  get people illegally across our border, and then Homeland Security,  with the help of ICE--there are children involved that involves Health  and Human Services, HHS--they ship them around the country to whatever  address the drug cartels give the individuals and tell them that this  is where you are going, and you can finish paying off your fee to us by  working for us at the address where we send you, either in sex  trafficking, drug trafficking, or whatever.                                time  1915    Yes, so we are taking United States Government money; we are prying  it out of the hardworking hands of Americans; and we are using it to  help the drug cartels build up their employee base all over America.   It is time that people in the Republican Party woke up and realized  the amount of human suffering that our failure to secure our southern  border is causing. President Trump is doing what he can, but he could  do a whole lot more if we gave him the tools to do it.   How heartless can we be not to secure our southern border and allow  the deaths, the rapes, the drug abuse that is overwhelming our country.  We have got to stop it.   The Obama administration had a chance to cut it off at its root  source. They killed the program.   So, Mr. Speaker, I think it would be a good idea--I know our friend  Mike Pompeo is busy right at this moment, but there are others in the  State Department, there are people in Homeland Security, Secretary  Nielsen, others. We can do something about it. We have got to do  something about it. It is what decent, caring people would do.   And those, including any judge who says you have got to give these  children back to people who may not be their parents, people who have  convictions for human trafficking and sex trafficking or child  molestation, ought to come up on charges themselves.   Fortunately, one judge backed off of the deadline that had been set  for getting certain children back to their parents, because Homeland  Security and HHS is doing everything they can as quickly as they can to  make sure if they give children to adults, they are not sex traffickers  and they are not drug traffickers, there is a family relationship. And  it appears a great deal of work has been done along those lines. So  there are at least five or six children who have not been turned over  to people who were not their family or people who had drug or child  molestation offenses.   But this is serious stuff. It is what we do. It is why our Nation, so  many of us, became outraged when we found out that young, beautiful  little girls competing as Olympians for the United States in the world  were sexually molested by an adult monster.   And then we have the wannabes, adult men who set records and won  wrestling matches. They could take down the strongest and best in the  country, take them down if they didn't like what they were doing. They  could take them down if they got in a ring and the match started. They  could take them down. And two guys like that come forward, say: Yeah.  Okay. So I was an adult. So I could have been out in Afghanistan  shooting and killing people. I was no match for some wimpy doctor who  made come-on comments.   Somebody like that would be allowed to besmirch the name of  Jim  Jordan. It is disgusting. And any group that would glom on to something  like that, it is disgusting.   Assassinating an honorable character used to be a virtually  unpardonable sin in America. But what happens when you quit teaching  about right and wrong, you quit teaching about the Ten Commandments,  you quit teaching that we are all accountable for our own actions, and  you start teaching, instead, that everything is relative? There is no  right. There is no wrong. There is only convenient and politically  expedient. When political expedience becomes more important in America,  like it has for some, and right and wrong goes out the window, we have  no business maintaining the same form of governance.   It is time to get back to teaching right and wrong, because there are  such.   C. S. Lewis said he used to enjoy making fun of Christians when he  was an atheist by saying: How can you say there is a just God in the  world when there is so much injustice in the world?   And no matter what they would come back with as a response, these  Christians, Lewis would say: Yes, yes, that is all well and good, but  wouldn't it be easier just to admit there can't be a just God in the  universe when there is so much injustice?   And then one day he finally realized: If there is not some absolute  source of right and wrong in the world, justice and injustice, then how  could he ever know there is so much injustice in the world? It would be  like a man blind from birth being unable to know what light is.  [[Page H6109]]    But there is an absolute source of justice in the world, and that is  why, in 1787, in Philadelphia, when our Nation's leaders struggled to  come up with a new constitution, that Ben Franklin, who so many  teachers across the country wrongly say was a deist, as some do about  Washington, said:         I have lived, sir, a long time, and the longer I live, the       more convincing proofs I see of this truth: God governs in       the affairs of men, and if a sparrow cannot fall to the       ground without His notice, is it possible an empire could       rise without His aid?        We have been assured, sir, in the Sacred Writing, that       unless the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that       build it.    Franklin said:         I firmly believe this: I also believe without His       concurring aid, we shall succeed in our political building no       better than the builders of Babel. We will be confounded by       our local partial interests and we, ourselves, shall become a       byword down through the ages.    He went on to move that they start having prayer to start each of  their days at Independence Hall working on the Constitution, just like  they did throughout the Revolution. But if you go back and look at the  debate, you find the reason that was voted down. They didn't have  anybody who everybody else would agree would do a fair prayer for all  the different Christian denominations.   So during the Revolution, they hired a chaplain who always did what  all the Christian denominations believed was a fair prayer, but as they  explained in debate: We are not getting paid. We don't have a treasury.  We can't hire a chaplain. We can't do that right now.   And so next they moved to Randolph of Virginia, his motion: Okay.  Here we are at the end of June. I move that we recess--this is not his  exact words, but in essence:         Let's recess, reconvene on our Nation's birthday,       Independence Day, at one of the local churches. Let's worship       God together. And after we as a group here have worshiped God       together, then let's come back and try this again. We are not       making progress.    That passed. They went to the Reformed Calvinistic Church in  Philadelphia. And it must have gone well. You can find prayers that the  presiding pastor, the Reverend William Rogers, prayed. He brought that  group together through prayer by the grace of God, and they came back  and gave us the greatest founding document in the history of the world.   We have got to get back to where we teach right and wrong. That is  why John Adams in 1797, as President of the United States, said:         This Constitution was meant for a moral and religious       people. It is wholly inadequate for the government of any       other.    And he was right. And when you fail to instill those moral  understandings that brought C. S. Lewis around from being an atheist to  being one of the most effective and greatest apologists for  Christianity in its history, we have got to get back to that or the  Constitution cannot work, and you will have administrations that commit  heinous, reproachable acts as leaders of the Nation.   We ask that God bless America, but there are certain things a nation  of people are supposed to do to be blessed people and merit the  blessings of Heaven, as our Founders often referred to them.   Let's stand up for what is right. Let's stop the political  vindictiveness, and the Nation will be better and be more likely to be  blessed.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 7 o'clock and 28 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, July 12, 2018, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
