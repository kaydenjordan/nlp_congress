 Mr. President, I thank Senator Collins for arranging for  us to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the passage of women's  suffrage here in the Senate.   I thank my colleague Senator Feinstein for working together so that  we all have a chance to reflect on the progress we made and the  commitment to make sure we continue to move forward.   It was June 4, 1919--100 years ago today--that the Senate passed the  women's suffrage constitutional amendment, but the campaign started  with the birth of our Nation. On March 31, 1776, Abigail Adams wrote a  letter to her husband, who was serving in the Continental Congress.   She wrote:         I desire you would remember the ladies and be more generous       and favorable to them than your ancestors. Do not put such an       unlimited power in the hands of the husbands. . . . If       particular care and attention is not paid to the ladies, we       are determined to foment a rebellion and will not hold       ourselves bound by any laws in which we have no voice or       representation.    I am sorry that our Founding Fathers did not listen to Abigail Adams.   Over 144 years later, the 19th Amendment was adopted to our  Constitution, providing for women's suffrage. It passed first in the  House of Representatives on May 21, 1919, and then in the Senate on  June 4, 1919.   The right to vote was the first step. Over the last 100 years, we  have seen tremendous progress. Legally, financially, and socially, more  women have entered the workforce than ever before. Women are filling  key leadership posts in increasing numbers, but we still have an  unfinished agenda for equality for women.   I think most people in this country would be surprised to learn that  there is nothing in the Constitution of the United States that  guarantees equal rights for women. As the late Justice Scalia said,  there is nothing in the Constitution that requires discrimination  against women, but there is nothing that protects women against  discrimination.   Senator Murkowski and I introduced S. Res. 6, which extends the date  for the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment. In 1972, we passed  the Equal Rights Amendment here for ratification for the States and  extended it one time, and 10 years later, 35 States had ratified the  Equal Rights Amendment--3 short of the required 38. Nevada and Illinois  have since ratified the amendment, so it is one State short. However,  we need to pass the resolution to extend the time limit.   As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has said--and this is interesting-- every constitution written since the end of World War II includes a  provision that men and women are citizens of equal stature. Ours does  not. It is well past time that we passed the Equal Rights Amendment.   The 27th Amendment to the Constitution took over 200 years to ratify.  It deals with congressional pay increases.   We can pass and should pass in this Congress a fitting tribute to the  celebration of women's suffrage--the Equal Rights Amendment for women.    We need to do more for equal pay for equal work. I acknowledge the  extraordinary leadership that we had in Maryland and this Nation in  Senator Barbara Mikulski. She was a true champion in so many ways--as a  social worker, as a city councilperson, as a Member of the House of  Representatives, and as a U.S. Senator--in advancing rights for women,  particularly in the workplace. I remember, with pride, seeing her stand  next to President Obama as he signed his very first bill, the Lilly  Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which enforced rights for women in the  workplace. As Senator Mikulski would point out, we still have work to  do. We still have not passed equal pay for equal work in this country,  and this Congress should deal with that.   We have a wealth gap. There is no question that women do not have the  same wealth as men. In working with Senator Rubio on the committee on  which I serve as ranking member, the Small Business and  Entrepreneurship Committee, we must look at whether the tools of the  Small Business Administration's are providing help to women to develop  their own businesses. Wealth is usually accumulated through business  growth, and we need to do more to help women.   In the State of Maryland, I am proud that 39 percent of our small  businesses are owned by women, but women do not have equal access to  the tools with which to access capital. We can do better with the 7(a)  Program and with the Community Advantage Pilot Program, particularly in  making it permanent. So there are still steps we can take to help  advance equal rights and equal opportunity for women.   There is women's healthcare. The constitutional right of women to  make their own choices about their own health and well-being is again  being challenged by some of our States and here on Capitol Hill.  Whether it is abortion, preventive screening, or contraception, access  to reproductive healthcare provides women with greater economic  opportunity. Treating women as less than equal was wrong at the start  of our Nation, and it is wrong today.   As we celebrate the 100th anniversary of women's suffrage, let us do  several things. First, I urge all of our colleagues to support the  resolution that is pending, S. Res. 212, in regard to celebrating the  women's suffrage and, second, that we work for full equality for women  in our Constitution, in the workplace, in entrepreneurship, and in  healthcare.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that floor  privileges be granted to Marli Pasternak, a member of my staff, during  today's session of the Senate.
