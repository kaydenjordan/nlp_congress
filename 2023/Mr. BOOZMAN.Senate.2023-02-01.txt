 Mr. President, today I rise to recognize and  congratulate the Arkansas Martin Luther King, Jr. Commission's 30th  anniversary.   For three decades, the Arkansas Martin Luther King, Jr. Commission  has worked to promote and preserve the life and legacy of Dr. King in  The Natural State and advocate the principles of nonviolence and  equality among all citizens.   Dr. King devoted his life to pursuing equality and fighting  injustice. His leadership of the civil rights movement ushered in a  turning point in our country's history. His vision and influence will  forever be part of America's identity.   Arkansas's MLK Jr. Commission works year-round teaching about the  life of Dr. King and encouraging us all to take action to improve the  lives of others. Through programs devoted to empowering individuals and  communities, it has made a positive difference and inspired the next  generation of leaders.   The commission organizes a number of community outreach projects that  help further education, foster appreciation of history, and encourage  youth to engage in positive leadership development right in their own  neighborhoods and beyond. Notably, it hosts one of the largest national  celebrations and day of service events in recognition of Dr. King.   It has been praised by Dr. Bernice King, daughter of the late Dr.  Martin Luther King, Jr., as one of the most active commissions in the  country. In 2017, the group hosted what was coined a MegaKing Fest that  emphasized a theme of ``Passing the Torch'' of the civil rights icon's  legacy to future generations.   I am pleased to congratulate the Arkansas Martin Luther King, Jr.  Commission on this milestone of 30 years of service to our State. Dr.  King's legacy and mission live on through its efforts and we are proud  of what it represents and the impact is continues to make.                            ____________________
