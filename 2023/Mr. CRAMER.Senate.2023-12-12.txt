 Mr. President, I have the privilege of once again  congratulating my alma mater on its' second high school State football  championship in 3 years.   On November 10, the Kindred Vikings won the Division A State title at  the Dakota Bowl State Football Tournament. They finished a truly  impressive undefeated season by taking the championship over Dickinson  Trinity by a score of 36-7. They had earlier won their first three  postseason games, defeating teams from Harvey/Fessenden-  [[Page S5917]]  Bowman, Oakes, and Langdon/Edmore/Munich.   This was the third appearance and second State championship for the  Vikings since State playoffs sponsored by the North Dakota High School  Activities Association began in 1975. They made one Dakota Bowl  appearance in 2016 and, in 2021, took the championship by defeating the  Edmore-Munich Cardinals.   At Kindred High School, I lettered for 4 years in football,  basketball, and track before graduating in 1979. Our teams were not as  good as the Vikings are today, something I observed firsthand as the  starting quarterback my junior and senior years. Remembering those  years increases my admiration all the more for the superb quality of  this team and its undefeated season.   Quarterback Jake Starcevic scored three touchdowns and rushed for 117  yards in the Vikings's decisive victory in the championship game. He  and two other Vikings players, Riley Sunram and Brooks Bakko, were  named to the All-State Class A Football Teams.   Congratulations to this year's team members: Camron Schwartzwalter,  Gabe Whipple, Hayden Cichy, Izaak Spelhaug, Hunter Bindas, Jack  McDonald, Miles Stroh, Brock Johnson, Landon Kottsick, Jakob Starcevic,  Ethan Duval, Brooks Bakko, Carson Gette, Gabriel Iverson, Wyatt  Briscoe, Myles Thielges, Graham Hesse, Owen Hoyme, Kylan Swenson,  Sawyer Hesse, Grant Allison, Brayden Olson, Tyson Johnson, Fisher  Johnson, Taylor Brandsted-Fletcher, Brady Baumgarten, Christopher  Freier, Samuel Jenness, Jacob Lund, Kyle Campbell, Tanon Johnson, Tate  Miller, Gavin Niemeyer, Teige Erdmann, Brody Mauch, Cole Richard, Kelby  Erdmann, Ethan Fornshell, Andrew Haley, Dilon Filler, Lukas Starcevic,  Trevor Olson, Riley Sunram, Grant Spelhaug, Javen Johnson, and Lincoln  Swenson.   I also want to also recognize Eric Burgad in his first year as head  coach, along with his assistants Brad Ambrosius, Joe Harder, Nate Safe,  and Ryan Sunram, as well as all the hometown fans for their part in  winning this championship.   As a proud alumnus of Kindred High School, I join the rest of North  Dakota in congratulating the Vikings on a perfect season and another  State championship and for inspiring all of us to strive for  excellence, regardless of the circumstance. Once again, they have shown  the rest of us what can be achieved when faith and passion combine with  determination and teamwork.                            ____________________
