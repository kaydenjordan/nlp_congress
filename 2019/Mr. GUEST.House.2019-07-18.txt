 Madam Speaker, 50 years ago, rockets tested at the  Mississippi Test Facility, now known as the Stennis Space Center,  carried Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins high above the  Earth's atmosphere.   These brave Americans were aided by the technical and engineering  expertise of Mississippi scientists and engineers. The men and women at  the Stennis Space Center conducted 2,475 man-years of rocket engine  testing to ensure that the astronauts successfully carried American  ingenuity toward the stars and returned home safely to a proud nation.   Following the successful mission, the Stennis Space Center team  continued to support the Apollo program by performing tests on the  Saturn V rockets and continues today to support NASA in our exploration  of space.   As a Mississippian, I join the rest of our States as we remember the  crucial role we played in this historic accomplishment of our great  Nation.                            ____________________
