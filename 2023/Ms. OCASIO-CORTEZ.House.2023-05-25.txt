 Madam Speaker, we are here on the last day of this  session and Republicans have decided to skip town, but what this debt  ceiling debate really is about is the fact that Republicans have run up  a bill that they now do not want to pay. They have run up this bill  with extremely excessive military spending. They have run up this bill  with extraordinary tax cuts for the wealthiest people in this country  and now when it comes time to pay for this bill, they do not want to  pay it.   Not only that, but they are accusing Democrats of saying we spend too  much. For anyone that wants to entertain that thought, I ask you to  think about the last time a person has said in this country that the  government does too much for them, that their Social Security check was  too high, that teachers are paid too much. When was the last time  anyone has heard or seen that?                            ____________________
