 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1218) to require the Federal Communications Commission to  incorporate data on maternal health outcomes into its broadband health  maps, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1218         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Data Mapping to Save Moms'       Lives Act''.       SEC. 2. MAPPING BROADBAND CONNECTIVITY AND MATERNAL HEALTH                     OUTCOMES.         (a) Incorporation of Maternal Mortality and Severe Maternal       Morbidity Data.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Federal Communications       Commission shall incorporate publicly available data on       maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity, including       for not less than 1 year postpartum, into the Mapping       Broadband Health in America platform of the Commission.        (b) Consultation With CDC.--The Federal Communications       Commission shall consult with the Director of the Centers for       Disease Control and Prevention regarding the maternal       mortality and severe maternal morbidity data that should be       incorporated under subsection (a).     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1218.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1218, the Data  Mapping to Save Moms' Lives Act.   Tragically, the United States has the highest rate of maternal  mortality across developed nations. While maternal mortality and  morbidity are problems that affect women across the country, these  concerns are especially pronounced in Black and Native American  communities. Maternal mortality rates for Black women are three times  higher than those of White women, and the rate of death for American  Indian and Alaska Native women is two times higher.   This legislation seeks to provide a visualization for the public on  how connectivity and these health data intersect. It will help guide  policymakers on how to target telehealth services to vulnerable  populations and communities at risk in an effort to reduce maternal  mortality and morbidity in this country.   For pregnant women, access to telehealth services like routine  checkups, health monitoring, and updated prescriptions can go a long  way in ensuring the health and safety of both the mother and child.   Specifically, under this legislation, the FCC is required to  integrate publicly available data related to maternal health, including  mortality and severe morbidity, into its Mapping Broadband Health in  America platform. The FCC will be required to consult with the Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention to determine the right data to  include for this effort.   I commend Representatives Butterfield, Bilirakis, and Blunt Rochester  for their bipartisan efforts on this legislation. I also thank  Subcommittee Chairman Doyle for working to get this legislation through  the Communications and Technology Subcommittee.   I also commend you, Madam Speaker, as the vice chair of the Energy  and Commerce Committee, because you have spent quite a bit of time  dealing with these maternal mortality issues.   This initiative, combined with other good work we and the executive  branch have done, will help us better understand the communications  barriers some pregnant women face so that we can then explore  connectivity policies that help keep these women safe and healthy.   I know the Senate has passed a companion bill recently, led by  Senators Rosen and Fischer. Although there are some technical  differences between the two bills, my hope is that we can get those  worked out as quickly as possible and get this legislation to the  President's desk.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Data Mapping to  Save Moms' Lives Act in a bipartisan manner, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge bipartisan support for this bill  as part of our continued effort to address maternal mortality, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2501) to require the National Telecommunications and  Information Administration and the Federal Communications Commission to  update the memorandum of understanding on spectrum coordination, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2501         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Spectrum Coordination Act''.  [[Page H4135]]            SEC. 2. UPDATE OF MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING ON SPECTRUM                     COORDINATION BETWEEN NTIA AND FCC.         Not later than December 31, 2022, the National       Telecommunications and Information Administration and the       Federal Communications Commission shall update the Memorandum       of Understanding on Spectrum Coordination entered into in       January 2003, to--        (1) improve upon the process for resolving frequency       allocation disputes in shared or adjacent allocations between       the National Telecommunications and Information       Administration and the Federal Communications Commission to       ensure that such disputes are definitively resolved in an       efficient and timely manner;        (2) ensure that spectrum is used efficiently; and        (3) establish reasonable timelines for the exchange of       information between the National Telecommunications and       Information Administration and the Federal Communications       Commission in order to maintain effective spectrum       coordination and collaboration.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 2501.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2501, the Spectrum  Coordination Act.   Our country's airways are foundational to next-generation wireless  networks. These networks offer so much promise to better our lives, as  they can promote enhanced telehealth services and educational  opportunities and offer new ways of engaging in entertainment and e- commerce. These networks can also help propel advancements in  manufacturing and enhance critical public safety communications to save  lives.                                time  1715    But to achieve these important objectives, our airwaves must be  managed competently and correctly. Unfortunately, in recent years, our  country has not hit this mark. Instead, the two agencies charged by  Congress to manage the public's airwaves, the FCC and the National  Telecommunications and Information Administration, or NTIA, have often  bickered and refused to coordinate their efforts.   I am pleased to see that with new leadership over the last year, the  FCC and NTIA have begun to make some headway towards ensuring the  Federal Government once again speaks with one voice in overseeing our  airwaves.   H.R. 2501 helps advance the ball even further. This legislation  requires the FCC and NTIA to update their memorandum of understanding  on spectrum coordination by the end of this year. The last time this  MOU was updated was in 2003, and much has changed since then. An  updated MOU will reaffirm the commitment of these two agencies to  provide and allocate our airwaves in a way that best serves consumers,  commercial carriers, and Federal agencies in the days and months to  come.   Over the past several years, the Energy and Commerce Committee has  worked on a bipartisan basis on several important telecommunications  matters. I want to commend Subcommittee Chairman Doyle and  Representative Bilirakis for continuing this tradition through their  leadership and bipartisan work in advancing this bill out of the  committee. I hope the Senate can follow suit soon.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to likewise support the Spectrum  Coordination Act in a bipartisan manner, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I would ask bipartisan support for this  bill, which will continue the objective of trying to coordinate better  between the two agencies, the FCC and the NTIA.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5657) to amend the Controlled Substances Act to make  marijuana accessible for use by qualified marijuana researchers for  medical purposes, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5657         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Medical Marijuana Research       Act''.       SEC. 2. FACILITATING MARIJUANA RESEARCH.

(b) Requirement To Verify Registration.--Before supplying       marijuana to any person through the National Institute on       Drug Abuse Drug Supply Program or through implementation of       the specialized process established under subsection       (a)(1)(B), the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall--        (1) require the person to submit documentation       demonstrating that the person is a qualified marijuana       researcher seeking to conduct research pursuant to section       303(f)(3) of the Controlled Substances Act, as added by       subsection (d) of this section, or a manufacturer duly       registered under section 303(l) of the Controlled Substances       Act, as added by section 3 of this Act; and        (2) not later than 60 days after receipt of such       documentation, review such documentation and verify that the       marijuana will be used for such research (and for no other       purpose authorized pursuant to this Act or the amendments       made by this Act).        (c) Guidance on Use of State-Authorized Marijuana       Programs.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human       Services shall issue guidance related to marijuana from       State-authorized marijuana programs for research.        (d) Research.--Section 303(f) of the Controlled Substances       Act (21 U.S.C. 823(f)) is amended--        (1) by redesignating paragraphs (1) through (5) as       subparagraphs (A) through (E), respectively;  [[Page H4137]]         (2) by striking ``(f) The Attorney General'' and inserting       ``(f)(1) The Attorney General'';        (3) by striking ``Registration applications'' and inserting       the following:        ``(2) Registration applications'';        (4) in paragraph (2), as so designated, by striking       ``schedule I'' each place that term appears and inserting       ``schedule I, except marijuana,'';        (5) by striking ``Article 7'' and inserting the following:        ``(4) Article 7''; and        (6) by inserting before paragraph (4), as so designated,       the following:        ``(3)(A) The Attorney General shall register the applicant       to conduct research with marijuana (including any derivative,       extract, preparation, and compound thereof) if, irrespective       of whether the applicant is registered pursuant to paragraphs       (1) and (2)--        ``(i) the applicant meets the requirements for being       registered under such paragraphs to dispense, or conduct       research with respect to, controlled substances in schedule       I, II, III, IV, or V;        ``(ii) the applicant is compliant with, and authorized to       conduct the activities described in clause (i) under, the       laws of the State in which the applicant practices; and        ``(iii) in the case of an applicant pursuing clinical       research, the applicant's clinical research protocol has been       reviewed and authorized to proceed by the Secretary under       section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.        ``(B) An applicant registered under subparagraph (A) shall       be referred to in this section as a `qualified marijuana       researcher'.        ``(C)(i) Not later than 60 days after the date on which the       Attorney General receives a complete application for       registration under this paragraph, the Attorney General shall       approve or deny the application.        ``(ii) For purposes of clause (i), an application shall be       deemed complete when the applicant has submitted       documentation showing that the requirements under       subparagraph (A) are satisfied.        ``(iii) In the case of a denial under clause (i), the       Attorney General shall provide a written explanation of the       basis for the denial.        ``(D) The Attorney General shall grant an application for       registration under this paragraph unless the Attorney General       determines that the issuance of the registration would be       inconsistent with the public interest.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 5657.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5657, the Medical Marijuana  Research Act.   Last week, Congress considered and passed the MORE Act, which  effectively removes marijuana from the strictest category of regulation  under the Controlled Substances Act. Today, medical marijuana is  approved and regulated in 37 States, the District of Columbia, Guam,  Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. These actions highlight the  need for increased research about safety and efficacy of the marijuana  products being consumed by millions of Americans.   Unfortunately, comprehensive research on marijuana has been regulated  in a restrictive, time-consuming way, and the current body of research  is not representative of the products available to the average American  adult consumer.   H.R. 5657 is a bipartisan bill that streamlines the registration  process for scientists seeking to engage in cannabis research. It also  maintains the appropriate oversight and control by the Department of  Health and Human Services and the Drug Enforcement Administration.   The bill requires HHS and DEA to respond to registration applicants  in a timely manner and expands the number of federally approved  manufacturers and distributors that can supply marijuana products for  research purposes.   The bill also creates a special process to allow State-authorized  marijuana to be used for research purposes. This is an important step  toward understanding the positive and negative health effects of the  products being frequently consumed by people across our country.   The House passed this bill by a voice vote in the 116th Congress. The  Senate also passed a similar measure last Congress and did so again by  unanimous consent last month.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank Representatives Blumenauer, Harris,  Holmes Norton, Dingell, Cohen, Griffith, Lee, and Case for their  leadership on this issue. I look forward to working with them and our  colleagues in the Senate to expand comprehensive cannabis research and  protect the health of our constituents.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell), who is one of the  sponsors of this legislation.                                time  1730     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me agree with my Republican colleague that this is very important  because there really hasn't been enough research done on marijuana and  the impacts of it.   That is why this bill really needs to pass, and I urge my colleagues,  on a bipartisan basis, to support it. I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Eshoo for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1916, the Ensuring  Lasting Smiles Act, a bipartisan bill that will help patients with  congenital anomalies and birth defects get the necessary treatment that  they deserve.   Three percent of American children are born with congenital anomalies  or birth defects that affect the way they look, develop, or function,  often for the rest of their lives. These children require serious  medical treatment. But for far too long, insurance companies have been  unfairly denying treatment, despite an official medical diagnosis, by  deeming it cosmetic or because the treatment involves dental services.  This is unacceptable. This treatment is critically important and  medically necessary, particularly for children with serious dental  anomalies.   During our legislative hearing on this bill in committee, we heard  from Kevin Koser about his family's longstanding struggles to get his  son Kannon's medical treatment covered. Kannon was diagnosed with  ectodermal dysplasia when he was 1 year old, and this had a drastic  impact on his health and quality of life. Ectodermal dysplasia is a  congenital anomaly that affects the development of the hair, skin,  teeth, and other body parts. Kannon sprouted his first tooth at the age  of 4, and this has severely restricted his diet and impacted his  ability to speak.   In accordance with the treatment plan established by his doctor, his  family began pursuing dentures for Kannon; however, their family health  plan denied the medically necessary treatment for Kannon and deemed it  as not a covered benefit. The Koser family is not alone.   Madam Speaker, there are countless children across the country whose  medically necessary treatments are unfairly denied by insurance  companies. These children may have to forego the care they need to live  healthy and fulfilling lives because their families simply cannot  afford the treatment. Too often, their families are stuck with the  financial burden of paying out of pocket for medically necessary  treatment despite having health insurance, and children like Kannon are  forced to delay necessary care that is meant to restore bodily  function.   The National Foundation for Ectodermal Dysplasias estimates that some  families will pay upwards of $150,000 out of pocket in their lifetime  for medically necessary treatments. This is for medical care that  should be rightfully covered by insurance.   The Ensuring Lasting Smiles Act will require all individual and group  market health plans to cover medically necessary treatment resulting  from congenital anomalies and ensure that children like Kannon get the  treatment they need. This is important, commonsense legislation that  has--as Ms.  [[Page H4143]]  Eshoo said--310 bipartisan cosponsors. I commend Ms. Eshoo for her  leadership on this legislation as the prime sponsor of the bill.   This important bill will improve the health and well-being of  countless Americans and ensure that individuals born with congenital  anomalies have the opportunity to live a healthy life. Children like  Kannon and his family should have the peace of mind to know that  medically necessary treatment will be covered.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.
