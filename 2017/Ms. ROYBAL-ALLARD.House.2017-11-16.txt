 Mr. Speaker, on behalf of America's future  generations who will be saddled with an unsurmountable debt created by  H.R. 1, the Republican Tax plan, I must object to it. This rushed piece  of legislation will not only add more than $1.7 trillion to the  national debt over the next 10 years, but it will also shift the burden  of paying for that debt to our hard working families.   Despite our Republican colleagues' assertions that this tax plan will  benefit the majority of Americans, numerous economists disagree. They  note that nearly 45 percent of all households with children will see a  tax increase, while 80 percent of our wealthiest citizens will receive  a tax cut by 2027.   Even more egregious, this tax bill seeks to eliminate the long- standing State and Local Tax deduction, subjecting every wage earner's  income to double taxation. This defeats the original framers' intent to  avoid a system of double taxation.   The original tax code, drafted in 1913, consisted of three pages in  its entirety and included the State and Local Tax deduction at the core  of its responsible tax policy to ensure state and local governments  could raise revenues for public schools, police, fire, and emergency  services.   Plain and simple, this tax plan is a tremendous windfall for our  wealthiest 1 percent and large corporations. It favors large businesses  over small businesses, it favors sending jobs overseas rather than  creating jobs at home, it favors the wealthy over hourly wage earners,  and it pays for these tax cuts for the wealthy by raising taxes on our  middle class families  [[Page H9413]]  to the detriment of Medicare, Medicaid, education, and other vital  public services.   The fact is, Mr. Speaker, this bill is so skewed to benefit the  wealthiest 1 percent in America that it could more accurately be named,  ``H.R. 1 percent'' I urge my colleagues to support the 99 percent of  Americans instead, and to oppose this plan. Vote no on H.R. 1.
