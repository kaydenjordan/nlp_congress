 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to our esteemed former colleague,  Jerry Lewis, the longest-serving California Republican in the history  of the House, who on a personal level, was my good friend and mentor.   On July 15, Jerry passed from this life into the next. For the last  86 years, Jerry lived a full life. He made an extraordinary impact  throughout the Inland Empire community he loved so dearly, leaving it  in a far better position than when his decades of public service began.   When I was first elected to this body in November of 1992, Jerry was  one of  [[Page H3834]]  the first people I turned to for guidance. As I embarked on this new  path, it just so happened that this exciting time in my life coincided  with a rare low point for Jerry, who just lost his leadership position  as Conference chair following the election.   Well, Jerry's loss turned out to be my gain as I was able to hire a  number of Republican Conference staff members. From that moment  forward, our offices shared a very tight bond, both personally and  professionally, that would endure for decades.   Personally, I couldn't have asked for a better person to learn from.  Jerry possessed a deep understanding of the needs of his district, and  he methodically found opportunities to align Federal resources that  could help address them.   In order to achieve his goals, Jerry recognized the importance of  working across the aisle and being bipartisan, the realization that  was, no doubt, aided by Jerry's first 16 years in the House as a member  of the minority party. Jerry worked with whoever he needed in order to  deliver results for the people who sent him here.   He demonstrated that if you don't care how it gets done, or who gets  credit for it, you can actually get a lot accomplished around here.  Jerry's community benefited in countless ways because of his  leadership. Thanks to his efforts, veterans and other residents have  received better care at the VA Loma Linda Healthcare System and the  Loma Linda University Medical Center.                                time  1345    Students have greater opportunities, thanks to his support for STEM  education at the Apple Valley Science and Technology Center, which was  later renamed the Lewis Center for Educational Research. The entire  region is safer, protected from flooding, thanks to the construction of  Seven Oaks Dam. I could go on and on.   Jerry may no longer be with us, but the tremendous size and scope of  his life will endure and continue to make impacts for many years and  many generations.   In 2005, Jerry became the first Californian to serve as chairman of  the House Appropriations Committee. He was incredibly proud to fill  this honored position.   Jerry understood his time in that role was finite. He was determined  to use that precious time to make a difference for his country, State,  and district.   In May 2007, I was fortunate enough to join Jerry as a member of the  Appropriations Committee.   In addition to his affection for the district, the body, and the  Appropriations Committee, Jerry had a deep appreciation for his staff.  His office was like a family. Jerry had many longtime staff members, a  clear sign of mutual admiration.   Jerry's greatest love, of course, was reserved for who he always  affectionately referred to as ``his bride,'' Arlene. Along with their  dog, Bruin, the couple was inseparable.   I will always treasure the time I spent together with Jerry and  Arlene, especially Wednesday nights at the Capitol Hill Club for prime  rib night and our regular get-together for Mexican food at La Lomita  here on Capitol Hill.   I extend my heartfelt condolences to Arlene, the Lewis family, and  all the former Lewis office staff members. Like all of you, I simply  cannot imagine our lives without Jerry and the incredible influence he  had upon me.   I know he is looking down at all of us with that smile and chuckle,  saying: ``Enough now, get back to work, Kenny.''   Godspeed, Jerry. We will take it from here.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.  Rogers).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Aguilar).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the Democratic leader, the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana  (Mr. Scalise), the Republican whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr.  Cole).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. McCarthy. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bid farewell to  Congressman Jerry Lewis, who passed away last week at his home in  Redlands, California. He was 86.   His impact on his district, his state, and his nation are enormous  and will not be forgotten.   Jerry approached the responsibilities of public service seriously.   He was one of the longest-serving and most influential Californians  in this chamber's history--serving a total of 34 years.   He was the chair of the Republican Conference, a cardinal, and the  chairman of the Appropriations Committee.   Through it all, he was tireless and effective, delivering for the  people he represented.   You can see it in his work:   Improving health care;   Building dams and the environment;   Funding education and scientific research; and   Strengthening our national defense and industrial base.   Yes, Jerry was a serious legislator. But as everyone who knew him  will also tell you, he never took himself too seriously.   He was always smiling.   He loved his wife, Arlene.   He was an optimist--in politics, in his personal life, and about the  future of our great nation.   That is his legacy.   Mr. Speaker, the great Italian writer Petrarch said that, ``love is  the crowning grace of humanity, the golden link which binds us to duty  and truth, the redeeming principles that reconciles the heart to  life.''   I don't know if Jerry ever read those words, but he certainly lived  them.   He was a statesman and a public servant who worked hard for his  district, his state, and his country because he loved them.   We should always remember that.   God Bless Arlene and his entire family.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.  [[Page H3838]]    I want to say we are all going to miss Jerry. It was a privilege to  serve with him, and Godspeed, Jerry.
