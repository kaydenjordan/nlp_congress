 Mr. Speaker, 75 years ago, in a letter to his troops,  General Dwight D. Eisenhower encouraged the invasion forces of D-Day.   ``The eyes of the world are upon you,'' he wrote. ``The hope and  prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere march with you.'' He ended  this famous letter with a call to pray: ``Let us all beseech the  blessings of Almighty God upon this great and noble undertaking.''   On the 75th anniversary of D-Day, we turn our attention and  admiration to those young soldiers at sea, in the air, and on land who  sought to liberate Europe from tyranny.   This is the time to humbly remember the sacrifice of over 4,000  American soldiers who died on the beaches of Normandy to liberate the  world from evil; and it is a time to thank Almighty God for his  blessings in delivering some of the heroes of D-Day home after the war  and for welcoming those who did not into his heavenly kingdom.                            ____________________
