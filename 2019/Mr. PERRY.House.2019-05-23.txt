 Mr. Speaker, I stand in support of H. Res. 106, which  condemns female genital mutilation, or cutting, as a violation of the  human rights of women and girls and calls for a coordinated response  from the United States Government and the international community to  end this horrific and abhorrent practice.   I am proud of the bipartisan effort that has gone into this  resolution, and I want to thank Representative Lois Frankel from  Florida for coleading this resolution with me, which gives us the  opportunity to bring renewed attention to the harm that FGM causes  innocent girls and highlights the actions needed to eliminate this  unspeakable act.   As the House considers this resolution, there are over 200 million  women and girls alive today who have been affected by FGM. This year  alone, an estimated 3 million girls are at risk of being mutilated.  This despicable practice simply must end.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this effort to condemn  and end FGM in the United States and across the globe. There is much  more work that must be done to combat FGM, and I hope that we continue  this bipartisan work.                            ____________________
