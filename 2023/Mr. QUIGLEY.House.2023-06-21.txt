 Mr. Speaker, I had the honor of serving with the  gentleman from California on the House Permanent Select Committee on  Intelligence for 8 years. I had an in-the-ring view of his work.   Obviously, it is not what Mr. Schiff did that was wrong, it is what  he did so well. That is what bothers the majority. He defended our  country from threats, foreign and domestic. He defended the rule of  law. He defended our democracy at one of its most critical and pivotal  points. He held the ethically and legally challenged former President  accountable.   What really gnaws on the majority and what really bothers them is  that Mr. Schiff was way better than anybody on their team at debate, at  leadership, at messaging, and at legal knowledge. He kicked their ass.  He was better, he was more effective, and that still bothers them.   They couldn't beat him on the field, so they voted him off. We voted  people off committees because they posted threats, not because they  can't compete.
