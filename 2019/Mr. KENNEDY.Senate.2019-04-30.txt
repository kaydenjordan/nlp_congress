 Madam President, as a member of the U.S. Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, it is my privilege to  recognize a veteran-owned Louisiana small business that has not only  grown and succeeded but has also steadfastly remained dedicated to  their customers, employees, and community. This week, it is my honor to  name BBQGuys of Baton Rouge, LA as the Senate Small Business of the  Week.   In 1998, Mike Hackley began what has been an American entrepreneurial  success story. After serving over 10 years in the U.S. Air Force and  working in the real estate and retail sectors, Mike followed his  passion of outdoor living and started his own business, opening a  retail location called The Grill Store & More. Recognizing the  potential that e-commerce had early on, he founded bbqguys.com in 2001.  He started out with single-digit employees. Today, BBQGuys has grown to  become one of the largest outdoor living online retailers in the world,  employing nearly 300.   With the success of the retail operations, Mike continued growing his  business, founding Blaze Grill, and began to design and manufacture  premium barbecue grills with manufacturing operations in the United  States. In just a few years, Blaze is already one of the top grill  manufacturers in the market.   Even with BBQGuys' growth and success, Mike continues to prioritize  his  [[Page S2511]]  employees, making an effort to say good morning every day to team  members and maintaining an open-door policy for all. Mike believes in  treating his employees like family--a belief he extends to his  customers. This culture of hospitality has ultimately resulted in high  employee retention and a reputation for outstanding customer service.  BBQGuys has been named as one of the Best Places to Work several times  by the Greater Baton Rouge Business Report and achieved an A+ rating  from the Better Business Bureau. BBQGuys has also been named one of the  5,000 Fastest Growing Businesses in the U.S. by Inc. Magazine for 11  consecutive years. BBQGuys is also involved in the Baton Rouge  community, participating in several local community activities  including Toys for Tots, the Youth Oasis Children's Center, LifeShare  Blood Center, and Friends of the Animals of Baton Rouge.   BBQGuys is a true representation of the American dream--following a  passion, committing to hard work, treating people--customers and  employees--with the utmost respect, and growing a very small business  of single-digit employees into a leading global business that is  constantly innovating. It is my distinct pleasure to honor Mike and the  entire team at BBQGuys as the U.S. Senate Small Business of the Week. I  commend them for their service to the Baton Rouge community and look  forward to watching their continued growth and success. BBQGuys, you  make Louisiana proud.                            ____________________
