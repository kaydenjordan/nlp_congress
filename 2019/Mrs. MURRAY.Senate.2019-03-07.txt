 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Madam President, since day one of the Trump  administration, the Republicans have done everything they can to cater  to an extreme rightwing base by undermining women's access to the  healthcare they need and the healthcare providers they trust.   They have moved to roll back requirements that insurance companies  include birth control as an essential health benefit, which would mean  millions of women would go back to paying extra for birth control on  top of their coverage. They have held votes on extreme abortion bans  that would get in between a woman and her doctor. They have jammed the  courts, even the Supreme Court, with partisans who have made clear they  share  [[Page S1722]]  the extreme and frightening goal of overturning Roe v. Wade and of  taking away a woman's constitutional right to safe, legal abortion in  the United States of America.   Most recently, the Trump administration has put forward a deeply  harmful rule that would jeopardize access to affordable reproductive  healthcare for the millions of men and women who depend on title X, our  Nation's family planning program, which historically has had bipartisan  support. If this rule goes into effect, providers at health centers  that receive title X funding will be blocked--gagged--from even telling  patients about where and how to get a safe, legal abortion as part of a  discussion of reproductive healthcare options.   The rule would also impose new, medically unnecessary requirements  that would make it impossible for Planned Parenthood centers, which  serve 41 percent of the title X patients, to continue to participate.  Four million people--disproportionately young people, low-income women,  and women of color--go to title X-funded centers, including to Planned  Parenthood centers, for birth control, for lifesaving cancer  screenings, for STD tests, and more each year, and this rule puts the  care they depend on in jeopardy.   The Republicans here in the Capitol may have no idea what it would  mean for patients to lose access to the providers they trust and the  affordable care they need, but that is not because those patients and  their doctors and their communities have not been speaking up--they  have been. People across the country--women and men, doctors, city and  county health officials, religious groups, advocates--told this  administration as it was developing this rule that they did not want to  see providers at title X barred from giving them medically sound  information or have patients be denied access to providers they trust  at Planned Parenthood because the Republicans think they know better.   The final rule the Trump administration released shows it ignored  those who personally know how much it matters to have unbiased, quality  care at title X centers, including at Planned Parenthood. The  Republicans might have ignored those voices, but we Democrats are not  going to. So I am releasing a memo today that will highlight statements  that were submitted in strong opposition to this rule by people from  across the country. I want to make absolutely sure that the Republicans  have every opportunity to hear what patients and providers have to say.  I want to give a few examples.   One patient called her visit to a Planned Parenthood to get a Pap  smear a ``lifesaver.''   Another wrote: ``Young people like me rely on Title X for access to  family planning services at the provider of our choice.''   A mother and sister from Nevada told the Trump administration:         I too have sisters and four daughters. We are capable,       adept, and able to make decisions for ourselves. We want to       make informed decisions. . . . Withholding information is       misinformation and manipulation.    County health officials and healthcare providers repeatedly urged the  administration that this rule would ``interfere in the doctor-patient  relationship'' and was ``an infringement on the ethical principles that  medical providers adhere to'' with potentially ``irreversible'' impacts  in struggling communities.   Since it, apparently, needs to be said on the Senate floor, I would  like to remind my colleagues that what these patients, healthcare  providers, and community leaders are saying about the importance of a  woman's ability to make her own healthcare decisions is not  controversial. People in this country overwhelmingly agree that women  should be able to get birth control. They agree that no matter how much  money you make or where you live, you should be able to get a cancer  screening that could save your life and, yes, that women should be able  to exercise their constitutional right to safe, legal abortion.   I challenge the Republicans today to read the memo I am releasing.  Listen to the women and men whom this rule hurts and from the people  who are working to help them get the care they need. Then join the  Democrats in standing up against this dangerous, unethical step  backward because, right now, it is pretty clear, once again, that the  Republicans want to make women's health a political battlefield instead  of a serious priority.   Let me be clear. The Democrats are going to keep standing up for a  woman's right to the care that is right for her. We are going to  continue to stand up for women's access to affordable birth control,  for women's constitutionally protected rights, and against those who  want to put politicians in the doctor's office, where they do not ever  belong. If that is a fight the Republicans want to have, we are ready  and so are people across the country, like the brave ones who spoke up  against this very harmful rule.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
