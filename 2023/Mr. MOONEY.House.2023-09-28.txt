 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment to  prevent tax dollars from hardworking Americans from being sent to  Mexico allegedly in support of economic development until the President  of the United States of America informs Congress that Mexico has  decided to stop the free flow of fentanyl across our southern border.   My plan is a simple and strong response to the Mexican Government's  refusing to take action to address the crisis of fentanyl pouring  across our border. The Mexican President continues to falsely state  that fentanyl is not manufactured or consumed in his country.   On March 17, 2023, Mexico President Obrador said at a news conference  in Mexico City, ``Here, we do not produce fentanyl, and we do not have  consumption of fentanyl.'' Suggesting why doesn't the United States  take care of its own issues.   However, the numbers do not lie. The Drug Enforcement Administration  said in December that ``Most of the fentanyl trafficked by the Sinaloa  and CJNG cartels is being mass-produced at secret factories in Mexico  with chemicals sourced largely from China.'' There were 14,000 pounds  of fentanyl seized last year at the southern border and more than  11,000 pounds this year so far.   Fentanyl is pouring across our border because of the disastrous open- border policies of President Biden and his Democrat allies in Congress.  Meanwhile, Mexico refuses to act against the cartels. Todd Robinson,  who is President Biden's Assistant Secretary of State for International  Narcotics, testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in  February 2023, To be honest, the challenge that we have with Mexico is  their unwillingness to put sufficient resources into the fight against  fentanyl, and we are pushing them to do that.   Multiple administrations have pushed Mexico to do more, yet they  refuse to act. Now is the time for Congress to step up and use the  power of the purse to hold Mexico accountable until they change their  behavior.   Mr. Chair, this amendment is focused solely on economic aid. This  amendment does not impact narcotics interdiction and border security  assistance that we also provide to Mexico. Mexico should not be  rewarded with economic support funding when they refuse to stop the  production of fentanyl that has killed hundreds of thousands of  Americans. West Virginia, in particular, has been hit hard by the drug  epidemic, and a lot of the poison on our streets can be traced directly  back to Mexican drug cartels.   We need to secure our border, but we also need Mexico to partner with  us. Our practice of giving them more United States taxpayer dollars as  an inducement to fight against drug trafficking has failed. It is time  to cut off economic funding until the President of the United States  can report to Congress that Mexico is working with us to address the  flow of fentanyl across the border. I call on all my colleagues to join  me in supporting this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance  of my time.                                time  1400
