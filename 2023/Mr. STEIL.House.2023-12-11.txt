 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (S. 2747) to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to extend  the Administrative Fine Program for certain reporting violations.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2747         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF ADMINISTRATIVE FINE PROGRAM.         Section 309(a)(4)(C)(v) of the Federal Election Campaign       Act of 1971 (52 U.S.C. 30109(a)(4)(C)(v)) is amended by       striking ``December 31, 2023'' and inserting ``December 31,       2033''.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2747, a bill to amend the  Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to extend the Administrative Fine  Program for certain reporting violations for an additional 10 years.   Congress has previously extended this program six times, each time on  a nonpartisan basis. I rise today to encourage my colleagues to again  extend the authorization of this crucial program.   The Federal Elections Commission, commonly referred to as the FEC,  enforces Federal law that requires political committees to file reports  of receipts and disbursements by a certain date.                                time  1415    Under the Administrative Fine Program, the FEC is able to swiftly  resolve infractions related to late-filed or unfiled reports, ensuring  transparency and accountability in our political process.   Currently, the Administrative Fine Program is set to expire on  December 31, 2023. By passing this bill today, the House will extend  the program for an additional 10 years, ensuring the FEC can  expeditiously assess and enforce fines against campaign committees for  their late-filed or unfiled reports.   Without the Administrative Fine Program, the FEC would be required to  go through its traditional enforcement process to achieve compliance.  This process is more costly and more time consuming. It would result in  fewer available resources for the agency to devote to serious  violations of campaign finance law.   The Administrative Fine Program has been successful. Before the  inception of the Administrative Fine Program, an average of 21 percent  of campaign finance reports were filed late. Now, late-filed reports  are below 10 percent, and the agency has assessed over $9 million in  fines. It is important to note that these fines do not fund the agency  but are deposited in the U.S. Treasury.   Fewer late-filed reports means greater transparency for the American  public. Greater transparency builds Americans' confidence in our  elections.   The bill not only accomplishes the immediate goal of efficient  campaign finance regulation, but it also aligns with the broader  objectives of the American Confidence in Elections Act, or ACE Act:  transparency and our shared goal to ensure confidence in our elections.   By passing this bill today, we can ensure the FEC enforcement  operations continue to run smoothly. In late September, the Committee  on House Administration considered an identical bill, H.R. 5734, and  reported it to the full House by voice vote.   Our Senate colleagues passed S. 2747 by voice earlier this fall,  which means this important bill would go to the President's desk  following passage in the House.   I am urging my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join the  bipartisan membership of the Committee on House Administration and the  Senate Rules Committee to support this important measure today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Lee), the chair of the Subcommittee on Elections of the  Committee on House Administration and the former Florida Secretary of  State.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   I thank my colleague, Mr. Morelle, the ranking member on the  Committee on House Administration, for his work in this regard.   As noted by my colleague, sometimes we disagree on elections  administration. We have had those debates in our committee. This piece  of legislation is a true nonpartisan opportunity for us to come  together to provide more transparency for the American people, in  particular, to make sure that this important program continues in place  at the Federal Election Commission.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for speaking in support  of this important measure. By passing the bill today, we can ensure FEC  enforcement operations continue to run smoothly. I am urging my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join in supporting this  measure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
