 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3101) to enhance cybersecurity information sharing and  coordination at ports in the United States, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows                                 H.R. 3101         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Strengthening Cybersecurity       Information Sharing and Coordination in Our Ports Act of       2017''.  [[Page H8105]]            SEC. 2. IMPROVING CYBERSECURITY RISK ASSESSMENTS, INFORMATION                     SHARING, AND COORDINATION.         The Secretary of Homeland Security shall--        (1) develop and implement a maritime cybersecurity risk       assessment model within 120 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, consistent with the National Institute       of Standards and Technology Framework for Improving Critical       Infrastructure Cybersecurity and any update to that document       pursuant to Public Law 113-274, to evaluate current and       future cybersecurity risks (as such term is defined in       section 227 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C.       148));        (2) evaluate, on a periodic basis but not less often than       once every two years, the effectiveness of the maritime       cybersecurity risk assessment model under paragraph (1);        (3) seek to ensure participation of at least one       information sharing and analysis organization (as such term       is defined in section 212 of the Homeland Security Act of       2002 (6 U.S.C. 131)) representing the maritime community in       the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration       Center, pursuant to subsection (d)(1)(B) of section 227 of       such Act;        (4) establish guidelines for voluntary reporting of       maritime-related cybersecurity risks and incidents (as such       terms are defined in section 227 of such Act) to the Center       (as such term is defined subsection (b) of such section 227),       and other appropriate Federal agencies; and        (5) request the National Maritime Security Advisory       Committee established under section 70112 of title 46, United       States Code, to report and make recommendations to the       Secretary on enhancing the sharing of information related to       cybersecurity risks and incidents, consistent with the       responsibilities of the Center, between relevant Federal       agencies and--        (A) State, local, and tribal governments;        (B) relevant public safety and emergency response agencies;        (C) relevant law enforcement and security organizations;        (D) maritime industry;        (E) port owners and operators; and        (F) terminal owners and operators.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Strengthening  Cybersecurity Information Sharing and Coordination in Our Ports Act.   More than $1.3 trillion in cargo travels through American seaports  along our coasts every year. A safe but constant and unrestricted flow  of goods and services through our maritime transportation system have  played a vital role in allowing the United States to become the global  superpower it is today. To put it simply, our seaports are the gateways  to our economic survival.   Unfortunately, as our port systems increasingly benefit from new  technology, high-capacity information technology, and computer systems,  they are also increasingly finding themselves in the crosshairs of  those who are waging a cyber war against the United States. These  attacks originate from rogue hackers, terrorist groups, and adversarial  nation-states, and America is a constant target.   In recent years, China successfully stole over 20 million security  clearances from OPM. Russia has waged a cyber war against our political  system. Equifax had a breach that jeopardized sensitive information on  over 43 million people.   In June, the Port of Los Angeles, one that several of our committee  members will be visiting next week, was briefly shut down because of a  cyber attack. This is one of our busiest ports, and it is estimated  that it cost nearly $300 million in economic damage. We must do more to  strengthen cybersecurity of these essential maritime hubs.   Fortunately, we have that opportunity. The legislation before us  requires the Department and the Secretary of Homeland Security to  implement a risk assessment model which focuses on cybersecurity  vulnerabilities and risk. This assessment will be reviewed periodically  so we can determine the best security practices to implement at each  port.   The bill also requires that the DHS Secretary work with the National  and Area Maritime Security Advisory Committees to analyze and share  cyber risks and to report to Congress measures that have been taken to  improve cybersecurity at our Nation's ports. This bill will strengthen  the security of our homeland and protect our economic assets.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congresswoman Torres and other members  of the Homeland Security Committee for their hard work on this issue. I  urge my colleagues to support this commonsense bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.           Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of             Representatives,                                  Washington, DC, October 19, 2017.      Hon. Michael T. McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      Washington, DC.        I write concerning H.R. 3101, the Strengthening       Cybersecurity Information Sharing and Coordination in Our       Ports Act of 2017. This legislation includes matters that       fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure.        I recognize and appreciate your desire to bring this       legislation before the House of Representatives in an       expeditious manner, and accordingly, the Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure will forego action on the       bill. However, this is conditional on our mutual       understanding that foregoing consideration of the bill does       not prejudice the Committee with respect to the appointment       of conferees or to any future jurisdictional claim over the       subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation       that fall within the Committee's Rule X jurisdiction.       Further, this is conditional on our understanding that       mutually agreed upon changes to the legislation will be       incorporated into the bill prior to floor consideration.       Lastly, should a conference on the bill be necessary, I       request your support for the appointment of conferees from       the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure during any       House-Senate conference convened on this or related       legislation.        Finally, I would ask that a copy this letter and your       response acknowledging our jurisdictional interest be       included in the bill report filed by the Committee on       Homeland Security, as well as in the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor, to       memorialize our understanding. I look forward to working with       the Committee on Homeland Security as the bill moves through       the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                      Bill Shuster,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                   Washington, DC, October 19, 2017.      Hon. Bill Shuster,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Shuster: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 3101, the ``Strengthening Cybersecurity Information       Sharing and Coordination in Our Ports Act of 2017.'' I       appreciate your support in bringing this legislation before       the House of Representatives, and accordingly, understand       that the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will       forego further consideration of the bill.        The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual       understanding that by foregoing consideration of this bill at       this time, the Committee on Transportation and  [[Page H8106]]       Infrastructure does not waive any jurisdiction over the       subject matter contained in this bill or similar legislation       in the future. In addition, should a conference on this bill       be necessary, I would support your request to have the       Committee represented on the conference committee. Further,       the Committee on Homeland Security agrees that mutually       agreed upon changes to the legislation will be incorporated       into the bill prior to floor consideration.        I will insert copies of this exchange in the report on the       bill and in the Congressional Record during consideration of       this bill on the House floor. I thank you for your       cooperation in this matter.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers. If the gentleman  from Texas has no other speakers, I am prepared to close once the  gentleman does.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I once again urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation. I want to thank Congresswoman Torres for her strong  leadership on this bill, Mr. Vela, Ranking Member Thompson.   Mr. Speaker, we have passed over 50 bills out of my committee, out of  the House floor, and sent them to the Senate, where they still sit  there with no action whatsoever. And when it comes to homeland security  measures, I believe that it is dangerous to do nothing, and I urge the  Senate to take up action on this bill and the other 50 bills that we  have sent over to the Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
