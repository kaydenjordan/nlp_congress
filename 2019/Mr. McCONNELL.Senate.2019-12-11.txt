 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  following the disposition of H.R. 2333, the Senate proceed to executive  session and resume consideration of the VanDyke nomination; further,  that the postcloture time on the VanDyke nomination expire at 4:15 p.m.  today and the Senate vote on the confirmation of the nomination;  further, if confirmed, that the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified of  the Senate's action; further, that following the disposition of the  VanDyke nomination and notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, the  Senate vote on the motions to invoke cloture on the Sullivan, Hahn, and  Skipwith nominations in the order listed; finally, that if cloture is  invoked on the Sullivan, Hahn, and Skipwith nominations, the  confirmation votes occur at a time to be determined by the majority  leader, in consultation with the Democratic leader, on Thursday,  December 12.    Madam President, it is no secret that Washington  Democrats have been itching to impeach President Trump since the moment  he took the oath of office. Remember the Washington Post's headline on  Inauguration Day in 2017: ``The campaign to impeach President Trump has  begun.'' That was the Washington Post's headline on Inauguration Day in  2017.   Just a few months later, in April of 2017, one leading House Democrat  had already made up her mind. She declared she would ``fight every day  until he's impeached.'' As an aside, this same senior Democrat is one  of the committee chairwomen whom Speaker Pelosi asked to help lead the  impeachment process. She was literally standing at the Speaker's  shoulder as she announced yesterday that she will bring two articles of  impeachment up for a vote. Yet she had had her mind made up more than 2  years ago, long before this supposedly fair inquiry. This is sort of  emblematic of their whole process.   House Democrats announced yesterday that they will rush ahead and  prepare to send the Senate articles of impeachment based on the least  thorough and most unfair impeachment inquiry  [[Page S6958]]  in modern history. Well, the House Democrats' denigration of their  solemn duty will not cause the Senate to denigrate ours. If the House  continues down this destructive road and sends us articles of  impeachment, the Senate will take them up in the new year and proceed  to a fair trial.   Now, in the meantime, our colleagues' obsession with impeachment has  left us with a host of important, bipartisan legislation that is still  unfinished at this late date.   For months, Senate Republicans have been calling on our Democratic  colleagues to go beyond picking fights with the White House and  actually legislate for the American people. Yet, for practically the  entire autumn, our Democratic friends' political calculation seemed to  be that these vital pieces of business could wait until the eleventh  hour because impeachment was the higher priority--and wait they have.   Finally, after weeks of pressure from the Republicans and from hard- working Americans across the country, Speaker Pelosi backed down  yesterday and announced that she will let the House vote on President  Trump's USMCA. The Democrats have stalled this agreement for so long  that it is now impossible for the USMCA to become law in 2019,  especially given all of the other urgent things they have stalled right  alongside it. The Democrats have simply run out the clock. Assuming the  House Democrats send us articles of impeachment next week, a Senate  trial will have to be our first item of business in January. So the  USMCA will continue to be a casualty of the Democrats' impeachment  obsession for several more weeks before we can actually turn to it. Yet  I am glad the Speaker is finally beginning to bring her USMCA  obstruction to a close.   As we triage in the coming days, the Republicans hope we will be able  to pass not only the NDAA conference report but also government funding  legislation that allocates taxpayers' hard-earned money to urgent  Federal priorities. The NDAA has consistently brought Members together  from across the political spectrum--and with good reason--in that it  gives Congress the opportunity to set priorities for the U.S. military  of the future. The NDAA helps to guide the Pentagon's investments in  modernization and readiness, cutting-edge weapons and capabilities, and  in servicemembers and military families.   I am grateful for the efforts by Chairman Inhofe and Ranking Member  Reed, who made compromises from the beginning and worked hard to ensure  the conference report remained true to the 58-year tradition of a  bipartisan bill that prioritizes our military and sets aside unrelated  partisan priorities.   I cannot say the same thing about the Democrats in the House,  unfortunately, but I hope they will learn from this year's difficult  path to a conference report. Next year, I hope they will produce a  bipartisan bill from the beginning that will put our national security  interests first. Now, obviously, that authorizing legislation should be  paired with the appropriations measure that will actually fund our  servicemembers' tools and training and enable our commanders to  actually plan ahead.   I am grateful for the hard work by Chairman Shelby, his counterpart  in the House, and our subcommittee chairs to reboot a stalled  appropriations process and try to get bills over the finish line in the  short time that remains.   To be frank, only a laser focus from both parties in both Chambers on  getting results will create a path to pass appropriations bills this  year. There is simply not the time left for my Democratic friends to  continue haggling over the exact kinds of poison pills, partisan policy  riders, and Presidential transfer authorities that the Speaker and the  Democratic leader had explicitly agreed months ago would be off the  table. Under the agreement months ago, these were supposed to be off  the table.   The White House, Republican leaders in both Chambers, and the  Democratic leaders in both Chambers all agreed to these parameters-- literally pledged in writing that these kinds of partisan roadblocks  would be kept out of the process. So if all parties honor what they  agreed to, we should have an opportunity to agree on government funding  in time to make this a law this month, which means next week.   Now that our Democratic colleagues are back at the table, Senate  Republicans stand ready to do all we can in the time we still have.  Let's end this legislative year on the right foot. Let's deliver for  our All-Volunteer Armed Forces and for families all across our country.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    For the information of all Senators, the Senate will  vote on the confirmation of the Skipwith and Sullivan nominations at  11:45 a.m. tomorrow, as well as the confirmation of the Hahn nomination  at 1:45 p.m.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that if any of  the nominations listed are confirmed, the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I have 7 requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of  the Majority and Minority leaders.
