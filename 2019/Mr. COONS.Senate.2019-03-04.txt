 Mr. President, today, it is with a heavy heart that  I wish to recognize the life and legacy of William ``Bill'' Murray, a  tremendous advocate for kidney disease patients in my home State of  Delaware. This week, advocates from across the country will travel to  Washington, DC, to meet with their congressional representatives, share  their stories, and ask that we remain committed to investing in kidney  disease research.   Like Bill, who became involved with the National Kidney Foundation  and the kidney disease community in 2014, many patients, family  members, and caregivers throughout the country will meet with their  legislators and government officials to increase awareness of and  improve policies focusing on kidney disease.   I am proud to say that Bill made being involved with the National  Kidney Foundation a family event, often bringing his partner Linda,  daughter-  [[Page S1619]]  in-law Danielle, grandson Emerson, sister Michelle, nieces, friends,  and others to as many events as possible.   Bill worked tirelessly to increase awareness about kidney disease in  Delaware, spending time volunteering at local events, helping with  community health screenings, and organizing support for World Kidney  Day. True to character, even in his death, he helped those in need by  being a deceased donor for patients waiting for organ transplants. As  my family, staff, and I extend our deepest sympathies to all those who  had the privilege of knowing Bill, I take comfort in knowing that his  impact, passion, and determination will continue to bring hope to the  kidney disease community for years to come.                            ____________________
