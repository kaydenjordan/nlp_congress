 ROE of Tennessee asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute.)    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  life of a giant in northeast Tennessee and my friend, Frederick ``Pal''  Barger, Jr., who passed away recently at the age of 90.   Pal's impact on our community was tremendous. Pal is best known for  Pal's Sudden Service, a drive-through restaurant with rapid service,  great food, and affordable prices.   In 2001, Pal's became the first restaurant to receive the Malcolm  Baldrige National Quality Award, the Nation's highest Presidential  honor for performance excellence. Pal is one of northeast Tennessee's  best success stories.   Pal's commitment to excellence didn't stop at the drive-through  window. He received recognition throughout his life for his kindness,  generosity, and unwavering dedication to help our region prosper.   I am especially grateful for Pal's contributions to his alma mater,  East Tennessee State University, which have greatly impacted so many of  our region's current and future leaders.   Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize the life of Pal Barger for  his tremendous impact on our community.                            ____________________
