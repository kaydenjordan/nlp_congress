 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember Mr. Jack Greer.   Jack passed away last week after a long life of personal and business  achievement and service to his family and to his community.   So many people in south Alabama knew Jack from shopping for groceries  at Greer's grocery store, a business which has been operating in our  area for over 100 years. But it was through his civic involvement that  Jack truly left his mark. His civic contributions are too many to list.   It was his role as an environmental advocate that he perhaps was most  proud of. He was a founding member of Mobile Baykeeper and remained  engaged throughout his life in protecting the waters in and around  Mobile Bay.   Jack was an active member of Dauphin Way United Methodist Church, and  he proudly served his country as second lieutenant in the United States  Army.   I knew Mr. Jack. I have known the Greer family my entire life. My  deepest condolences to his wife of 70 years, Janice, and his many  surviving children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. Please know  that Mr. Jack lived a life you can all be proud of. He will be, and is,  sorely missed.                            ____________________
