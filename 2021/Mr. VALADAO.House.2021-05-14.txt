 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the  worsening drought conditions in California.   Farmers and producers in California grow more than one-third of the  vegetables and two-thirds of the fruit and nuts produced in the U.S.  Depriving our farmers of the water they need to grow our Nation's food  ultimately increases the cost of food for every person in the United  States. Still, the House majority has yet to take action to address  this drought or consider legislation that will bring clean, reliable  water to our struggling communities.   In February, I introduced H.R. 737, the RENEW WIIN Act, to allow the  little water we have to be made available to the communities that feed  our Nation.   While I am glad to see my persistent requests for a drought emergency  declaration granted this week by California's Governor, this is only a  step in the right direction. We need immediate action in Congress, and  I implore my colleagues in the majority to advance legislation to  confront this crisis, including my bill, the RENEW WIIN Act.                            ____________________
