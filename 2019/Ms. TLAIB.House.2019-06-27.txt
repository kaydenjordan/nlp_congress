 Madam Speaker, I take offense to my colleague from Arizona  saying we are not going to win. This is not a game. These are people's  lives.   When my colleague says we need to try, we have tried. I am asking  them to try harder because we are creating a whole generation of  children, Madam Speaker, who will remember what we did. They will  remember that we caged them up like animals. We ripped them away from  their parents and pumped them with drugs to make them stop crying for  their mothers.   No amount of apologizing and no amount of debating in this Chamber  will make it better, Madam Speaker. I am asking my colleagues to be  more humane, to debate real policy change that will address the crisis  at the border, like comprehensive immigration reform.   We must do better for these children. Again, no amount of  apologizing, no amount of debating, no amount of politicking will make  it better.  [[Page H5240]]
