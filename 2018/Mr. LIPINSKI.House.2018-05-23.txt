 Mr. Chairman, Iran is the world's foremost state  sponsor of terrorism. In spite of their weak economy and U.S.-imposed  sanctions in response to Iran's support for terrorism, abuse of human  rights, and acquisition of prohibited weapons, they continue to support  violent groups abroad.   As our diplomatic and military leaders determine how best to respond  to Iran, they and the world, including Iranians, should have a detailed  accounting of the amount spent by Iran to support specific terrorist  groups. This is especially important in light of the escalating  conflict between Israel and Iran-backed forces in Syria.   My amendment requires an annual report from the Secretary of State  and the Director of National Intelligence describing Iranian  expenditures on military and terrorist activities outside their  country. This will send a clear message to Iran and our allies that we  do not tolerate support of terrorism.   Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman and ranking member for including my  amendment in this en bloc, and I urge my colleagues to support it.
