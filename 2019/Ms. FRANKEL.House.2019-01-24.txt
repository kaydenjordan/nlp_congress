 Madam Speaker, this week I met with south Floridians to  talk about the impact of the cruel Trump shutdown, so many sad stories.   I learned about a TSA agent who just came back from maternity leave  who had to send her baby to her mother in Massachusetts because she  didn't have the money for daycare or Pampers.   The air traffic controllers told me that their stress level is so  high now, it is a danger to all of us. And I heard from the service  providers of victims of domestic violence who are worried that their  shelters are about to close.   Now, Democrats, we support smart border security, not an ineffective,  wasteful wall. But, listen, we can debate that at another time.   Right now, we have to open our government so that we can get back to  the business for the people.  [[Page H1189]]                                ____________________
