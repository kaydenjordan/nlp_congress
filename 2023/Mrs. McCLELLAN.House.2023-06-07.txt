 Mr. Speaker, yesterday the students at Huguenot High  School in Richmond, Virginia, celebrated their graduation.   Moments after the ceremony ended, as friends and family gathered  outside for hugs and selfies, gunshots rang out.   Panic ensued.   When the dust settled, a graduate, Shawn Jackson, was dead. He was 18  years old. Shawn's stepfather, who came to celebrate with him, Renzo  Smith, was dead. He was 36 years old.   Five additional people were shot. Others sustained injuries,  including Renya Jackson Smith, Shawn's 9-year-old sister, who was hit  by a car while fleeing the scene.                                time  1045    Richmond police have a suspect in custody. He is 19 years old. He  knew the victim. He and Shawn were in an ongoing dispute.   We should not have to live like this. What should have been the  happiest day of those kids' lives turned into every parents' worst  nightmare.   Those kids saw their freshman year cut short by COVID. They should  have felt the joy yesterday and last night of graduating. Instead,  their final memory of high school is marred forever by trauma.   The active shooter drills that they endured throughout their school  years did not prepare them for a shooting at their graduation, or in a  public park, in a grocery store, at a theater, at their house of  worship, at a concert, at a mall, walking down the street, on a  highway, in their home.   Where are they safe? My son asks me this every time that there is a  shooting on the news.   Three months ago today, when I stood at this very spot to take my  oath of office, you saw my son and daughter standing proudly beside me.  You saw how excited my son was. You saw his dance moves.   Four days later, one of his classmates shot himself accidentally with  a gun he was using as a prop to record a video. He died.   Last night, my husband and I had to tell our children that they are  not going to school today and possibly for the rest of the year because  of a shooting at a graduation less than a mile from our home.   Every time there is a shooting we go through this same routine. Every  time my son is afraid, wondering will he be next. I hug him and I say,  I am doing everything within my power to keep you safe.   As a State legislator in Virginia, I was proud to pass several pieces  of gun violence prevention measures to do just that, including securing  $12 million in funding to invest in our communities to address the root  causes of gun violence.   I was excited to see this Congress pass the first piece of  substantive gun violence in 30 years in a bipartisan measure. So you  can imagine my disgust and my sorrow when, after the Tennessee school  shooting, one of our colleagues, one of our Republican colleagues in an  interview on television said: We are not going to do anything.   That is unacceptable. We must take action to address the root causes  of gun violence, to ban assault weapons, implement universal background  checks, gun storage, among other commonsense measures that are popular  with an overwhelming majority of voters according to FOX News polling.   I came here to solve problems. I came here to save lives. Thoughts  and prayers are not enough. It is past time for action.   Today, I mourn the lives lost in my district, my city, my school  division, my neighborhood. Today, I seek to comfort their loved ones  and those traumatized by the terror they felt last night.   Today, I recommit to doing everything within my power to make sure  that this never happens again. Enough is enough.   Mr. Speaker, I am begging my colleagues in this body: Do something.                            ____________________
