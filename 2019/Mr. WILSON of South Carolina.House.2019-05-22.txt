 Mr. Speaker, South Carolina is  commemorating the life of Ronnie Young, who was a model public servant  who genuinely loved the people he represented.   State Representative Young of Aiken County entered into rest on  Sunday. He was a native of Aiken County, having made the valley  community his lifelong residence. He was a member of Sweetwater Church  of God.   He was a full-time legislator for District 84 in the State house.  Previously, he had been elected countywide as chairman of Aiken County  Council.   His civic involvement included the Graniteville Exchange Club, Aiken  Rotary Club, Midland Valley Lions Club, Midland Valley Chamber of  Commerce, and the Has-Been Club.   He is survived by his wife of 48 years, Susan Napier Young, and a  sister, Patricia Boyd of Warrenville.   Ronnie Young will always be cherished for his successful dedication  to public service.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
