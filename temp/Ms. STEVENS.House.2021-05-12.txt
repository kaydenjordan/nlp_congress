 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of my incredible  friend, Tom Hess, a beloved resident of Northville, Michigan, who we  lost last month after a courageous battle with cancer at the age of 76.   Tom was born in Detroit in the summer of 1944 to Raymond and Jessie  Hess.   After graduating from Michigan State University in 1966, he joined  the United States Army, where he attended Infantry Officer Candidate  School. He went on to complete all the training necessary to become a  Green Beret and proudly served his country as a first lieutenant during  the Vietnam war. This was something that Tom was  [[Page H2202]]  deeply proud of, his service to the country.   Upon his honorable discharge from the Army, Tom returned to Detroit,  where he graduated from Wayne State University Law School and was  admitted to both the Michigan and Florida Bar Associations. He became  the managing partner of a law firm in Daytona Beach and had many  exciting real estate ventures in Florida before moving back to metro  Detroit in 1990 to establish his own firm, where he practiced for  another 18 years.   Tom married his exceptional wife, Janet, in 1991. Together, they  opened their hearts and their home in Northville to members of our  community on countless occasions.   This was the stuff that the Democrats of Western Wayne County are  made of, and it is what raised me as a young candidate for Congress to  propel me into office.   Their generosity was boundless and their ability to connect people  endless. It is something that we will remember for all of time, in  their home, in downtown Northville, that looked as if it was built in  the 1800s but was actually built by Tom himself.   With his generous spirit and political acumen, Tom was a tireless  advocate for the causes closest to his heart. He cared very deeply  about the work being done in this Chamber, and he was focused on  efforts to make our democracy more fair, strong, and inclusive for  generations to come.   During my final visit to Mr. Hess, when I got the opportunity to say  good-bye to him--because in classic Tom Hess fashion, he insisted, as  he lay in hospice, on having an open, living wake--he looked me in the  eye and said to me that his ultimate wish, his dying wish, was to see  H.R. 1, the For the People Act, signed into law.    He was passionately committed to ensuring the success of our  democracy, and he recognized the historic opportunity we have before us  right now to bring our elections into the 21st century and to ensure  that everyone has the right to vote. He looked me in the eye and said:  I ask you to tell your colleagues on both sides of the aisle, but most  penetratingly, the other side of the aisle, to join you in getting H.R.  1 done.   Now, we know we have taken the H.R. 1 vote in this Chamber, and it is  going to the Senate. So I send the message from Northville, Michigan,  as any good representative of their constituents would do: Pass H.R. 1  now. Send this to the President's desk for his signature.   Tom showed us a life well-lived. For if cleanliness and perfection of  home is godliness, that was Tom and Janet.   The Wall Street Journal in August 2020, just last year, reflecting on  the hobbies that people were taking up in the pandemic, shared stories  about people building model trains in the bottom of their homes, and  that was something that Tom already had in his home. He had this model  train station that we would, during the pandemic, go down and look at.  He disassembled it and gave it to a museum before he passed away. So,  he beat the pandemic trend.   We know that Tom is survived by his loving wife of 29 years, Janet  Hess; his children, his son, Raymond, and his beloved granddaughter,  Hazel; his in-laws; many nieces and nephews; and extended family  members throughout Michigan and Indiana.   The family pays tribute to Angela Hospice, providers who I had the  chance to meet when I was visiting with Tom, for their tireless work  and dedication to the people in the most sacred time in their life,  and, of course, the VA hospital in Ann Arbor, which Tom loved so  dearly.   I thank my colleagues for joining me and recognizing my beloved  constituent, Tom Hess.                            ____________________
