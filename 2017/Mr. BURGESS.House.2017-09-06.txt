 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, the country has stood, first, in awe of the power that  was unleashed on the Texas-Louisiana coast, and then in admiration of  constituents up and down the Texas and Louisiana coast as they face  this difficulty and work together to get through it.   This bill today is also a product of people working together. Through  at least two sessions of Congress we have now come with self-driving  vehicle legislation that is going to change our economy.   This bill will allow developers room to grow, while making certain  that the technology is safe for consumers. This act will create jobs  and ensure that we remain the global leader in innovation. Most  importantly, the self-driving vehicle legislation has the ability to  save lives.   Throughout my life, I have seen the lifesaving effects of  advancements in vehicle technology, starting with the seat belt, to the  air bag, to antilock brakes. Self-driving vehicles are the next step in  this trajectory.   The Energy and Commerce Committee has dedicated a lot to this  technology and its ability to save lives, and, certainly, the last term  of Congress, the Commerce, Manufacturing, and Trade Subcommittee that  Mr. Latta now chairs. I am proud to see the product of our work come to  the floor.
