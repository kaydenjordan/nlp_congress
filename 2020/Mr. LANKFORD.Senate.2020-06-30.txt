 Madam President, 2 days ago, at 3:30 in the morning in  Tulsa, Officer Zarkeshan did a routine traffic stop. He got backup  coming to him, who was Sergeant Craig Johnson, and dealt with a person  who would not get out of their vehicle. Twelve times they said to this  person: Get out of your vehicle.   Trying to figure out what to do, they worked to deescalate, and they  realized he was not going to move. After the back-and-forth  conversation there in the street, the individual got out of his car  with a pistol and shot both officers multiple times in the head, jumped  in a second car, and drove away. Seven hours later, both those  individuals were apprehended.   While the flippant national conversation in this room and across the  country continues about defunding the police, two officers in Tulsa are  clinging to their lives in a hospital right now.   I think our Nation loses track of exactly the sacrifices that law  enforcement makes every single day. Their families hugged them before  they took off for the graveyard shift and said: See you in the morning.   Officer Zarkeshan had been on patrol 6 weeks. He graduated from the  academy in May.   I am grateful there are men and women across our country who continue  to put on the blue uniform to serve and protect us because there are  people on the streets who mean to do our community harm, and when given  the opportunity, they will take that opportunity.   If the Presiding Officer doesn't mind, I would like to pause and pray  for just a moment for the families and for them.   Father, we do ask Your help for Sergeant Johnson and Officer  Zarkeshan, to intervene in a way that only You can. Help the doctors  and nurses. Give them wisdom. Give a sense of peace to those families  as they struggle for answers. Pray for Chief Franklin and for all the  Tulsa PD. God, they need Your help in these moments. I pray that You  would bring peace as only You can.   In Your Name I pray. Amen.                                   S. 4049    Madam President, Senator Inhofe and Jack Reed have done a pretty  remarkable job working through the NDAA and all that has to be done and  the literally thousands of decisions that have to be made. It is pretty  remarkable what they have done, and I am grateful for all of their  work.   We lose track of the fact that there are folks in Afghanistan right  now fighting over peace and stability and pushing down terrorists who  are still in the area. We lose track of the fact that U.S. Army  soldiers right now are having dinner in a tent in Poland. There are  folks in the U.S. Navy who are sound asleep in Guam, except for those  folks who are standing watch. There are marines in Okinawa who are  asleep, but they won't be asleep very long. There are folks in the Air  Force who are prepping for tomorrow's mission in South Korea.   All around the world, awake and asleep, there is never a moment and  there is never a place where folks in the U.S. military are not  representing their Nation and doing exactly what their Nation has asked  them to do. We are proud of those folks.   This bill, the NDAA, gives a 3-percent pay increase to those folks.  It ensures that we won't have another BRAC round of base closings in  the United States during this next fiscal year. It deals with some of  the ally relationships that we have in Taiwan and Ukraine. It helps  bring some of the folks who have worked as interpreters in Afghanistan  for years to the United States.    It deals with not just those in the military, but it deals with their  families as well. It allows additional funding to help licenses move  from State to State for those who are military spouses. It adds  additional supervision for military housing to make sure we do better  supervision there.   Bases and posts around Oklahoma have very specific things that fully  fund the KC-46 and the B-21 Programs. It is very significant to Tinker  and the community around it. It deals with the 180-day rule  modification. It is an amendment I specifically put into this. It is  something that folks at Tinker have asked for over and over again.  Those folks who are retiring in their uniform are interested in  civilian spots, but under current practice, they have to wait 180 days  before they can move from military to civilian. Well, in that time  period, guess what happens? They get snatched up by a defense  contractor, and we lose their skills and their wisdom that they have.  Why do we do that? Why do we literally punish one of our members in the  military when they retire from the military, after great service there,  and then say, ``If you are interested in continuing to be able to serve  in the community that you are in, you have to wait 6 months before you  can do it''? We put an addition in there to expand this pilot program  to allow those folks to move from uniform to civilian and to compete  for those jobs and not have to wait 180 days.   At Altus Air Force Base, it fully funds the KC-46. It prohibits us  stopping the KC-135 tankers until all the details are all worked out  with the KC-46 and advance if they need it. It funds the T-7 Red Hawk  in the development of that, the replacement for the T-38.   In McAlester, it funds the Army McAlester munitions plant work there  and the construction to increase the capability of the Sea Lion. That  is an area where we have old munitions that have to come back and  actually be disassembled to be safely disassembled. It is a job a lot  of folks don't want because they are handling old munitions, but it is  the folks in McAlester who do it every day, and we are very grateful  for the work they continue to do there.   In Lawton, Fort Sill, it funds the Talon, an integrated management  system. It is a very significant advantage that we have. It is one of  the things that everything that happens in Lawton in the fires, they  want all over the world. Whether you are in South Korea or whether you  are in Saudi Arabia, they are interested in what is happening in  Lawton. Even for some of our guardsmen for the Oklahoma National  Guard--it protects the 137, stopping any kind of divestiture of their  system for the MC-12. It continues that process. It is a very  significant bill to the Nation in our national defense. It pays  attention to people all over the world, but it also takes care of the  issues that we need to resolve to be able to have them trained,  equipped, and ready--much of that happening in Oklahoma.   There are some specific things that are in this that I requested as  well. Everyone in the military is familiar with the term ``DD-214.''  Everyone, after you get out of the military, whether you go to the VA  or whatever it may be, they are interested in your DD-214. Those are  your records for your Active-Duty service.   Well, it is great if you are in Active Duty. The problem, though, is  if you are a reservist or a guardsman--and there are 840,000 of those  across the country--they don't get a DD-214 like the Active Duty do.  So, in later years, when they want to prove their service record, they  can't do that. We fixed that in this bill. It is an amendment I brought  to the 13,400 Oklahomans who are in the Guard, for them to finally have  records for their service just like the Active Duty have records for  theirs.   One of the things I focused in on as well is allowing religious  accommodation and training for that in our military. Our members of the  military have the same religious freedoms as everyone else does. They  are to be accommodated in their faith, no matter what their faith is,  in the U.S. military. Sometimes the training lacks on that, and  officers and JAG members who sometimes struggle, they say: Well, for  good order and discipline, everybody just needs to put your faith  aside. Well, when you join the U.S. military, you are not required to  also give up the Constitution. You are protected. You are allowed to  keep your faith and to  [[Page S3988]]  maintain that. This bill will allow some greater training and  instruction to make sure we protect the rights of each individual to  live their faith. We think that is important as well.   There are a lot of good things in this. I am glad to be a part of it  and to see this continue on, even through some things that you may not  think are really military in it. Last year, in the bill, when it came  out of conference, paid parental leave was added to it for Federal  employees. A lot of folks said: Where did that come from? It came from  a House-Senate compromise. In the House-Senate was documentation to add  paid parental leave, but the problem was, what the House had actually  pulled together for paid parental leave didn't work for a lot of folks.  It left out people like the FAA and all the folks who work for FAA. It  left out the TSA. It left out article I judges, so they don't get  access. If you work for the FAA and TSA, you don't get access to paid  parental leave like other Federal employees do. You know, we need to  fix that, and I have an amendment in this bill that says: Let's treat  all Federal workers the same in this. If we are going to pay parental  leave, don't ignore the good folks who work for the FAA and TSA and  other folks. So this actually fixes an error from last year's bill that  came over from the House to make sure that all Federal employees are  treated equally. We can do this.   This is something we already have wide bipartisan support for. It is  why we opened the bill with so many votes yesterday on a wide  bipartisan majority. Let's keep working on it, and let's finish it out.  Let's get it done before the Fourth of July so we can continue to honor  members of the U.S. military and to thank them because they are  literally standing watch across the Earth right now on our behalf.   I yield the floor.
