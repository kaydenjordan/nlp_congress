 Mr. Speaker, today I come to the House floor with bad news  for American workers and small businesses. Democrats are pushing a  misguided provision within their massive tax-and-spend boondoggle that  will allow the Internal Revenue Service to spy on practically every  financial account in the United States.   Included in their $5.5 trillion socialist, tax-and-spend package is a  proposal to create an IRS surveillance program that would require all  financial institutions to monitor, track, and report accounts that have  more than $10,000 worth of inflow or outflow in a given year without  limit.   This is nothing short of widespread, indiscriminate government spying  that lays bare a direct threat to our American way of life. The  Democrats' plan to give the IRS unfettered access to the personal and  private finances of American citizens is a gross abuse of power and  should be deeply concerning to anyone who values privacy and economic  inclusion.   Given the IRS' past reputation, there is little reason to believe in  the agency's capacity to protect this unprecedented access to our  personal financial information from cyberattacks and other security  breaches.   As the concept of a surveillance state becomes more of a reality, we  must oppose Democrats' far-left, socialist policies.                            ____________________
