 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an innovative  effort in my hometown of St. Petersburg, Florida. Known as the 2020  Plan, its goal is simple: to reduce poverty by 30 percent in south St.  Petersburg by 2020. The plan connects all aspects of society to promote  investment, create jobs, and support families, and it is working.   In 2015 alone, the poverty rate in the community dropped by 8.5  percent, compared to 1.6 percent nationally. This effort is truly  inspiring. I salute the leadership of Gypsy Gallardo; the Pinellas  County Urban League and its president Watson Haynes, my brother; the  city of St. Petersburg; and over 100 grassroots community organizations  that are working together to reduce poverty in this historically  underserved community. Thank you and God bless you.                            ____________________
