 Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1. The Republicans call it the  Lower Energy Costs Act. In fact, it does the opposite, and it puts  polluters over people, so we call it the polluters over people act.  That is justified because that is exactly what it does.   This bill is nothing more than a grab bag of Big Oil giveaways and  loopholes that endanger the health, safety, and security of Americans.  It does absolutely nothing to lower energy costs for American families.  In fact, it will actually drive up costs while doubling down on costly  fossil fuels.   Now, does the GOP really believe that Big Oil cares about Americans?   During the COVID crisis in the last 3 years, we had a hearing where  we brought in some of the large oil companies. It was quite clear that  they wanted to keep prices high. It was quite clear that they were  benefiting from OPEC and the fact that Russia had invaded Ukraine and  that oil supplies had become more limited because of that invasion of  Ukraine and that as a result, prices for oil and gasoline were going  up. They didn't care. They liked it.   We actually asked them at the hearing whether or not they would  increase  [[Page H1543]]  production because they have so many leases on Federal lands that they  don't use, and they said no. They said maybe eventually they would do  that, but they haven't gotten around to it yet. I don't think they have  gotten around to it still.   So this notion that somehow by benefiting Big Oil, the major American  so-called oil companies, that this is going to help the American  people, that is not their goal.   Last year, Big Oil's profits in 2022 were $451 billion, a record  high. The dividends they gave out and the stock buyouts amounted to  $163 billion. They only care about the stockholders. They don't care  about the price of gasoline. They want it to stay high. They don't care  whether Americans can afford gasoline.                                time  1230    Chairwoman Rodgers, who I really respect a lot, talked about LNG. One  of the things in the bill is it removes the requirement--and I am going  to talk about other things it does--but it removes the requirement that  liquified natural gas exports be determined to be in the public  interest before being sent overseas.   That is going to lead to more American LNG being sent to our  adversaries, including China. This helps China. This doesn't hurt  China. This helps China. We know that there was a time a few years ago  when LNG exports were limited because of--I forget what caused it--and  during that period of time, the evidence shows the price for American  gasoline or American crude was actually going down.   When you send LNG overseas, it is not available here in the United  States. That actually lowers gas prices when you have more gasoline  available or more refineries available to process gasoline here in the  United States.   I debunk this idea that somehow this bill is going to lower prices  here, that somehow benefiting Big Oil benefits Americans, that somehow  exporting more LNG hurts China. These things simply are not the case.  The evidence proves very much to the contrary.   This bill, H.R. 1, I will call it the polluters over people act,  rescinds several transformational climate programs that the Democrats  enacted as part of the Inflation Reduction Act last year. What I am  trying to get across today is that at the same time that they are  helping Big Oil, not driving down prices, and helping China, the  Republicans are also tearing down all of the environmental laws that we  have had for the last 50 years and putting all the emphasis on fossil  fuels rather than clean energy.   The bottom line is, the only way that we are going to lower costs is  by encouraging clean energy. Yes, I agree with Chairwoman Rodgers that  the United States has to be a bigger energy producer, but the future  for that is with clean energy, not with pumping more oil and gas. It is  by encouraging clean energy because that is where we can be the big  producer. That is where the future is. That is where we can outcompete  the rest of the world.   What does this bill do?   It foolishly repeals the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund,  which invests in high-impact projects that reduce pollution, creates  good-paying clean energy jobs, and improves public health. They  obviously do not want to do anything for clean energy.   It also repeals the methane emissions reduction program, which  protects the health of our communities and ensures that polluters, not  taxpayers or customers, pay for wasted methane. Let me use that as an  example. I want everyone to understand that when we passed the  Inflation Reduction Act and we were trying to cut back on greenhouse  gases which lead to global climate problems and the increase in global  warming, we worked hard to deal with those industries here that could  be affected. The Methane Emissions Reduction Act is a perfect example  that we worked with the independent oil producers because they said,  well, if you cause the methane that is wasted now and goes into the  atmosphere and causes this increased number of greenhouse gases, if you  work with us, we can accomplish capturing this methane and then it can  be recycled, but we need some money to accomplish that.   We provided them with a fund so they could make that transition. We  also said that if it took them time to get a permit to capture the gas  and provide a recycling program for the methane, that they would not be  penalized by doing that.   This has been characterized by the GOP as some sort of tax or fee on  the industry. It is really a penalty if they don't do what is necessary  to capture methane and avoid it going into the atmosphere. The same is  true for almost every provision that they seek to repeal here.   These are provisions that try to protect the public health, reduce  greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, but at the same time don't have a  negative impact on those industries that are hiring people and that  create jobs. At the same time, try to move toward new clean energy  things like wind, solar, and more hydropower, and other things that  actually do create more jobs, as we have proven that they have.   There are so many other things that repeal--I won't go through all of  them because I know that we have other speakers. The bill also repeals  the popular home electrification rebates that are specifically designed  to lower energy bills for American families. These are popular  incentives that will save families money and are urgently needed to  help us fight the climate crisis.   Republicans are rejecting all these things that help people save  money, help reduce greenhouse gases so they can double-down on the old  pro-polluter policies that they have had for years. This bill also does  nothing to meaningfully address permitting reform.   Its vision of permitting consists of letting polluters do whatever  they want, and instead, the bill becomes a sweetheart deal. The bill,  for example, doesn't include any changes to the transmission policy  necessary to ensure that clean energy can reach all corners of the  country.   Let me also give you a couple of other examples. The biggest thing  that they do to basically endanger all of our environmental protections  is they exempt so-called critical energy resources from the Clean Air  Act and hazardous waste permitting requirements.   They say if we label a refinery or if we label a utility as a  critical energy resource, then they don't have to follow the Clean Air  Act, they don't have to follow the Clean Water Act, and they don't have  to follow the Hazardous Waste Act. It is a roundabout way of saying  that we are just going to let all these industries do whatever they  want, even though it undercuts public health protections.   They do the same thing with toxic chemicals. We had a major toxic  chemical bill to try to cut back on toxic chemicals that needlessly  expose families and children to health risks. They basically get rid of  that by saying, oh, those facilities don't have to worry about  releasing toxic chemicals.   Mr. Chair, I end by saying this. Democrats understand that the  transition to clean energy is important. In fact, projects already  underway are valued at tens of billions of dollars and have already  created more than 100,000 good-paying jobs.   Our Inflation Reduction Act is estimated to create 9 million new jobs  over the coming decade and reduce energy costs by an average of $1,800  per year.   What we have done in the last few years as Democrats is to try to  move toward clean energy, understanding that you still have to have  fossil fuels and nuclear and other things, but understanding that the  future in terms of the U.S. being a major energy producer is in clean  energy, not in fossil fuels.   To just wreck and put a bulldozer through all our environmental  protections in order to encourage fossil fuels is just a huge mistake.  It is not going to lower energy costs. It is going to make it much more  difficult for us to reduce greenhouse gases and all the negative  impacts of climate change.   There is nothing in here. In my opinion, this bill is also going to  hurt us from a national security point of view because it does actually  help China and help our adversaries rather than making it more  difficult for them to compete with us.

Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Khanna).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, Republicans keep talking about lowering energy costs,  but let's be honest with the American people. Right now, the price of  oil is $50 per barrel less than its high last year. The price of a  gallon of gasoline is $1.57 less than its high last year. The price of  natural gas is 78 percent lower than it was at its high last year.   Of course, we would all like even lower prices, but the bottom line  is, this bill is misnamed. It will not lower energy prices. It would  make natural gas more expensive by making Americans compete with  consumers across the globe. It would make our electricity dirtier and  more expensive. It would enrich the oil and gas companies that price- gouged American consumers last year.   This bill is nothing but a handout to the fossil fuel industry that  would drive prices higher for Americans.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster), who is a member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I keep hearing that Republicans want to lower energy costs with this  bill and how important it is to export natural gas overseas. I want to  take a moment to examine some history here.   Back in 2015, with a Republican-controlled House and a Republican- controlled Senate, Congress passed a bill that repealed the crude  export ban. Since then, crude oil and petroleum product exports to  China have tripled, and the amount of refining capacity on the East  Coast of the United States has decreased by 36 percent.   This is not a coincidence. Lifting the export ban meant that oil  producers saw more profits in sending their oil overseas, including to  China, and little in refining it here at home. That led to 10  refineries closing in the intervening 7 years, destroying jobs.   It tied the price of oil in the U.S. firmly to the price of oil on  global markets, which has been responsible for the gas prices roller  coaster we have seen for the past few years.   Now, what that bill did was enrich a very small number of people who  export oil at the expense of every other American who now has to pay a  little bit more for gasoline.   Republicans, with this bill, want to turn around and do this for the  natural gas industry, too. This bill makes it far too easy to export  LNG abroad--yes, including to China. This would mean the same process  would repeat.   You would pay more for energy. American factories and industries  would pay more for energy. A very small sliver of natural gas  businesses would profit. It is prioritizing the enrichment of the few  over the needs of many Americans.   The sheer gall of calling this the Lower Energy Costs Act, in my  opinion, is insulting. It is insulting to refinery workers who lost  their jobs. It is insulting to the frontline communities next to fossil  fuel plants that suffer from dirtier air. It is insulting to the  hundreds of millions of Americans who would have to pay more to keep  their houses warm each winter.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), Speaker Emeritus of the House.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, today, Republicans have completed the process of trying  to determine what exactly their energy policy will be. It is not about  energy independence. It is not even about an all-of-the-above energy  approach. Instead, it is a return to the glory days for them of oil and  gas running the show.   Today's bill, however, does nothing to chart a course for American  energy policy. Instead, it is a political messaging bill. Industry  admits it.   There was a Politico piece last week detailing how Republican  industry allies feel about the bill. Rapidan Energy Group, which is run  by Bob McNally, who testified at the Committee on Energy and Commerce's  first hearing this year, sent an analysis note to their clients saying  that H.R. 1 is doomed in the Senate. Several anonymous Republican  Members have said the very same things themselves in press interviews.   Let's be clear: Three months into their majority, instead of using  their power to seriously tackle issues in a bipartisan manner--and many  of my colleagues on the Democratic side said today they wanted to work  with Republicans on real energy policy--Republicans have chosen to put  forward a messaging bill that I think is really an insult to every  single American that is not an oil or gas executive.   It is a message bill, and the message is this: They want the energy  your family uses to be dirtier and more expensive. It is a shame.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I am calling this the polluters over people act because it eliminates  the environmental protections that keep families and communities safe  while doing nothing to lower energy costs. Everyday Americans need  relief from high energy costs.   Big Oil is still making record profits, and instead of cracking down  on price gouging, House Republicans are handing giveaways to big oil  and gas company CEOs without delivering any help to working families.   The East Palestine train derailment and other recent catastrophes  have shown just how dangerous putting profits before people can be.   As the climate crisis accelerates, we need real action to support  clean, secure, and affordable American energy.   That is what House Democrats delivered last year with our historic  investments that will help us lead the world in the transition to clean  energy and will truly combat the worsening climate crisis. After all,  extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and more extreme.   Just last week, it was the devastating and deadly tornado that ripped  through Mississippi. These horrifying extreme weather events are  costing families their loved ones, their homes, and their livelihoods.   House Republicans are attacking the very clean energy policies that  hold polluters accountable, reduce costs for American families, and  combat the worsening climate crisis.   House Republicans have the wrong priorities, and we should defeat the  polluters over people act today.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I hope after today we don't hear Republicans  talk about States' rights again. Pipeline and LNG projects require both  Federal and State permits. The spirit of the Clean Water Act clearly  demands that States have a say in the requirements and permits that  projects  [[Page H1585]]  in their State are subject to. This amendment disapproves of the State  of Oregon's decision to deny permits to the Jordan Cove LNG export  project.   Mr. Chair, who are we to disapprove of Oregon's decision?   I don't live in Oregon. The distinguished gentlewoman from Colorado  offering this amendment doesn't live in Oregon. Oregon decided in a  democratic fashion what standards projects had to meet in order to  build in the State. Jordan Cove didn't meet those standards and it  didn't get the permits and it didn't get built. I don't see anything  objectionable there.   If Congress spent floor time debating every State decision that one  Member of the House disagreed with, we would never get anything done. I  just think this is a meaningless sense of Congress resolution. If this  passes and the bill somehow becomes law, it won't bring the project  back. It is really a messaging amendment, being added to, in my  opinion, a messaging bill.   I would also note that my colleague, Congresswoman Val Hoyle,  staunchly opposes this amendment and has a long history of opposing the  Jordan Cove LNG project. Unfortunately, she has come down with COVID  and regrets that she is unable to be on the floor to discuss this  amendment.   Republicans promised when they took the majority that they were going  to be serious legislators dealing with actual issues the country is  facing. I don't see that here.   Mr. Chair, I urge opposition to the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, the gentleman from Texas' amendment would  undermine EPAs critical Underground Injection Control program and  endanger the health of communities around the Nation, in my opinion.   The Underground Injection Control program, or UIC, regulates  injection wells to protect drinking water sources.   Under the Safe Drinking Water Act, EPA implements the program, but  can delegate primary enforcement authority, or primacy, to a State.   To be granted primacy, States must demonstrate to EPA that they,  among other things, have regulations in place that meet various minimum  requirements.   The point of this application and EPA approval process is to ensure  there is a Federal floor to regulations so drinking water is protected  across the country.   This amendment seeks to expedite approvals of primacy applications by  effectively rubber-stamping State UIC programs for class 6 wells, those  used for carbon sequestration, if EPA hasn't acted on the State  application within the review period.   Just like other permit deadline provisions of the polluters over  peoples act, this would be dangerous.   While this amendment targets class 6 wells used for underground  injection of carbon dioxide, the text, as written, would apply to State  program applications or program revisions for all well types, including  hazardous waste injection wells.   UIC programs should be rigorous and protective. We should not gamble  with people's drinking water. Once water is contaminated, we cannot  easily reverse course.   If Republicans care about the implementation of this program, they  would support EPA as it works to ensure robust State programs are in  place before granting primacy.   In fact, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $25 million  toward that goal. So if States want primacy, they should complete the  application process and be held to the Federal standard so Americans  know their water is safe. Circumventing this process will only put  communities in jeopardy.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment and encourage my colleagues to do  the same.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, frankly, I have no idea why this amendment is  being offered. It would force the Department of Energy to ride the  roller coaster that is the oil future's market, without any option to  just pay a simple fixed price for a barrel of oil.   If oil goes up $20 per barrel between when DOE purchases oil for the  Strategic Petroleum Reserve and when it is delivered, well, that is too  bad. We are now paying $20 per barrel more, and we will have to buy  less oil.   This amendment unnecessarily restrains DOE and makes purchasing  petroleum products to refill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve more  expensive. DOE recognized as much when it issued a rulemaking last fall  clarifying that it could purchase oil at a fixed price, as common sense  would dictate.   There is no reason that it should be illegal for the Department of  Energy to sign a contract saying that it will purchase oil for $70 per  barrel. No reason that I can think of. Except, of course, if you are an  oil company that wants the Department of Energy to pay more to refill  the reserve.                                time  1615    However, if you are an average American, then this amendment is a raw  deal. It constrains the Department of Energy's usage of the Strategic  Petroleum Reserve, which is partially responsible for the tremendous  over $1.50 per gallon fall in the cost of gasoline we have seen since  last summer's peak gas prices.   I will note that when the Department of Energy issued its notice of  proposed rulemaking this last summer, industry did not object. In fact,  the Department of Energy only received one comment on the rulemaking  from Employ America, which was unambiguously positive.   That comment stated that the rule change ``is an important step to  reduce the volatility of oil prices over the short and medium term,  improve our Nation's energy security, and a necessary step to ensure  that acquisition procedures more fully align with the Strategic  Petroleum Reserve's governing statute.''   This amendment will put the usage of index pricing on par with the  Department of Energy's duty to acquire petroleum products for the  reserve as cheaply as possible. I don't understand that mission. It  will only serve to diminish the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.   Mr. Chairman, I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  to reject the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, frankly, I could not disagree more with  this amendment. It claims that President Biden's budget would repeal  tax breaks that are ``vital to the oil and natural gas industry of the  United States.''   This is the same Big Oil that last year saw just six companies make a  shocking $200 billion in profit and then spend billions to enrich their  shareholders with stock buybacks and dividends, all while gouging  American drivers at the pump.   So, I hope the gentleman will forgive me if I don't think that Big  Oil needs a tax break.   Mr. Chairman, I am glad the gentleman offered this amendment because  I think it is very illustrative of how Democrats and Republicans are in  different places. Democrats and President Biden are fighting every day  to keep Americans' Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid safe.  Republicans, however, apparently only value the tax breaks that their  Big Oil friends love.   Just yesterday, Speaker McCarthy sent President Biden a letter on the  national debt, but I guess cutting tax breaks for fossil fuels is a  real red line for Republicans. They would rather us default than impact  their special interests.   It is fitting that this amendment is being added to the polluters  over people act.   For all of my colleagues today, it is very simple. If you are on the  side of the polluters, then support this amendment. If you are on the  side of the people, then you must oppose it.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, the Delaware River Basin Commission is  made up of representatives from the States of New York, Pennsylvania,  Delaware, and my home State of New Jersey.   The commission oversees drinking water quality for the Delaware River  Watershed, a vitally important role that impacts millions of people  across four States.   Congress created the commission over 60 years ago and gave it powers  to regulate the Delaware River Watershed.   Crucially, each State's democratically elected leaders signed up to  join the commission, and each State receives a vote on the commission.   Mr. Chairman, 2 years ago, the commission banned fracking in its  watershed, and this wasn't a controversial decision.   In fact, it was unanimous. It was a 4-0 vote to help protect the  public health of the 13 million citizens in the watershed and to  preserve the waters themselves.   Today, Republicans want to retroactively take away the rights of the  citizens of these four States and their elected representatives. They  want to take away the powers that Congress gave the commission just  because they don't like the outcome.   I would suggest this: If you really care about clean rivers and  waters, I urge you to oppose this amendment. If you care about people's  rights to safe drinking water, I urge you to oppose this amendment.   I would like to think that all my colleagues care about these things,  so I urge opposition to the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my  time.                                time  1700     Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   The Governors are the four commissioners. The Governor of  Pennsylvania is the chairman of the commission. They may delegate to  someone to actually go to the meetings, but they are making these  decisions.   I don't understand how my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  think that we should take away the rights of the Governors who are on  these commissions to make the decision that was a 4-0 decision. If they  decide that they want something different in the Delaware watershed  than in their individual States, that is their prerogative, but they  made this decision. They voted 4-0.   Again, I don't see the point, and I think it is really egregious for  us to take away the powers of the Governors, as they are elected by the  people of the four States to make this decision about fracking within  their watershed.   Mr. Chairman, I urge opposition to this amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to claim time in opposition to the  Perry amendment.    Mr. Chairman, a common refrain that I hear from  Republicans is that unilateral action by the United States to reduce  greenhouse gases would harm our economy and wouldn't move the needle on  reducing global emissions. The core of this argument is that if we are  going to address climate change, we need to coordinate an international  response.   Of course, this argument completely falls apart when you take a look  at the actions of the House Republicans. Many cheered as the previous  administration removed the United States from the Paris Agreement.  Exiting the largest international agreement to combat global climate  change not only weakened our diplomatic standing abroad, but it made it  abundantly clear that Republicans don't care about addressing climate  change.   Now, thankfully, President Biden rejoined the Paris Agreement,  putting that embarrassing chapter behind us, but it appears that House  Republicans want to go back to burying their heads in the sand when it  comes to combating climate change, as was made clear by this amendment.   This amendment would repeal section 115 of the Clean Air Act, which  provides EPA with a tool to address air pollution while promoting  international cooperation to combat climate change.   As my Republican colleagues should know by now, air pollution does  not respect boundaries, whether these are State or international.  Section 115 provides the EPA administrator the authority to set limits  on an air pollutant that is harming public health and welfare in  another country as long as the other country grants reciprocal rights  to the United States.   The gentleman's amendment would remove this discretionary authority,  gutting our ability to cooperate with our neighbors. We have agreements  with Canada and with Mexico, and we show leadership with the  international community by working with our neighbors to try to deal  with air pollution.   Climate change is a global problem. We need to work with other  nations like we worked with Canada and Mexico and provide the  leadership to encourage international engagements to tackle this  crisis.   I have to say: I don't believe the Republican majority wants to act  on climate crisis internationally or domestically. Case in point, the  polluters over people act we are dealing with today. It attempts to  repeal popular provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act: The  greenhouse gas reduction fund, the methane emissions reduction program,  and $4.5 billion in home electrification rebates.   Now, House Democrats took historic action to combat the climate  crisis by passing the Inflation Reduction Act, which included  unparalleled investments in climate and clean energy.   Not a single House Republican voted for it, but if we can't act  domestically and we can't act in coordination with our neighbors, even  Canada and Mexico, what are we going to do to address the threat caused  by the climate crisis?   According to this amendment, the answer is apparently nothing. We are  not going to do anything domestically. We are not going to do anything  with our neighbors. We are not going to do anything internationally. We  are going to do nothing. I just think that is unacceptable.   At a time of real crisis, as highlighted by the recent  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Report, we should empower EPA  to combat dangerous climate change and strongly encourage other nations  to do the same. We shouldn't be taking any tools off the table, and  that is what this amendment does. It takes the tool off the table.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I frankly don't understand the purpose of  this amendment.   Last spring, FERC issued an updated policy statement, an interim  guidance, detailing how the Commission should treat new applications  for natural gas pipelines and account for greenhouse gas emissions. The  Commission, a month later, clarified that both documents were drafts  and that it would seek further input and comments on the drafts. That  is it.   These documents are not final rules or orders from the Commission.  They are not law. They are a draft, draft documents that the Commission  has put out to solicit industry and stakeholder feedback, and that is  the way we want the government to work for it to be responsive.   Withdrawing these documents from draft status, which is what I think  the gentleman's amendment would do, would have no impact on any policy  and, instead, I think, would just create further confusion and possibly  release FERC from the duty to consider industry's comments on the  draft.   It may be that the real reason that the Republicans offered this  amendment is that they don't think that FERC should consider greenhouse  gas emissions. They don't think that these emissions should matter when  FERC makes a decision about whether or not to authorize a new natural  gas pipeline.   This doesn't change the law. The law currently requires FERC to  consider the greenhouse gas impacts of a certificate it grants.  Multiple Federal court rulings have held that the agency must think  about these issues based on the statute, and the interim policy  statement was meant to create certainty for industry on how the  Commission would do that.   Instead, Republicans want to send FERC and, frankly, all parts of the  Federal Government back into confusion. If you want to say that FERC  shouldn't consider greenhouse gases--I am not in favor of that--you  should amend the statute to say that.   By simply saying that these draft rules should be withdrawn, that is  going to tell industry, how do you deal with this? How are they going  to know what to do if there are no rules, no policy, no input from them  whatsoever?   I think it would be wrong to change the statute to say that they  shouldn't take greenhouse gas impacts into consideration, but that is  not what this amendment does. This amendment says to just get rid of  these drafts, and then industry would have no input into any of this. I  don't think industry would support that.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, again, FERC is not radical. There is a  statute that says that FERC has to consider greenhouse gas emissions.  They put out a policy statement about how they are going to do that and  asked for the industry to look at it and give their input.   All this amendment does is to say to put that aside. Then how does  the FERC--do they just issue another draft saying here is another way  to look at it?   I just think this is very confusing. I do think FERC should take into  consideration greenhouse gas emissions. They are required to by the  law.   Unless the gentleman is going to change that, it makes no sense to  say that they can't get industry input about how they do that.   Mr. Chairman, I urge opposition to the amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
