The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 811         Resolved, That the Clerk be instructed to inform the       President of the United States that the House of       Representatives has elected Mike Johnson, a Representative       from the State of Lousiana, Speaker of the House of       Representatives.    The resolution was agreed to.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member  Meeks for coming together on this critical, important piece of  legislation, the first piece of legislation under Speaker   Mike  Johnson, to stand with our friend Israel as they are under attack from  Hamas and other terrorist organizations.   Let's not forget what has happened because there are reports that  Iran and other terrorist organizations worked with Hamas for not only  months, but possibly over a year, planning these vicious attacks that  now result in war and death of so many people--not just Israelis,  Americans, hostages, so many injured, and thousands more.   This is horrific. This is an opportunity for people all around the  world to stand with Israel's right to defend themselves. As we look at  the casualties, the devastation, and the barbaric nature of the attacks  coming from Hamas and Gaza, we must recognize that the funding that  goes to these terrorist organizations can be stopped with stronger  action from this Congress.   I know we are going to be coming together again to address some of  those issues. We need to stand up against Iran's ability to sell oil on  the world markets because they use those billions of dollars in funds  to also augment and fund terrorism to groups like Hamas. Everybody  knows it happens, it has been going on for years and years and it must  stop. We must stand up against it.   We must also freeze the $6 billion that still hasn't been transferred  but that was negotiated as part of a settlement that even Iran has  admitted can be used for whatever purpose they want, including funding  terrorism. We can't stand by and let that happen either.   As we are taking strong action to stand with Israel, our friend in  the Middle East, we must also stand up to the anti-Semitism that we see  here in our country that pops its ugly head during ugly times like  this.   Mr. Speaker, I applaud my colleagues. There are 425 co-sponsors on  this piece of legislation that shows that even in a divided Congress we  can come together when it is time to support our strongest ally in the  region when they are under attack. We strongly stand with Israel.   Mr. Speaker, let's pass this legislation overwhelmingly.
