 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of President  Biden's American Rescue Plan, a critical tool in the race between  vaccines and variants.   My district is home to global leaders in the life sciences who are  helping to win this race. Last week, I visited one of them in Franklin,  Massachusetts.   Cold Chain Technologies is at the cutting edge of materials science,  producing insulated packaging to transport and store vaccines and other  biologics. They package all of Moderna's vaccines on the critical path  of getting shots into arms.   To defeat this pandemic and prevent another, we must enact the  American Rescue Plan and unlock its investment in life sciences  research, development, and manufacturing here in the United States. My  district is an exemplar of the innovation and jobs that are the fruits  of the life sciences.  [[Page H601]]                                ____________________
