 Mr. Speaker, today I proudly recognize and honor a true  public servant, Captain Andrea Kaman, of the United States Army. Soon,  Andrea will transition from her Army Congressional Fellow assignment to  continue service as an Army Human Resources Officer.   In 2016, the people of Ohio's Ninth District were rewarded when  Andrea joined our team as my first Defense Fellow. On behalf of a  grateful Nation, it is my honor to recognize her selfless service and  sacrifice, and that of her family, too, her husband, Drew, and  children, Elle and Jack. I wish her well in her journey with the United  States Army.   And the type of commitment that her life represents is necessary for  our Nation today as much as it ever was.   Today, in my own State of Ohio, the FBI arrested two individuals  suspected of plotting to kill a rabbi and Jewish worshippers in our  region. Let me express to the FBI--which has been getting some  criticism by members of the executive branch--and local Toledo Police  Division Officers, and other law enforcement officials, deepest  gratitude for their professionalism and dedication to duty, to protect  and defend the American people against all enemies, foreign and  domestic.   Today, in Ohio, the FBI's motto of ``Fidelity, Bravery, and  Integrity'' was demonstrated again, backed by the brave blue line of  the Toledo Police Division.   This Member of Congress says: I salute you. Thank you on behalf of  the people of our region and the American people. God bless you.                                time  1915          UNSAFE AND UNHEALTHY SITUATION ALONG SOUTHWEST BORDER    (Mr. POLIQUIN asked and was given permission to address the House for  1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
