 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I came down to the floor to talk about  President Biden's mishandling of Afghanistan.   Today, I want to talk about another situation the administration has  mishandled and perhaps, more accurately, failed to handle; and that is  the crisis at the southern border.   I say ``failed to handle'' because, by and large, the Biden  administration has completely failed to take any meaningful action in  response to this crisis. Sure, they occasionally made half-hearted  stabs at the problem--usually when the media starts noticing things  like thousands of migrants and their children residing in a squalid  refugee camp under a bridge in Del Rio, TX. Mostly, they seem content  to ignore it.   More than 6 months into this crisis, there are no signs the President  plans to travel to the border to get a look at the problem firsthand.  In fact, it is not clear whether President Biden has ever visited the  border at any point during his political career.   The President seems to have adopted an ``if I pretend the problem  doesn't exist, it will go away'' attitude. It is kind of like earlier  this year, when Biden administration officials refused to call the  situation a crisis, despite overwhelming evidence border influx has  reached crisis proportions. It is like they believed that if they  didn't use the word, they could somehow avoid the reality.   Unfortunately for the administration, there is no way to avoid the  fact we are facing a border crisis.   Last month, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection encountered  208,887 people attempting to cross our southern border illegally, a  318-percent increase from August of 2020.   Madam President, let me repeat that. In August, Customs and Border  Protection encountered 208,887 people attempting to cross our southern  border, a 318-percent increase from prior August.   For context, that number is bigger than the population of Sioux  Falls, SD, the largest city in my home State--in a single month--in a  single month.   At this point, the situation at the border is beyond a crisis. It is  completely out of control. The situation will soon deteriorate further  with one outlet reporting yesterday that tens of thousands additional  Haitian migrants are set to head to our southern border.   Illegal immigration across the southern border tends to slow down  during the heat of the summer. Not under the Biden administration.  Under the Biden administration, the numbers this summer just got worse.  Encounters along the southern border in July were up 420 percent from  July of 2020--420 percent.   Of course, these numbers only reflect individuals Customs and Border  Protection has been able to apprehend. There are, undoubtedly,  individuals who are successfully evading apprehension and illegally  taking up residence in our country.   Then there are the individuals being detained and released into the  country with orders to appear at an immigration court. This so-called  catch-and-release approach is notorious because the individuals  released into the country often never show up to immigration courts as  directed. In spite of this, the administration is using this strategy  and is apparently employing it to deal with the surge of migrants from  Haiti. Despite having committed to deporting these individuals, the  administration is releasing thousands of Haitian immigrants into the  United States.    The situation at the border is a crisis. It is a security crisis, it  is a logistics crisis, and it is a humanitarian crisis. Attempting to  cross the border illegally is a dangerous enterprise. Migrants face the  risk of death, injury, heat exhaustion, and disease, to say nothing of  the risk of exploitation from smugglers and traffickers, who are  profiting to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars by conveying  people across the border illegally.   By failing to stem the flow of illegal immigration, the President is  perpetuating this humanitarian disaster, and Democrats in Congress are  helping him. My colleagues across the aisle have been trying to add  amnesty for illegal immigrants into the tax-and-spending spree that  they are considering. That is a policy that is pretty much guaranteed  to further encourage individuals to make the dangerous and illegal  journey across our southern border.   Most people are familiar with the expression ``fiddling while Rome  burns.'' It is an expression I am forcibly reminded of when I consider  the actions of my Democratic colleagues and the Biden administration on  the crisis at the border. Our country is, as I have discussed, facing a  massive security and humanitarian crisis at our southern border.   On top of that, we just completed a disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal  that has put our country at greater risk from terrorists, damaged our  standing among our allies, and condemned the Afghan people to Taliban  tyranny.   Meanwhile, on the economic front, we are facing a serious inflation  problem, and it doesn't look like it is going to go away anytime soon.  Americans are seeing their purchasing power shrink as they face higher  prices on everything from groceries to gas. The Democratic response?  Essentially sticking their fingers in their ears and humming or  checking their watches to see if the unpleasantness is over yet.   If you were just going by the Democrats' legislative priorities, you  would be forgiven for thinking that none of these problems I have  discussed even exist. Rather than addressing our border crisis or our  inflation problem, Democrats are, right now, attempting to tee up a  massive--massive--reckless tax-and-spending spree to vastly expand the  reach of government into Americans' lives. Our border is in crisis, our  country is at risk, American families are struggling with inflation,  and the Democrats' top priority is advancing socialism.   Not only does their bill fail to address any of the major challenges  I have outlined, it is pretty much guaranteed to make them worse.  Dumping trillions of additional government dollars into an economy  already struggling with inflation is pretty much guaranteed to send our  already high inflation rate even higher.   As I mentioned, the Democrats are frantically working to circumvent  Senate rules and insert some type of amnesty into their spending bill,  which will only aggravate the crisis at the border. Although, at this  point, I am wondering if Democrats will even be able to pass their tax- and-spending spree. The Democratic Party is in disarray, and the story  changes so often, I think reporters are starting to get whiplash. I  certainly am.   One minute, the Democratic leaders are united; the next minute, the  Senate leader doesn't know what the Speaker is doing. One minute, the  House is going to consider the tax-and-spending spree and the  infrastructure bill together; the next, it is going to consider them  separately. Democratic leaders announce an agreement on a framework for  their tax-and-spending spree; their rank-and-file Members report they  have never seen it. Their spending spree is going to cost $3.5  trillion. No. Wait. It is going to cost zero.   Democratic progressives and Democratic moderates are at each other's  throats. The House Speaker is chewing out centrist Democrats, and  Democrats can't agree on a host of issues from Iron Dome funding, to  prescription drug measures, to infrastructure. The Democratic Party is  unraveling fast, and it is deeply unfortunate that Democrats can't seem  to rise to the challenges of governance.   President Biden's administration was supposedly going to usher in a  new era  [[Page S6807]]  of domestic tranquility and international respect. The professionals,  we were told, were back in charge. Well, instead, it looks like  Democrats and the President are going to leave our country a lot worse  off than they found it, burdened by tax hikes and government spending-- that is, if they can ever manage to agree on a bill--in greater danger  from terrorism, and with a never-ending crisis at our southern border.   If Democrats don't change their focus and get their act together, a  weakened country is likely to be their legacy.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
