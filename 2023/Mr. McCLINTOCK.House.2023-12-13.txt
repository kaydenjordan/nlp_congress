 Mr. Speaker, when the presidents of MIT, Harvard, and  the University of Pennsylvania were invited to denounce open race  hatred on their campuses, they wrapped themselves in the mantle of free  speech.   People have a right to say what they think as long as it doesn't  become threatening conduct, they said. On this narrow point, they are  right, but that does not explain why anti-Semitism is rampant on their  campuses.   It is not a tolerance for outrageous speech that is the problem. It  is a complete intolerance of patriotic speech.   According to the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, the  two most intolerant and oppressive universities in the country are  Harvard and UPenn. MIT ranks 136 out of the 254 universities surveyed.   How is it possible that such depraved and discredited philosophies as  Marxism, totalitarianism, racism, Islamic fascism, and anti-Semitism  now flourish on these college campuses? It is because, for years, the  antidote to these social pathologies--the American founding principles  of freedom, democracy, tolerance, and justice that have always kept  them in check--have been systematically suppressed and removed from  campus discussions.   A generation ago, only the lunatic fringe of our society would deny  or minimize the Holocaust, cheer the slaughter of innocents in their  cribs, or praise the fascist governments that produce such horrors. The  spectacle of university presidents maintaining that genocide was a  contextual matter would have been absurd. Why? Because people of good  will had the freedom to present the other side, and the other side was  always compelling.   The only way to separate truth from lies or wisdom from folly or good  from evil is to place the two side by side and then trust the common  sense and good judgment of the American people to know the difference.   This free exchange of ideas is the beating heart of democracy. It is  the sole purpose for which this Capitol Building was constructed.   We have based our entire form of government on the assumption that  more than half of the people are right more than half of the time, but  it assumes that people have the full and unfettered freedom to express  themselves and to challenge the claims and opinions of each other. In  such an exchange, the good, the moral, the wise, and the right will  ultimately rise to the top.   There are only two ways to resolve disputes among human beings:  reason and force. The American Founders built an empire of reason  enshrined in the First Amendment. Freedom of speech, of the press, of  religion, and of peaceful assembly are the very tools that Americans  have used for two and a half centuries to resolve our differences  civilly and chart a path to a better future.   In this brave new Orwellian woke world that we have entered, speech  in opposition to leftist views is violence; violence in support of  leftist views is speech; racial discrimination is social justice; and  force rather than reason is the legitimate way to resolve our  differences.   They tell us that shouting down opponents, disrupting civil  discussions, rioting in the streets, and threatening or even practicing  violence against opponents is freedom of expression. The ultimate  expression of this rot is the moral confusion that sees the killing of  babies as a legitimate way to resolve grievances.   Polls on campuses tell us that the vast majority of college students  fear even expressing views that conflict with leftist orthodoxy.   We are now learning that the Federal Government itself colluded with  tech companies to deny the American people crucial facts and analysis  over everything from COVID to the Russian collusion hoax to Biden  family influence peddling.   Major newspapers that once thrived on vigorous debate have said they  won't even print opinions contrary to leftist orthodoxy on climate  change.   Free societies do not fear words and thoughts, even those that are  hateful,  [[Page H6864]]  ugly, evil, or obscene, because the same freedom that protects these  darkest impulses of our nature also protects the right of men and women  of good will to confront them, expose them, and reject them.   This is what these university presidents and their many confederates  have taken from our campuses, and this is what the left is taking from  our society. This is what we must restore if we are to resume the  upward path toward peace, prosperity, happiness, and justice that our  freedom ensures and that our First Amendment protects.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, short of declaring war, impeachment is  the most serious act that Congress can take. It must be confined to the  narrow grounds established by the Constitution and never used to settle  political differences.   However, the Democrats would have us simply turn a blind eye to  mounting evidence of a family influence-peddling scheme that implicates  the President. This we cannot do.   We owe it to the country to get to the bottom of these allegations,  and that requires the House to objectively invoke its full  investigatory powers, respect the due process rights of all involved,  and lay all of the facts before the American people.   Last session, the Democrats made a mockery of impeachment, and we  cannot allow them to become our teachers.  [[Page H6884]]  Shrill voices should be kept far from this inquiry lest they undermine  its legitimacy and credibility.   Congress has an obligation to approach serious accusations seriously.  With this vote, we do so.
