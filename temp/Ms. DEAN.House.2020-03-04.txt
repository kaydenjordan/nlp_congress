 Mr. Speaker, our servicemen and -women deserve more than a  thank-you. They deserve our support and our protection.   This week, with unanimous support, we passed H.R. 5003, the Fair Debt  Collection Practices for Servicemembers Act, to stand up for our troops  against abusive debt collection practices.   Many debt collectors have used manipulative practices against our  soldiers, such as threatening to contact a soldier's superior officer,  threatening to reduce rank, and threatening to revoke a security  clearance. If these practices aren't shameful enough, many debt  collectors have resorted to contacting the soldier's family.   Soldiers are already under enough stress keeping us safe. The House  passage of H.R. 5003 sends a clear message that we will protect those  who protect us, and predator debt collection practices are never  acceptable.   I urge the Senate to consider our servicemembers and support H.R.  5003.                            ____________________
