 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  recess from 3:30 p.m. until 5 p.m. to allow for the all-Senator's  briefing.    Now, Mr. President, the slaughter of over 1,300 people  in Israel on October 7 reminds every Jewish person in the world of  darker, more sinister times. It lay bare, sadly, that the ancient  poison of hatred against Jews still persists.   We must be clear that Hamas does not speak for the Palestinian  people. Hamas is a terrorist organization dedicated to Israel's  eradication. Hamas must be defeated. And the violence of Hamas  terrorists has tragically put innocent Palestinians in harm's way.   I was deeply saddened and shocked by the awful news of the explosion  at the Al Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza. The loss of innocent life is a  sickening tragedy. My prayers are with the victims, the families, the  children, and all innocent people who were injured or killed.   Now, while we await the results of a full review to be completed, as  the President indicated and as of this morning--people should look at  this--the released signal intelligence confirms, it appears that  terrorist fighters within Gaza were responsible for the explosion and  deaths, not the Israeli IDF. It is clear that terrorists in Gaza have  no regard for civilian human life.    As I have said, and as the Biden administration has made clear,  civilian life must be protected. And we must help civilians impacted by  the war--Palestinian civilians--who have nothing to do with Hamas. As  the Senate considers a supplemental package to help Israel fight Hamas,  we will include robust humanitarian aid to help civilians and make sure  that the aid goes to those who need it urgently and does not fall into  the wrong hands, such as Hamas's.  [[Page S5056]]    When I joined my Senate colleagues in meeting with the Israeli  Government, we promised to do whatever we could to help Israel defend  herself.   In the coming days, President Biden will send Congress a supplemental  request that will provide Israel the resources they need to defend  themselves and eliminate the threat of Hamas.   The Senate will move this package as soon as we can, without delay,  with strong bipartisan support. Democrats want to act, and I know a lot  of Republicans want to act, and I was very encouraged to hear my friend  the Republican leader, Leader McConnell, express his support too.   At this moment of crisis in Israel and of the chaos in the House of  Representatives, the Senate must step into the breach and stand firmly  together to get emergency military and humanitarian aid to Israel.   In this difficult moment, the Senate must act as a steady, bipartisan  force. We must show that the work of the first branch of government is  continuing.   We will not wait for the House--we cannot--because the need for this  package is too urgent to sit and wait for them to get themselves out of  their own morass. I hope the Senate passing a strong bipartisan package  will importune the House to follow suit in whichever way they see fit.   Passing this supplemental and providing Israel the tools they need  will show Israel and the world that the United States stands with our  ally, now and always.   And I expect very soon--as early as today, maybe tomorrow morning-- the Senate will act to pass a resolution from Senator Cardin, Ranking  Member Risch, Leader McConnell, and myself, affirming that the Senate  stands firmly with Israel and firmly against Hamas. Our resolution has  overwhelming--nearly unanimous--bipartisan support in the Senate. It is  cosponsored by 99 Senators, Senator Paul being the outstanding one who  hasn't.   Passing a supplemental and passing this resolution will affirm an  unchanging truth: So long as there is a United States of America and so  long as there is a United Sates Senate, the people of Israel will not-- will not--be alone.   Mr. President, now on the all-Senators classified briefing, later  this afternoon, we will have an all-Senators classified briefing on  Israel and Gaza. We will be briefed by the top people in the  administration: Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, Secretary of State  Tony Blinken, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. C.Q. Brown, and  Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines.   I encourage all my colleagues on both sides to attend today's  briefing from our top leaders so we can stay fully updated on the  latest information on the ground regarding Israel's security and their  efforts to defeat the evil, terrorist, horrible organization named  ``Hamas.''                                 Nominations    Mr. President, on nominations, now, with all the conflagration in the  Middle East, it is really important that we have Ambassadors in  critical places. It is always important, but a lot of them have been  blocked. But now, with the conflagration in the Middle East, it is more  important than ever that they be there. When we were in Israel, the  lack of an ambassador was apparent. Now, there is a great Charge  d'Affaires person; she did a great job. But we still need an  ambassador.   So, Mr. President, for that reason, I want to thank my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle for working quickly this week on getting  critical nominees through the Senate. Last night, we confirmed Ana  Escrogima to serve as Ambassador to Oman, and earlier this week, we  confirmed Karen Sasahara as Ambassador to Kuwait.   We have more nominees whom we need to pass to fill ambassadorships in  the Middle East. More important than ever, we must do more. It is  important that the Senate show bipartisan unity right now to get these  critical diplomats confirmed. And I hope we keep doing so, like we did  with these two Ambassadors, in the days ahead.                U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Election    Mr. President, now, on what is going on across the way in the House,  thanks to MAGA Republicans, the U.S. House of Representatives has now  been without a Speaker for 2 weeks, a paralysis in governing  unprecedented--unprecedented--in modern times.   Hard-right extremists in the House have ground the people's House to  a halt at the worst possible moment: at a time when our ally Israel  faces its darkest hour and the U.S. Government would shut down in less  than a month if we don't act.   Today, the House will gavel in to try and break the impasse, though  it seems like the chaos of the hard right has exposed the deep, perhaps  irreparable, divisions within the House GOP.   No matter who becomes Speaker, one lesson remains true: Whether it is  funding the government, avoiding default, or helping American families,  bipartisanship will be the only way things get done in a divided  government.   Bipartisanship is the only way. When there is a Democratic President,  a Democratic Senate, and a Republican House, a small band of rightwing,  MAGA Republicans in the House cannot say: It is my way, not your way.   You are a minority, MAGA Republicans. You are a minority in the  Republican Party. You are a minority with the people of America. You  are a minority in this government. Certainly, your voices will be  raised, and you will want some say, but it can't be your way or no way.   Bipartisanship will be required to help Israel. It will be required  to avoid a government shutdown. It will be required to finish the  appropriations process. Bipartisanship will be required for just about  everything--everything--that happens in the Congress.   So whoever the House elects as Speaker will not be able to ignore the  realities of divided government, no matter what the hard right demands.  As former Speakers Boehner, Ryan, and McCarthy have learned, you cannot  let the hard right run the caucus or you won't last as Speaker. And,  even worse, it will lead to more chaos at a time when the American  people need unity and help and stability.                           Artificial Intelligence    Mr. President, on the AI Insight Forum, next Tuesday, the Senate will  hold our second in a series of bipartisan--let me underscore  ``bipartisan''--AI Insight Forums, focusing on our North Star for AI  innovation.   Our inaugural AI forum last month was one of the most historic and  informative discussions ever held in the Congress. The debate was  illuminating, and the discussions were candid, unvarnished, and direct.   Next week, we will turn to AI innovation, both transformational  innovation--the kind of innovation that creates new vistas, unlocks new  cures, improves education, protects our food supply and our national  security--but also to sustainable innovation, which is the kind of  guardrails that are needed to prevent the negatives in AI, necessary to  prevent against AI's risks and minimize the chance that this technology  becomes unmanageable or worse. We are going to focus on both of these  types of innovation, both of which are needed.   Congress has taken leaps forward in the past few months, learning  more about the benefits and risks of AI from the world's leading  experts, getting some of the companies that do AI to sit down with some  of the critics, so we can begin to fashion the kinds of guardrails that  are necessary. Our committees continue to lead the way, having hosted  more than 15 hearings on AI this year, and the bipartisan AI gang is  working to supplement the committees' critical work with our AI Insight  Forums. But there is still so much more to learn and do on AI, which is  rapidly changing as we speak. So these forums are designed to ensure  the Senate is asking the right questions, having the right debates, and  getting to the heart of this complex issue.   I urge everyone to attend next week's bipartisan forum, and I thank  my colleagues Senator Rounds, Senator Heinrich, and Senator Young for  helping organize this discussion.   To repeat, our AI forum will be--I am trying to get the date here--I  don't have it. We will get everybody the date right away. I believe it  is on the 24th of next week, at 3 p.m., in the Kennedy Caucus room.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we start the  vote now, 1 minute early.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    I announce that the Senator from California (Ms. Butler)  and the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin) are necessarily absent.    Madam President, in two criminal cases pending in  Federal district court in the District of Columbia and arising out of  the events of  [[Page S5083]]  January 6, 2021, the prosecution has requested testimony from a Senate  witness.   In these cases, brought against Ryan Samsel and John Earle Sullivan,  respectively, trials are expected to commence in late October, and the  prosecution has requested testimony from Daniel Schwager, formerly  counsel to the Secretary of the Senate, concerning his knowledge and  observations of the process and constitutional and legal bases for  Congress's counting of the electoral college votes. Senate Secretary  Berry would like to cooperate with these requests by providing relevant  testimony in these trials from Mr. Schwager.   In keeping with the rules and practices of the Senate, these  resolutions would authorize the production of relevant testimony from  Mr. Schwager, with representation by the Senate legal counsel.
