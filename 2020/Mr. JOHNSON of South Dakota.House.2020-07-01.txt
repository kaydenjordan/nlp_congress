 Mr. Speaker, during this COVID-19  pandemic, ag producers and consumers across the country have suffered  as we have seen the cracks in our food supply system.   Now, small State-inspected processors, meat processors, did what they  could to step up and close the gap, fill the gap, but their efforts  were hindered by the fact that Federal laws don't allow for State- inspected facilities to ship meat across State lines.   I would observe that this pandemic is only accelerating the American  desire to know where their food comes from and their desire to purchase  directly from producers. So that is why, this week, along with Speaker  Pro Tem Henry Cuellar, I introduced the DIRECT Act.   This bill allows these State-inspected meat facilities to sell their  meat across State lines through e-commerce. That is really going to  unlock an incredible amount of potential as small producers and  processors will have the option to put that product into the hands of  consumers.   I think it is important to remember that many States like South  Dakota have State-inspection standards that are at least equal to what  the Federal Government already requires, so this isn't a food safety  issue.   This bill would cut through the red tape. It would allow more  flexibility. It would allow more opportunity for producers, for  processors, and for consumers.   Now, the DIRECT Act is a market-based approach allowing producers and  retailers, under State inspection, to establish those connections with  customers in different States through e-commerce. That is going to  empower consumers to buy--if they want a particular branded product,  they are going to be able to get that product. They will be given more  freedom to choose. At the same time, we as a country won't have any  reduction in our confidence that our food supply system is safe.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, on July 3, 1776, John Adams  expressed his belief that the signing of the Declaration of  Independence should be commemorated ``with pomp and parade, with shows,  games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires, and illuminations from one end of  this continent to the other, from this time forward forever more.''   Well, I actually think we are going to check most of those boxes this  July 3 in South Dakota in the beautiful Black Hills, as President Trump  is there to watch fireworks over the incredible Mount Rushmore.   Now, I know there is a lot of political unrest in this country. On  any given day, there is plenty of political unrest in this Chamber. But  July Fourth should be a time for us to come together and celebrate what  binds us together: life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, with that in mind, and to  honor a day that unites us as Americans, I ask unanimous consent that  the  [[Page H2992]]  Committee on Oversight and Reform be discharged from further  consideration of H. Res. 1036, and I, furthermore, ask for its  immediate consideration by the House.    Mr. Speaker, I understand the Speaker's  ruling, but nevertheless, I wish the United States of America a very  happy birthday.                            ____________________
