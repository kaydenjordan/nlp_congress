 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for yielding.   I rise today in support of this en bloc, which includes my amendment  to prohibit funds from being used to implement, administer, and enforce  a recent rule forcing DNA collection from immigrant detainees. The  rollout of this policy started in January when CBP and ICE began  collecting DNA samples from people as young as 14 years old at the  Border Patrol sector in Detroit, Michigan.   Is this how we are going to do this? We are going to just stop and  not try to fix our immigration system, and this is what we are going to  do to people, which is violate their human rights?   We must stop this administration from forcing collection of DNA,  actual parts of people's bodies, from families and individuals. We must  push back, because this would indefinitely store DNA information,  creating a permanent law enforcement record for folks who may have  never even been accused or convicted of a crime.   So, Mr. Speaker, we must stand up against xenophobic criminalization  of our immigrant neighbors.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Serrano and Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez  for working with me on this measure, and I urge support for this  amendment.                                time  1230
