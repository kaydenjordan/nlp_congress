 Madam Speaker, I strongly support this legislation to  eliminate the cap on the State and Local Tax (or SALT) deduction. Two  years ago, Republicans capped the SALT deduction to force districts  represented by Democratic Members to pay for the bulk of their Tax  Scam. That cap raised over $662 billion in revenue for Republican tax  priorities, nearly all of it from Democratic states like New York. New  York State already pays $48 billion more to the Federal government than  it gets back, and the loss of the SALT deduction was responsible for a  $2.3 billion revenue hole in New York last year putting critical  services at risk.   Some of my colleagues claim that the SALT deduction will just benefit  the wealthy. Wrong. In 2016, 1.2 million New Yorkers used the SALT  deduction, and more than half of those taxpayers earned less than  $100,000 per year. We are not talking about a loophole used by the  richest Americans--many of which, I will point out, were preserved in  the Republican Tax Scam. We are talking about the largest deduction for  the teachers, office workers, and first responders who make up the  middle class in my district.   We must remove this cap and stop punishing the hard-working people of  New York simply because of where they live. I urge my colleagues to  vote yes on this bill.
