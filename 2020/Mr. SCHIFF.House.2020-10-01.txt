 Madam Speaker, Martin Luther King, Jr. once said: ``Of  all the forms of inequality, injustice in health is the most shocking  and the most inhuman because it often results in physical death.''   As our Nation confronts the crisis of coronavirus, we must also  confront the crisis of systemic racism in our society. Nowhere is the  fight for racial justice more urgent than in the field of health.   The legislation I introduced this week would create a clear and  forcible standard for equal healthcare, treating it as a civil rights  issue, as it is, and provide strong tools to identify inequitable care  and correct it wherever it is found.   I acknowledge and thank Dwayne Hall, whose own family experience with  bias in healthcare was a driving force behind this legislation and  without whose leadership this bill would not have been possible.   Every American deserves quality care and every American deserves  equal care. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this bill  to make health equity a reality in this country.                            ____________________
