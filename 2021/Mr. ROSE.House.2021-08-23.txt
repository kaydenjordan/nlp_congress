 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember a great Tennessean.  A devoted wife and mother, Bible school teacher, and a true Volunteer  in every sense of the word, Brenda Lannom was a blessing to her family,  her friends, her community, her church, and her country.   As I remember Mrs. Lannom, I recognize that she represents many great  women, past and present, across America who choose every day to put the  needs of their family ahead of their own. Women like Mrs. Lannom never  hesitate to lend a helping hand or a listening ear. They are always  there when a child needs to be scooped up and held close, like only a  mother can do. They are the best friend and trusted partner of their  spouse, even through life's toughest challenges. And women like Mrs.  Lannom spend a lifetime giving warm hugs and sharing sweet smiles that  instantly provide assurance to those who need it most.   America thrives because of women such as this. My district, my State,  and this Nation need women like Brenda Lannom. The loss of such a  special person brings great sadness, but we can be comforted knowing  that she has surely gone home to be with her Lord and Savior, and what  a fitting reward for such a faithful and lovely soul.                            ____________________
