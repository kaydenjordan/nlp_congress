 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 1531 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1531         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R.       2617) to amend section 1115 of title 31, United States Code,       to amend the description of how performance goals are       achieved, and for other purposes, with the Senate amendment       to the House amendment to the Senate amendment thereto, and       to consider in the House, without intervention of any point       of order, a motion offered by the chair of the Committee on       Appropriations or her designee that the House  [[Page H10064]]       concur in the Senate amendment to the House amendment to the       Senate amendment. The Senate amendment and the motion shall       be considered as read. The motion shall be debatable for one       hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Appropriations or their       respective designees. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the motion to its adoption without       intervening motion.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution, the House shall       be considered to have taken from the Speaker's table the bill       (H.R. 4373) making appropriations for the Department of       State, foreign operations, and related programs for the       fiscal year ending September 30, 2022, and for other       purposes, with the Senate amendment thereto, and to have       concurred in the Senate amendment.        Sec. 3.  Senate Concurrent Resolution 51 is hereby adopted.        Sec. 4.  House Resolution 366 is hereby adopted.        Sec. 5.  Upon adoption of this resolution, the House shall       be considered to have taken from the Speaker's table the bill       (H.R. 1082) to prohibit the unauthorized sale of ride-hailing       signage and study the incidence of fatal and non-fatal       assaults in TNC and for-hire vehicles in order to enhance       safety and save lives, with the Senate amendments thereto,       and to have concurred in the Senate amendments.        Sec. 6.  House Resolution 1382 is hereby adopted.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Reschenthaler), pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Rules Committee met and reported a rule, House  Resolution 1531, providing for consideration of a motion, if offered,  by the chair of the Committee on Appropriations that the House concur  in the Senate amendment to the House amendment to the Senate amendment  to H.R. 2617. The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  Appropriations.   The rule further deems as passed the following: S. Con. Res. 51, H.  Res. 366, H. Res. 1382, and motions to concur in the Senate amendments  to H.R. 1082 and the Senate amendment to H.R. 4373.   Mr. Speaker, we are here today to debate a rule that would bring a  Consolidated Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2023 to the floor.   I give my wholehearted thanks to all of our appropriators, especially  Chairwoman DeLauro, and their staff for the work that went into  crafting such a strong, bicameral, bipartisan funding bill.   This package offers tremendous investments in American families and  workers while strengthening democracy at home and abroad.   This spending agreement ensures permanent, mandatory, and continuous  coverage for the 40 million children enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP. It  provides record Medicaid funding for Puerto Rico, and permanent  enhanced Medicaid funding for all other territories, as well as the  PREVENT Pandemics Act, which uses lessons from COVID-19 to improve our  preparedness for future public health emergencies.   For the first time in more than a decade, we have provided more  funding for the National Labor Relations Board, which helps defend  workers' right to organize.   There is also emergency disaster support to help victims of  hurricanes and wildfires; to address the water crisis in Jackson,  Mississippi; and $1 billion for Puerto Rico's electrical grid.   Critically, this package includes language to reform the Electoral  Count Act of 1887. This is an imperative measure that will help prevent  any future insurrections designed to disrupt the peaceful transfer of  power like we saw on January 6.   This bill received broad support in the Senate, with the votes of 18  Republican Senators, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and  Senate Appropriations Vice Chair Shelby. Senators can rarely agree on  what to get for lunch, let alone a spending package like this.   I want to be clear here that I am not thrilled about everything in  this package.   Quite frankly, I find the endless increases in defense spending year  after year to be appalling. We constantly hear from the other side that  we don't have enough money to invest in the American people, yet there  always seems to be enough to invest in the next weapons system that the  Pentagon doesn't even want or need. We have to control this  unbelievable defense spending habit that we have here in Congress, and  I hope we will do that in the coming months.   I am also thrilled that this bill includes a bipartisan agreement to  permanently extend food benefit increases for parents with children.  This will provide an extra $40 per child per month for struggling  parents to feed their kids over the summer when hunger is often the  worst. While I support that, I don't love the way we pay for it, by  robbing Peter to pay Paul, and taking from our pandemic EBT benefits. I  find that to be obnoxious, quite frankly. As we approach the farm bill,  we all need to be focused on making sure that we restore any damage  that might be done by this offset.   But, again, the give and take of negotiations requires compromise.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to a constructive debate here on the  House floor, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1045     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I am a little bit surprised that my friends are complaining about the  process. Senator Shelby, a Republican over in the Senate, said I was  surprised that they, meaning the House Republicans, didn't enter into  negotiations because they are the Republicans in the House, they should  have been at the table, but they chose not to come, which is kind of  typical of what they do on everything is they say ``no'' and do not  want to be part of a constructive solution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Jeffries), the chairman of the Democratic Caucus and future Democratic  leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I love my friends on the other side of the aisle. They complain they  are going to vote ``no,'' and then they are going to go home and do  press conferences announcing all the Members' projects that they got,  but that is what we have come to expect from my Republican friends here  in the House. They don't want to come to the table. They don't want to  be constructive. They are just no, no, no, no on everything. They are  more interested in Twitter followers than they are in actually  legislating. That is their problem, but that is not going to be the  problem today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I remind the Members that the microphones are working.  People don't have to shout.   But, in any event, let me say that it wasn't I who said that  Republicans didn't come to the table. That was Republican Senator  Richard Shelby. I mentioned that earlier.   Mr. Speaker, there are people who come to the floor and yell and  scream about the process, and, yet, what is their plan?   Their plan is vengeance.   I would take a moment to thank the 18 Republican Senators, including  the senior Senator from Texas, Senator Cornyn, who voted for this bill.  I don't think the senior Senator from Texas voted for the omnibus  because he thought it was bad for Texas or that it would destroy the  country. Quite the contrary. I thank him for his vote.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the names of the Senators-- Republican Senators--who voted for the omnibus in the Record.                 List of R Senators That Voted YES on Omni         1. Blunt (R-MO)        2. Boozman (R-AR)        3. Capito (R-WV)        4. Collins (R-ME)        5. Cornyn (R-TX)        6. Cotton (R-AR)        7. Graham (R-SC)        8. Inhofe (R-OK)        9. McConnell (R-KY)        10. Moran (R-KS)        11. Murkowski (R-AK)        12. Portman (R-OH)        13. Romney (R-UT)        14. Rounds (R-SD)        15. Shelby (R-AL)        16. Thune (R-SD)        17. Wicker (R-MS)        18. Young (R-IN)     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  [[Page H10067]]    Mr. Speaker, I heard some of my Republican colleagues on the other  side threatening to vote against any legislation in the future  sponsored by Republicans in the Senate sent over to the House because  they don't like their vote. In fact, the leader, Leader McCarthy, said,  ``when I am Speaker, their bills will be dead on arrival in the  House.''   Well, some of the 18 Republican Senators who voted for the bill  yesterday actually had some incredible legislation signed into law; for  example, Senator Cornyn's bill, S. 4834, the PROTECT Our Children Act  of 2022 was signed into law just a couple of days ago. That is  protecting our children.   Would that be dead on arrival now?   Senator Boozman's bill, S. 2102, which expands access to mammograms  for veterans, was passed in June, and it is now law.   Is that not important, providing mammograms to our veterans, and that  would be dead on arrival under this new rule my Republicans are saying  they want to enforce?   Senator Inhofe is the lead sponsor on S. 1790, the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 Act. I just complained about how  big the defense budget is. I don't like the fact that it is so  overblown and bloated, but I know my Republican friends do.   But would they have blocked that bill because Senator Inhofe voted  for the omnibus?   Imagine if veterans or children didn't get the aid they needed  because of petty politics. That is no way to govern, Mr. Speaker.   This legislation that some of these Republican Senators have brought  forward will not only keep the lights on but provide aid to thousands  of Americans. It is important that the President sign it. It will make  life better for people in this country.   So I get it that this is the time when everybody is yelling and  screaming and trying to score political points, but at the end of the  day, let us reflect what our purpose here is, and that is to get stuff  done and to improve the lives of the American people. If you don't like  the priorities in this bill, then you can vote against it. But 18  Republicans--pretty conservative Republicans--voted for it over in the  Senate. They put people ahead of politics, and I applaud that.   This is not a perfect bill. There are a lot of things in here I don't  like. But rather than yelling and screaming and threatening revenge,  maybe people should sit down and talk and work things out and come to  some sort of a compromise. That is what they did in the Senate. I hope  that some of my friends will learn from that example.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me just say that I am proud of the work that the  Rules Committee has done over the past two sessions. I just want to  contrast where our focus has been and what we have accomplished to the  Party of No.    When we took over, we passed a new rules package that actually had  bipartisan support for the first time in over a decade. We had the  first-ever House Office of Diversity and Inclusion to recruit, train,  develop, promote, and retain a congressional workforce that reflected  the diversity of the American people.   We established a Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress  which has already led to real changes to improve the efficiency and the  effectiveness of our congressional community. We required a Member Day  hearing so that all Members had a chance to be heard across the  Congress.   We implemented a Consensus Calendar to expedite consideration of  ideas with broad, bipartisan support.   We had remote voting by proxy and remote committee proceedings to  keep Congress functioning during a once-in-a-lifetime global pandemic,  over a dozen hearings, roundtables, site visits in at least eight  cities, and numerous interactive discussions on social media exploring  what it will take to finally end hunger in America, which led to the  first White House conference on hunger, nutrition, and health in over  50 years.   We held the first-ever congressional hearing on Medicare for all and  the first-ever congressional hearing on seating a delegate from the  Cherokee Nation.   We passed landmark legislation that President Biden signed into law  that will have a positive impact for generations to come: the American  Rescue Plan, the bipartisan infrastructure law to rebuild America and  reinvest in our communities; the Inflation Reduction Act to lower  prices for consumers and invest in clean energy to address the climate  crisis; the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to reduce gun violence;  the Respect for Marriage Act to guarantee and expand civil rights for  all Americans; the CHIPS and Science Act to turbocharge American  manufacturing, and requiring legislation to have a hearing and a markup  before being considered on the floor.   We set an example to disagree without being disagreeable, even during  polarized times like two Presidential impeachments. One journalist  praised our hearing in the Rules Committee as a master class in what  civility and respectful disagreement should look like in Congress.  [[Page H10068]]    I would just say that none of these accomplishments would have been  possible without the incredible staff on the Rules Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the names of all staff,  Democratic and Republican, who have spent countless hours at the Rules  Committee over the last 4 years working late at night, early in the  morning, and every time in between to help bring legislation to the  floor to improve the lives of the American people.                             Committee on Rules                   Staff in the 116th, and 117th Congresses         Chairman James P. McGovern        Matthew Bonaccorsi        Cindy Buhl        Jennifer Chandler        Kim Corbin        Eric Delaney        Adam Duffy        Jeff Gohringer        Caitlin Hodgkins        Lori Ismail        Rose Laughlin        Ana Martinez        Lale Morrison        Lauren Mueller        Allie Neill        Liz Pardue        Nate Perkins        Allie Polaski        Matthew Price        Samantha Russell        Don Sisson        Jessica Suh        Dan Turton        David Vince         Ranking Republican Tom Cole        Emily Ackerman        Jennifer Belair        Kelly Chambers        Sarah Corley        Matt Diller        Chris Erb        James Fitzella        Hannah Gill        Eric Shepard        Steve Waskiewicz    I also thank the House and Senate clerks who have been  working around the clock trying to get the omnibus text to us as  quickly as possible. Their work has not gone unnoticed.   I think it is important for us to reflect on the hard work of the  people who served all of us in this Congress, and I am proud to have  worked with all of them on both sides of the aisle.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, after listening to that, it is clear he  doesn't have the votes yet.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, for the record, the minority leader came  to the floor and was criticizing community projects, and maybe he  doesn't know this, let me inform him: that over 100 of his Members on  the Republican side requested and received community projects, all of  which I am happy to say were vetted. Maybe he is suggesting that they  should all give them back because I know they are going to vote ``no''  on this bill and go home and do a press release and a press conference,  but he ought to understand that. There is that saying, ``physician,  heal thyself.''   The bottom line is that over 100 Members on that side requested  community projects that were fully vetted--I am not questioning whether  they are good or not--their communities requested them and they have  community support. That is on your side.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1145     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I would tell the gentleman from Louisiana  (Mr. Higgins) that his veterans bill is included in this omnibus  package.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the decision before us today is clear. Either we choose  to do the job the American people elected us to do and vote for a good  bipartisan, bicameral bill, or we shut down the government 2 days  before Christmas as a massive storm wreaks havoc on Americans' holiday  travel plans. It is as simple as that.   Games like the one House Republicans are playing by using this bill  as a political wedge to threaten their  [[Page H10073]]  counterparts in the Senate is equal parts dangerous and destructive.   As Republican Senator Kevin Cramer said: ``The reality is this kind  of chest-thumping and immaturity doesn't instill confidence in their  ability to lead.''   You hear it all the time: Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the  good. I will be one of the first to say that this bill isn't perfect.  It doesn't address everything I wanted, nor does it address everything  in the way I wanted. But it is a good bill.   It was put together through hours of hard-fought negotiations that  involved Members in both Chambers from both sides of the aisle. It is  not anyone's fault but their own that House Republicans chose to walk  away from the negotiating table.   At the end of the day, we are here to legislate, to get stuff done.  We are here to help the American people, and that requires us to keep  the lights on.   The last time Republicans held the majority in the House, they left  us in a prolonged government shutdown that cost our country and  taxpayers over $11 billion. I can promise you that the Democrats have  no plan of letting that happen under our watch.   We must pass this rule and the underlying bill and get it to the  President's desk.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the  previous question on the resolution.   The previous question was ordered.
