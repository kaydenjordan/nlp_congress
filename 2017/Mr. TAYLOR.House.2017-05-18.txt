 Mr. Speaker, I rise to acknowledge the great men and  women of law enforcement. As you know, it is National Law Enforcement  Week, first established by President Kennedy in 1962.   Imagine waking up every morning, rolling out of your bed, rubbing  your eyes, getting dressed for work, kissing a loved one good-bye for  what may be the very last time. You walk out your door not even  thinking about the potential danger that awaits you, not even  questioning who the person is asking for help, and not hesitating to  step in the line of fire should you be required to.   Notice that I said ``you.'' You, a Republican. You, a Democrat.  Black, White, Brown, gay, or straight, for all types don the uniform  every day.   Men and women of law enforcement are a special breed amongst us.  Theirs is a higher calling for service. They are part of the very  fabric of our society. Without them, we would not have order, and our  laws would be worthless.   For those men and women of law enforcement in Virginia's Second  District, and those around the Nation, we thank you. Your willingness  to put the safety of others above your own demands respect,  recognition, and, for some, remembrance.  [[Page H4345]]                                ____________________
