 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Virginia for  yielding to me.   You haven't heard any discussion of abuse of official time because  there is no record of abuse of official time. My colleagues on the  other side simply want to get rid of official time, as they have wanted  to do for decades.   A little background: Federal employees have no right to strike, as  they do in the private sector. In return, though, the time-honored  right to organize and represent employees in their official capacity on  matters relating to the workplace has always been in place under  Republicans and Democrats alike.   Remember, there is also no requirement to join a union in the first  place; yet unions must represent all workers, regardless of their  membership or not.   The bill on the House floor, H.R. 1293, is unnecessary. Official time  reports are already required. This is a redundant bill.   If my friend is worried that these reports haven't been timely, as he  implied then he can do that administratively or do it in this bill. The  reason he doesn't do it in this bill is this bill is a cover. It is a  cover for two pending bills which are already out of committee. I  expect them on the floor any minute now, although, notice the sequence.                                time  1415    Mr. Speaker, this seemingly vanilla bill, is going to be followed by  the real bills that my colleagues are after. They are parallel bills.  They essentially eliminate official time to represent workers.   Now, why is official time important? They are important for the  operation of the Federal Government itself. And why is that? Because  there are always going to be disputes and contention between management  and labor. Official takes away time that would otherwise be wasted and  allows the parties to go to the table and work matters out.    Mr. Speaker, these two bills are a frontal attack on  official time, but they actually stab federal employees in the back.  One bill would make it virtually impossible for union members to  volunteer their time unless they wanted to give up parts of their  retirement benefits.   What kind of quid pro quo is that? What do you want to do next?  Reduce pay if a union rep uses official time?   The next bill designates employees who cannot represent other  employees. This bill looks like something you would expect from  countries where there is no right to organize.   This bill reduces the amount of dues unions can collect, even though  they are collecting dues on their own time and not official time. This  is a brazen attempt to eliminate the fair-share fee, non-union workers  pay for being represented equally with union members, and allow free  riders to be served free of charge. This is the beginning of an out- and-out assault on the freedom of workers to organize.
