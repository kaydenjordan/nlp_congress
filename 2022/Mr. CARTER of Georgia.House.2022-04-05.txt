Founded in 1922 by James Ernest Stewart in Waycross, Georgia, the  Stewart Candy Company has grown into a multimillion-dollar candy  business that distributes their products nationwide.   From its humble beginnings, when Ernest would package his candies in  cigar boxes and deliver them in his Model T, to a massive company that  sells candies with the click of a button, 100 years is truly worth  celebrating.   After Ernest's son, James, graduated from the University of Georgia  and served 3 years in the United States Army, he came home to work at  the family business.   James, better known as Papa, molded and fashioned Stewart Candies  into a modernized business production fit for the next generation of  the Stewart family. Four of Papa's six children came to work for the  company and organized the Stewart Distribution company, a new division  of the candy company.   Jump to today, and Stewart Candy Company is still making their pure  sugar soft peppermints in many different flavors, such as banana  pudding, key lime, and cinnamon.   The company has gone from just 3 employees to 240 employees and works  every day to spread the joy of their candies to every American.                            ____________________
