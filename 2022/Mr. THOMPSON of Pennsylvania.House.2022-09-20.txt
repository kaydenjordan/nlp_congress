 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Celebrate Community Week.   Last week, Congressman   Jimmy Panetta from California and I  introduced a resolution to designate the week of September 11 through  September 17 as Celebrate Community Week and commemorate the efforts of  local service organizations across the country.   Mr. Panetta and I are co-chairs of the bipartisan Congressional  Service Organization Caucus. The resolution recognizes the role of  service organizations in promoting community humanitarian assistance  while also instilling the value of giving back in our youth. We  specifically applauded the Kiwanis International, Lions Clubs  International, Optimist International, and Rotary International for  encouraging and promoting community service and humanitarian assistance  through their local chapters.   The Celebrate Community Week resolution highlights the critical work  of our community service organizations. Volunteer service is the  cornerstone of a successful, strong, and healthy community, and is an  important staple of American life.   I commend our community service organizations like the Lions Club  International, Rotary International, Kiwanis International, and  Optimist International for everything they do to help our communities  flourish.                         Celebrating Constitution Day     Mr. Speaker, I rise today because over  the weekend, we celebrated Constitution Day. On September 17, we  commemorate the signing and adoption of the U.S. Constitution in 1787  in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.   This day, where we celebrate our Constitution, originated in 1953  when the Senate passed a resolution designating September 17 to 23 as  Constitution Week.   In 2004, Congress officially made Constitution Day and Citizenship  Day a Federal holiday. Congress also required all publicly funded  agencies and schools to provide information on the Constitution on this  day.   In 2017, President Trump proclaimed September 17 as Constitution Day  and Citizenship Day. Constitution Day serves as a celebration of our  American system as well as a reminder that our government exists to  serve the people and their freedom.   For 235 years, Congress has been given the responsibility by the  people to represent their interests. We should behave like every day is  Constitution Day and remember Congress should always serve the people  as outlined in the preamble.                           POW/MIA Recognition Day     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  September 16 as POW/MIA Recognition Day.   Last Friday, we remembered the men and women our Armed Forces who  served honorably and have not returned home.   At this time, almost 82,000 servicemen and -women have not returned  home from the battlefield. This includes those who served in World War  II, the Korean war, the Vietnam war, the Cold War, and both wars in  Iraq.   Those who serve in uniform have sacrificed greatly to give us the  opportunity to live our lives in freedom and in peace. We thank those  who served and returned home, but most importantly we remember those  who served and never returned.  [[Page H7977]]    Last May, I introduced the Prisoners of War and Missing in Action  Trade Agreement Resolution. This resolution would urge our mutually  beneficial trade agreements to include a commitment from our trade  partners to continue to search for and recover our missing  servicemembers.   Mr. Speaker, on this POW/MIA Recognition Day, I urge my colleagues to  support this resolution and honor our commitment to bring our  servicemen and -women home.                           Remembering September 11     Mr. Speaker, Sunday marked the 21st  anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks. I rise today to  remember the innocent lives we lost.   At 8:46 a.m., American Airlines Flight 11 flew into Tower 1 of the  World Trade Center. Not long after, Flight 175 roared over Lower  Manhattan into Tower 2.   While Americans around the country were grappling with the events  that just transpired, a third plane, Flight 77, crashed into the  Pentagon.   In southwest Pennsylvania, the fourth flight, United 93, was hijacked  and made the abrupt turn toward Washington, D.C. But because of the  brave passengers and crew members, it crashed into a field in  Shanksville, Pennsylvania.   In the days, weeks, months, and now more than two decades that  followed September 11, our country joined together to face the very  evil which attempted to take us down.   We will forever be indebted to our servicemen and -women who joined  the fight to protect our freedoms.   While today's world has grown no less dangerous, we, as Americans,  are resilient. We will never forget, not 21 years later, not ever.   May God continue to watch over our first responders, our men and  women in uniform, and all those who keep us safe.                            ____________________
